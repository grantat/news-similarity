(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) </div> </div> <p><em>With Breanne Deppisch</em></p> <p><strong>THE BIG IDEA: Barack Obama has deluded himself with the misguided hope that Donald Trump will not even try to follow through on many of his biggest campaign promises. </strong>He is consoling himself with the hope that, if he does, the new president will be measured, self-restrained and respectful of custom. That he will “study … deeply” and “look at the facts.” That logic and reason, not emotion or ideology, will drive him above all else.</p> <p><strong>The lame-duck president has convinced himself that Republicans probably won’t go through with repealing Obamacare when they realize just how hard it will be. Ditto with the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.</strong> “Reality has a way of asserting itself,” Obama reasoned. “I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately he’s pragmatic in that way.”</p> <p><strong>-- Is Obama really that naïve? Probably not. He is just wallowing in a state of denial and has resorted to wishful thinking as a coping mechanism. It is a natural psychological condition that afflicts most human beings grieving a major loss, at least for a time. Presidents are not immune.</strong></p> <p>For a little over an hour yesterday afternoon, Americans saw a 55-year-old who has not come to grips with just how big a blow Trump’s victory is to his legacy and his party. He rationalized. He downplayed. He justified. He minimized. With all the trappings of the presidency still his, it hasn’t fully sunk in yet. And it might not for 66 more days, when Trump gets sworn in on the West Front of the Capitol —&nbsp;and Obama begins living as a civilian in Kalorama.</p> <p><strong>-- Trying to project reassurance, circumspection and a sense of continuity, Obama came across at times as both nonchalant and almost ambivalent about the results. </strong>He expressed confidence in how hard it is to move the levers of power. “The federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It’s an ocean liner,” he said. But with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-fall-of-the-house-of-obama-is-coming-and-its-his-own-fault/2016/11/14/d0151cac-aa7d-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html">the stroke of a pen</a> Trump could instantly undo much of what Obama has pushed with through executive action during the second term.

(Andrew Harnik/AP) </div> </div> <p><strong>-- Obama is a textbook case of denial right now. </strong>The president allowed himself to hear what he wanted to hear during his 90-minute sit-down with Trump last Thursday. His successor somehow managed to both reassure and flatter him. Perhaps Trump privately told him that he was not serious about many of his priorities and stressed that they are merely opening bids in a negotiation.</p> <p>It is also possible that <strong>the same confirmation bias that&nbsp;caused so many in the mainstream media to tune out all the signals that Trump was on the verge of pulling off the biggest political upset since at least “Dewey defeats Truman” has now apparently convinced Obama that his successor is not actually about to massively roll back many of his proudest achievements</strong>, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

You have more power … so folks will enable you to be more of who you are. It will shine a spotlight on who you are.”</p> <p>Yesterday, he took the opposite view: “<strong>This office has a way of waking you up.</strong> My advice to the president-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that.”</p> <p><strong>“Of course I’ve got concerns,” Obama allowed later, when another journalist asked basically the same question that had already been asked three times. </strong>“There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.”</p> <p>But he pointedly declined to say whether he still believes Trump is unqualified to be president. In fact, when pressed, <strong>Obama praised his “gregarious” successor whom —&nbsp;behind the same podium in the same briefing room —&nbsp;he once called “a carnival barker.”</strong></p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo"> <img class="zoom-in" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558im_/https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/50e7c3a14338835de424932aa61a6a08-908-646-AFP_HZ8RE1962.jpg"> <div class="pb-caption"> Trump checks out Paul Ryan's balcony at the Capitol last week.

When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you’re more likely to look at the facts. That is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris agreement.”</p> <p><strong>“Do I think that the new administration will make <em>some</em> changes? Absolutely,” he continued.</strong> “But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they’re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us.”</p> <p>As Politico’s Edward-Isaac Dovere <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/barack-obama-donald-trump-231376">notes</a>, “This is precisely the kind of argument that Republicans in Congress have felt so patronized by over the last eight years, and one that is completely out of whack with the shake to the system delivered by Trump’s campaign, which racked up few political debts to anyone as he claimed victory.”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo"> <img class="zoom-in" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558im_/https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/33e411db2335f6d19c9dcf10baa555d2-908-616-Obama18b08.jpg"> <div class="pb-caption"> President Obama boards Marine One on the South Lawn last night.

The other half of the country is alarmed that a new age of bigotry and inwardness has seized the country. … This has been Obama’s pattern.

Steve Stivers praised Priebus’ appointment as evidence Trump has “done a good job of an inclusive pick so far.”&nbsp; Pressed on Bannon, Stivers said: “I don’t know a lot about Steve Bannon, so I don’t care to be an expert on him.”</p> <p><strong>-- HOW WILL HE HELP SHAPE A TRUMP WHITE HOUSE?&nbsp;“If Bannon’s past is prologue, he will not care about criticism,”</strong> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/14/steve-bannons-rise-points-to-aggressive-anti-globalist-trump-media-strategy/">Dave Weigel</a> writes. “Under his leadership, Breitbart became an anti-‘globalist’ news site clearly aligned with the European far right. Under the site’s founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, accusations of ‘racism’ were dismissed as ‘cultural Marxism.<strong>’ The attacks lobbed at Bannon, one plumbing [a] 2007 divorce record for evidence of anti-Semitism, resemble the ones that failed to stop Trump’s rise. There is even talk of more Breitbart reporters joining Bannon at the White House, in roles that do not require Senate confirmation.” </strong>“Bannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds,” white nationalist thinker Richard Spencer wrote last night on Twitter. “Bannon is not a ‘chief of staff,’ which requires a ‘golden retriever’ personality. He'll be freed up to chart Trump's macro trajectory.”</p> <p><strong>-- In an interview with the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/stephen-bannon-white-house-trump.html?referer=&amp;mc_cid=63800e6f10&amp;mc_eid=211848afd8">New York Times</a>, Bannon rejected what he called "ethno-nationalist” tendencies of some in the movement, saying he believes his enemies are misstating his views and the views of many Trump supporters: </strong>“These people are patriots,” he said. “They love their country. They just want their country taken care of. ...&nbsp;<strong>It’s not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, aren’t bad guys — racists, anti-Semites.

But it’s worth recalling that any presidency also features a range of more or less banal crises in which the fate of the nation and the world is nonetheless at stake. Can Trump really tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran without completely destablizing the Persian Gulf, for example? I’m not sure, I’m <em>sure</em> that Trump is not sure, and I’m frankly skeptical that Priebus is the right person to figure it out. It’s great that Trump has decided to make the premier digital popularizer of white nationalism the <em>second</em> most important person in his White House rather than the first. But the presidency is still a really big job that Trump has no relevant experience for. More to the point, the country needs people who can help Trump actually run the government.”</p> <p><strong>-- Analysis: Less than a week into Trump’s transition, and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161115231558/http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trumps-great-bait-and-switch">The New Yorker’s John Cassidy</a> argues that he has already pulled a “bait-and-switch” from rhetoric espoused during his populist campaign:</strong> “To sum up, this is the prospect we are facing. A populist but semi-engaged President who is less interested in governing than in soaking up adulation at big rallies. (He might hold more of them even though the campaign is over...). Meanwhile, his cronies and members of the permanent establishment make many of the actual decisions, which will largely benefit the already rich, including the ruling family. Debt mushrooms as El Presidente approves prestige construction projects but not the taxes needed to pay for them. And skilled propagandists, like Bannon, whip up nationalist fervor to keep the masses diverted from what is really going on. We’ve seen this movie before, many times.
