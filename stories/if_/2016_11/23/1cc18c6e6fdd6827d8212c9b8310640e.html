<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="314">ASAN, South Korea — To improve its chances in the boys’ team tennis event at the National Sports Festival here, Mapo High School in Seoul brought in a ringer from Jecheon, two hours southeast of the capital. His name was Lee Duck-hee, and he had first caught the coach’s eye when he was in elementary school.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="650">Mapo High’s players pressed against the fence beside along the dusty hardcourts and chanted in support while Lee, 18, crushed forehand winners past his bespectacled opponent in the final. The 6-1, 6-1 win took little time — no surprise, as Lee is the best teenage player in South Korea, and a professional ranked 143rd in the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="808">“Seeing the level of skill, power and returning is totally different than high school level,” said Jeong Yeong-sok, his doubles partner at the tournament.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="1187">Lee is exceptional among professionals, too. He is deaf, and no deaf player in the sport’s history has reached these heights. In tennis, simply seeing the ball is believed to be insufficient. Hearing the ball, top players say, enables faster reactions — a crucial advantage in a sport where powerful serves and groundstrokes mean that every tiny fraction of a second matters.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a>

That’s maybe one of the first things that tells you rather than actually seeing the ball. Like trying the drop shot, all of a sudden, I hear it not come off the racket.

While most students lived in the dormitory there, seeing their families only on weekends, Park was determined to have more time with her first son, and so she drove him the hour to and from school each day.

<h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="13727">Striving to Be the Best</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="13964">Reaching a No. 1 world ranking is Lee’s goal, but first he aspires to become the best player in South Korean history, which would mean passing the career high of Lee Hyung-taik, who reached No. 36 in 2007 and won one ATP singles title.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="14338">Tennis lags behind sports like baseball and soccer in popularity in Asia, and South Korea does not currently host an ATP event. But with Lee Duck-hee and another talented young player, 104th-ranked Chung Hyeon, 20, the Korean Tennis Association hopes the two will be able to lift the country’s Davis Cup team back into the World Group, from which it was relegated in 2008.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="14535">Under new leadership, the association hopes that newly secured funding will help players like Lee and Chung, as well as develop juniors by paying for travel to warmer climates during winter months.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="408" data-total-count="14943">Lee doesn’t believe that his hearing impairment will hold him back — “It doesn’t really matter,” he said — but he acknowledged that another physical disadvantage might: At 5 feet 9, he is a shrub amid the redwoods of professional men’s tennis. In an era of increasingly physical competition, only one player in the ATP top 50 is as short as Lee, David Ferrer. Only six players are under 6 feet.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="15289">Lee travels with Woo, who serves as a hitting partner and speaks limited English, as the two navigate their first laps on the circuit together. Woo said that although Lee might sometimes feel intimidated by being one of the youngest on tour, he keeps an unrelentingly positive attitude, and is comfortable socially interacting with other players.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="15563">While Lee can compete without much issue on court, save for sometimes not noticing out or let calls, other tour regulations may prove challenging for a deaf player. All players are required to participate in news conferences after each match, if requested by the news media.</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="15979" id="story-continues-13">While he is effusive in nonverbal communications across linguistic boundaries, formal interviews can be burdensome for Lee because he must read an interpreter’s lips, and his own speech is often not readily understood. When Lee was interviewed by a Korean television station after a match at the National Sports Festival, the station used subtitles. There can also be benefits to Lee’s unique situation, however.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="16206">“Of course I do want my player to be treated as a normal player, but we have some opportunities and some advantages from being deaf, business-wise,” Lee Dong-yeop, his agent, said. “Because no one has done this before.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="16653">One of the first boosts came from Hyundai, the Korean car manufacturer, which began sponsoring Lee when he was 13 and recently renewed its support through 2020. In a statement, Hyundai said that it was “astonished and inspired by his relentless spirit to reach the top as a tennis player despite his handicap of being deaf,” and that the company “felt the responsibility to give him support as a responsible company in the Korean society.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="16914">Funding from Hyundai has given Lee a stable financial base which few developing players enjoy. His agent hopes that increased funds, both through prize money and additional sponsorships, might someday allow Lee to travel with a full-time manager and translator.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="52" data-total-count="16966">“Money can solve that kind of problem,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="472" data-total-count="17438">Starting Monday, Lee will compete in a playoff in Zhuhai, China, held for Asian players for a regional wild card into the Australian Open. If he does not win that event, he would have another chance to reach his first Grand Slam main draw by winning three matches in the qualifying rounds in Melbourne. With continued success at the Challenger level, his ranking may steadily climb into the Top 100, which would allow him to enter main draws at Grand Slam events directly.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="17596">Stringer said she believed that there was no reason deaf athletes should be less common in the elite levels of tennis than they are in the general population.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="456" data-total-count="18052">“To reach the top of any sport is limited to a very select group of talented athletes,” she said. “So it’s a percentages thing. The odds are that more people with normal hearing will be in the Top 150 than those with deafness. I bet Lee Duck-hee’s success has to do with his athletic talents, personality, intelligence, work ethic, opportunities, and the support group he has around him; his deafness is less of a factor than those attributes.”</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda">
