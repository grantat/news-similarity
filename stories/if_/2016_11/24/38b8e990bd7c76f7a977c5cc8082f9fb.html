Just 35 percent said he should keep the account open. Despite their concerns over his social media use, though, 59 percent of Americans say they are &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; about the next four years with Mr. Trump as president, compared with 37 percent who are not.</p><p><strong>12:39 p.m. ET&nbsp;</strong>Mitt Romney impressed Donald Trump so much during their meeting at Bedminster over the weekend, that he became a serious contender for secretary of state, said a source close to the Trump transition, who added a little more insight to what the vice president-elect told CBS News over the weekend.</p><p>The meeting between the president-elect and the 2012 GOP nominee was initially scheduled as a courtesy visit, and could have been awkward, given the animosity between the two during the presidential campaign. In March,&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161124072800/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitt-romney-casts-donald-trump-as-unfit-to-be-president/" target="_blank">Romney delivered a speech specifically intended to derail Trump&rsquo;s presidential candidacy</a>, calling him a &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; and a &ldquo;phony.&rdquo; Trump, in turn,&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161124072800/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-mitt-romney-begged-me-for-the-2012-endorsement-election-2016/" target="_blank">labeled Romney a &ldquo;loser&rdquo; and a &ldquo;choke artist.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Yet whatever tension there may have been seems to have dissipated. &ldquo;Trump enjoyed the meeting,&rdquo; the source told CBS News.</p><p>Though Rudy Giuliani has been a leading candidate for secretary of state -- the source said Trump has had his &ldquo;head wrapped around Rudy Giuliani&rdquo; for the position &ndash; Trump has reconsidered since his meeting with Romney.</p><p>Also, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, despite a meeting with Mr. Trump this past weekend, is out of the running for a position as a top adviser or department chief. Christie has been telling supporters he&rsquo;s &ldquo;in it for the long run.&rdquo;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll serve out his term as governor which ends in January 2018, and await what may come from Bridgegate. Christie, according to the source, wanted to be attorney general. His view is that he&rsquo;s been a good soldier for Mr. Trump throughout the campaign, once he ended his own presidential bid, and he&rsquo;ll continue to sit back and be a good soldier in hopes of serving in Trump&rsquo;s administration years from now. Mr. Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father Christie prosecuted, was a driving force behind Christie&rsquo;s ouster from Trump world. <em>-- Arden Farhi</em></p><p><strong>10:08 a.m. ET </strong>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s meeting with the New York Times is back on just hours after he ranted against the news organization on Twitter.
