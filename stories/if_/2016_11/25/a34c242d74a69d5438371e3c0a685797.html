RON, THANKS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; TONIGHT A MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS CALLING FOR ACTION AFTER OUR  NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION AIRED  HERE LAST NIGHT ABOUT ARTIFICIAL TURF ON THE SOCCER FIELDS AND  FOOTBALL FIELDS. THE TURF CHILDREN PLAY ON ALL  ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND THE  CONCERN AS WE SAID COULD THE  MATERIAL THAT&#39;S USED AS A KIND  OF GRANULAR SYNTHETIC DIRT  BETWEEN THE BLADES OF ARTIFICIAL GRASS BE HARMFUL? IN THE 24 HOURS SINCE OUR  REPORT, WE HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF VIEWERS INCLUDING PARENTS AND ATHLETES THEMSELVES SHARING  THEIR STORIES, THEIR CONCERNS. WE GET OUR FOLLOW-UP REPORT  TONIGHT FROM NBC&#39;S STEPHANIE  GOSK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: MEG GAN LOUL  COULDN&#39;T THINK LAST NIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LAST NIGHT I WAS LAYING IN  BED, PROBABLY AROUND 1:00 A.M.,  PROBABLY SHOULD BE SLEEPING,  OBVIOUSLY. AND I WAS READING IT. AND I WAS IN TOTAL SHOCK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE 24-YEAR-OLD WAS A SOCCER GOALIE THROUGH COLLEGE  WHERE SHE SAYS SHE PLAYED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON FIELDS WITH CRUMB RUBBER. THOSE LITTLE BLACK DOTS MADE  FROM SHREDDED CAR AND TRUCK  TIRES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE THEM IN MY EARS. I WOULD HAVE THEM EVERYWHERE. IN MY HAIR. I WOULD EVEN BLOW MY NOSE. AND I WOULD HAVE THEM IN THE  TISSUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: LAST YEAR SHE WAS  DIAGNOSED WITH NON-HODGKIN  LYMPHOMA. TODAY SHE IS IN REMISSION. LOWELL E-MAILED UP FROM UPSTATE  NEW YORK, ONE OF MORE THAN TWO  DOZEN VIEWERS WHO REACHED OUT  WITH STORIES ABOUT ATHLETES WITH CANCER. A MOTHER FROM LOS ANGELES WRITES ABOUT HER DAUGHTER. I WILL NO LONGER LET HER COMPETE ON SYNTHETIC TURF. A FATHER WHOSE SON DIAGNOSED  WITH CANCER WHILE PLAYING  COLLEGE FOOTBALL WRITES, I FEEL  SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT THE  ARTIFICIAL TURF CAN HAVE SO MANY CHEMICALS. WE ALSO HEARD FROM A COACH AT A  CAMP FOR GOAL KEEPERS WHO TOLD  US HE HAS NOT HAD ONE CASE. THERE&#39;S NO RESEARCH DIRECTLY  LINKING CRUMB RUBBER EXPOSURE TO CANCER. AND SOME DOCTORS SAY PROVING A  LINK WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REASON IS THAT THE  BIOLOGY OF CANCER VARIES A LOT  BETWEEN DIMPBLT CANCERS. OUR OWN GENETICS VARY AND BOTH  HAVE A BIG IMPACT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE INDUSTRY ALONG  WITH RESEARCH, STATES AND  LOCALITIES DEFEND THE TURF. AVAILABLE STUDIES GATHERED AND  SPOKE WITH PEDIATRICIANS,  SCIENTISTS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS  WHO SAY MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO  BE DONE. THE EPA DOES TOO, BUT THE AGENCY DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR REQUEST  FOR AN INTERVIEW. IN A PREVIOUS STATEMENT THE  SPOKESPERSON SAID THE USE OF  CRUMB RUBBER REMAINS A STATE AND LOCAL DECISION. IN GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY, THEY  ARE DEBATING THE PROS AND CONS  OF A NEW CRUMB RUBBER FIELD. MICHAEL STEWART IS A FATHER OF  TWO AND PUSHING FOR THE TURF.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE LOOKING AT CURRENTLY  THE RISK VERSUS THE REWARDS. RECREATIONALLY THE REWARDS ARE  GREAT. THERE&#39;S REALLY NO SCIENTIFIC  BASIS FOR LINKING A CAUSE TO  CANCER WITH THESE FIELDS YET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHILE ANOTHER  FATHER OF TWO WANTS NO PART OF  IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE JARGON OF, WELL, IT DOES  RELEASE SOME CHEMICALS BUT NOT  ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE DANGEROUS,  THAT&#39;S NOT A VERY STRONG ANSWER  TO ME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE VOTE IS ON  ELECTION DAY.

IT&#39;S SOMETHING A LOT OF PARENTS  AND ATHLETES ARE GOING TO WANT  TO SEE. IT&#39;S ABOUT ARTIFICIAL TURF ON  THE FOOTBALL FIELDS AND SOCCER  FIELDS THAT SO MANY OF OUR  CHILDREN PLAY ON ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. THE MATERIAL USED AS A GRANULAR  SYNTHETIC DIRT BETWEEN THE  PIECES OF ARTIFICIAL GRASS BE  HARMFUL? IT STARTS WITH A SOCCER COACH  WHO NOTICED SOMETHING ABOUT TWO  OF HER PLAYERS WHO DEVELOPED  CANCER. AND SHE LEARNED OF OTHER YOUNG  ATHLETES WITH SIMILAR STORIES. NBC&#39;S STEPHANIE GOSK HAS BEEN  INVESTIGATING THE STORY FOR  MONTHS AND TONIGHT HAS OUR  EXCLUSIVE REPORT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS SOCCER HAS BEEN AMY GRIFFIN&#39;S  PROFESSION AND PASSION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I LOVE THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF  SPORTS. THERE&#39;S NOT MANY JOBS ARE YOU  FEEL THE ECSTASY OF VICTORY AND  THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THERE WAS ONE  LOW THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON COACH DIDN&#39;T SEE COMING. TWO OF HER GOALKEEPERS DIAGNOSED WITH NONHODGKINS LYMPHOMA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SHE SAYS THAT&#39;S THE FOURTH  GOALKEEPER I&#39;VE HOOKED UP THIS  WEEK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE REMEMBERS A  CONVERSATION WITH HER PLAYER  THAT NOW HAUNTS HER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I HAVE A FEELING IT HAS  SOMETHING TO DO WITH THOSE BLACK DOTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE STUFF EVERYBODY&#39;S TALKING ABOUT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: SOCKER AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS ALIKE ARE VERY FAMILIAR  WITH THEM. THE BLACK DOTS ARE ACTUALLY  SHREDDED CAR AND TRUCK TIRES  USED IN FIELDS TO FILL THE SPACE BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL BLADES OF  GRASS. THEY CONTAIN ALL THE SAME  CHEMICALS FOUND IN MOST TIRES. THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR  CANCER RESEARCH LABELS FOUR  CARCINOGENS. WHILE ADDING THAT AT LOW LEVELS  OF EXPOSURE THERE ARE CONSIDERED SAFE. ON A SOCCER FIELD GOALKEEPERS  MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER ROLL  AROUND ON THE TURF EVERY  PRACTICE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU DON&#39;T EAT TIRES. YET WE WERE. AS GOALIES OR PLAYERS, YOU WOULD GET IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND YOU  WOULDN&#39;T THINK ABOUT IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: JORDAN STARTING  PLAYING GOALIE ON TURF WHEN SHE  WAS 12 YEARS OLD. SOME WEEKS IN HIGH SCHOOL  PRACTICING AS MANY AS 20 HOURS  OF CRUMB RUBBER. AT AGE 21 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NONHODGKINS LYMPHOMA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO  HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FORMER GOALIE  IS ON THE LIST, NAMES THE COACH  CONTINUES TO GATHER OF PLAYERS  WHO DEVELOP DIFFERENT TYPES OF  CANCERS. 38 ALTOGETHER, 34 ARE SOCCER  PLAYERS. ANNIKA, 18 YEARS OLD, EMMA, 15. A LIST IS NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF. THERE&#39;S NO RESEARCH DIRECTLY  LINKING CHROME RUBBER EXPOSURE  TO CANCER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MANY ARE RELATED CANCERS, BUT THERE ARE OTHERS IN THERE TOO. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IN GENERAL  IT&#39;S VERY DIFFICULT TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN  ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND  CANCER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: NO AVAILABLE  STUDIES REPLICATE GOALKEEPERS&#39;  PLAYING CONDITIONS. BUT MANY RESEARCHERS, STATES AND LOCALITIES DEFEND THE TURF  SAFETY. DAVIS LEE HAS A Ph.D. IN  CHEMISTRY AND SITS ON THE  SYNTHETIC TURF COUNCIL BOARD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S CERTAINLY A  PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE TO THIS POINT THAT SAYS IN FACT IT  IS SAFE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: AN NBC NEWS  INVESTIGATION PUT THAT ASSERTION TO THE TEST. GATHERING AVAILABLE STUDIES AND  SPEAKING WITH PEDIATRICIANS,  SCIENTISTS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS  WHO SAY MORE RESEARCH SHOULD BE  DOWN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TURF FIELDS COME WITH A  NUMBER OF REAL RISKS AND A  NUMBER OF REAL BENEFITS. AND EVERY COMMUNITY THAT&#39;S BASED WITH DECIDING WHAT THEY WANT TO  PUT IN HAS TO KIND OF WEIGH IN  THE DIFFERENT RISKS AND BENEFITS FOR THAT SITUATION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: AMONG THE AVAILABLE STUDIES THE SYNTHETIC TURF  COUNCIL POINTS TO IS ONE IN  2009. THE AGENCY ITSELF DESCRIBES THE  CONCLUSIONS AS LIMITED. NBC NEWS REPEATEDLY REQUESTED AN INTERVIEW, BUT AFTER SEVERAL  E-MAILS AND TWO PHONE CALLS, THE EPA REFUSED. IN A STATEMENT A SPOKESPERSON  SAYS THE USE OF CRUMB RUBBER  REMAINS A STATE AND LOCAL  DECISION. AND MORE TESTING NEEDS TO BE  DONE. IF MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE  DONE, WHY ARE WE ALLOWING OUR  CHILDREN TO PLAY ON THIS  SURFACE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SURE. WELL, MORE RESEARCH CAN ALWAYS  BE DONE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT  THE SYNTHETIC TURF IS SAFE. WE&#39;VE GOT 14 STUDIES ON OUR  WEBSITE THAT SAYS WE CAN FIND NO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: PRO-ATHLETES AND  SCHOOL KIDS ALIKE ARE PLAYING ON MORE THAN 5,000 CRUMB RUBBER  FIELDS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THE FIELDS HAVE ALREADY  STIRRED SOME CONTROVERSY. THE NEW YORK CITY PARKS  DEPARTMENT AND THE LOS ANGELES  SCHOOL SYSTEM NO LONGER INSTALL  THE SURFACE CITING MULTIPLE  HEALTH CONCERNS. OTHER CITIES APPLAUD THE FIELDS  BECAUSE THEY SAY THE TURF IS  CHEAPER AND MORE DURABLE THAN  GRASS AND PROVIDES MORE OUTDOOR  SPACE FOR KIDS TO PLAY. BUT GRIFFIN WORRIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE TO SAY  WE&#39;VE DONE SOME TESTS AND WE&#39;VE  COVERED ALL OF OUR BASES. AND, YES, IT&#39;S SAFE. AND THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU WANT TO BE  PROVED WRONG? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE TO BE PROVED  WRONG.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COACH GRIFFIN IS THE FIRST TO SAY SHE IS NOT A SCIENTIST AND  SHE TELLS ME THAT THE AWARENESS  RAISED ON THIS ISSUE WILL  GENERATE THE RESEARCH SHE AND  OTHERS THINK IS NEEDED. NOW, WE HAVE POSTED MUCH MORE  INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE ALONG WITH A DEDICATED E-MAIL ADDRESS","smpte-tt":"http://web.archive.org/web/20161125003214/http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/nn_04_sgo_turf_141008.tt","srt":"http://web.archive.org/web/20161125003214/http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/nn_04_sgo_turf_141008.srt","web-vtt":"http://web.archive.org/web/20161125003214/http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/nn_04_sgo_turf_141008.vtt"}},"sections":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"},{"title":"Health","slug":"health"},{"title":"Nightly News","slug":"nightly-news"}],"topics":[{"title":"U.S. news","slug":"us-news"},{"title":"Kids' Health","slug":"kids-health"},{"title":"Video","slug":"video"}],"externalSource":"WorkBench","taxons":[{"slug":"news","type":"section","title":"News","topics":[{"title":"U.S. news","slug":"us-news","type":"topic"},{"title":"Video","slug":"video","type":"topic"}]},{"slug":"health","type":"section","title":"Health","topics":[{"title":"Kids' Health","slug":"kids-health","type":"topic"}]},{"slug":"nightly-news","type":"section","title":"Nightly News","topics":[]}],"broadcastDate":"Wed, Oct 08","playlistSlug":"nightly-news-investigates"}]};
