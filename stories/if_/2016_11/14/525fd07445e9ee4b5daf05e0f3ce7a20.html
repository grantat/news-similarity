Her grandfather, a doctor in Kentucky, was the descendant of a slave impregnated by her master. “We didn’t come here looking for a melting pot,” she said. “We were tortured and brought here.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="13196">Like Mara Kiesling, 57, who began life as a boy in Harrisburg, Pa., and now fights for transgender rights in Washington, Ms. Hill-Aston envisions an America where differences are celebrated, not airbrushed away.
