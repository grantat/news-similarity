<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="2128">Mrs. Obama, 52, is no stranger to speaking her mind. A Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer who was forced to give up her career as a hospital executive with a $250,000-plus salary when Mr. Obama won the presidency, she nevertheless set about conforming to the traditional job of first lady. As the first black woman in the role, she was well aware from the start that there would be little margin for error.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="418" data-total-count="2546">She declared herself the “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/us/politics/08michelle.html">mom in chief</a>.” She took on unassailable causes like healthy eating, exercise and military families. Despite the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/fashion/in-versace-michelle-obama-sends-a-powerful-message-at-her-final-state-dinner.html">couture she wore to state dinners</a> and the glamorous White House parties she threw with guests like Beyoncé, Mrs. Obama cultivated an unpretentious image by dispensing hugs rather than handshakes and kicking off her shoes to dance with local children on official trips abroad.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="2848" id="story-continues-3">Inside the White House, the image is different: Mrs. Obama has come to be adored but feared in the East Wing as a tough and exacting boss who has little patience for mistakes, improvisation and wasted time. But her discipline and intensity have paid off in her success as first lady, staff members say.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="544" data-total-count="3392">The discipline extends to her daughters, who have been required to play a sport of their mother’s choosing in addition to one of their own and are barred from television or computer entertainment on school nights. Mrs. Obama has worked only two to three days a week to allow her to spend time with them and only participates in activities she regards as “value added.” She rarely grants an interview unless she thinks there is a compelling reason, such as a link to one of her initiatives. She declined to be interviewed for this article.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="3566">“We should do things that matter to us and matter to the country, but we don’t have to do everything,” Mrs. Obama told her staff shortly after her husband’s election.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="50" data-total-count="3616">That rarely included campaign politics. Until now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="3808">“She’s gained confidence,” said Melissa Winter, her deputy chief of staff, who joined Mrs. Obama’s team in 2007. “I think she ultimately enjoys it more than she thought she might.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="4145">When in 2003, State Senator Barack Obama of Illinois announced his campaign for the United States Senate at a news conference in a Chicago hotel, Mrs. Obama did not attend. When he weighed a run for the White House four years later, she resisted. Once she finally gave her consent, she was parsimonious in her time on the campaign trail.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="4477">Ms. Winter, who had just gone to work for Mrs. Obama, remembers it well. “When I first started, she said, ‘I’ll campaign two days a week, and I’m not going to work on the weekends, because I’ll be with the kids,’” Ms. Winter said. “And I’m thinking, ‘I moved to Chicago for this?’ Politics is not her thing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="4616">Her daughters, Malia, 17, and Sasha, 15, who were in elementary school when their father won the White House, were only part of the reason.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="4821">“Michelle once explained to me, ‘I try to organize my life not to have a lot of mess around, and politics is just a big mess,’” Mr. Obama said last month on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night comedy show.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-4">Continue reading the main story</a>

Vote right now!”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="6707">Mr. Obama’s political advisers have long regarded his wife as a potent weapon. Their nickname for her in his 2008 campaign was “the closer.” Back then, with Mr. Obama engaged in a bitter <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/delegates/index.html">Democratic primary</a> against Mrs. Clinton, his aides noticed that Mrs. Obama’s so-called conversion rate — the ratio of voters who registered or signed up to volunteer or otherwise help the campaign after she made an appeal — was exceptionally high.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="6861">In part, that is because Mrs. Obama makes a point of telling voters what she expects them to do, like a mother ordering her children to do their homework.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

A worried Mrs. Obama, who was furious about the racist rumors of her husband, told aides that she might be hurting her husband’s chances, and wondered whether she had been wrong to swallow her misgivings and plunge into the campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="400" data-total-count="8429">“She wasn’t accustomed to this, and she wasn’t used to the criticism, and she became a lightning rod early on in the presidential race,” said David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama’s closest advisers at the time. “It wasn’t like she was demanding to be out on the campaign trail. We asked her to be out there. And oftentimes, we threw her out there without adequate preparation or staffing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="8757">Mrs. Obama was livid when a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/07/21">New Yorker magazine cover cartoon in July 2008</a> pictured her wearing fatigues, combat boots and an Afro and toting a machine gun, fist-bumping with her husband, who was dressed in Middle Eastern garb and a head scarf.

Mrs. Obama appeared on “The View” and talked about serving her daughters bacon for breakfast and hating to wear pantyhose. She gave an interview to Ladies’ Home Journal about her views on marriage and motherhood. She delivered a speech at the Democratic convention in Denver, where she talked of her working-class roots and called her husband “a great American story,” and — in a subtle attempt to answer her critics — spoke repeatedly of her pride in and love for America.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="9891">Her poll numbers shot up more than 10 points, above 50 percent, and by Inauguration Day, they were at 68 percent, according to Gallup’s daily tracking. They have not dipped below 60 percent since.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="10924">Over their time in the White House, Barack and Michelle Obama have adopted their own memes to explain each other to the public, each with a serrated edge that has the ring of truth.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="11256">Mr. Obama’s portrayal is tart: He casts his wife as the real boss in the family, one who has barely tolerated his political aspirations for far longer than she has wanted to, and is always on the brink of cutting him loose. (He told Mr. Kimmel last month that “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDujVSXYcrY">Michelle would divorce me</a>” if he were able to seek a third term.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="11688">Hers is about a husband who is brilliant but takes himself too seriously and frequently needs an ego-shattering reality check. On “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” in September, Mrs. Obama <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiMUoVjQ5uI">lowered her voice</a> several octaves to impersonate the president lecturing his daughters on global warming at the dinner table. In 2007, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/tales-from-the-obamas-bedroom/">she told Glamour magazine</a> that her husband was “snore-y and stinky” when he awoke in the morning.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="11899">Cindi Leive, the editor in chief of Glamour who has worked with the first lady on the “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/https://letgirlslearn.gov/">Let Girls Learn</a>” education initiative, recalled editing that first interview and thinking she wanted to know her better.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="12173">“That’s exactly the sentiment that much of America has come to have over the last eight years: ‘I need to be friends with this woman,’’’ Ms. Leive said. “‘Why am I not friends with this woman?’ And, then increasingly, ‘I am friends with this woman.’”</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

The American public doesn’t want that in a first lady. They want someone nice and relatable.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="13067">But as voters greet Mrs. Obama rapturously at campaign events this fall and eagerly chant her slogan, “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161106053811/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_hCThhzWU">When they go low, we go high</a>,” speculation has started that she may one day seek office herself. Those close to her regard the prospect as absurd.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="13209">“I am certain she does not wish to be in politics herself,” Ms. Jarrett said. “There are very few things I’m as certain of in life.”</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
