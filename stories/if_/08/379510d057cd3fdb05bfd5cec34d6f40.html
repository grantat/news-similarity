(Jonathan Drake/Reuters) </div> </div> <p><em>With Breanne Deppisch:</em></p> <p><strong>THE BIG IDEA:</strong></p> <p><strong>CARY, N.C.—Richard Burr, the senior Republican senator from North Carolina, knows how closely his fortunes are tied to Donald Trump at this point. </strong>In a state where the GOP presidential nominee is running neck and neck with Hillary Clinton, he’s stuck with him. Last night he campaigned with Mike Pence. “There's not a separation between me and Donald Trump,” Burr told a group of party activists <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161108012515/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2rOjv-olvM">recently</a>.</p> <p><strong>Like 2016 in miniature, Trump has sucked up all the oxygen and allowed Democrats to turn several Senate races into referendums on him.</strong> As a result, a lawmaker like Burr finds himself vulnerable in a year when he did not expect to. The 60-year-old, once a football star at Wake Forest, has been in Congress since 1994. He could lose to Deborah Ross, a former state legislator and the onetime state director of the ACLU.</p> <p><strong>The final Quinnipiac poll of North Carolina, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161108012515/https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/ps/ps11072016.pdf/">published this morning</a>, shows the Senate race tied (47 percent to 47 percent)</strong> and Clinton leading in the presidential race by two points (47 percent to 45 percent).</p> <p><strong>Ross said in an interview that she can imagine any of the four possible scenarios playing out tomorrow.</strong> Trump could win the state narrowly and pull Burr across the finish line. Or Trump could win, and she could still beat Burr (she said she’s met several people in rural areas who support Trump and her). Clinton could win the state, and that could get her across. Or Burr, because of split-ticket voting, could narrowly hold on. “I think all scenarios are possible in a situation where races are close,” she explained, adding that she tries not to think about it.</p> <p><strong>An adviser to Burr said he has been working to win over some later ticket-splitters in the suburbs around Charlotte and Raleigh, like this one</strong>, and expressed hope that the incumbent will prevail even if Trump narrowly loses the Tar Heel State.</p> <p><strong>If Senate Democrats win North Carolina, they will almost certainly get back their majority after two years in the wilderness.</strong></p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo"> <img class="zoom-in" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20161108012515im_/https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/d1ddebc0d55968669f080930b496fcf1-908-592-Senate_2016_North_Carolina_Debate376c2.jpg"> <div class="pb-caption"> Richard Burr and Deborah Ross square off in the Research Triangle at their final debate.&nbsp;(Gerry Broome/AP/Pool) </div> </div> <p><strong>-- Bigger picture: I spoke yesterday with 20 strategists and operatives who are closely involved in the battle for the Senate</strong>, <strong>both nationally and in the states.</strong> It was an even mix of Republicans and Democrats.

What follows are the most interesting points and predictions that emerged from these interviews, with the important stipulation that any of it could wind up being wrong. The 2016 cycle has shown the shortcomings of conventional wisdom, and a big surprise somewhere is totally conceivable.</p> <p><strong>-- Every person I talked with presupposes that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency, even though the race has tightened.</strong> That means Democrats need to pick up four seats because Vice President Tim Kaine would be the tie breaking vote.</p> <p><strong>-- Both sides are girding themselves for what they expect will be a very late night, but the conventional wisdom is that it is more likely than not that Democrats net at least four. </strong>Reflecting the high stakes, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161108012515/http://www.cfinst.org/data/2016_Senate_Independent.aspx">a study</a> out this weekend showed that more than $532 million has now been spent by outside groups on Senate ads in the general election.</p> <p><strong>-- Republicans say that they’ve done remarkably well at staying in the game, considering what a debacle Trump could have caused down the ballot.</strong> One GOP power player likened the party to a football team that’s playing on the road and down a touchdown with two minutes left in the fourth quarter. Despite everything that’s gone wrong in the previous 58 minutes – injuries, turnovers, penalties – they could still find a way to get to the end zone.

Ted Cruz running-mate Carly Fiorina, despite blowing a totally winnable 2010 Senate race in California, keeps telling people she wants to run. But she would (to put it nicely) not be able to clear the field. Virginia’s demographics may be changing, but with the exception of 2013, the commonwealth has a storied history of rejecting the newly-elected president’s party in its off-year elections.

God will be against you. Will you reconsider?’ ‘No,’ she said firmly. Just like that, Hijazi, 45, was freed from a 33-year marriage to a man she described as abusive and domineering. The refugee from Syria’s war had long wished for such an ending, but it had never seemed possible … That changed when the family fled to Lebanon two years ago. … For some Syrian women living in Lebanon, the bitter realities of life as a refugee have nourished an unexpected side effect: empowerment.

Tim Kaine’s Senate seat in Virginia — and Carly Fiorina could soon be leading the pack. Whether or not Kaine wins the vice presidency this week, his term is up in 2018. But if he has to resign, there will also be a special election in 2017, and Fiorina, who resides … in Mason Neck, Virginia, is considering entering the race — but won’t make a decision on whether to do so until after Election Day … Republicans in the state are urging Fiorina to run because she would bring immediate star power and fundraising ability to the expensive, back-to-back races for Kaine’s seat that will take place if he becomes vice president. Fiorina is not the only Republican interested … But her national name recognition after the 2016 presidential campaign would make Fiorina particularly formidable in a GOP primary. ‘It’s something she’s taking a very strong look at,’ a Virginia GOP operative said. ‘She’s not just name ID, she’s got serious definition. People have seen her, they know what she can do.’”</p> <p><strong>DAYBOOK:</strong></p> <p><strong>On the campaign trail:</strong> It's the final day to campaign.
