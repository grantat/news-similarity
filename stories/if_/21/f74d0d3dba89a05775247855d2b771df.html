<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="2335">“Everyone else has their own constituencies, but Jared is just there to protect the interests of the president,” said Thomas Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s who is heading up the inaugural committee.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="529" data-total-count="2864">It is not clear exactly how Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump’s elder daughter, Ivanka, might be deployed. He is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html">exploring the prospects of joining the administration</a> as a formal, but unpaid, adviser. Anti-nepotism statutes prohibit close relatives of the president from playing an active role in the government, but at the same time, the Constitution gives the president broad authority to choose his own advisers. If the Trump administration presses ahead with a Kushner appointment, the matter could wind up in court.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="527" data-total-count="3391">Whatever role Mr. Kushner may play in the administration, he has already had a hand in helping assemble it. Both of Mr. Trump’s most senior advisers, Mr. Priebus, his new chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, seek Mr. Kushner’s advice routinely, considering his buy-in almost a prerequisite for their proposals to Mr. Trump, two senior Trump officials said. (In deference to Mr. Kushner, the transition team delayed announcing the two men’s appointment until after the Jewish sabbath last weekend.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="3770">“Jared has the trust, confidence and ear of the entire inner circle of the Trump administration, including the most important member of that group, the president-elect,” said Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He described Mr. Kushner as “one of the most important players right now beyond the president- and vice president-elect.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="4217">Inside the Trump operation, he is known as the staunchest defender of Mr. Trump’s judgment. When Mr. Bannon was recently accused of anti-Semitism and of promoting white supremacist views and conspiracy theories, Mr. Kushner reassured the Trump team. He called Mr. Bannon a man of character and said the widespread criticism was a smear, according to a senior Republican official, speaking about private discussions on the condition of anonymity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="4556">While Mr. Kushner kept himself out of the spotlight throughout the campaign, he has been more visible since the election, walking the White House grounds during Mr. Trump’s recent meeting with President Obama and accompanying the president-elect at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/world/asia/shinzo-abe-donald-trump.html">a meeting at Trump Tower on Thursday night</a> with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="4729" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Kushner declined to be interviewed for this article. Although he is a newspaper owner and publisher, he has not been quoted in the media since the start of the campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="5087">Before that, Mr. Kushner did not have much of a public political identity, but appeared to lean left. He was raised in a Democratic household, and several years ago, he and his wife hosted a fund-raiser in their Park Avenue penthouse for Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey and former Newark mayor, who has become a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.</p><figure id="media-100000004777443" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004777443" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/us/20KUSHNER1/20KUSHNER1-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="5379">They also once hosted a fund-raising breakfast for another Democrat, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who sued Trump University for allegedly defrauding students. (The lawsuit was one of a series brought against the program that were <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/politics/trump-university.html">settled on Friday for $25 million</a>.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="301" data-total-count="5680">The couple moves in a predominantly liberal Manhattan circle. “Their social politics seem more what I would expect from New Yorkers of their generation,” said Adam Silver, the National Basketball Association commissioner and a friend of Mr. Kushner’s who has frequently contributed to Democrats.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="452" data-total-count="6132">Some New York business leaders, who had recoiled at Mr. Trump’s candidacy, say privately that they are hoping Mr. Kushner will be a moderating influence on the new president. But it remains to be seen how receptive he will be to their concerns. Trump officials say that Mr. Kushner underwent an ideological conversion over the course of the campaign, and that he was particularly affected by the experience of wading into the crowds at Trump rallies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="6307">Mr. Kushner projects a very different image from his father and father-in-law. He speaks in a near-whisper, punctuated by long pauses, conveying both intimacy and awkwardness.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="571" data-total-count="6878">Unlike most of Mr. Trump’s advisers, Mr. Kushner is unfazed by Mr. Trump’s frequent fits of anger, sitting silently rather than flinching or fighting back when he is being dressed down, several campaign officials have said. The relationship between the two men is relatively uncomplicated. Unlike Mr. Trump’s two eldest sons, Mr. Kushner did not have to live through his father-in-law’s public and messy divorces, and the businesses that he presides over are his own, not part of the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump has described him as a “brilliant young man.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="7294">His quiet manner belies a driving confidence; his family’s wealth has allowed him to plunge into new ventures, sometimes stumbling in the process. In his mid-20s, he took charge of his father’s real estate empire and bought The New York Observer. Much as he once courted the media mogul Rupert Murdoch as a mentor, now that he is immersing himself in politics, he has been seeking the counsel of Henry Kissinger.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="433" data-total-count="7727" id="story-continues-5">At the start of the campaign, Mr. Kushner was mostly just along for the ride, keeping his father-in-law company at the occasional rally and making the odd phone call to a potential donor on his behalf. His purview was never entirely spelled out, which gave him latitude to exert influence without clear responsibility. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/us/politics/jared-kushner-donald-trump.html">He gradually built influence</a>, and by the end of the race, he was seen internally as the de facto campaign manager.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="8169">He oversaw the creation of the campaign’s $90 million digital operation, including a database of millions of Trump supporters, which was developed by a Texas business that had previously worked on the Trump Organization website. He also brokered important meetings for Mr. Trump, including his sit-down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, which Mr. Kushner arranged with Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the United States.</p><figure id="media-100000004777445" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004777445 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/us/20KUSHNER3/20KUSHNER3-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

More recently, Mr. Kushner backed away from a member of the transition team he had previously supported, when the man’s work as a lobbyist for foreign governments attracted headlines.</p><div class="newsletter-signup dropzone-24 ab-test-newsletter-buffet hidden" id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productcode="CN" data-newsletter-producttitle="First Draft">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="9227">Though he is not particularly bookish, Mr. Kushner is an admirer of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” the story of an innocent man seeking vengeance against people who have wronged him. It is a story that feels particularly resonant now: In recent weeks, Mr. Kushner has been able to exact a measure of revenge against his own family’s nemesis, Governor Christie.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="9441">During the campaign, Mr. Kushner opposed Mr. Christie’s appointment to oversee the transition team, but Mr. Trump overruled him, aides have said. This past week, however, Mr. Kushner helped push Mr. Christie out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="439" data-total-count="9880">Their history dates to 2005, when Mr. Christie, then the United States attorney for New Jersey, sent Mr. Kushner’s father, Charles, to federal prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations. The case involved a tawdry family feud: At one point, Charles Kushner sought to blackmail his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with the federal authorities, by hiring a woman to seduce him and videotape the encounter.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="10221">“This had nothing to do with personalities or individual relationships,” Jason Miller, Mr. Trump’s spokesman, said of Mr. Christie’s departure. “This was purely about putting in the best leadership and the most-qualified individuals to form the government that the president-elect wants in place when he’s sworn in on Jan. 20.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="10470">Other Trump officials were critical of Mr. Christie’s performance as transition chief, and said his role had become untenable after the so-called Bridgegate scandal resulted in the convictions of two former Christie aides days before the election.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="425" data-total-count="10895" id="story-continues-6">Mr. Kushner’s work on the campaign took place behind the scenes, with the notable exception of an op-ed article in support of Mr. Trump in July in The Observer. At the time, Mr. Trump was under fire for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-star-of-david.html">a Twitter post</a> that included an image of Hillary Clinton with a shape resembling a Star of David next to a pile of cash, the latest in a list of actions by the campaign that struck many as insensitive to Jewish concerns.</p><figure id="media-100000004777447" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004777447 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/us/20kushner-web5/20kushner-web5-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="11212">In defending Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner told the story of his grandmother’s narrow escape from the Nazis in the Soviet Union during <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about Wold War II." class="meta-classifier">World War II</a>. The article provoked an angry response on Facebook from two estranged cousins, one of whom accused Mr. Kushner of exploiting their family’s history for political purposes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="11504">Like Mr. Trump’s children, Mr. Kushner was raised in a privileged environment. He went to a private Jewish school in Livingston, N.J., and attended Harvard after his parents pledged a $2.5 million gift to the university. Later, he got a joint M.B.A. and law degree from New York University.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="11794">His wife described him as a “great New Jersey boy,” in a Vogue magazine interview last year. When the couple were married at a Trump golf course in 2009, guests were given white flip-flops with the words “Jared” and “Ivanka” on the insoles and a tag reading, “A Great Pair.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="11987">Mr. Kushner had no journalism experience when he purchased The Observer for $10 million in 2006, installing a chess board in his office that former staff members don’t recall ever being used.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="12338">He found himself presiding over a newspaper of reporters and editors more or less his age, and he responded with solicitousness. “‘This is so great I’m getting to hang around with journalists, and they are really smart,” Nancy Butkus, the paper’s former artistic director, recalled Mr. Kushner saying in a cab packed with Observer employees.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="12721">As he sought to put his imprint on the paper, his relationship with its veteran editor, Peter Kaplan, quickly soured. “This guy doesn’t know what he doesn’t know,” Mr. Kaplan complained to colleagues at the time. Sustaining declines in print advertising like others in the newspaper industry, The Observer announced this month that it would <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121035103/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/business/media/new-york-observer-ending-print-edition.html">become a digital-only publication</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="13020">Mr. Kushner became the public face of his family’s real estate business, Kushner Companies, when his father was sent to prison. In an effort to rehabilitate the family name, the younger Mr. Kushner oversaw a series of transactions geared toward moving holdings out of New Jersey and into New York.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="13371" id="story-continues-7">The centerpiece was the purchase of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper for $1.8 billion. It was then as record price for a New York office building; as it turned out, the timing could not have been worse. A couple of years later, in the face of recession, the Kushners were forced to sell a stake in the building to cover a secondary loan on the property.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="13647">Since then, the real estate market has rebounded; the Kushners have acquired $7 billion worth of commercial and residential property over the last decade, according to real estate executives who have been briefed by the Kushners but were not authorized to discuss the matters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="13913">Charles Kushner remains an active presence in the business. The company named a new president over the summer as his son, the C.E.O., became increasingly involved in the Trump campaign. Jared Kushner has found a new passion, and his father-in-law is counting on him.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
