Trump</a> appeared to soften some of his hardest-line campaign positions on immigration on Sunday, but he also restated his pledge to roll back abortion rights and used Twitter to lash out at his critics, leaving open the possibility that he would continue using social media in the Oval Office and radically change the way presidents speak to Americans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="673">In his first prime-time television interview since his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161114014406/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-president.html?_r=0">upset victory on Tuesday</a>, Mr. Trump repeated his promise to name a Supreme Court justice who opposed abortion rights and would help overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized them, returning the issue to the states.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="862">Asked where that would leave women seeking abortions, Mr. Trump said on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” “Well, they’ll perhaps have to go — they’ll have to go to another state.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="511" data-total-count="1373">On immigration, he said the wall that he has been promising to build on the nation’s southern border might end up being a fence in places. But he said his priority was to deport two million to three million immigrants he characterized as dangerous or as having criminal records, a change from his original position that he would deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. President Obama has deported more than two million undocumented immigrants during his time in office.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="6713" id="story-continues-5">“I’m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out,” Mr. Trump said of Twitter during the interview, adding that his millions of followers on various social media sites had given him “such power” that it helped him win the election.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="257" data-total-count="6970">“When you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,” Mr. Trump added, “I have a method of fighting back.” He said, however, that he would be “very restrained” in his Twitter posts should he continue to make them as president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="7402">Mr. Trump is a highly public scorekeeper of his own accolades and accomplishments, and his elevation to the highest office in the land has not changed his instinct to crow about the smallest details. During the interview, Mr. Trump boasted that since his election, he had built up his social media following by tens of thousands of people. “I’m picking up now — I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="7669">The interview, which also featured Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, and adult children, showed a side of the president-elect that he did not display during the campaign — a man awed and somewhat intimidated by the enormity of the office to which he had just laid claim.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="7843">“I’ve done a lot of big things, I’ve never done anything like this,” Mr. Trump said. “It is — it is so big, it is so — it’s so enormous, it’s so amazing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="8181">Mr. Trump said he had been inaccurately portrayed as “a little bit of a wild man” during the campaign, and he promised that he would be able to tamp down some of his more heated rhetoric as president. But he suggested that he would still use such tactics to galvanize his supporters, just as he did during his bid for the White House.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="8324">“Sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated,” he said. “I don’t want to be just a little nice monotone character.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
