I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.</p><p>Donald Trump:&ndash;and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Like--</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, <a href="/web/20161114015738/http://www.cbsnews.com/obamacare/" data-is-autolink="true">Obamacare</a> is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.</p><h4>&ldquo;I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m actually not. I&rsquo;m a very sober person.&rdquo; President-elect Donald Trump</h4><p>Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, he didn&rsquo;t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--</p><p>Donald Trump: No, I think I&rsquo;m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m actually not. I&rsquo;m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found&mdash;it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.</p><p>[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you&rsquo;ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you&rsquo;re-- unqualified--</p><p>Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Yeah.</p><p>Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other&mdash;</p><p>Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?</p><p>Donald Trump: I&rsquo;ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that&rsquo;s strange. I&rsquo;m actually surprised to tell you that. It&rsquo;s-- you know, a little bit strange.</p><figure class="media-block"><span class="thumb-big"><a href="#" class="img-info-icon" id="img-info">info</a><div class="img-caption" id="img-caption" style="display:none;"><span class="caption">

They&rsquo;ve let &lsquo;em down on the job front. They&rsquo;ve even let &lsquo;em down in terms of the war front. You know, we&rsquo;ve been fighting this war for 15 years--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.</p><p>Donald Trump: We&rsquo;ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what&rsquo;s been taking place over a longer period of time than that.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?</p><p>Donald Trump: You know, I&rsquo;ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it&rsquo;s going to be America first. It&rsquo;s not going to be what we&rsquo;re doing&mdash;we, we&rsquo;ve lost-- we&rsquo;re losing this country. We&rsquo;re losing this country. That&rsquo;s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don&rsquo;t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: Can you be?</p><p>Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that&rsquo;s easier. Honestly to do that, it&rsquo;s easier.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So let&rsquo;s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you&rsquo;re going to do what you said or you&rsquo;re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Yes.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: They&rsquo;re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?</p><p>Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I&rsquo;m very good at this, it&rsquo;s called construction.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?</p><p>Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be &ndash; it could be some fencing.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?</p><p>Donald Trump: &nbsp;What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we&rsquo;re getting them out of our country, they&rsquo;re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we&rsquo;re going to make a determination on the people that you&rsquo;re talking about who are terrific people, they&rsquo;re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it&rsquo;s very important, we want to secure our border.</p><p>[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We&rsquo;re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: And you&rsquo;ve got both Houses?</p><p>Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.</p><p>Donald Trump: It&rsquo;s been a long time since it&rsquo;s happened.</p><p>Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don&rsquo;t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.</p><p>Donald Trump: Yeah.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team&mdash;</p><p>Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: I don&rsquo;t like it, no.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: You don&rsquo;t like it, but your own transition team, it&rsquo;s filled with lobbyists.</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: That&rsquo;s the only people you have down there.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.</p><p>Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody&rsquo;s a lobbyist down there-- </p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Well, wait</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: That&rsquo;s what they are. They&rsquo;re lobbyists or special interests&mdash;</p><p>Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team.</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump:&ndash;we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that&rsquo;s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we&rsquo;re going to clean it up. We&rsquo;re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we&rsquo;re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren&rsquo;t happy about, but we&rsquo;re putting on term limits. We&rsquo;re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: But you&rsquo;re, but you&rsquo;re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?</p><p>Donald Trump: I&rsquo;m saying that they know the system right now, but we&rsquo;re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Let&rsquo;s talk about your cabinet.</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: OK.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Yes.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Tell us.</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I can&rsquo;t tell you that, but I have made--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on&mdash;</p><p>Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I&rsquo;ve spoken to many of them and I&rsquo;ll call the rest of them, but and I said, &ldquo;Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.&rdquo; France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia&mdash;and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: One of the things you&rsquo;re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you&rsquo;ll do that quickly?</p><p>Donald Trump: Yes. Very important.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?</p><p>Donald Trump: So look, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen-- I&rsquo;m going to-- I&rsquo;m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They&rsquo;ll be very&mdash;</p><p>Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They&rsquo;ll be pro-life, they&rsquo;ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody&rsquo;s talking about the Second Amendment and they&rsquo;re trying to dice it up and change it, they&rsquo;re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won&rsquo;t be able to get an abortion?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: No, it&rsquo;ll go back to the states.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: By state&mdash;no some --</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Yeah.</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they&rsquo;ll perhaps have to go, they&rsquo;ll have to go to another state.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: And that&rsquo;s OK?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, we&rsquo;ll see what happens. It&rsquo;s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you&rsquo;re taking on?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: No.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Not at all?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: I respect it. But I&rsquo;m not scared by it.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Now you&rsquo;re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--</p><p>Donald Trump: That&rsquo;s only because they don&rsquo;t know me. I really believe that&rsquo;s only because--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that&rsquo;s--</p><p>Donald Trump: I just don&rsquo;t think they know me.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they&rsquo;re demonstrating against?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are&mdash;</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Well Lesley&mdash;</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: are professional?</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about &ndash; they&rsquo;re in every city.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don&rsquo;t you say to yourself, I guess you don&rsquo;t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They&rsquo;re afraid.</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: I would tell them don&rsquo;t be afraid, absolutely.</p><h4>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; President-elect Donald J. Trump</h4><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: But that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re saying, I said it-</p><p>&nbsp;Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I&rsquo;ve been saying it.</p><p>&nbsp;Lesley Stahl: OK.</p><p>Donald Trump: Don&rsquo;t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don&rsquo;t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a terrible thing.&rdquo; And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.</p><p>It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s edge in the popular vote, have been significant.</p><p>When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name&hellip; or against his supporters.&nbsp; </p><p>Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.</p><p>Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it?</p><p>Donald Trump: I don&rsquo;t hear it&mdash;I saw, I saw one or two instances&hellip;</p><p>Lesley Stahl: On social media?</p><p>Donald Trump: But I think it&rsquo;s a very small amount. Again, I think it&rsquo;s--</p><div class="related-assets more-video-play">

    </div><p>Lesley Stahl: What about your husband&rsquo;s tweeting?</p><p>Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, &ldquo;Come on&rdquo;?</p><p>Melania Trump: I did.</p><p>Donald Trump: She does--</p><p>Melania Trump: I--</p><p>Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But&hellip;</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?</p><p>Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t--</p><p>Donald Trump: I&rsquo;m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don&rsquo;t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?</p><p>Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: All the time?</p><p>Melania Trump: All the time.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: And does--</p><p>Melania Trump: And--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--</p><p>Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He&rsquo;s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he&rsquo;s affected every bit as much. Maybe more.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Maybe more.</p><p>Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, &ldquo;I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.&rdquo; And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?</p><p>Melania Trump: 10.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?</p><p>Melania Trump: He knows. He knows--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: He knows?</p><p>Melania Trump: --what&rsquo;s going on. And, he&rsquo;s very proud of his dad.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--</p><p>Melania Trump: No.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?</p><p>Melania Trump: No. I didn&rsquo;t feel it.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Not at all?</p><p>Melania Trump: No.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.</p><p>Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That&rsquo;s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?</p><p>Melania Trump: They&rsquo;re here.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?</p><p>Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair&rsquo;s out of place. Are you both prepared for this?</p><p>Melania Trump: We are used to it.</p><p>Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve had a lot. But I&rsquo;ve never had anything like this.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You won&rsquo;t be able to walk down the street--</p><p>Melania Trump: I didn&rsquo;t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It&rsquo;s another level, but it will continue.</p><p>At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?</p><p>Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don&rsquo;t-- I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, there&rsquo;s been a lotta leaking, there&rsquo;s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I&rsquo;d answer a question like that.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you&rsquo;re not sure.</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, sure, I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?</p><p>Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I&rsquo;m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn&rsquo;t care because I won the election very easily. So they don&rsquo;t care. I never thought they did care. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy. </p><p>Donald Trump: I do.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it&rsquo;s rigged?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--</p><p>Donald Trump: You know, it&rsquo;s--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: --it&rsquo;s rigged?</p><p>Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you&rsquo;re saying that--</p><p>Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I&rsquo;m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There&rsquo;s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there&rsquo;s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? You&rsquo;re not going to take any vacations? You&rsquo;ve said that.</p><p>Donald Trump: We have so much work. There&rsquo;s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We&rsquo;re lowering taxes, we&rsquo;re taking care of health care. I mean, there&rsquo;s just so much to be done. So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be very big on vacations, no. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president&rsquo;s salary?</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I&rsquo;ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I&rsquo;ll take $1 a year. But it&rsquo;s a -- I don&rsquo;t even know what it is.</p><p>Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?</p><p>Lesley Stahl: $400,000 you&rsquo;re giving up. </p><p>Donald Trump: No, I&rsquo;m not gonna take the salary. I&rsquo;m not taking it. </p><p>In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and <a href="/web/20161114015738/http://www.cbsnews.com/isis/" data-is-autolink="true">ISIS</a>.</p><h2>The Trump Family</h2><figure class="media-block"><span class="thumb-big"><a href="#" class="img-info-icon" id="img-info">info</a><div class="img-caption" id="img-caption" style="display:none;"><span class="caption">

Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Ivanka, you said that your father&rsquo;s changed in the campaign.

You meet-- and in my father&rsquo;s case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Do you think your father&rsquo;s changed?</p><p>Eric Trump: I think as a family, we&rsquo;ve changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, it&rsquo;s fighting by our father&rsquo;s side every single day as you&rsquo;ve gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Don, did you discover something about your father that you didn&rsquo;t know before?</p><p>Donald Trump, Jr.: You know-- we-- we know him pretty well. And we&rsquo;ve got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know-- the tenacity that he&rsquo;s always shown-- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t triage. Which state are we gonna do today,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just gonna do &lsquo;em all. We&rsquo;re gonna speak to all of these people.&rdquo; And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. And, you know-- it-- it only furthered what I already knew.</p><figure class="media-block"><span class="thumb-big"><a href="#" class="img-info-icon" id="img-info">info</a><div class="img-caption" id="img-caption" style="display:none;"><span class="caption">

A lot of people are afraid. They&rsquo;re really afraid. African Americans think there&rsquo;s a target on their back. Muslims are terrified.</p><p>Donald Trump: I think it&rsquo;s horrible if that&rsquo;s happening. I think it&rsquo;s built up by the press because, frankly, they&rsquo;ll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could&rsquo;ve been there before. If I weren&rsquo;t even around doing this, and they&rsquo;ll make into an event because that&rsquo;s the way the press is.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Do any of you want to say anything about this fear that&rsquo;s out there?</p><p>Donald Trump, Jr.: I-- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: One of the groups that&rsquo;s expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You--</p><p>Donald Trump: And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You did.</p><p>Donald Trump: Everybody said, &ldquo;That was so great.&rdquo; I have been, you know, I&rsquo;ve been-a supporter.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?</p><p>Donald Trump: It-- it&rsquo;s irrelevant because it was already settled. It&rsquo;s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it&rsquo;s done.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So even if you appoint a judge that--</p><p>Donald Trump: It&rsquo;s done. It-- you have-- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They&rsquo;ve been settled. And, I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father&rsquo;s temperament. And he has himself has said, &ldquo;If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, I&rsquo;m gonna strike back.&rdquo; And now people are saying, &ldquo;Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little.&rdquo; What-- how do you think he&rsquo;s going to comport himself as president?</p><p>Eric Trump: I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think that&rsquo;s what this country elected.</p><p>Donald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word &ldquo;Temperament.&rdquo; It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn&rsquo;t work because we&rsquo;re here and they&rsquo;re not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we&rsquo;re going to start winning again. We&rsquo;re going to win on trade, we&rsquo;re going to win at the borders, we&rsquo;re going to knock out ISIS.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You have said that you&rsquo;re gonna destroy ISIS. Now, how are you going to?</p><p>Donald Trump: I don&rsquo;t tell you that. I don&rsquo;t tell you that.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what can --</p><p>Donald Trump: I&rsquo;m not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- it&rsquo;s a tough fight because, number one, the people from the --leaders of ISIS have left. What do you-- why do I have to tell you that?</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Troops on the ground?</p><p>Donald Trump: I&rsquo;m not gonna say anything. I don&rsquo;t want to tell them anything. I don&rsquo;t want to tell anybody anything.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about&mdash;the American people.</p><p>Donald Trump: I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: You said you knew more than the generals about ISIS</p><p>Donald Trump: Well, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they&rsquo;ve done. OK, look at the job they&rsquo;ve done. They haven&rsquo;t done the job. Now, maybe it&rsquo;s leadership, maybe it&rsquo;s something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we&rsquo;re going to get rid of ISIS. </p><p>Lesley Stahl: Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say you&rsquo;re going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?</p><p>Donald Trump: Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You&rsquo;re going to keep that?</p><p>Donald Trump: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we&rsquo;re gonna--</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You&rsquo;re gonna keep that--</p><p>Donald Trump: Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but it&rsquo;s very much something we&rsquo;re going to try and keep.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: And there&rsquo;s going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -&ndash; no?</p><p>Donald Trump: No, we&rsquo;re going to do it simultaneously. It&rsquo;ll be just fine. We&rsquo;re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we&rsquo;re not going to have a two-year period where there&rsquo;s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we&rsquo;ll know. And it&rsquo;ll be great health care for much less money. So it&rsquo;ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.</p><div class="related-assets more-video-play">

And that I want to fight for them.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: But you won&rsquo;t be inside--</p><p>Ivanka Trump: Wage equality, childcare. These are things that are very important for me. I&rsquo;m very passionate about education. Really promoting more opportunities for women. So you know, there&rsquo;re a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand.</p><p>Ivanka Trump: I don&rsquo;t think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And-- so th-- I-- I-- you know, that&rsquo;s the focus.</p><p>Donald Trump: I think what Ivanka trying to say, &ldquo;Who cares? Who cares?&rdquo; This is big league stuff. This is-- this is our country. Our country is going bad. We&rsquo;re going to save our country. I don&rsquo;t care about hotel occupancy. It&rsquo;s peanuts compared to what we&rsquo;re doing. Health care, making people better. It&rsquo;s unfair what&rsquo;s happened to the people of our country and we&rsquo;re going to change it. As simple as that. </p>
