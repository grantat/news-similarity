<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="1187" id="story-continues-3">Wisconsin, a state that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161122041127/http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/hillary-rodham-clinton?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Hillary Clinton." class="meta-per">Hillary Clinton</a> had assumed she would win, historically boasts one of the nation’s highest rates of voter participation; this year’s 68.3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states. But by local standards, it was a disappointment, the lowest turnout in 16 years. And those no-shows were important. Mr. Trump won the state by just 27,000 voters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="1516">Milwaukee’s lowest-income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures. Of the city’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161122041127/http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/electionAuthors/howtorun/maps/newdistrictmap2012.jpg">15 council districts</a>, the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas — accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="2008">The biggest drop was here in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161122041127/http://city.milwaukee.gov/Directory/How-to-Run-for-Public-Office/Nomination-Packet-Forms/District-Maps/Map-Aldermanic-District-15-Vot.htm#.WDETXbIrK71">District 15</a>, a stretch of fading wooden homes, sandwich shops and fast-food restaurants that is 84 percent black. In this district, voter turnout declined by 19.5 percent from 2012 figures, according to Neil Albrecht, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission. It is home to some of Milwaukee’s poorest residents and, according to a 2016 documentary, “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161122041127/http://www.milwaukee53206.com/about/">Milwaukee 53206</a>,” has one of the nation’s highest per-capita incarceration rates.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="2346">At Upper Cutz, a bustling barbershop in a green-trimmed wooden house, talk of politics inevitably comes back to one man: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161122041127/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Barack Obama" class="meta-per">Barack Obama</a>. Mr. Obama’s elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced. But their lives have not gotten appreciably better, and sourness has set in.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="2594">“We went to the beach,” said Maanaan Sabir, 38, owner of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161122041127/http://www.thejuicekitchenmke.com/">Juice Kitchen</a>, a brightly painted shop a few blocks down West North Avenue, using a metaphor to describe the emotion after Mr. Obama’s election. “And then eight years happened.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="2850">All four barbers had voted for Mr. Obama. But only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time. And even then, it was a sort of protest. One wrote in Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The other wrote in himself.</p><figure id="media-100000004776736" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004776736 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/21/us/21novote2/22novote2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="3150">“I’m so numb,” said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. “It’s like I should have known this would happen. We’re worse off than before.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="166" data-total-count="3316">But Mr. Obama did do something important: “He did give black people something to aspire to. That’s a lot. I’m happy my son was able to see a black president.”</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="3466" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Fleming, 47, who has been trimming hair, beards and mustaches for 30 years, had hoped his small business would get easier to run. But it hasn’t.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="3821">“Give us loans, or a 401(k),” he said, trimming the mustache of Steve Stricklin, a firefighter from the neighborhood. His biggest issue was health insurance. Mr. Fleming lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford. He finally found one, which starts Monday but costs too much at $300 a month.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="66" data-total-count="3887">“Ain’t none of this been working,” he said. He did not vote.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="4239">Mr. Albrecht, of the election commission, said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout. This was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo ID card, and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence. This was particularly onerous for the poor, who move often.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="98" data-total-count="4337">Mr. Albrecht said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="4453">“To me that’s very significant,” he said. “It takes away from the fairness and integrity of the election.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="475" data-total-count="4928">Although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo ID law discriminated against African-Americans, who disproportionately lack the approved IDs, the law was applied on Election Day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who backed the laws, has said they have no impact on voter participation, and Mr. Albrecht allowed that their effect on Milwaukee’s turnout would not have erased Mr. Trump’s victory in the state.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="5113">Perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in Milwaukee, as in the rest of the country, were the candidates themselves. To some, it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="5312">“I felt cornered,” said Ian Pfeiffer, 25, who works the grill at Jake’s Delicatessen and says he did not vote. “We were stuck between Trump and Hillary. They really left us with no choice.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="5633">Mr. Pfeiffer’s grandmother, an avid supporter of Mrs. Clinton, spent months trying to convince him to vote for her. But he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the Clinton Foundation. (Mr. Pfeiffer’s grandfather pushed him toward Mr. Trump, but he found him even less appealing.)</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

He blamed her husband’s policies for putting him in prison for 20 years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="6787">As for the claims of racism that have dogged Mr. Trump, Mr. Babar wasn’t so worried. “It’s better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our kids,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="73" data-total-count="6860">Tarvus Hawthorne, 45, a program coordinator at a local nonprofit, agreed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="7160">“He was real, unlike a lot of liberal Democrats who are just as racist” but keep it hidden, he said, his jaw slathered with shaving cream. “You can reason with them all day long, but they think they know it all.
