His first moves were to check Google for “the Dukes” and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks — in part because he wasn’t certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="365" data-total-count="2202">Like another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee’s old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.</p><figure id="14hack-phishing" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D.

He added that “the Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed ‘Dukes’ by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="10579">Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.</p><figure id="media-100000004820058" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004820058" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/14/us/14HACK3-TEAR/13HACK3-TEAR-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="10962">Mr. Tamene’s initial scan of the D.N.C. system — using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. — found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, “I did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,” Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="11300">In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was “calling home, where home meant Russia,” Mr. Tamene’s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. “SA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="11604">Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton’s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="11835">Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.’s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee’s system had likely been compromised.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="12173">Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.’s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

But then the situation took a dire turn.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="13598">A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="13846">“Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account,” <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://ww.documentcloud.org/documents/3237163-Rinehart-Hacking-Email.html">the March 22 email said</a>, adding that the sign-in attempt had occurred in Ukraine. “Google stopped this sign-in attempt.

Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the “change password” button.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="14909">“This is a legitimate email,” Charles Delavan, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34899">a Clinton campaign aide, replied</a> to another of Mr. Podesta’s aides, who had noticed the alert. “John needs to change his password immediately.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="437" data-total-count="15346">With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account — a total of about 60,000 — were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an “illegitimate” email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</p><figure id="media-100000004818880" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004818880 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/14/us/14hack5/14hack5-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="17096" id="story-continues-12">Investigators gave it a name — <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://medium.com/@chris_doman/the-first-sophistiated-cyber-attacks-how-operation-moonlight-maze-made-history-2adb12cc43f7#.ghd5tn5cf">Moonlight Maze</a> — and spent two years, often working day and night, tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end, they concluded that the total number of files stolen, if printed and stacked, would be taller than the Washington Monument.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="17247">Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="521" data-total-count="17768">But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese — who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn’t publish any of it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="18132">The Russians had not gone away, of course. “They were just a lot more stealthy,” said <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.fireeye.com/company/leadership.html">Kevin Mandia</a>, a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye — and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="301" data-total-count="18433">The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia’s war with Georgia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="18740">But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching “cyber Pearl Harbor” — a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="19159">But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Each time, they eventually met with some form of success,” Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/project/69/cyber_security_project.html">Harvard Cyber Security Project</a>, wrote recently in a soon-to-be published paper for the Carnegie Endowment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="558" data-total-count="19717">The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic “command and control” messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.</p><figure id="14hacks-promotron" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-sub-medium">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="20232" id="story-continues-13">“We’d have all these circular meetings,” one senior State Department official said, “in which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn’t happen.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="20399">So the Russians escalated again — breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as “doxing” in the cyberworld.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="470" data-total-count="20869">It was a brazen change in tactics, moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/world/europe/ukraine.html">they broadcast an intercepted phone call</a> between Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a little-known American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine, then in political turmoil.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="21177">They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the steal-and-leak strategy. The Open Society Foundation, run by George Soros, was a major target, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://soros.dcleaks.com/">when its documents were released</a>, some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="21510">Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="123" data-total-count="21633">The attacks “were not fully integrated military operations,” Mr. Sulmeyer said.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="269" data-total-count="23625">The D.N.C. immediately hired <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.crowdstrike.com/">CrowdStrike</a>, a cybersecurity firm, to scan its computers, identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="503" data-total-count="24526" id="story-continues-17">Those are CrowdStrike’s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear — the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for “advanced persistent threat” — may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike’s co-founder and chief technology officer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="24924">It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, “exfiltrate” documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="25119">“Once they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,” said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="439" data-total-count="25558">Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up — first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta’s email.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="25968">Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="26259">That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. “There’s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,” he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="26536">To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="26863">In the six weeks after CrowdStrike’s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.</p><div id="story-ad-11" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="455" data-total-count="28169">The D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau’s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick “attribution” formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="28394">“You have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,” Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. “We need to tell the American public that.

Concerned that word of the hacking might leak, they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html">news</a> that the committee had been attacked.

Someone calling himself Guccifer 2.0 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://guccifer2.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/dnc/">appeared</a> on the web, claiming to be the D.N.C. hacker — and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump’s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides.</p><figure class="media twitter embedded layout-horizontal-inset">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="301" data-total-count="29648" id="story-continues-21">It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee’s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="30133">Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.’s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a “lone hacker” and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers “sophisticated.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="30348">But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="30625">“Surprisingly, he answered right away,” Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. “I asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="385" data-total-count="31010">That gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well — and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="411" data-total-count="31421">Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2.0 had been edited by someone calling himself, in Russian, Felix Edmundovich — an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Felix_Dzerzhinsky">Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky</a>. Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian, generated by what was clearly a Russian-language version of Word.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="31748">When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor’s tone and manner changed. “At first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,” he said. “It seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="401" data-total-count="32149">Computer experts drew the same conclusion about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://dcleaks.com/">DCLeaks.com</a>, a site that sprang up in June, claiming to be the work of “hacktivists” but posting more stolen documents. It, too, seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably, the website was registered in April, suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole.</p><div id="story-ad-13" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="427" data-total-count="32576" id="story-continues-22">In addition to what Guccifer 2.0 published on his site, he provided material directly on request to some <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://hellofla.com/2016/08/12/guccifer-2-0-strikes-fl-18/">bloggers</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/">publications</a>. The steady flow of Guccifer 2.0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6, 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland, Guccifer released the D.N.C.’s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives, it was insider gold.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="32986">Then WikiLeaks, a far more established outlet, began to publish the hacked material — just as Guccifer 2.0 had promised. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/">WikiLeaks dumped out 44,053 D.N.C. emails with 17,761 attachments</a>. Some of the messages made clear that some D.N.C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger, Mr. Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="417" data-total-count="33403">That was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party’s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="402" data-total-count="33805">Mr. Trump, by now the Republican nominee, expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent, and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25, he sent out a lighthearted <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757538729170964481">tweet</a>: “The new joke in town,” he wrote, “is that Russia leaked the disastrous D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="34010">But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7, a month before the election, the site began the serial publication of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta</a>, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="34346">The same day, the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings, in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">a joint statement</a> by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date, with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="559" data-total-count="34905">The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden’s complaint that Mrs. Clinton’s instincts were “suboptimal.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="411" data-total-count="35316">“I was just mortified,” Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. “I put my hands over my head and said, ‘I can’t believe this is happening to me.’” Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.</p><div id="story-ad-14" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="35634" id="story-continues-23">Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. “If you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,” she said. “But they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="35857">The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks’ plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.</p><figure class="media twitter embedded layout-horizontal-inset">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="36012">But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="36310">Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin’s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="443" data-total-count="36753">In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks’ source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (“False. But what is this?

The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics, and they were masters of “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/europe/vladimir-putin-russia-fake-news-hacking-cybersecurity.html">kompromat</a>,” their term for compromising information.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="84" data-total-count="39497">But a formal “attribution report” still had not been forwarded to the president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="39651">“It took forever,” one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="395" data-total-count="40046">In August a group that called itself the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/shadow-brokers-leak-raises-alarming-question-was-the-nsa-hacked.html">“Shadow Brokers”</a> published a set of software tools that looked like what the N.S.A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install “implants,” malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A., a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="412" data-total-count="40458">The assumption — still unproved — was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in “The Godfather” where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="40706">The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon’s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.</p><figure id="media-100000004818960" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004818960 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/14/us/14hack10/14hack10-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="41090">While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia’s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="71" data-total-count="41161">But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="41406">In a series of “deputies meetings” run by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/18/statement-president-selection-avril-haines-deputy-national-security-advi">Avril Haines</a>, the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C.I.A., several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin’s hands.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="41662">“If we went to Defcon 4,” one frequent participant in Ms. Haines’s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, “we would be saying to the public that we didn’t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="41862">Even something seemingly straightforward — using the president’s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers — seemed too risky.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="42079">“No one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,” said another participant in the classified meeting. “Any retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="460" data-total-count="42539">Instead, when Mr. Obama’s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation’s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently — one that turned out not to be an issue — was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was “rigged” and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="42834">Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election — and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="43065">Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urging him twice in private conversations and in a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3237225-2016-10-18-DNC-RNC-Letter.html">letter</a> to join her in condemning the attacks — an offer he declined to take up.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="43294">“We just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,” she said. “Once upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="491" data-total-count="43785">But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="44007">Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America’s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. “Frankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,” he told reporters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="44360">But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia’s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president’s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="412" data-total-count="44772">The reference in the statement to hackings on “political organizations,” officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by “human and technical” sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States’ implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country’s role.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="44846">But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="45076">A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate “at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="45277">Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could “fundamentally alter the election,” he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="45313">“Hope not,” Mr. Biden responded.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="45529">Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has “got to be overt. It needs to be seen.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="186" data-total-count="45715">A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. “If you can’t see it, it’s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="45795">The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="45810">The Next Target</h4>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-27">Continue reading the main story</a>

        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="46132" id="story-continues-28">As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking — the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin’s motive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="46492">Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="70" data-total-count="46562">In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="429" data-total-count="46991">What seems clear is that Russian hacking, given its success, is not going to stop. Two weeks ago, the German intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bruno-kahl-im-interview-stoerversuche-aus-russland-1.3270241">warned</a> that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215032952/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/11/29/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-cyberattacks.html">“The perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such,” Mr. Kahl said.</a> Now, he added, “Europe is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance, and Germany to a particularly great extent.”</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="47255">But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target.
