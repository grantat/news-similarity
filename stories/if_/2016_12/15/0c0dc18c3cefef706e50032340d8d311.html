Our entire internal strategy plan was made public, and suddenly all this material was out there and could be used against me.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="402" data-total-count="1396">The impact of the information released by the hackers on candidates like Ms. Taddeo in Florida and others in nearly a dozen House races around the country was largely lost in the focus on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215043403/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html"> the hacking attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign</a>.

The hackers, working under the made-up name of Guccifer 2.0, used social media tools to invite individual reporters to request specific caches of documents, handing them out the way political operatives distribute scoops. It was an arrangement that proved irresistible to many news outlets — and amplified the consequences of the cyberattack.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="3265"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215043403/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/13/us/politics/democratic-party-documents-hack.html">“It’s time for new revelations now,”</a> the Guccifer 2.0 website proclaimed, as it began to pass out the D.C.C.C. documents, trying to entice reporters to look at them on their own. “All of you may have heard about the D.C.C.C. hack. As you see I wasn’t wasting my time! It was even easier than in the case of the D.N.C. breach.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="3750">Cybersecurity consultants believe the hacking of the D.C.C.C. took place around March or April of 2016 after a staffer clicked on a so-called phishing email. The D.C.C.C. shut down its computer system for a week — from the moment it learned of the attack in June. But it was already too late to close the door. The consequences started to become clear in August when the hackers released the home addresses, cellphone numbers and personal email addresses of Democratic House members.</p> <figure id="document-DCCC-Response-to-Hack" class="interactive promo  layout-small">

But as a former Army cavalry troop commander who served in West Germany in the final years of the Cold War, he said he was not surprised to learn that the Russians were behind the cyberattack.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="12031">“I’ve have been fighting Russians my entire life,” he said. “To me this is just a continued punch-counterpunch; the Cold War games are still being played.”</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda">

        <p>An earlier version of this article misstated the way that AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Paul Ryan, characterized the origins of leaked materials used in political advertisements.
