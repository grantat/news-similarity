But the charity has resisted giving aid to patients at clinics that do not donate money to the fund, an investigation by The New York Times has found. The actions have limited crucial help for needy patients at these clinics. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/docs/advisoryopinions/1997/kdp.pdf">The agreement</a> governing the relationship between the group and the companies forbids choosing patients based on their clinic.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="1118">In multiple cases, the charity pushed back on workers at clinics that had not donated money, discouraging them from signing up their patients for assistance. Until recently, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://textlab.io/doc/882813/hipp-guidelines---american-kidney-fund">the Kidney Fund’s guidelines</a> even said clinics should not apply for patient aid if the company had not donated to the charity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="1443">“I watched many patients who were not able to get that assistance,” said Elaine Brecher, a former social worker at a small clinic in rural Arkansas. After an application for one patient was declined, she said, she did not apply for others, because a colleague believed that only clinics that donated could refer patients.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a>

The money covers the insurance premiums for many types of coverage, including <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about Medicare." class="meta-classifier">Medicare</a> and employer and individual private plans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="488" data-total-count="2655">The Kidney Fund’s payments are part of an unusual deal it made with the government and the dialysis industry 20 years ago. The arrangement allows the dialysis companies to avoid violating anti-kickback laws. It allows dialysis clinics to donate to the Kidney Fund, treat patients whose insurance premiums are paid by the charity and then collect money from the insurers for those patients’ treatments — essentially guaranteeing a steady stream of paying customers for the companies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="2797">But the agreement also has a caveat: It requires that all patient applications be treated equally, regardless of whether their clinic donates.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="3016">In an interview this month, LaVarne A.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="3608" id="story-continues-4">Ms. Burton said the concerns raised by social workers like Ms. Brecher and others arose because many in the industry misunderstood how the charity worked. The charity <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://www.kidneyfund.org/assets/pdf/financial-assistance/hipp-guidelines.pdf">recently updated</a> its guidelines, she said, to provide more clarity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="392" data-total-count="4000">An examination of public documents, as well as interviews with more than a dozen social workers, employees of dialysis clinics, insurance officials and regulators, and a former executive at the charity, put the actions in a different light.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="4326">The findings also add to a list of concerns about the group’s relationship with the dialysis industry.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="396" data-total-count="4722">This year, for example, the fund faced questions about whether it was helping dialysis companies game the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, insurers and government officials have argued, the dialysis clinics used the charity’s assistance program to push people who were eligible for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about Medicaid." class="meta-classifier">Medicaid</a>, government <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about health insurance and managed care." class="meta-classifier">health insurance</a> for the poor, into private health coverage available under the new law.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="4903">The private plans pay the clinics much more than Medicaid — up to four times as much, adding up to an additional $200,000 per patient per year — for the same dialysis treatment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="5282">In recent months, the federal government has raised concerns about how patients are steered into private plans. UnitedHealthcare <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/business/unitedhealthcare-sues-dialysis-chain-over-billing.html">sued one company</a>, American Renal Associates, over the practice, claiming it was harming patients by converting them to less generous coverage. American Renal, which declined to comment for this article, has denied the claims and is fighting the suit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="5532">The suit against American Renal also says the Kidney Fund directed some donations directly back to patients at American Renal. As part of an investigation by Medicare, social workers and insurers have made similar accusations against the Kidney Fund.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="5738" id="story-continues-5">Ms. Burton denied those accusations and attributed the recent scrutiny of the insurance assistance program to insurers that want to avoid covering the often costly medical bills of people who need dialysis.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="5807">“The insurance industry has let us have it full force,” she said.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="18" data-total-count="5825">A Costly Treatment</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="6185">Dialysis filters toxins from the blood when a patient’s kidneys no longer work. The process is lifesaving, but also onerous, often requiring that patients be tethered to a machine for hours at a time, three times a week. Patients on dialysis often cannot hold full-time jobs, studies have shown, and those receiving the treatment are disproportionately poor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="6511">The poorest people with kidney disease qualify for Medicaid, which covers all of their costs. But Medicare covers most of the 500,000 or so Americans who need the treatment, regardless of their age, under a government program that has existed since the 1970s and that costs the federal government <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/https://www.usrds.org/2016/view/v2_11.aspx">more than $30</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/https://www.usrds.org/2016/view/v2_11.aspx"> billion a</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/https://www.usrds.org/2016/view/v2_11.aspx"> year</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="6748">Even with help, people covered by Medicare are left with significant out-of-pocket costs. Most must pay a monthly premium of about $120, as well as a portion of their medical expenses, which can add up to several thousand dollars a year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="7007">Until the late 1990s, the dialysis companies routinely paid these expenses. But a federal law outlawed that practice, out of concern that covering a patient’s bills might dissuade that patient from switching to another clinic that might provide better care.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="7235">That was when the American Kidney Fund stepped in. In 1995, the charity was relatively small, with a $5 million annual budget and contributions from the dialysis industry that accounted for less than 10 percent of its donations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="7406">The Kidney Fund and the biggest dialysis clinics presented the government with a proposal that would allow the companies to indirectly pay insurance premiums for patients.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="7674">The deal, reached with the Office of Inspector General at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161226063654/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/health_and_human_services_department/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Health and Human Services Department, U.S." class="meta-org">Department of Health and Human Services</a> in 1997, has had a profound effect on the charity. In 2015, the Kidney Fund reported revenue of $264 million, making it one of the country’s 100 largest nonprofits.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="8013" id="story-continues-6">The dialysis industry has also flourished. DaVita and Fresenius in particular have grown quickly, buying smaller chains, consolidating their market share and locking in profits. The Kidney Fund says it got 78 percent of its revenue in 2015 from two companies, which insurers, state regulators and others identified as DaVita and Fresenius.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="8214">“There’s a long history of recognition of the unique needs of that patient population,” said Philipp Stephanus, a senior vice president at DaVita who handles patient support and insurance issues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="8470">The Kidney Fund, DaVita and Fresenius said the federal agreement prohibited them from disclosing what percentage of applications the fund approved from those companies’ clinics, or how much the charity paid in insurance aid for patients at those clinics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="102" data-total-count="8572">But the 1997 deal tried to prevent any preferential treatment, no matter how big the companies became.</p><figure id="media-100000004830359" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004830359 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/20/business/20kidney3/20kidney3-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

They are exactly the kind of people the Kidney Fund says it is there to help.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="9889">In November 2014, Ms. Dickey emailed an executive at the fund. She said she had heard that only clinics that donated to it could apply for financial aid for patients. Her clinic had not donated, she said — but she still had a patient in need.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="10060">“I need to know the facts before I tell her there isn’t premium assistance,” Ms. Dickey wrote in an email to the fund. She provided a copy of the email to The Times.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="10354">An executive at the fund wrote back the same day. He was noncommittal, but attached a set of guidelines that he asked her to review. “If your company cannot make fair and equitable contributions,” the guidelines read, “we respectfully request that your organization not refer patients.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="85" data-total-count="10439">And so she didn’t. The patient, Ms. Dickey said, continues to struggle financially.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="10778">This summer, after Ms. Dickey and other social workers shared their experiences in an industry discussion group, the Kidney Fund invited them to contact the charity about their concerns. When she followed up, the charity told Ms. Dickey that she would need some computer training to enroll in the program. She has not pursued it, she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="10988">Ms. Burton said that Ms. Dickey had apparently misunderstood the exchange with the Kidney Fund employee and that had she applied, her patient would have been approved, assuming the person qualified financially.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="99" data-total-count="11087">But Ms. Brecher and several workers at other nonprofit or independent clinics told similar stories.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="11415">An administrator at an independent clinic in a Midwestern city said he had helped a handful of patients maintain their coverage through the fund after they transferred to his clinic from a large chain. He declined to be identified because, he said, he did not want to anger DaVita and Fresenius, who sometimes send him patients.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="11709">Each time, he said, the charity’s workers later demanded that the clinic make a donation that at a minimum covered the amount it had paid for the patient’s premium. If he did not pay, he said he had been told, the patient risked losing the financial help from the charity for his insurance.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="11891" id="story-continues-8">The administrator said he had refused to donate to the charity. The Kidney Fund continued to help pay for the patients’ insurance, he said, but the aggressive approach angered him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="12052">Ms. Burton said the charity never declined a patient because a clinic did not donate. But she said the Kidney Fund did not hesitate to ask clinics for donations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="12148">“We are a charitable organization,” she said. “We fund-raise for everything that we do.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="12516">She said nearly 40 percent of the 213 dialysis companies whose clinics had successfully helped patients apply to the fund had never donated. She would not say, though, what percentage of the 80,000 patients the fund helps annually comes from clinics that do not donate, or how many of those patients come from the biggest companies, which donate most of their revenue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="12659">Still, some social workers say the assumption at many clinics where they work is that the aid decisions are not always based on financial need.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="13023">Jennifer Bruns, now a social worker at the St. John Transplant Specialty Center in Detroit, worked for years in dialysis clinics and said she had many clients who received assistance from the American Kidney Fund. She said sometimes patients would tell her that their insurance premiums — which the Kidney Fund had agreed to pay — had not been paid that month.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="13177">Ms. Bruns called the fund to find out why, she said in an interview, “and they would say, ‘Well you haven’t made your contribution this month.’”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
