Orange groves at dusk, sky full of pastel color, and Janet Reno is driving the car, a rental. It’s 2002, Reno is running for governor of Florida, and I’ve spent days riding shotgun with her, reporting for this magazine, accompanying her to various campaign events — most of them populated by older women, bright and warm women with structures of freshly coifed hair, who fawn over Janet Reno, who knew her mother, an investigative reporter for The Miami News. To them, Janet Reno is the daughter who left Florida to fix America, serving eight controversial years as attorney general under Bill Clinton, and has now returned to fix the Sunshine State.</p>

  <p>There is a photograph of the astronaut Edgar Mitchell emerging from the Apollo 14 capsule, a ragged cone of scorched metal and shredded foil bobbing in the South Pacific 880 miles off the coast of American Samoa. A wetsuit-clad Navy swimmer is helping him out of the access hatch and into an inflatable raft. Mitchell, dressed in an olive-drab flight suit and a biological mask, steadies himself with his left hand on the door frame. He is 40, with the receding hairline and blandly gentle affect of a family dentist. It is Feb. 9, 1971, and he has just had an epiphany.</p>

  <p><strong>You had to</strong> have a little bit of patience and a lot of luck to catch Miss Cleo. She appeared on TV only late at night, after the second round of reruns and right before the white fuzz took over the screen. Miss Cleo was usually sitting at a table, draped in a glorious amount of fabrics, a stack of tarot cards in front of her, candles and incense burning behind her. “You have questions, I have the answers,” she would intone knowingly in her Jamaican patois, before singing out the words that would become her signature catchphrase: “Call me now!”</p>

  <p><strong> In 2003,</strong> the State of New Jersey allowed a black-bear hunt for the first time in 33 years. The resulting controversy, still smoldering today, seemed irresolvable: Depending on whom you asked, the hunt was either sadistic blood sport or noble tradition. Two sociologists, Dave Harker and Diane C. Bates, scrutinized 10 years of clashing regional newspaper editorials and letters to the editor and concluded that the two sides did not even seem to be arguing about the same animal. Actual bears had been replaced by “competing social constructions” of bears. Those in favor of the hunt imagined the animals as “menacing threats” that needed to be controlled; those against saw them as docile and benevolent creatures that just wanted to “live in peace.”</p>

  <p><strong> When the shaking</strong> stopped on April 18, 1906, William A. Del Monte’s mother bundled him in a tablecloth and carried him out of the house and into the street, where her husband waited in a buckboard wagon. Amid San Francisco’s chaos — broken water and gas mains, shattered windows, twisted telegraph wires, six-foot chasms in the fissured earth — a horse began hauling the family from their North Beach neighborhood to the ferry terminal by the Embarcadero. Dawn was breaking. Small fires were beginning to burn. Houses, tipped diagonally, seemed on the verge of collapse. The city’s power was down, and its supplies of fresh water were mostly gone.</p>

  <p><strong>In 1963,</strong> the 19-year-old Frank Sinatra Jr. sang with the Tommy Dorsey band, just as his father had two decades before, though now Dorsey was seven years dead and The New York Times referred to the musicians performing under his name as a “ghost band that has become the nucleus of a ghost show.” The younger Sinatra was praised for how close his mannerisms and phrasing were to his father’s, but he was damned for lacking his father’s “creative presence.”</p>

Minutes before she heard her breakthrough hit, “This Will Be,” on the radio for the first time in 1975, she had scored a heroin fix and was tripping down 113th Street in Harlem. Drugs were a recent mainstay; she started using heavily in college, during the substance-fueled psychedelic era (she still managed to get her degree, in psychology). Music, meanwhile, was her birthright — after all, she was the daughter of Nat King Cole, one of the most beloved singers of the 20th century. Growing up in the exclusive Hancock Park section of Los Angeles, she could wander into the living room and find the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra gathered round the family piano. Now that she had a big hit of her own, fame was proving to be a stronger stimulant. She kicked heroin, married one of her producers, had a son, had more hits, appeared on “The Tonight Show.”</p>

  <p>Across the length of 2016, the photographer Mitch Epstein — known for making careful large-format images that draw rich meaning out of places and objects — arranged to visit the living and working spaces of some of the monumental figures we lost this year. The goal was to arrive not long after each person’s death, in those days when a person’s spirit can still seem palpable somewhere among their rooms and their things — as in his photograph of the writer Jim Harrison’s studio, where the items on a bedside table seem as if they were set down only moments ago.</p>

  <p><strong>One day in</strong> the summer of 1953, Josephine Couch went with her boyfriend, Salvatore Del Deo, on an overnight trip to the dunes outside Provincetown. They’d been invited by a friend, a former chorus girl who went by Frenchie Chanel, to stay with her at her tar-paper shack by the water. That day, amid the compass grass and rose hips, Josephine, 27, felt the rest of the world vanish: Birds cried, but the white noise of surf and wind enforced a hush. At night, the moonlight caused the dunes to glow. Josephine fell asleep in the arms of Salvatore, whom she married that fall, to the cooing of a dove.</p>

  <p><strong>She was lucky</strong>, she believed, to be taught by “Harvard’s great men.” At 17, Ruth Hoffman was freshly enrolled at Radcliffe, the women’s college affiliated with Harvard, and keen on studying biochemistry. It was 1941. The two institutions had separate campuses but shared a faculty. Harvard professors lectured their male students and were then obliged to repeat it all to the smaller, all-female classes at Radcliffe. That teaching women was a chore, even an insult, was something Hoffman read on their faces. Her professors did little, she felt, to hide their disdain.</p>

  <p><strong> On the second</strong> day of the first Circle of Mothers retreat, in 2014, Afeni Shakur approached the stage to speak to the assembled crowd. Some days, it felt as if America was brimming with grieving mothers, so the event’s founder, Sybrina Fulton, wanted to gather many of them together in the hope that they could help one another move forward. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was shot and killed two years earlier. Shakur’s son, the rapper Tupac Shakur, had been dead for almost 20 years.</p>

  <p><strong>Carnival proprietors taking</strong> drugs and poisons to intentionally breed baby freaks: That’s the unvarnished core of Katherine Dunn’s third novel, 1989’s “Geek Love.” The Binewski Carnival Fabulon needs a boost, and Aloysius and Crystal Lil Binewski hatch this twisted plan to turn things around. Lil births a boy with flippers, beautiful Siamese-twin sisters joined at the waist, an albino dwarf hunchback and a boy with telekinetic powers. It hardly sounds like a universal cipher, the kind of humanist tale that attracts readers over time. Yet somehow this strange, singular book has spent the 27 years since its publication doing just that, speaking clear and true to a certain kind of reader.</p>

  <p><strong>On the 7:02 a.m.</strong> commuter train from Fairfield, Conn., to Manhattan, a woman with scarlet lipstick and chestnut hair slid beside a businessman reading his newspaper. “May I ask you a question?” she said. “What do you think about breast-feeding?” This was the mid-1950s. The woman was Dana Raphael, an anthropologist, a protégée of Margaret Mead and an outspoken feminist who, a decade before Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique,” refused to take her husband’s name and shunned the conventional wedding her mother planned. She initially also had no intention of following the de rigueur practice of bottle feeding. But after she tried but mostly failed to nurse her firstborn son, she began an anthropological quest that would end up spanning decades: Why was breast-feeding more successful in some cultures than in others?</p>

  <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here’s a story about Muhammad Ali that might have been lost to history, disappearing among all the other Ali esoterica, but for The Los Angeles Times photographer Boris Yaro. On Monday, Jan. 19, 1981, Yaro heard reports of a suicidal jumper on the radio. His editor wasn’t interested, but Yaro drove over to Los Angeles’s Miracle Mile regardless, where he found a young black man in flared jeans and a hoodie, perched on an office-building fire escape nine floors above.</p>

  <p><strong>Role models often</strong> appear with a thunderclap, a bright flash on a dark horizon, but can feel remote and evaporate just as quickly. Gwen Ifill was different. I didn’t know her, but I did get to know her influence, how it entered the lives of my students, especially girls and young women of color, whom I taught in Newark, N.J. For those like Jephtane Sophie Sabin and Isabel Evans, who watched Ifill on PBS over many years and eventually had the opportunity to meet her, Ifill created a warm and welcoming climate in which their aspirations had the chance to take root. Her impact wasn’t instant but played out slowly over time, like the rain of a wet season.</p>

  <p><strong>Jacques Rivette’s</strong> “Out 1” — a 12-hour film, completed in 1971 and all but impossible to see in its entirety until very recently — begins with an extended sequence that combines artlessness and high artifice. The members of an experimental theater troupe (one of two such entities in the film) participate in an exercise that consists of writhing and squirming on the floor while wordlessly moaning and keening. It’s the primordial soup from which the film’s elaborate and elusive narrative will evolve, a reminder that every story begins in chaos and noise. Cinema, like other art forms, imposes a capricious kind of order on the mess of human experience, and “Out 1” illustrates this principle with a characteristically Rivetteian blend of intellectual rigor and anarchic whimsy.</p>

  <p><strong>For nearly 20</strong> years, Coca Crystal’s weekly public-access show began with her smoking a joint. The show’s title was a scrap of messy poetry, as unwieldy as the program itself: “If I Can’t Dance, You Can Keep Your Revolution.” It was a no-fi interview show featuring scribbled title cards and minor downtown celebrities; regular guests included a singing dog and a disheveled poet who recited his work in a tapioca-thick mumble. She dedicated one episode to “the second anniversary of the first nonstop balloon crossing of North America.” The show isn’t easy to characterize, but Crystal probably described it best: “an hour of talk, telephone and technical failure.” Every episode ended with her dancing to groovy music — a little shoulder sway, some finger snaps.</p>

  <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring a Final Four basketball game against the University of North Carolina, on April 1, 2007, Pat Summitt, the coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team, found her team down by 12 points with 8:18 to go. She was fuming — her gold rings were dented from being banged on the parquet floor. Summitt was a screamer. She loved to win. Over 38 years at Tennessee, she won 1,098 games — more than any other coach in N.C.A.A. Division 1 history. She also understood winning as a far more potent and radical act than even the most rabid male football fans would understand while pounding their painted chests.</p>

Orange groves at dusk, sky full of pastel color, and Janet Reno is driving the car, a rental. It’s 2002, Reno is running for governor of Florida, and I’ve spent days riding shotgun with her, reporting for this magazine, accompanying her to various campaign events — most of them populated by older women, bright and warm women with structures of freshly coifed hair, who fawn over Janet Reno, who knew her mother, an investigative reporter for The Miami News. To them, Janet Reno is the daughter who left Florida to fix America, serving eight controversial years as attorney general under Bill Clinton, and has now returned to fix the Sunshine State.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Just “Janet” to the women — and “Janny,” the oldest of four siblings, to her family — she is leading in the polls of the Democratic primary, up at one point by almost 30 points. Her unusual, grass-roots campaign has been dubbed “The Little Red Pickup-Truck Tour,” for the fact that she has mostly crisscrossed the state alone in her Ford Ranger. She seems to have no advisers, no pollsters, no bodyguards, no team or entourage to speak of.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>During her tumultuous <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/us/janet-reno-dead.html?_r=0\">tenure as attorney general</a>, the decisions came in a furious rush: Reno oversaw a 51-day standoff with Branch Davidians in Waco, Tex., and authorized the F.B.I. to storm the compound, resulting in the deaths of more than 70 people. She ordered the forced seizure of Elián González, which led to the famous image of a federal agent pointing his automatic weapon at the screaming 6-year-old Cuban boy. She assigned a special prosecutor to lead an investigation of Whitewater — a criminal inquiry eventually overtaken by Kenneth Starr, whose expanded powers resulted in the revelation of Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. And she successfully prosecuted the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, as well as the Oklahoma bombers, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. As Reno became the face of each new upheaval, The Washington Post called her “arguably the most powerful appointed woman in American politics,” adding, “She is doubtless the best-known attorney general since Robert F. Kennedy.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004830599\", \"dropzone\":3, \"pNum\":3]} --><p>In Florida now, it’s just Janet, citizen/adventurer/candidate, getting gas, shambling in for a chocolate bar. She materializes out of thin air at white picnics and black churches, Hispanic parades and shopping malls where everyone mixes, all 6-feet-1 of her tumbling into the sun in her thick-lensed glasses and mail-order, shoulder-padded dresses, speaking plainly, in a deliberate, almost dulling lingua, about the environment and education, hearkening backward to an Old Florida she would like to reclaim. “I’m not fancy,” she has said in the past. “I’m what I appear to be.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Back in Washington, many people disputed and opined about who she appeared to be. She was attacked as both a Clinton lackey and a Clinton enemy, when in fact her only allegiance was to the law. She was desexualized and then re-sexualized as a man in drag, a lesbian, a freak — or as her sister, Maggy, once put it, into “a large person with boots on.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>Here’s how she really appears in the lightly freckled flesh, though, among people who know her best: She is curious and open; whip-smart and a little war-weary; afflicted with the tremors of Parkinson’s, not defined by them. She announced that she had the disease during her term as attorney general, and after her medication kept her up at night, decided to cut the dosage. A colleague, wondering aloud about how she might appear to the public, said that she replied, “So I’ll be an old lady who shakes.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004829050\", \"dropzone\":6, \"pNum\":6]} --><p>For all her years of tough talk at Justice, you can’t help being struck most by a certain strain of gentleness in her, how she talks lovingly about her deceased mother, about the wonderful old pinto pony named Tony she had when she was a kid growing up in the cypress bungalow, under the gumbo limbo trees, of what was then rural Miami. In her are the echoes of Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking, people of the frontier, who yearned for it. When her silverware clicks against the plate and she’s asked about her disease, she says that she knows how it will end, with the loss of her ability to speak and people feeding her, but until she’s incapacitated, she intends to keep living life as fully as possible, visiting friends and family, road tripping and kayaking.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>On we drive, then, through grove land and orchards, headed to her sister Maggy’s, for a good dinner and a day off on the coast, when something unexpected occurs: Strobe lights flash from behind, a siren whoops once. Until now, Janet Reno has been happily telling stories, about the old family dynasties that rule Central Florida. But with the sound of the siren, her expression turns glum. The color drains from her face, and by the time the trooper opens his door and approaches in clipped strides to the driver’s-side window, she seems about to hyperventilate. He doesn’t make eye contact to say hello or ask a question. He just holds out his hand, grunts, “License and registration.” Janet Reno, in turn, dutifully fumbles for both. It’s possible she has never been on the wrong side of the law. Ever. And now she has been caught, by this eager beaver, maybe 10 miles over the speed limit.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>When he goes back to his cruiser, we sit for an interminable moment in silence, except for when she sighs and says, “Oh, well.” When the trooper returns, it’s as if he has been injected with the fluorescent serum of polite friendliness. “Ms. Reno,” he says, deferentially, looking straight in her eyes. “I didn’t realize it was you. I, I. ... It’s a pleasure to meet you out here.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834496\", \"dropzone\":9, \"pNum\":9]} --><p>“I know I was speeding,” says the former attorney general. “I don’t have an excuse.”</p><p>“I’m only giving you a warning today — ”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":11} --><p>“No,” she insists. “Please treat me like anyone else.”</p><p>“Anyone else would get a warning, too,” he says, though that seems likely false. “I want to thank you for your service.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":13} --><p>Janet Reno thanks him for <em>his</em> service. “I just need you to be careful out here,” he says, then he waits obligingly, with a tip of his cap, as we pull from the shoulder, to the clicking sound of stone under the wheels. Janet Reno never lets the speedometer’s needle climb above 55, all the way to Maggy’s, where there’s food and a familiar bed. “He probably should have given me that ticket,” she tells her sister later.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":14} --><p>The next day, she shows me how to roll a kayak. She will eventually lose the primary by less than 5,000 votes when the Democratic establishment, deciding that she’s aloof and convinced that her controversial time in Washington has made her unelectable, throws its support behind her challenger. Over the next 14 years of being a Floridian, she will ultimately be relegated to a wheelchair and succumb to the disease, surrounded by loved ones at the end. But on this bright day, we boat the St. Lucie inlet, to snorkel. She applies sunscreen to her fair skin. In her bathing suit, she smiles unabashedly and dives in, leaving a tiny splash. Among the coral and teeming aquatic life, she flutters her large feet and floats in unseen currents, borne forward, almost without trying. Her power, I realize, is this easy oneness with a higher law. And that’s how I’ll choose to imagine her at the end, unspeaking but wholly aware, gracefully slipping through.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":15} --><p><em>Michael Paterniti is a contributing writer for the magazine and a GQ correspondent.

A wetsuit-clad Navy swimmer is helping him out of the access hatch and into an inflatable raft. Mitchell, dressed in an olive-drab flight suit and a biological mask, steadies himself with his left hand on the door frame. He is 40, with the receding hairline and blandly gentle affect of a family dentist. It is Feb. 9, 1971, and he has just had an epiphany.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>It happened on the flight back from the moon, where Mitchell and his colleague Alan Shepard had traversed the Fra Mauro region and trekked to the Cone Crater to gather geological samples that, it was hoped, might reveal something of the moon’s inner structure. As the Kitty Hawk command module hurtled homeward, Mitchell watched the earth, moon and sun passing by the window of the rotating capsule in two-minute intervals. Looking out into space, Mitchell later recalled, “I realized that the molecules of my body and the molecules of the spacecraft had been manufactured in an ancient generation of stars.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Mitchell was a naval aviator whose doctoral dissertation, from M.I.T., was on guidance systems in low-thrust interplanetary vehicles. Nothing in his training had equipped him for a sudden discovery of the oneness of all things. “It was a subjective visceral experience accompanied by ecstasy,” he would later tell a yoga magazine.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>In the Apollo years, NASA sent military test pilots into space, not poets or preachers; they came back in possession of extraordinary knowledge that, by dint of personality or professional inclination, they seemed helpless to communicate. As the Gemini and Apollo astronaut Michael Collins once put it, “It was not within our ken to share emotions or to utter extraneous information.” Asked what it was like to go to the moon, Apollo 12’s Pete Conrad replied: “Super! Really enjoyed it!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>But then there was Mitchell. After returning to Earth, he left NASA, grew a beard and divorced his wife. He founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences, which advocated exploring the universe by means of inquiry that lay outside of science and religion. He sought out South American shamans and Haitian Vodou priests, promoted the benefits of Tibetan Buddhist lucid dreaming, visited the homes of people who claimed their children could bend spoons with their minds. He went on Jack Paar’s talk show with the self-proclaimed psychic Uri Geller. Two more marriages came and went. He got deep, very deep, into theories about extraterrestrials. He had a posthumous cameo in the cache of John Podesta’s hacked emails that WikiLeaks published this year, which included messages Mitchell sent to Podesta (a U.F.O. buff) asking him to discuss the possibility of disclosing the federal government’s records of alien contact. He signed the emails “6th man to walk on the Moon.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834553\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>If he got weird sometimes — O.K., a lot of times — could you really blame him? Few people had a closer view than Mitchell of the staggering velocity of the 20th century. He spent his early years on a West Texas farm with horse-drawn plows, watched a mushroom cloud bloom over a Marshall Islands atoll as a young Navy pilot and temporarily escaped his home planet before his 41st birthday. “I have wondered if we are prepared for our own survival,” he wrote late in life. The only way for humans to gain some control of the species’ mad trajectory, he believed, was “by questioning many fundamental assumptions underlying civilization.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Mitchell was the last surviving member of his mission. The seven living Apollo astronauts who stood on the lunar surface are all in their 80s now; within a decade, probably, the experience of walking on the moon will be as alien to the living as the experience of fighting in the Peloponnesian War. The American flags Mitchell and the others planted there are most likely faded to white now, after years of unimpeded solar radiation, gnomic banners of no particular nation.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Americans, and especially American politicians, tend to consider this an indictment of the national character, the final departure from the moon in 1972 the beginning of a slow retreat from destiny. But Mitchell believed his odyssey was beyond “the capricious political whim of a technological civilization.” When he first stepped onto the moon, “that pristine bone-white world,” he was overcome with a sensation of belonging. “The stillness,” he wrote, “seemed to convey that the landscape itself had been patiently awaiting our arrival for millions of years.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><em>Charles Homans is the politics editor for the magazine.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-edgar-mitchell","promotional_media":100000004827770,"module_top":100000004827770,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004834553":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820506":{"data_id":100000004820506,"print_headline":"Miss Cleo","headline":"Miss Cleo Went From Joke to Legend","summary":"Late at night, she offered advice to the anxious and the lovelorn.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1962</p>","byline":"By JENNA WORTHAM","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Jenna Wortham"],"kicker":"They Lives They Lived","body":"<p><strong>You had to</strong> have a little bit of patience and a lot of luck to catch Miss Cleo. She appeared on TV only late at night, after the second round of reruns and right before the white fuzz took over the screen. Miss Cleo was usually sitting at a table, draped in a glorious amount of fabrics, a stack of tarot cards in front of her, candles and incense burning behind her. “You have questions, I have the answers,” she would intone knowingly in her Jamaican patois, before singing out the words that would become her signature catchphrase: “Call me now!”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Miss Cleo was the star of a hotline company called the Psychic Readers Network, which people called for relationship advice, lottery numbers or answers to questions about their future. She quickly found loyal fans. She came to prominence in the late 1990s, a time marked by high camp and an abundance of deliciously trashy daytime talk-show hosts like Ricki Lake and Maury Povich. Everyone on TV back then was low on ethics and high on entertainment. Her infomercials were a cross between a theater production and a scripted reality show, a telethon for people suffering from heartbreak and in desperate need of wisdom. People phoned in for Miss Cleo’s special brand of real talk. She lectured people about new loves (“The ex is much better than the present one, you know?”) and cautioned against overtly pessimistic outlooks (“Don’t make me take you to church, young man”). She once untangled a paternity crisis by describing the shape of the baby’s chin. In the now-unimaginable era before on-demand everything, she was often the only thing worth watching after midnight.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Born in Los Angeles, Youree Dell Harris loved being in character. Before her career as a television psychic, according to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Harris produced and starred in several plays in the city. Several former castmates described her as brilliant and talented, but also deceptive: Harris, they said, once skipped town after producing a show without properly paying her cast and crew. In 1997, she met Steven Feder and Peter Stolz, the Fort Lauderdale cousins behind the phone psychic company, and agreed to represent their business as Miss Cleo, a mystic shaman born in Jamaica. In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against the Psychic Readers Network, for engaging in “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” The company was forced to forgive $500 million in outstanding customer debts and pay a $5 million fine. Not long after, Harris parted ways from Feder and Stolz. The disintegration of their partnership also dissolved Miss Cleo. The Psychic Readers Network created the Cleo character, and they controlled how she could use it.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834559\", \"dropzone\":3, \"pNum\":3]} --><p>Not that Harris wanted to keep up the ruse. People saw her as a thief and a con artist. She later admitted she never expected people to take the commercials seriously. “If the truth was there, in black and white,” she said, wiping away tears in a 2014 documentary called “Hotline,” “surely people would have sense. But that’s not the way it goes.” Although she confessed that she wasn’t a psychic, she insisted she had studied under a female high priestess in Voodoo for 30 years. But by the time of the documentary, she was already well into the new phase of her identity. In 2006, she came out as a lesbian in an interview with The Advocate. She was raising two daughters from previous relationships and officiating at weddings and performing cleansings on houses. She wrote a spiritual guidebook, and she even had a podcast.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>The media business dynamics that made Miss Cleo a household name no longer exist. Miss Cleo has no heirs, just pixelated relics on YouTube. Her closest kin is a B-celeb-sponsored post on Instagram, but flat-tummy tea doesn’t have the same charm. Miss Cleo may have started off as a joke, but her character grew into a legend. She voiced a character in “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City” and was referenced in skits by Dave Chappelle and on Mad TV. She was briefly a spokeswoman for Benefit Cosmetics. She predated the Kardashians in understanding the importance of a personal brand, and the power of a platform.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>Before <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/business/media/tv-psychic-miss-cleo-dies.html\">she died of colon cancer</a>, she told an interviewer that she had finally found her community, a tribe of people who understood her and treated her as an elder and an adviser. Harris retired Miss Cleo, but dispensing guidance and advice was always second nature to her. “If you sit down at my table,” she told <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2006/09/25/miss-cleo-comes-out\">The Advocate</a>, “you have to take away a lesson and not just learn what is going to happen tomorrow.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p><em>Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine. </em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-miss-cleo","promotional_media":100000004827318,"module_top":100000004827318,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004834559":"embedded"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820508":{"data_id":100000004820508,"print_headline":"David Bowie","headline":"David Bowie in Eternity","summary":"Extracts from an endless list of reasons to appreciate an endlessly restless artist.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1947</p>","byline":"By COLSON WHITEHEAD","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Colson Whitehead"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p>... and it is a collaboration that makes me additionally thankful for this splendid enigma: What did you and Eno chat about in between takes?

Who can forget that time in seventh grade when you inspired my sister to an act of true altruism after I came home with a heavy-metal mixtape a buddy had made me. She barged into my room, said, “What is this crap?” and lent me corrective vinyl: Gang of Four’s “Songs of the Free,” the Clash’s “London Calling” and “Changesonebowie.” An intervention, really. A good chunk of my personality was born that day, Bowie unlocking punk and then post-punk, what we used to call “college radio” and everything that came out of it. Or maybe it wasn’t altruistic, as it saved her from hearing a lot of metal, until in the fullness of time we decided that metal was cool, too, and gave Lemmy his props.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p><strong>766.</strong> Grateful, too, for “The Hunger.” You and Catherine Deneuve as a dissipated swinger vampire couple, picking up club kids and draining their blood while the director, Tony Scott, intercuts footage of Bauhaus performing “Bela Lugosi’s Dead.” All those names in one sentence, adding up to a single entity: Skinemax.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p><strong>767.</strong> And thanks for your weird ubiquity, scattered in other people’s songs, like clues to a ’70s mystery without solution. George Clinton shouts you out in Parliament’s “P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up).” Take the “Trans-Europe Express” Kraftwerk promises, and “you’ll meet Iggy Pop and David Bowie.” As if you were not a person but a destination.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p><strong>768.</strong> And for so many different records that after decades of listening there are still songs waiting to be appreciated in the way they deserve to be appreciated.

I love you, and I couldn’t lie to you.” Soon, he made his way to the fire escape, put an arm around Joe and guided him inside. The two walked out of the building together, got in Ali’s car and drove, after a stop at a police station, to a nearby V.A. hospital.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004825569\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>The day Ali saved Joe’s life, he had already begun to crumble. He was five years removed from “The Thrilla in Manila,” the fight against Joe Frazier that many believe irrevocably destroyed something inside him. Back in October, he fought his friend and former sparring partner Larry Holmes, who gave him a beat down so vicious that Ali didn’t come out for the 11th round; afterward, Holmes was reduced to tears. In three short years, Parkinson’s would be diagnosed. But as Robert Lipsyte — a former Times reporter who has spent much of his life chronicling Ali’s — remembers it, Ali was still “the most beautiful creature on the planet.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Ali spent three and a half years of his athletic prime stripped of his boxing license for protesting the very war that haunted Joe. Perhaps he felt a kinship with the vet. Or perhaps it was something else. One of the main things Lipsyte remembers about Ali was “the narcissism, the wanting to be loved, the need for constant attention.” What kind of guy gets in his car and drives toward a potential suicide, to save the life of a man he has never met?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>The answer, of course, is a guy who thinks himself a hero. The one constant in Ali’s life — from the 12-year-old boxer passing out fliers for his own fights to the man who withdrew from public life as Parkinson’s took hold — was his unyielding, nigh-oblivious self-belief. It was there in 1964, when a 22-year-old named Cassius Clay called himself “The Greatest” before his championship bout against Sonny Liston, and it was still there when he was ultimately dismantled by Holmes. It wasn’t just that his confidence informed his speed, skill, wit and beauty. It was that his confidence made him a beacon. People in need of strength could affix to him whatever symbolism they needed: black pride, the strength of protest, the senselessness of war. In turn, Ali could energize them.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>The ledge story wasn’t quite as simple as it appeared. The police reported that Joe was “badly disturbed,” and later in the week, The Los Angeles Times published a follow-up: Joe, it turned out, was only 21, too young to have served in Vietnam. On Wednesday, Jan. 21, at a news conference for a beverage company, Ali announced that he was going to buy Joe clothes and travel with him to his home state, Michigan, though it’s unclear if they ever made the trip. Ali’s narcissism, as Lipsyte remembers it, was only one part of why he would try to talk a man off a ledge. “The other part was he was capable of acts of kindness; almost casual acts of kindness,” Lipsyte said. In other words, Ali showed up to the office building not only because he thought he <em>could</em> help Joe, but because he <em>wanted</em> to. “In some sort of ways, he talked a lot of people off the ledge,” Lipsyte says. “I think about a guy who made people brave.

To be an 8-year-old white boy in a beige-carpeted basement in southern Indiana and have “1999” come on at the end of 1982 was ... there was no going back from it. It offered lots of lessons, first and foremost how to deal psychologically with the threat of existential annihilation. You may recall that 1983 was the year of the made-for-TV nuclear-holocaust movies: “The Day After” and, most disturbing of all, “Testament.” I slept less that year than in any year until my 20s. We were all going to die, and die horribly — I didn’t know much, but I knew that. No one was telling me how to deal with this. My mom tried. She told me about the Cuban missile crisis, in a “we’ve been here before” sort of way. But now came Prince. He sang what continues to be one of the most wonderful lyrical openings to a pop song: “I was dreaming when I wrote this./Forgive me if it goes astray.” Then he told me what you do in the face of certain and total destruction. The advice has held up. <em>Live</em>.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>There’s a temptation to try a thing about “the meaning of Prince,” i.e., one of those half-true, crypto-competitive think pieces we tend to trot out (we including I) at times like this. When an artist you love disappears, everyone else’s ideas about that person can seem grotesque and stupid, and even if right, right for the wrong reasons. I’m having it happen right now with all the essays on Dylan’s Nobel. How dare you talk about Bob! Partly it’s the narcissism of minor difference, but partly it’s the simple inadequacy of language. You know that old line, that writing about music is like dancing about architecture? (So is <em>writing</em>.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>One thing that seems maybe worth saying is to note how all the writing on Prince so far has paid such scant attention to his deepest and most important gift, his feel for pop melody. We often do this, for some reason, in talking about pop singers, almost as if the gift were shameful. But it’s like discussing Olympic runners without mentioning their speed. Everything else that made Prince special — style, virtuosity, movement, guts, beauty — all of it could be removed piece by piece like body parts in a game of Operation, and there would still be Prince on the table. But if the man had not been able to write a song like “When You Were Mine” or “Raspberry Beret” (by write it, I mean put the notes and vowels in an order that made them hard to forget), we would never have heard of him. Because he could, though, we have, and people will, for hundreds of years.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>The only thing I’ll risk adding to what will no doubt soon become a library shelf of Prince biographies and appreciations has to do with the man’s name, Prince Rogers Nelson. It interests me. Years ago I wrote an essay about Michael Jackson and learned that the name “Prince” — which Michael bestowed on his sons, in a gesture that most of the world quite reasonably took to be ostentatious and silly — had in fact been in Michael’s family for hundreds of years, and was a name first given to one of his slave ancestors in the South. Could this also be the case with Prince? That is, after all, his real name. The birth certificate says Prince Rogers Nelson (the clerk wrote Prince Roger Nelson, a mistake). But it turns out that neither the name Prince nor that of Rogers had been used by Prince’s family in living memory. The reality of where he got them was way weirder.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004825719\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>First, there is the immediate derivation, one most Prince freaks know about: In the ’50s, his father, John, formed an experimental jazz band called the Prince Rogers Trio. At one point, they were called simply Prince Rogers (“prince rogers,” read the business cards, “a whole new concept in music”). They played in restaurants and supper clubs. They never “went anywhere.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>The question becomes, Where did Prince Rogers get “Prince Rogers”? Where did Prince’s father pick it up? Was there a real human being called Prince Rogers, a person whose name would have been known to the band and family? There was.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>The first Prince Rogers’s real first name wasn’t Prince, though. It was Douglas. He was born Douglas T. Rogers. I don’t know where he got the name Rogers. I can’t find his father. His mother was Jettie Layton. He grew up in Decatur, Ill., and left while still in high school to join the Navy. When he moved to Chicago, he intended to pursue premedical studies at DePaul. But something fateful happened, and he fell into the circle of an infamous spiritual figure known as Prophet Jones.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>In the world of midcentury black Christianity, Prophet Jones was a figure equally loved and reviled. He had once been a man named James F. Jones in Birmingham, Ala. Down there he got mixed up in a church called Triumph the Holy Righteous Church, one of the countless splinter sects that emerged from the black evangelical revivals of 1890–1910, a kind of third Great Awakening in American history. In the 1930s, he went to Detroit as a missionary, and there he received his call. He could boast of hundreds and at times thousands of followers, black and white. The Detroit Free Press covered his doings extensively. Life magazine <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2UEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">published a profile</a> of him at one point; The Saturday Evening Post called him the “Messiah in Mink.” He conducted services from a kind of throne. Next to his throne was an empty chair for his dead mother. He claimed to be a real prophet: God spoke to him, showed him the future. He predicted that Eisenhower would win, and when this came to pass, Ike invited him to the inauguration, which made for excellent P.R. for the prophet.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>Douglas T. Rogers became his right-hand man, or some combination of that and a body man. Never had the terms been more appropriate: Among the pictures of Prophet Jones, a startling number of them show Rogers, too. In the prophet’s organization, high-ranking figures were called princes and princesses. So Douglas Rogers became Prince Rogers, and people forgot he had ever been called Douglas.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p>It gets intriguing, in that Prophet Jones was most probably gay (a woman who knew him in his early days described him as a member of the “third sex”), and so, it appears, was Prince Rogers. Presumably they were lovers at first, after which it mellowed into a long partnership. The prophet’s scene was: lots of young men around, all the time, doing as the prophet wished. The prophet lived in a “French castle” with 54 rooms. He wore silk robes and an earring and a woman’s diamond bracelet and kept his hair long and wavy in back. At one point he was busted on “gross indecency” charges. The city’s Vice Bureau had sent in a spy, a handsome young man. The prophet, they claimed, had made “immoral advances.” When they threw Jones into his cell, he asked for two people: his lawyer and Prince Rogers.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004825777\", \"dropzone\":11, \"pNum\":11]} --><p>Another time a would-be assassin broke into the castle. Prince Rogers, the church later claimed, had helped to thwart this attempt on the prophet’s life. According to the newspaper, however, he ran the opposite direction and fainted. “That’s all right,” said the prophet. “He’s just unconscious. It’s just the spirit of God.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":12, \"pNum\":12} --><p>The prophet’s fame outside Detroit rested primarily on his radio show. His program, broadcast across multiple states, aired on Sundays. It seems safe to say his sermons were entertaining. It was said “to sound like a rock ’n’ roll concert.” Little Richard, in an interview with John Waters, owned the prophet as an early influence.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":13, \"pNum\":13} --><p>It would have been via this show, either closely listened to or casually overheard in the home of one John L. Nelson, that the name Prince Rogers entered the story of Prince Rogers Nelson, and the story of Prince. The prophet often mentioned his beloved prince in those Sunday transmissions. Strange evidence exists, in a 1954 issue of Jet, that Prince Rogers had become a known figure in Northern black culture: A handsome grifter in Chicago had tried to buy a fancy camera with a bogus check, and he claimed to be Prince Rogers, “secretary to the fabulous prophet.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":14, \"pNum\":14} --><p>I don’t know what it all means. Certainly there seems to be some ... appropriateness ... in the idea that a sexually ambiguous black man known for displays of spiritual ostentation played some role in our hero’s evolution. Prince’s music and his theology, his musical theology, drew from so many of the same depths: eroticism and religion, physical purity and material display. But was there any real influence? We’d need to know first whether Prince’s father or any of the other band members ever got into Prophet Jones, or if the prophet’s message somehow played into the mission of the Prince Rogers Trio. Maybe they just thought it sounded good. We’d need to know whether Prince, as a boy, ever heard of the earlier Prince Rogers and his “fabulous” prophet. These things may be not merely unknown by now but unknowable. As for Prince, all we know is he has transitioned.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":15, \"pNum\":15} --><p>Prophet Jones died in 1971, but the first Prince Rogers seems to have lived on, in Los Angeles, into the ’80s.

Eventually that same artwork became his most famous tract, published in 1964: “This Was Your Life!” In it, a man holding a drink drops dead, and an angel whisks him to a celestial drive-in theater, where scenes from his past play before him: that time he told a dirty story, ogled a young woman (“ummm NICE!”), wondered about the score of a ballgame while in church. His sins are tallied, and his name is not found in the Book of Life; he is damned.

They are classic forms of effective, quick-strike storytelling, every illustrated panel propelling the reader to the next, as dramatic tension builds: Just how far will the author go in rendering the wrath and mercy of God? In “Gun Slinger,” an Old West killer for hire goes to heaven after turning to Christ just before he’s hanged, while the marshal who captured him goes to hell for never having done the same.

The resulting controversy, still smoldering today, seemed irresolvable: Depending on whom you asked, the hunt was either sadistic blood sport or noble tradition. Two sociologists, Dave Harker and Diane C. Bates, scrutinized 10 years of clashing regional newspaper editorials and letters to the editor and concluded that the two sides did not even seem to be arguing about the same animal. Actual bears had been replaced by “competing social constructions” of bears. Those in favor of the hunt imagined the animals as “menacing threats” that needed to be controlled; those against saw them as docile and benevolent creatures that just wanted to “live in peace.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Each construction of the bear was then girded by the construction of subsequent constructions; the meaning-making escalated quickly. Voices opposing the hunt dismissed hunters as “uncivilized killers incapable of reason and unworthy of respect,” while hunters dismissed opponents as “panicky” suburbanites and “anthro-antagonistic wackos of the PETA-Qaeda cult.” With each side delegitimizing the other, actual dialogue seemed impossible. And everyone delegitimized the government, with each side believing that the state couldn’t be trusted to make a fair decision about the hunt because it was corrupted by the other. The entire episode, the sociologists wrote, “highlights how public discourse has fed intractability over the conflict rather than provided common grounds for consensus.” Bears are huge, immovable objects, made of bone and meat. And yet here they were, being swished around like ephemeral sock puppets on a plane of pure, post-truth subjectivity called New Jersey.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>So that was the backdrop. Now enter Pedals, shambling on two legs.</p><p>The black bear rose to fame in the summer of 2014, after a man in suburban Oak Ridge <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuJlsmTG2ik\">filmed him</a> toddling through the bulb end of a quiet cul-de-sac at dawn. Pedals, as he became known, appeared to be missing his right front paw, and his left front leg seemed warped and truncated — injury or deformity, only he knew. But he had apparently compensated for these disabilities by learning to walk upright, an image that produced both delight and terror. It all felt deeply weird. Especially because Pedals was good at walking. The camera tracked him as he moved in a sturdy lurch, covering a lot of ground, holding his dangling, unnecessary arms close to his chest like a mime absconding with a snatched purse. At one point, Pedals leaned over a garbage can, just to check out what was inside. Then he crossed a lawn and accelerated into a stand of trees. It was obvious where he was heading: internet fame.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":4} --><p>At first, many people refused to believe that the footage was real. But even those who did resorted to describing Pedals as looking like a human in a bear suit — which, on the skeletal level, is a fair description of what all bears are. His humanness was uncanny and made our animal-ness feel suddenly uncanny, too. After all, we were quadrupedal ourselves until three to six million years ago, when a few of us reared up and decided to stop moving dumbly in the direction of our digestive tracts. It was our earliest signature innovation. Now Pedals was innovating, too — crossing some sacrosanct threshold of verticality, blurring some line. They didn’t contextualize the video like this when they played it on “Good Morning America,” but if the walking bear unsettled you, I’m suggesting that this is why.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004833002\", \"dropzone\":4, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>More people saw Pedals. More videos surfaced. The question became: What should we do about him? Two local women, Sabrina Walsh Pugsley and Lisa Rose-Rublack, started an online petition asking the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to capture the bear and transport him to an orphaned wildlife center in upstate New York. By 2015, they had wrangled about 300,000 signatures from around the world, and they ultimately raised almost $25,000 to pay for the relocation. They ceremoniously delivered the petition to the State House and staged a small protest outside. Rose-Rublack worked in the world of domestic animal rescue — saving dogs, saving cats. It seemed obvious to her that a crippled black bear warranted the same compassionate intervention. There were reports of Pedals looking exhausted or frail. “We just wanted to take care of him,” Rose-Rublack says.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":6} --><p>State wildlife officials saw things differently. “The bipedal bear,” as they insisted on calling him, was not a victim but a survivor. Pedals was getting around, foraging, denning in winter — successfully executing all vital bear behaviors. They were hesitant to wrench an animal from the wild unnecessarily and warned that what might, through a certain anthropomorphic lens, feel like rescuing could actually be imprisonment. One wildlife expert, unaffiliated with the state but frequently called on by the press — a Pedals pundit — summed up the situation nicely: “We process things differently in the wildlife community,” she explained. She and her colleagues were looking at the exact same bear, feeling the exact same compassion. But, she said, they drew a different conclusion: “We don’t think he needs saving.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Every new Pedals sighting suggested that the state’s worldview best reflected the objective reality: He survived two winters; he was muddling through. When new footage of him appeared this June, wildlife officials noted that he even seemed to have put on some weight; they described him as “thriving.” But the wild card all along, of course, was New Jersey’s bear hunt. And on Oct. 10, it happened: A bow hunter in Morris County lugged Pedals’s body to a check station and weighed him in at 334 pounds. (Or what appeared to be Pedals’s body; the state won’t definitively identify any wild animal unless it has been tagged.)</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p>One photograph, released by the government, shows Pedals hanging from a scale with a bloodied maw — vertical again, but this time upside down. The Department of Environmental Protection would not release the hunter’s identity. (When rumors swirled around one man, he says he received death threats.) And so it was impossible to know the circumstances: whether the hunter knew the bear’s identity before he or she fired; whether Pedals, who did spend some time on all fours, had been distinguishable from an ordinary bear; whether he had been standing upright in the wilderness, looking preposterous and conspicuous, and conspicuously like himself. That is, the bear’s posture — the very proof of his resilience — might have marked him for death.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p>It was never clear what we owed Pedals, exactly. You could argue that allowing Pedals to live in the woods and be hunted, like any other bear, was an act of respect — a validation of his wildness. You could also argue that it was a gruesome lapse of human compassion.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>Pedals stood for something. We may never agree what it was.</p><p><em>Jon Mooallem is a writer at large for the magazine and the author of “Wild Ones.”</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-pedals-the-bear","promotional_media":100000004828118,"module_top":100000004828118,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004833002":"embedded"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820521":{"data_id":100000004820521,"print_headline":"William A.

Del Monte’s mother bundled him in a tablecloth and carried him out of the house and into the street, where her husband waited in a buckboard wagon. Amid San Francisco’s chaos — broken water and gas mains, shattered windows, twisted telegraph wires, six-foot chasms in the fissured earth — a horse began hauling the family from their North Beach neighborhood to the ferry terminal by the Embarcadero. Dawn was breaking. Small fires were beginning to burn. Houses, tipped diagonally, seemed on the verge of collapse. The city’s power was down, and its supplies of fresh water were mostly gone.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>In letters and archived observations of survivors, we can experience how it must have felt to be in the city in the hours after the temblor — the feeling of “drunkenness” that began at 5:12 a.m. with the earth moving to and fro for 45 to 60 seconds and then the unsteady ground trembling through the day with aftershocks. Other recollections capture the background noise of human desperation: armies of the dispossessed dragging heavy trunks over cobbled streets, <em>thunk thunk thunk</em>, in an effort to get out of the city before it was too late.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>When the Del Monte family arrived at the ferry building, they boarded a boat to Oakland, because no bridge spanned the bay yet (and none would be built for another 30 years). The family was lucky: As the owners of a summer farm, they could live outside the city while it recovered, rather than huddle in refugee camps. But first, they watched from afar for three consecutive days as San Francisco burned, the fires exceeding temperatures of 2,000 degrees. By the end, 508 city blocks were incinerated. According to some estimates, San Francisco didn’t fully recover from the damage for two decades.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>On the day of the quake, a fraternal organization known as the South Market Boys Club hung a wreath on Lotta Crabtree Fountain, a landmark that served as a meeting point for displaced San Franciscans. Since 1919, the disaster has been commemorated at this spot, becoming an annual ceremony — always on April 18, always at 5:12 a.m. — with a splash of flamboyance. Politicians sport bowlers and fake handlebar mustaches; aging survivors wear vintage fire hats. There is solemnity as well: a minute of silence for the 3,000 dead, along with warnings from fire officials that in California, a place that by nature looks ahead rather than behind, a tragedy like 1906 could easily happy again.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004833013\", \"dropzone\":4, \"pNum\":4]} --><p>One attendee at Lotta’s Fountain was Bill Del Monte, by all accounts a charming man who loved to play the stock market. He delighted in telling the story he heard from his parents about his escape at 3 months old. He was the disaster’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/us/william-del-monte-last-known-survivor-of-the-1906-san-francisco-earthquake-dies-at-109.html\">last-known living survivor</a>.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>A vast digital trove of photographs and letters relating to the quake is now safeguarded for posterity, thanks to the efforts of several California libraries and historical associations. Archives are what we create in lieu of actual human engagement, however. And when the final survivor of a natural disaster or human catastrophe disappears, the loss seems greater than what any diligent historian can preserve. The death of Del Monte therefore seems a proper moment to consider the value of living memory, as compared with archived memory — a chance to ask how the presence of actual survivors bolsters a resolve that what happened before should not happen again.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>It turned out that a number of good works and ideas came from those who lived through the disaster. One was that Bay Area city officials decided to build a more robust system of fire-pumping stations; another was that California eventually adopted building codes so that new construction could withstand another big jolt. The year 1906 also marked a significant expansion of seismological research in the United States, as scientists in the Bay Area began mapping the San Andreas fault nearby. The quake’s epicenter was pinpointed a few miles offshore, where accumulated stresses along the San Andreas unleashed seismic waves that traveled around the city at speeds of 6,300 to 8,300 miles per hour.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>We now know that dozens of active faults, some more stable than others, cut through Northern California. The United States Geological Survey recently put the risk of another major quake in the Bay Area over the next three decades at about 72 percent. And scientists say that a potentially far more dangerous fault line, the Cascadia subduction zone, just offshore Seattle, might erupt at any moment, releasing 30 times the energy that destroyed San Francisco.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Cities in the West will suffer again. The point of the gatherings at Lotta’s Fountain that Bill Del Monte so enthusiastically attended was not to displace scientific facts with memories.

Is it a gift for a famous man to name a son after himself or a curse? Ricci Martin said of his older brother, “The name alone puts you in that zone where you cannot hide.” It is impossible for any of us to know what our lives would have been, without our advantages and disadvantages, stripped of our names and given fresh starts.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":10} --><p>After his brother’s death, Ricci performed with Dean Paul’s old band before touring in a tribute show to his father.

Minutes before she heard her breakthrough hit, “This Will Be,” on the radio for the first time in 1975, she had scored a heroin fix and was tripping down 113th Street in Harlem. Drugs were a recent mainstay; she started using heavily in college, during the substance-fueled psychedelic era (she still managed to get her degree, in psychology). Music, meanwhile, was her birthright — after all, she was the daughter of Nat King Cole, one of the most beloved singers of the 20th century. Growing up in the exclusive Hancock Park section of Los Angeles, she could wander into the living room and find the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra gathered round the family piano. Now that she had a big hit of her own, fame was proving to be a stronger stimulant. She kicked heroin, married one of her producers, had a son, had more hits, appeared on “The Tonight Show.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>But as it turned out, almost every transcendent moment across her four-decade career would be somehow shadowed, asterisk-affixed. She was criticized as an Aretha Franklin sound-alike who wasn’t Aretha Franklin. Or, she was already passé, a soul singer when the genre was being eclipsed by disco. Or, she was cashing in on her father’s legacy, still just the “daughter of.” And so her impressive early streak — three Grammys, six consecutive gold or platinum albums and the riches they brought in — ended up leading her right back to drugs, this time the L.A. cocaine culture. “It was like a damn dip for crackers,” she wrote in her memoir “Angel on My Shoulder.” By the time she escaped in the early ’80s, her years as “the base queen,” as she was known, had cost her not one but two recording contracts, her first marriage and almost her voice and son, who fell into a pool while she was on a binge and was rescued by a couple who worked for her. In her memoirs she claimed to have narrowly escaped death herself at least half a dozen times before she was 35.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>From that point, she stayed clean, but sobriety didn’t make her more risk-averse, at least in terms of her career. In 1991 she embarked on “Unforgettable ... With Love,” an album of songs her father had made famous, mostly in the 1940s and ’50s, with lush, period string and horn arrangements. Anchored by the “duet from the beyond” with him on the title track (he died in 1965), the very uncontemporary album was a way of both paying tribute to him and exorcising his ghost, and a surprise runaway success besides, eventually going seven-times-platinum and sweeping the Grammy Awards. But as had become customary for Cole, a backlash soon followed — how could this collection of ancient songs be best album in the year of Nirvana and N.W.A.? (Though those songs were no more ancient then than many still-ubiquitous Beatles, Dylan and Stones tracks are today.) Partly because of “Unforgettable ... With Love,” the Grammy voting rules were changed, essentially leading to the creation of a Grammy electoral college that reduced the influence of older voters. A particularly stinging rebuke, though, may have been a “Saturday Night Live” skit titled “Unforgivable,” in which Cole (Ellen Cleghorne) sings further spectral duets with the likes of Judy Garland (Mike Myers) and Mama Cass (Chris Farley).</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Cole’s passing, announced on New Year’s Day, was just the beginning of a cascade of musical loss (even in death she was somewhat overshadowed), and yet as one giant after another departed, hers was still the music I craved most. As I scanned the titles in my collection, I was reminded how, whether she was singing R&amp;B, pop, jazz or standards, she left it all in the grooves: There was the joy bomb of “This Will Be”; the Bowie/“Fame”-like groove of “Sophisticated Lady,” only with sharper jabs and better footwork; the scatting whoosh of “Mr. Melody” and the sustained elegance of “The Very Thought of You.” A sassy hit cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “Pink Cadillac.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>But the album I reached for first was “Dangerous,” an obscure 1985 release and her first after she emerged from rehab. Reviewing the record for a local paper at the time, I youngly but not insincerely claimed that Cole was the best singer in pop music. “That’s a brave call,” said the editor, but he wasn’t buying it: 1985 was the year of Whitney rising and a period of reascendance for Aretha, Chaka, Patti, Tina. (The review never ran.) Listening to the album more than 30 years later, I could hear how, well, forgettable the tracks were, unworthy of the worst Brat Pack soundtrack. Yet I was still struck by how Cole could be a vocal shoehorn, able to slide meaningful phrases into even this synthy muck. She had to know the material was beneath her, yet she stared it down the way she stared down addiction, or everyone who said she was nothing more than a knockoff. Maybe I was on to something way back then.

He was a cartoon of aggression, nine parts Mr. T to one part Mike Tyson, with a comic-book character’s massive chest and steroidal ziggurat of shoulder and neck muscle, a refulgent Old Testament beard and dialogue consisting of mighty gold-toothed roars and tag lines on the order of “game over.” If his heart had not given out at age 42, he would have found a lasting home in professional wrestling and Hollywood, where the violence is pure mime.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Before Kevin Ferguson became Kimbo Slice — Kimbo was an old nickname; Slice derived from a gruesome cut he inflicted on Big D — he was a star linebacker at Miami Palmetto Senior High School and, after college football didn’t work out, drifted into work as a bouncer. While minding the door of a strip club one night, he ran into Mike (Icey) Imber, a high school friend who had become an entrepreneur in the growing online porn business. They hit upon the idea of matching Kimbo against local tough guys who had backers willing to bet on informal scraps. “The world we were in, it was easier to go for immediate satisfaction,” Imber says. “As a regular boxer, you have to start from the bottom, and it can take years to get up to 10 grand, if you ever do.

Drawn by the bigger money available in more legitimate fighting circles, he started training in Mixed Martial Arts, making his debut in the cage in 2007. Having become a headline attraction while still an M.M.A. novice, Kimbo soon moved on to six-figure paydays. He appeared on reality TV (“The Ulimate Fighter”) and in action movies (“Blood and Bone,” “The Scorpion King 3”) and played a prison lout named Bludge in Nickelodeon’s “Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh.” Mike Tyson, Shaquille O’Neal and various rappers professed admiration.

Seeing Kimbo’s beard sticking up when he charged in, a sign that his chin was not properly tucked, Petruzelli responded with practiced reflex, nailing the exposed chin with a concise right and then raining blows on Kimbo as he lay stunned on the canvas.

Each was pioneered by J.L. Moreno, Zerka’s husband and the founder of psychodrama, a form of therapy in which people act out their experiences and feelings in an effort to gain insight or achieve catharsis.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>J.L. called his method “Shakespearean psychiatry,” and he and Zerka had little doubt that it would save the world — if only the world would play along. Not only did psychodrama help people suffering from grave psychological problems, the couple believed, but it had the added benefit of building understanding and empathy, whether for a nagging spouse or a beggar on the street. “Put yourself into the place of a victim of injustice and share his hurt,” J.L. once suggested as the first rule of psychodrama. “Reverse roles with him.” Warring countries might also benefit from psychodrama, if only J.L. could get their leaders in the same room. During the Vietnam War, he unsuccessfully lobbied Bill Moyers, the White House press secretary, to let him direct Lyndon Johnson and Ho Chi Minh in a psychodrama of potential healing.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Though Zerka had never heard of psychodrama before emigrating from Europe in 1939 and meeting J.L. two years later, she threw herself into his life’s work. She helped him establish the Psychodramatic Institute in Beacon, N.Y., home to a motley crew suffering from everything from addiction to schizophrenia. Unlike most psychiatric hospitals, this one featured a large stage on which patients were expected to act out their issues. When leading a session, Zerka had little patience for excessive navel-gazing. “Too much talking; let’s get into action!” she would yell, certain that physically acting out a problem worked better than endlessly talking about it.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>There was little daylight between the couple’s professional and personal lives — they lived some 50 yards from their sanitarium — and they saw no compelling reason not to create what they considered “the first psychodramatic family.” (They wrote a book by that name.) In her memoirs, “To Dream Again,” Zerka insisted that her “goal was not to turn our child into a guinea pig or an experiment.” Instead, she hoped to make Jonathan’s life — and that of his much older stepsister, Regina, from J.L.’s previous marriage — “more colorful and interesting.” Zerka could imagine few fates worse than a humdrum existence.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Trying to see the world through her son’s eyes, Zerka would lie on her back next to 5-month-old Jonathan, gurgling along with him. His sounds, she wrote, “induced in me the most fantastic cosmic tales such as it has never been my pleasure to create sense. We exchanged opinions about how strange it was here, how peculiar these humans.” When Jonathan was 2, Zerka taught him the concept of role reversal. If he fought with a friend over a toy, Zerka had Jonathan play the part of his friend. The tiff usually ended promptly, and play resumed. “After all,” Zerka wrote, “each child was giving in to himself.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004833038\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Psychodramatic techniques also defused typical parent-child squabbles. One night at dinner, Jonathan, then 3, said he wasn’t hungry and refused to eat a meal Zerka had spent the afternoon cooking. They bickered until J.L. had heard enough. “This is ridiculous,” he said. “Zerka, get up, become Jonathan and take his seat, and Jonathan, you be Mommy and sit in her chair.” Playing his mother, Jonathan stretched his spine to make himself taller and looked down at Zerka, who had shrunk her body and lifted her feet off the floor to play the little boy. “Eat!” Jonathan commanded, doing his best overbearing-mother impression. Zerka, who had been grazing on food as she cooked and could relate to her son’s lack of appetite, said she wasn’t hungry. “So don’t eat,” Jonathan said with a smile.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>When they were older, Jonathan and Regina would wander over to the ostensibly off-limits sanitarium and hang out with patients. “My best friends were drug addicts and narcissists,” Jonathan, now a 64-year-old professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the country’s leading bioethicists, recalls. “I could have very easily been totally nuts, but people are amazed at how normal I am.” Though he rarely practices psychodrama with his own family (“I’m not inclined to be very dramatic, except in the classroom”), he suspects his upbringing taught him keen observation skills. “I’m also told my interpersonal skills are good, but it’s hard to know if that’s nature or nurture.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Regina, who is now 77 and teaches psychodrama in the Bay Area and in China, has little doubt that her unconventional childhood “made me more empathetic, more open-minded.” It also helped her work through teenage anxiety. “When I had a relationship problem, my dad had me talk to an empty chair,” she says. “I’d play myself and then switch and play the person I was in conflict with. It helped me work out my feelings.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>Zerka never stopped practicing or promoting psychodrama, even after the amputation of her right arm from cancer in 1958 and J.L.’s death in 1974. She wrote extensively and wasn’t one to mince words, especially when it came to Sigmund Freud. Zerka mocked his penis-envy theory, what she called his “military model of the family” and psychoanalysis itself, which she believed was insufficient to achieve catharsis. In her memoirs, she wrote of the time J.L. confronted Freud after a lecture. “You analyze people’s dreams,” J.L. told a surprised Freud. “In a way, you disillusion them.” By contrast, J.L. said, “I teach them to dream again.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>Until her death, Zerka trained therapists from her room in a retirement community and then a nursing home, where she liked to tell jokes.

For seven justices, the decision involved a simple constitutional question. They saw the law as an effort to force religious belief into the science curriculum, and they struck it down.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Justice Antonin Scalia <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/482/578#writing-USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZD\">dissented</a>. He saw the case as a question about certainty: What can we really know for sure?

He relished argument and debate, but when he had to grapple with scientific evidence, he was often wary. “In all my conversations and observations of him, I don’t remember him talking about science,” says Steven Calabresi, a law professor at Northwestern University who clerked for Scalia and considers him a second father. Scalia was the court’s indefatigable and irrepressible originalist, promising to interpret the Constitution based on its meaning when it was written. In his crowning achievement, the 2008 case <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html\">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, he used historical research to locate an individual right to bear arms in the 18th-century language of the Second Amendment. “History is a rock-solid science compared to moral philosophy,” Scalia said at the University of Virginia School of Law in 2010. In other words, he saw his project as stripping the law of judicial ideology. When his colleagues reached results that matched their politics, he derided them with the phrase “any stick to beat a dog,” according to another former clerk, Bruce Hay, now a law professor at Harvard. To prove the impartiality of originalism, Scalia often pointed to the occasional votes he cast against his preferences, like his support for a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/397\">5-to-4 ruling in 1989</a> that found a right to burn the flag in the First Amendment.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>And so it’s striking, observes Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago, “that the justice who more conspicuously than any other was invested in trying to make legal interpretation objective sometimes seemed to be skeptical of science itself, the best means we have of pursuing objectivity.” At an argument before the Supreme Court in 2006, in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1120.ZS.html\">a case about climate change</a>, a lawyer for Massachusetts gently corrected Scalia for referring to the stratosphere instead of the troposphere. “Whatever,” Scalia responded. “I told you before I’m not a scientist. That’s why I don’t want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834580\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>But the court had to deal. Justices are generalists by trade, picking their way through a minefield of facts without the benefit of personal expertise. A majority of the justices agreed in the climate case to state the scientific consensus: “The harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized.” In dissent, Scalia held fast to doubt: “The court’s alarm over global warming may or may not be justified.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>He also refused to treat social-science research as settled. In 2013, the lawyer defending California’s ban on same-sex marriage gave no examples of how allowing gay couples to marry could be harmful. “I don’t know why you don’t mention some concrete things,” Scalia prodded him. “There’s considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.” In fact, at that point there was a strong body of evidence showing that children fare as well with gay parents as they do with straight ones.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004828025\", \"dropzone\":7, \"pNum\":7]} --><p>Scalia, whom Donald Trump has called his model for selecting future justices, also contradicted scientific consensus when he declared it “very likely” last year that the death penalty deters murder. He dismissed the <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty\">findings of a panel</a> of the National Research Council, which surveyed the relevant studies and unanimously concluded in 2012 that the death penalty does not have a deterrent effect. To support his claim to the contrary, Scalia cited three articles. Two were statistical studies that the National Research Council had discredited. The lead author of the third (which was not an empirical evaluation) had previously stated that his paper did not claim the death penalty had a deterrent effect. “Scalia was willing to cite work that was thoroughly refuted by an accepted scholarly institution, without feeling any need to buttress his position,” says John Donohue, a Stanford economist and law professor who conducts empirical research on the death penalty.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>By seeking refuge in uncertainty, Scalia — paradoxical though it may sound — cast himself as a kind of apostate. He even refused to join part of a 2013 opinion, by Justice Clarence Thomas, that laid out basic principles of human genetics in textbook fashion: “Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino acids.” Scalia said he could not affirm the facts based “on my own knowledge or even my own belief.” The last bit could contain multitudes; Scalia didn’t explain it.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p><em>Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-antonin-scalia","promotional_media":100000004828019,"module_top":100000004828019,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004834580":"embedded","100000004828025":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820574":{"data_id":100000004820574,"print_headline":"Josephine Del Deo","headline":"What Josephine Del Deo Saved for Us","summary":"She fought to preserve public land – and also some tarpaper shacks.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1925</p>","byline":"By GARETH COOK","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Gareth Cook"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p><strong>One day in</strong> the summer of 1953, Josephine Couch went with her boyfriend, Salvatore Del Deo, on an overnight trip to the dunes outside Provincetown. They’d been invited by a friend, a former chorus girl who went by Frenchie Chanel, to stay with her at her tar-paper shack by the water. That day, amid the compass grass and rose hips, Josephine, 27, felt the rest of the world vanish: Birds cried, but the white noise of surf and wind enforced a hush. At night, the moonlight caused the dunes to glow. Josephine fell asleep in the arms of Salvatore, whom she married that fall, to the cooing of a dove.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Frenchie’s place was one of a scattering of shacks along a wild stretch of Cape Cod called Peaked Hill. These were modest structures — no electricity or running water, an outhouse somewhere nearby — yet Josephine described them, in her dune-life memoir, “The Watch at Peaked Hill,” as “spiritual temples.” She came to believe that there were settings where the “creative spirit” lived, offering refuge and renewal, and throughout her life she tried to protect such places.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Provincetown itself was the most obvious target of Josephine’s preservationist impulse. When she arrived in 1951, it was both a fishing village and a bohemian mecca, the kind of place where the Portuguese captains would leave the catch they couldn’t sell on the dock so aspiring artists wouldn’t starve over the winter. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Josephine, along with the modernist painter Ross Moffett, led a grass-roots campaign to donate public land to the nascent Cape Cod National Seashore, foiling a development plan that featured a three-story parking garage and a heliport. In 1968 she founded, with Salvatore and others, the Fine Arts Work Center in a lumberyard, giving emerging artists funding and a place to work in what was becoming an expensive town. Remarkably, Provincetown still looks something like the way Josephine found it — a vibrant artists’ colony of modest, handsome buildings near untamed dunes — and today she gets much of the credit.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Yet oddly enough, Josephine’s longest-running struggle pitted her against the officials who oversaw the National Seashore she helped create. The Peaked Hill shacks were on the land given to the Seashore, and the government considered them blemishes in need of removal. One dune resident had a shack where he observed birds and distilled beach-plum wine, but soon after he died, it was bulldozed, leaving his possessions strewn in the sand. Josephine and Sal inherited Frenchie’s shack, and in Josephine’s memoir, she argued that the government had made a destructive fetish of wildness. She pointed to Arkansas’s Buffalo National River park, from which hundreds of families were ejected, along with their traditions of “weaving, spinning, basket-making, chair-caning, the art of the forge and the smithy, and folk music.” Humans had been part of the Cape shore for millenniums. What needed preservation, Josephine argued, was not the physicality of a particular dune feature, or some collection of species, but the totality of what had grown up in that locale, including the people and their ways. She was also convinced that the shacks themselves held poetic and philosophical value. In her memoir, she describes a peerless day at Frenchie’s with her children, Giovanna and Romolo. They explored, played and rolled giggling down a dune. That evening, they walked the beach to bid the sun “good night.” Residency in the shacks created, she wrote, “a metaphysical sense of place over time.” Merely knowing of such spaces — outside and apart — had the power to “refresh a stale vision of the universe.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Today the shacks are part of our national cultural heritage — they’ve inspired many artists, including Eugene O’Neill and Jackson Pollock — and they are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, in part because of Josephine’s writings. Her son, Romolo, a bronze sculptor, recently drove me into the dunes, his truck fishtailing through turns and shuddering on the rises. The sun had set, and the November light was blue and thin. The shack sat in a hollow, just two rooms and a screened-in porch, with a wooden star at the roof peak, overlooking a dune edge that drops to the beach.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>The windows were boarded for the winter, and Romolo had to dig out the front door. Inside he lit a kerosene lamp. “I’m going to leave you with the shack for a few minutes,” Romolo said, “so you can become friends.” I sat at a small table dusted with sand and listened to the wind. Part of the shack’s magic, Josephine explained, was its minimalism, the chance it offered to witness what she called “the oracles of nature”: the passing seals and humpback whales, the wind-waved poverty grass, the bee at a solitary dune flower.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Suddenly Romolo called me outside. He gestured east, where out over the Atlantic, the moon was poking up. It was full, shining lurid orange, its shape unsettled as it rose.

Harvard professors lectured their male students and were then obliged to repeat it all to the smaller, all-female classes at Radcliffe.

Wald was obsessed with the photochemistry of eyeballs — the enormous, unsolved mystery of how exactly the eye converted light into information for the brain. Before long, Hubbard was obsessed, too. Not yet 25 and in the process of earning a Ph.D. in biology from Radcliffe, she began a series of landmark studies examining the role of a pigment in the eye called rhodopsin and how it absorbed light. She worked long hours in Wald’s lab at Harvard, keeping eyeballs in cold storage — human eyes, squid eyes, cow eyes — teaching colleagues the best methods for slicing them open to extract what was inside.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>When Wald mentioned that he was planning to ride his bicycle from Woods Hole, Mass., to the tip of Cape Cod one weekend, Hubbard asked if she could join him.

After a weekend of torrid bicycling, they kept their love affair a secret for more than a decade. Having divorced their respective spouses, they married each other, finally, in 1959.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Life continued to be all about the lab. Hubbard and Wald walked to campus every morning, worked in side-by-side offices, ate lunch together and then strolled home again, discussing their work right through. “It was rhodopsin at the breakfast table and rhodopsin at dinner,” recalls the older of their two children, Elijah Wald, who viewed their relationship as “a great romance.” Hubbard published dozens of papers on vision. Wald was part of a team that won a Nobel Prize in 1967. That same year, he and Hubbard were jointly awarded the prestigious Paul Karrer Gold Medal for their rhodopsin research.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>Ruth Hubbard would later acknowledge that she had lived, contentedly, in a man’s world. “I really thought men were smarter, more interesting, better company,” she said. It didn’t yet bother her that she and the other female scientists at Harvard were locked in low-status lecturer and research positions — “nonjobs,” she would later call them — while men were granted tenure. “We’d just sort of been naïve about — ‘Oh, well, Harvard lets us work here. Isn’t that nice of them?’ ” she recalled. “I wasn’t really looking at the whole scene.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>When she did look, finally, it was the late 1960s. Hubbard was taking her children to demonstrations against the Vietnam War. At universities across the country, women were questioning the foundations of white male privilege upon which traditional knowledge was built. Hubbard noted the manifestations of science around her — in particular, the weapons, gas and chemical defoliants used in Vietnam — and this triggered an abrupt reversal of her beliefs. “It just became imperative not to close my eyes to the fact that science is part of the social structure,” she said.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Her interest in rhodopsin disappeared. She declared herself done with the “pretended objectivity” of lab work and instead dedicated herself to writing and editing books that challenged the male paradigms in science. Hubbard wrote essays critiquing the assumptions of Charles Darwin, E.O. Wilson and Watson and Crick. Her work largely dismantled biological theories about gender inequality. At Harvard, she taught a first-of-its-kind course — Biology 109 — devoted to examining the absence of women in science and medicine and its consequences. She devoted herself to mentoring young women pursuing careers in science.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>In 1974, with women’s groups pressuring the university, Hubbard became the first woman at Harvard to be tenured in biology. (It would take 10 years for a second to follow.) Her relationship with the university remained uneasy, in part because her early experiences at Radcliffe still echoed. “I have felt, and I still feel, that Harvard is a bad place for women,” she said in 1981. “Women are still socialized to sit at the feet of great men.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>For many years, Ruth Hubbard and George Wald spent winters in Cambridge and summers in Woods Hole, where they liked to sunbathe and swim nude at the public beach.

According to their son, the magnitude of her grief surprised her. “For someone who had made a life as a feminist, it was a shock for her — that he really was the center of her life.” Yet for as long as she was physically able, Hubbard continued to swim off the shore at Woods Hole, her convictions very much alive. “Women and nonwhite working-class and poor men have largely been outside the process of science-making,” Hubbard told an interviewer after her retirement. “We have not formulated the questions scientists ask, nor have we answered them.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p><em>Sara Corbett is a contributing writer for the magazine.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-ruth-hubbard","promotional_media":100000004826114,"module_top":100000004826114,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820588":{"data_id":100000004820588,"print_headline":"Sirdeaner Walker","headline":"Sirdeaner Walker Spoke Out Against the Dangers of Bullying","summary":"Her son’s suicide turned her into an activist.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1965</p>","byline":"By SUSAN DOMINUS","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Susan Dominus"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p><strong> At 11,</strong> a boy is a dangerously ideal target for bullying: His horizons are limited, his sensitivity is ripe, his reactions are hot.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Carl Walker-Hoover of Springfield, Mass., was such a boy.

Kids were calling him “faggot,” he told her. “You act like you’re kind of feminine,” one girl told him, an accusation masked as an observation.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>If Carl felt powerless, Walker — who had a law degree and worked with the homeless at a nonprofit — did not, at least not at first. She called the school, met with administrators. But Carl came home one day in April that year and told his mother that he was facing suspension for fighting with a girl after he accidentally caused something to bump into her. He said the girl had threatened to kill him. The guidance counselor wanted them, as a form of mediation, to have lunch together every day for a week. Walker, frustrated, wondered: What kind of dumb idea was that?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Carl headed to his room. Walker decided she would see the principal and take Carl with her. She went upstairs to tell Carl her plan. She found her son lifeless, hanging from an extension cord he had tied to the banister.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>A year later, the television host Dr. Phil, on an episode about bullying, asked Walker what she was thinking when she realized her son was gone. “I failed as a parent,” she told him. “I failed to protect my child.” As the camera panned out at the segment’s end, she bowed her head, as if in prayer, or defeat.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834587\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Almost as soon as she could form thoughts after her son’s death, Walker spoke to the news media and then to her Legislature, which eventually passed the state’s first anti-bullying law, her testimony crucial in the process. The consummate advocate, she stepped forward so others could bear witness to her pain, while reining in her emotions to leave room for lucid argument. The audience did not see the woman who had stopped eating and who woke her family, night after night, with screams as she lay in the grip of a deep, recurring dream in which she relived her son’s death.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>That her son did not identify as gay, that she was a Christian, made her a particularly compelling activist against anti-gay bullying in 2009, before most Americans supported same-sex marriage, before celebrities started reassuring young gay people, in a popular video series, that “It Gets Better.” Now, amid a rise in bias attacks, the anti-bullying laws and policies that Walker and others fought to put in place stand as bulwarks — benchmarks, however imperfect, for the ideals of tolerance and caring.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Even after she fell ill with breast cancer, Walker actively served on the board of Glsen, a nonprofit organization devoted to making school safe for L.G.B.T.Q. students. Soon after Carl’s death, she spoke at one of its fund-raisers. When she finished, two dozen or so attendees waited patiently in line to take her hand. They wanted to thank her and share their own tortured schoolyard pasts. “You know, I have never met so many rich, white gay people in my life,” Walker told Eliza Byard, the executive director of Glsen. “And every single one of them, when I look in their eyes, I see my Carl.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><em>Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-sirdeaner-walker","promotional_media":100000004827748,"module_top":100000004827748,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004834587":"embedded"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820591":{"data_id":100000004820591,"print_headline":"Afeni Shakur","headline":"How Afeni Shakur Kept Tupac’s Name Alive","summary":"Long after her son was killed, she became a source of comfort for other grieving mothers.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1947</p>","byline":"By JAZMINE HUGHES","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Jazmine Hughes"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p><strong> On the second</strong> day of the first Circle of Mothers retreat, in 2014, Afeni Shakur approached the stage to speak to the assembled crowd. Some days, it felt as if America was brimming with grieving mothers, so the event’s founder, Sybrina Fulton, wanted to gather many of them together in the hope that they could help one another move forward. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was shot and killed two years earlier. Shakur’s son, the rapper Tupac Shakur, had been dead for almost 20 years.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Before Shakur reached the stage, her son’s paean “Dear Mama” began streaming from speakers: “When I was young, me and my mama had beef; 17 years old, kicked out, on the streets.” By that point, the song was nearly two decades old, and most people at the event knew it by heart. The crowd had been eating, drinking, making small talk, but now their murmuring softened. Tupac rapped: “Though back at the time, I never thought I’d see her face,” and then the mothers suddenly joined in: “Ain’t a woman alive that could take my mama’s place.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Until the song’s release in 1995, Afeni Shakur was best known for the Panther 21 trial, when 13 members of the Black Panther Party were indicted on 156 charges, including conspiracy to bomb subway stations, police stations, railroads, department stores and the New York Botanical Garden. In 1971, she successfully defended herself in court — without a law degree, visibly pregnant — and on May 13, she and every other Panther named were acquitted of all charges. Thirty-four days later, she gave birth to Tupac. During his childhood, she was an active mother who held her son to high standards (a popular punishment was making him read The New York Times from front to back), but in his adolescence, she became addicted to crack cocaine, and their relationship withered. Tupac left home at 17, and they barely spoke until she got clean a few years later.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Tupac wrote “Dear Mama” as a tribute to her.

She acknowledged Fulton’s anger but urged her not to succumb to it. “We cannot go anywhere with anger that we haven’t already been,” Shakur wrote. “My only son was murdered, and out of respect for him and what he accomplished in his short 25 years on this earth, I could not allow myself to be angry.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834589\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Her speech at the Circle of Mothers retreat was frank and confident, faintly ecclesiastical.

Lil births a boy with flippers, beautiful Siamese-twin sisters joined at the waist, an albino dwarf hunchback and a boy with telekinetic powers. It hardly sounds like a universal cipher, the kind of humanist tale that attracts readers over time. Yet somehow this strange, singular book has spent the 27 years since its publication doing just that, speaking clear and true to a certain kind of reader.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>I was that kind of reader, awakened by the novel at 16. The narrator, Olympia, was the albino dwarf, but she felt like my mirror: a put-upon observer of her own family, a peacemaker, a weirdo.

At the time, she worked as a waitress, a bartender and a house painter. She swam a mile a day, five days a week, at a pool in the basement of a school near her apartment. “I wrote most of that book in the water,” she once told me. She was surprised by the powerful, continuous response it received. (The first print run was 20,000 copies; in total, it has sold nearly half a million.) Dunn would describe how charmed she was by the variety of reader interpretations. She told me about a review in a disability publication that said “Geek Love” was either an enormous joke at the expense of the disabled or the best thing for disability rights to come down the pike in a long time. A parenting magazine took it as an attack on bad parenting. “And I once gave a reading in a small bookstore,” she said, “where the audience was primarily young people in black leather with spikes through their noses and big green mohawks, and they thought that the book was about the vanity of conventional notions of beauty.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>I met Dunn while I was working at The Paris Review, after writing her a frank fan letter, asking for something we could publish. In the nearly two decades since “Geek Love,” she had shown the world no new fiction — though she had published lots of great nonfiction, much of it about boxing. We became friends and pen pals, of a sort. (She was good at that, a curious and engaged listener; between 1984 and 1992, she even answered reader questions on any subject for Willamette Week, her local alt weekly.) I last saw her two months before she died. She didn’t know she was sick with lung cancer yet. She and her new husband, Paul — a college boyfriend she reconnected with decades later — were splitting time between New York and Portland, Ore., where Dunn had spent most of her life. The marriage made her very happy. Last Halloween, she sent me a photo of Paul in a Superman costume. She had dressed in black, as Insect Queen, with wings and big, dark sunglasses; she always wore sunglasses.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Once, when I told her I was leaving a solid job, she asked me: “Are you scared?

While the other authors interested me technically rather than emotionally, Butor’s “Degrés” (read in Richard Howard’s English translation) captivated me.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":5} --><p>“Degrés” was Butor’s fourth novel. His third, “La Modification” (“A Change of Heart”) — written entirely in the second person, its action confined to a single train compartment — won him the prestigious Prix Renaudot. This “fragile and ephemeral notoriety,” Butor later wrote, allowed him to settle in Paris and embark on a still more formally audacious book.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":6} --><p>“Degrés” recounts the lives and studies of teachers and students in a Paris lycée as told by three different narrators in succession, beginning with a teacher whose ambition is to bring together into a coherent whole, for the benefit of his nephew, the different courses of study in the upper-grade curriculum. What I appreciated was, for one, the patient and unstinting detail — somewhat akin to James Agee’s “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men”; the embrace, within a work of fiction, of various bodies of knowledge — which I relished also in Flaubert’s “Bouvard and Pecuchet”; the extensive and frequent quotations from the works the children were studying — one critic complained that the reader drowns in a sea of them; and the mathematical fascination of author and narrators (and, of course, reader) with the complex interrelations, familial and other, among the characters (which now remind me of Georges Perec’s “Life: A User’s Manual,” confined to the population of a single apartment building — as was Butor’s first novel, “Passage de Milan”).</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":7} --><p>It was a collection of travel essays that next brought me into direct involvement with Butor’s writing, when in 1985, the Marlboro Press (then an adventurous one-man operation) hired me to translate the first volume of Butor’s suite of five “travel autobiographies or geographical meditations,” as he called them. This book, which we titled “The Spirit of Mediterranean Places,” opens with an essay on Cordova (“Its network of white streets, along its sand-colored and whitewashed walls”); and continues with chapters on Istanbul, Salonica and Delphi; Mallia, Mantua, Ferrara; and last — the entire second half of the book — Egypt.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":8} --><p>In addition to his novels and travel books, Butor wrote art criticism — he loved painters’ studios and their conversation — poetry, translations of Friedrich Hölderlin, Lukacs, Shakespeare and others; a work of fiction that included verse; artist’s books, literary criticism and a series of collections of invented dreams. He taught in many institutions, in France but also in Salonica, Egypt, the United States, Manchester — which provided him the material for his second novel, “Passing Time” — and, for many years, Geneva.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":9} --><p>He died not far from there in Contamine-sur-Arve in France.

The poem that Butor sent earlier this year was one he wrote in 2014 for the artist Jacques Riby.

The show’s title was a scrap of messy poetry, as unwieldy as the program itself: “If I Can’t Dance, You Can Keep Your Revolution.” It was a no-fi interview show featuring scribbled title cards and minor downtown celebrities; regular guests included a singing dog and a disheveled poet who recited his work in a tapioca-thick mumble. She dedicated one episode to “the second anniversary of the first nonstop balloon crossing of North America.” The show isn’t easy to characterize, but Crystal probably described it best: “an hour of talk, telephone and technical failure.” Every episode ended with her dancing to groovy music — a little shoulder sway, some finger snaps.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Crystal was born Jackie Diamond, a well-to-do girl from Westchester.

It finally went off the air when public-access administrators tried to move her to the ungodly hour of 11 a.m. on Friday. Crystal refused, read a TV bureaucrat’s phone number on the air (with some curse words thrown in) and retired her show for good.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>In a sense, Crystal saw where American culture was going. Her show predicted the sensibility of the internet — nonlinear, surreal, personal, casual, satirical yet still passionately earnest. But she didn’t divulge everything to her audience. Crystal’s viewers knew her as the ringmaster of a loopy circus, but she spent much of her time offscreen caring for Gustav Che Finkelstein, a nephew of hers who became her son. She adopted Gus, who was severely handicapped, when he was a toddler in the 1970s and remade her life around him.

For those like Jephtane Sophie Sabin and Isabel Evans, who watched Ifill on PBS over many years and eventually had the opportunity to meet her, Ifill created a warm and welcoming climate in which their aspirations had the chance to take root. Her impact wasn’t instant but played out slowly over time, like the rain of a wet season.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Growing up, Ifill didn’t have an Ifill to emulate. Her immigrant parents and five siblings would watch the news on television “because that’s the kind of nerdy family we were,” she said in 2013. “I would look up and not see anyone who looked like me in any way. No women. No people of color.” Nonetheless, Ifill decided she wanted to be a journalist at age 9 in 1964, the year Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, ensuring her right to pursue her ambition.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Ifill drew her strength from her parents and their religious faith. Her father, a pastor from Panama, was so involved in the political battles of the 1960s that Ifill’s mother, who was from Barbados, worried he might get the family deported. Ifill worked as a reporter at a series of newspapers, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/business/media/gwen-ifill-dies.html\">including The Times</a>, before making the leap to television. By 1999, she had found a permanent perch at PBS. Along the way, she became one of the nation’s most respected political journalists: the first African-American woman to moderate a vice-presidential debate and the first to host a major weekly political-affairs program. After Ifill became the co-anchor of the “PBS NewsHour,” she said she hoped little girls would watch her and think it “perfectly normal” to occupy an anchor’s desk someday.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Sophie encountered Ifill before she entered grade school. Her family had immigrated to the United States from Haiti in 2002 and spoke Creole.

Soon, Sophie was joining her mother in front of the TV.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Isabel, who is two grades behind Sophie, was born in the United States to American parents. Her mother’s ancestry is Puerto Rican; her father is black. Isabel was exposed to Ifill in middle school when she and Sophie took a class I helped teach that is part of a nationwide program created by the “NewsHour” called the Student Reporting Labs. Even after it was over, Isabel kept returning to Ifill at night. “I am African-American,” she says. “I am Hispanic. I am a girl. Things that, according to history, should hold me back.” But Isabel noticed Ifill had “never been held back.”</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004831203\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Sophie began making news broadcasts for classmates in fifth grade. She was shy, her teacher Sharon Alonzo recalls. “It was hard coaxing her in front of a camera.” In 2014, PBS gave Sophie an opportunity to interview Ifill via Skype. “I didn’t understand why this important person, who had this really busy schedule and lived in Washington, D.C., was taking time out to talk to me,” Sophie says. She asked Ifill about it. Ifill replied: “Well, Sophie, it’s because I <em>was</em> you.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>“Watching her growing up,” Sophie says, “there was this barrier in my mind. I didn’t think of that person on the screen as a human being, as someone who could be like me.” But she came to see Ifill as just much farther down a road she was also on. A few months later, Sophie and Ifill attended a PBS summer program. Sophie didn’t think Ifill would recognize her, but Ifill rushed over to give Sophie a hug.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>Sophie finished eighth grade and graduated from her Newark school in 2014. But Isabel was still there. So Sophie wrote to Ifill to ask if she would be the graduation speaker at the school the following year. Ifill agreed.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p>The night before the ceremony, Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina and massacred nine parishioners. Ifill’s father had been an A.M.E. pastor. She wrote on Twitter: “Once an A.M.E. preacher’s kid, always an A.M.E. preacher’s kid. My heart aches for Emanuel Charleston.” In the morning, Ifill spoke to the eighth graders, expressing gratitude to be able to “focus on the future” with young people. Afterward, Ifill tweeted, “I spent part of my day today with the terrific Sophie Sabin,” adding, “#spiritlifted.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>At the gathering, Isabel got to interview Ifill, and that summer, a news package Isabel worked on appeared on the “NewsHour.” Sophie also continued to make her mark.

The members of an experimental theater troupe (one of two such entities in the film) participate in an exercise that consists of writhing and squirming on the floor while wordlessly moaning and keening. It’s the primordial soup from which the film’s elaborate and elusive narrative will evolve, a reminder that every story begins in chaos and noise. Cinema, like other art forms, imposes a capricious kind of order on the mess of human experience, and “Out 1” illustrates this principle with a characteristically Rivetteian blend of intellectual rigor and anarchic whimsy.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>Abbas Kiarostami’s “Taste of Cherry” — which shared the Palme d’Or in Cannes in 1997 — ends with a shot that makes a related point about reality and representation. We have spent 80 minutes in the melancholy, mysterious company of a certain Mr. Badii as he drives aimlessly along a dusty road on the outskirts of Tehran preparing to commit suicide. And then the image changes (from film to video, from static to hand-held), and we are observing an actor, a director and other crew members engaged in making the movie we have just seen. This gesture is less an act of postmodernist rug-pulling than a sly alteration of perspective. Cinema is an art of perception as well as creation, and “Taste of Cherry” illuminates this paradoxical truth with a typically Kiarostamian amalgam of sober contemplation and mischief.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>It could be argued that Kiarostami, an Iranian, had little in common with Rivette, a Frenchman, except a tendency to attract the description “enigmatic” from mystified critics. But in each case the source of the enigma lay in an idiosyncratic interest in film as philosophical pursuit. I’m referring less to the content of their movies — which is gratifyingly hard to pin down — than to the directors’ very different approaches to storytelling and image-making, which circle back to fundamental questions about representation and reality.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004829046\", \"dropzone\":3, \"pNum\":3]} --><p>They also shared an explicit interest in literature, less as a reservoir of source material than as a source of ideas and analogy. Rivette, who started out as a critic for Cahiers du Cinéma, set many of his films — including his first feature, “Paris Nous Appartient” (“Paris Belongs to Us”), and his late masterpiece “Va Savoir” (“Who Knows?”) — in and around the world of theater, combining backstage intrigue with epistemological gamesmanship. When does human behavior become performance? Is there a difference between acting and authentic feeling, or is the point of art, and maybe of life, to erase that distinction?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>Kiarostami approached similar questions through his love of poetry. Described by the scholar Hamid Dabashi as “the first visual poet of his nation,” he was steeped in a Persian tradition of oblique, ruminative lyrics about nature, love and the divine. His films of the 1970s and ’80s, before and after the Islamic Revolution, look at first glance like simple tales, many of them involving the everyday mishaps and adventures of children in poor neighborhoods and rural villages. But as Kiarostami refined the technique of using nonprofessional actors to reconstruct episodes from their own lives, his work traveled beyond realism into the realm of fable.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>He was both a pioneer — a mentor and influence for filmmakers from Iran to Thailand, from Mali to Argentina — and something of a terminal figure. “Film begins with D.W. Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami,” Jean-Luc Godard once remarked, suggesting that the grand experiment begun in Hollywood in the early 20th century was wrapping up in Tehran on the eve of the 21st. Rivette, too, was a great originator — the French New Wave began “thanks to Rivette,” François Truffaut said — and by the end of his life, a symbol of fading glory, as French film drifted toward mannerism and nostalgia.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Yet cinema is hardly finished, occasional rumors of its demise to the contrary, in part because the work of certain filmmakers remains permanently open. Kiarostami’s Koker trilogy — “Where Is the Friend’s Home?” “Life and Nothing More” and “Through the Olive Trees” — represents a layered, infinitely curious approach to reality that feels like an unfulfilled promise. And Rivette’s “Out 1,” a shaggy-dog conspiracy tale that makes itself up as it goes on, is contemporary in its own way. There is no comparing two such radically individual artists, except to note that each left behind a body of work that is less canonical than provocative. Why aren’t there more like them? It’s not a rhetorical question. It’s a philosophical puzzle.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p><em>A.O.

The channel gave you the recipes for being chicer, more alternative, more you; for being gayer, blacker, more confrontational; for being <em>cooler</em>, basically. Perhaps it was your meal plan: “Yo! MTV Raps” for breakfast, “120 Minutes” for a midnight snack. And for dessert, “House of Style.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>MTV aired the first episode of “House of Style” in June 1989. I don’t think I knew what fashion really was back then, but I didn’t need to, because neither did the show’s creator. Alisa Marie Bellettini had no official background in fashion; she was an MTV News producer when she suggested the channel try a show on style. Within 24 hours, the network executive Doug Herzog told her it would and that she’d be in charge. Her first thought for a host was Johnny Rotten, the former Sex Pistol, but Herzog nixed that idea. Bellettini settled — <em>settled</em> — for Cindy Crawford, the willowy, all-American supermodel with the vertiginous cheekbones.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>The idea was to be accessible rather than rarefied — to show people how to personalize clothes and accessories not by reading fashion magazines but by experimenting. Bellettini’s sister, Gina DeHerrera, told me Alisa lived the same way: “She didn’t feel that what you were wearing had to be expensive. Her style was about mixing and matching and feeling incredible in it. Pearl bracelet with a Swatch watch worn backward; a Gap T-shirt with a designer blazer — she had an incredible knack of putting clothes together and looking genius in them.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Her “House of Style” ran for 11 years. It was always at least as of the moment as its peers, and often well <em>ahead</em> of the times. In 1991, Crawford interviewed Jean Paul Gaultier about dressing men in skirts, which was Bellettini’s show exactly: this gorgeous, cornfed white girl asking people to be smart about stuff no one was expected to be smart about. When the writers Rob Tannenbaum and Craig Marks talked to Bellettini for their oral history, “I Want My MTV,” she said she “wanted the audience to be girls in the Midwest who we could teach about style.” She got black boys in Philadelphia too; she got lots of people in lots of towns. You never knew what her show would cook up, or with whom. One week, Crawford was trying on Will Smith’s Fresh Prince jackets. Another, she’d be ambushing a member of the hip-hop outfit Onyx with makeup tips or asking Jerry Seinfeld about his diet.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":4, \"pNum\":4} --><p>The show arrived at peak supermodel, peak house music, peak Sassy magazine, and you could argue that “House of Style” helped some of that culture <em>get</em> to its peak. The show used house music underneath and between so many segments, like peanut butter or glue. It was during the “House of Style” years that models invaded the top of the fame-industrial complex — the years they starred in music videos, the era of “I’m Too Sexy” and RuPaul’s “Supermodel.” The show helped crystallize this idea of fashion-world glamour, as a new neighbor to rock stardom.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>“House of Style” rethought fashion-magazine dogmatism and democratized style, but never too mockingly, never too righteously. It wasn’t “Style with Elsa Klensch,” but it wasn’t “Zoolander,” either. Bellettini took this world seriously, journalistically. Her show spent segments unpacking the budgets of fashion shows and letting models explain their salaries. It gave us “Todd Time” with Todd Oldham, the dreamy young designer who made daffy videos about swimwear and taught us stuff like how to reupholster a chair. The designers Karl Lagerfeld, Vivienne Westwood, Herve Leger and Martine Sitbon — they were all news to me. “House of Style” equated the value of what they did with the value of what was going on in the clubs and on the streets.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Oldham told me that all of this — the show’s happy, off-center, insatiably curious personality, its nonstop introductions and conflations — came straight from Bellettini. A woman who had come into fashion television almost by happenstance created a show that expressed not just who she was but who some of us aspired to be. Oldham remembered a labor-intensive and expensively arty garment he once created, one Bellettini took a shine to: “an elaborate embroidered and beaded skirt I made and put Mona Lisa on one side and a wonky thrift-store painting on the other. Basically a $5,000 joke.” But she wore it every day, “like jeans.” Bellettini’s insouciance is what, for Oldham, made “House of Style” unique: its “honest assessment that style has nothing to do with money.” That, he said, “was straight up Alisa.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p><em>Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-alisa-bellettini","promotional_media":100000004827204,"module_top":100000004827204,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820610":{"data_id":100000004820610,"print_headline":"Dana Raphael","headline":"Dana Raphael Opened Up the Mysteries of Nursing","summary":"Investigating why American women did — and did not — breast-feed.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1926</p>","byline":"By MAGGIE JONES","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Maggie Jones"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p><strong>On the 7:02 a.m.</strong> commuter train from Fairfield, Conn., to Manhattan, a woman with scarlet lipstick and chestnut hair slid beside a businessman reading his newspaper. “May I ask you a question?” she said. “What do you think about breast-feeding?” This was the mid-1950s. The woman was Dana Raphael, an anthropologist, a protégée of Margaret Mead and an outspoken feminist who, a decade before Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique,” refused to take her husband’s name and shunned the conventional wedding her mother planned. She initially also had no intention of following the de rigueur practice of bottle feeding. But after she tried but mostly failed to nurse her firstborn son, she began an anthropological quest that would end up spanning decades: Why was breast-feeding more successful in some cultures than in others?</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>She posed the question in one way or another everywhere she went. She asked obstetricians and pediatricians, taxi drivers, ministers and factory workers, men and women sitting on park benches and walking down the street, recording it all in a 5-by-7 notebook she kept in her purse. Many people said breast-feeding was “disgusting,” “animalistic” or “not for humans.” Some women told Raphael they were open to trying it but lacked confidence. One-third of the mothers who tried to breast-feed, one doctor told Raphael, failed.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Breast-feeding had been on the wane since World War II as breasts became increasingly sexualized (pinup girls, Marilyn Monroe, Playboy magazine) and less functional: Doctors and formula manufacturers promoted formula as the scientific, modern, convenient method. If you were a young mother in 1950s suburban America, after leaving the maternity ward you were largely left alone to figure out life with a newborn. There was a good chance your own mother hadn’t breast-fed. Or your sisters. Or your friends. Your pediatrician may have discouraged it. In the meantime, you were setting up the diaper service, doing laundry, cooking and cleaning, entertaining visitors bearing gifts and sending out birth announcements. How much easier to mix some evaporated milk, sugar and water than to puzzle out the mysteries of nursing.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>It was far different in much of the world. In parts of East Asia, new moms returned to their parents’ home for weeks to be cared for. In the Latin American tradition of <em>la cuarentena</em>, postpartum women were encouraged to refrain from household work and sex for 40 days while relatives helped tend to mother and baby. In some cultures, the family brought a new mother special food to help her gain strength, while in others, elders shared their knowledge about how to care for the baby. All of it served to “mother the mother,” as Raphael put it, and insulate her from daily pressures so she could relax and — by extension — breast-feed.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834594\", \"dropzone\":4, \"pNum\":4]} --><p>“That’s a doula,” an elderly Greek woman told Raphael in the late 1950s when Raphael explained the concept. The Greek word meant “female servant,” and Raphael used it in her 1966 dissertation on cross-cultural practices of breast-feeding and later popularized it in her book “The Tender Gift: Breastfeeding.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":5, \"pNum\":5} --><p>By then, Raphael was a breast expert (or as some professors at Columbia, where she got her Ph.D., disparagingly called her: the Tit Lady). When her second son was born, as if to make up for lost time, she nursed him for five years. She did it again when she and her husband adopted their daughter, Jessa. To get her breasts to relactate, Raphael, who had interviewed more than 40 adoptive mothers about the process, massaged her breasts, drank lots of water (and wine with seltzer to relax) and borrowed a friend’s baby to nurse.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>She was an early critic of Nestlé and other companies in the 1970s for pushing formula in developing countries where women often diluted it or mixed it with tainted water. But she wasn’t a zealot. Working with the Human Lactation Center, which she founded with Margaret Mead, Raphael led a team of anthropologists who interviewed women around the world and discovered that many undernourished women were unable to breast-feed or too preoccupied with the basics of survival to find the time to do so. Formula, in other words, saves lives, too.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>For Raphael, it was primarily about giving women options, including to breast-feed where and when they wanted. Raphael certainly did so: at the dinner table of her disapproving mother, during academic meetings, at the ballet and the opera, at parties, on the commuter train. She unbuttoned her blouse and opened it up. No embarrassment, no shame. No barriers between that baby and those very functional breasts.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":8, \"pNum\":8} --><p><em>Maggie Jones is a contributing writer for the magazine and a visiting assistant professor in the writing program at the University of Pittsburgh.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-dana-raphael","promotional_media":100000004828223,"module_top":100000004828223,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004834594":"embedded"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004820611":{"data_id":100000004820611,"print_headline":"Pat Summitt","headline":"Why Pat Summitt Won So Many Basketball Games.","summary":"She made her statement about the power of women by relentlessly pursuing every victory.","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1952</p>","byline":"By ELIZABETH WEIL","byline_prefix":"By","authors":["Elizabeth Weil"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p><span class=\"dropcap\">D</span>uring a Final Four basketball game against the University of North Carolina, on April 1, 2007, Pat Summitt, the coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team, found her team down by 12 points with 8:18 to go. She was fuming — her gold rings were dented from being banged on the parquet floor. Summitt was a screamer. She loved to win. Over 38 years at Tennessee, she won 1,098 games — more than any other coach in N.C.A.A. Division 1 history. She also understood winning as a far more potent and radical act than even the most rabid male football fans would understand while pounding their painted chests.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} --><p>“We are not going home without a championship!” she yelled at her players a minute later during a timeout, her hair still sprayed into a TV-ready helmet, her white cuffs protruding just-so from her pinstriped pantsuit. This was not rhetoric. This was directive. Summitt’s plan: Her players would get five straight stops, meaning the Lady Volunteers would prevent U.N.C. from scoring the next five times it had the ball. The Lady Vols nodded. “If Mom said do A, and you did B,” Tyler Summitt, Pat’s son and only child, told me, “you were going to hear about it right away.”</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":2, \"pNum\":2} --><p>Summitt’s genius stemmed from her ability to perform multiple jobs at once. She could track 10 players and the clock, recall an entire season’s worth of plays and see patterns evolving. She could watch tape, take notes, make recruiting calls, joke with reporters — media were always welcome; the real goal was promoting women’s sports — and console a player whose grandmother was sick. She could help Tyler, as a youngster, with his homework, do laundry, cook dinner, make recruiting calls (she was always making calls), churn homemade ice cream and shoo raccoons off the porch. She could also drive 120 miles per hour while applying mascara, steering with her knees or talking on the phone.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":3, \"pNum\":3} --><p>Her commitment to the Lady Vols was consuming. Summitt continued chatting up one prospect at her home in Pennsylvania well after she, Summitt, went into labor.

His core philosophy was: Discipline yourself so no one else has to. He didn’t believe in birthday celebrations or sick days from school. Summitt and her four siblings worked nonstop on the family farm. If she missed picking a sucker off a tobacco plant, her father was sure to find it, and if she cried when he spanked her, he spanked her harder.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004834600\", \"dropzone\":5, \"pNum\":5]} --><p>Summitt was 5-foot-9 in third grade and played on the eighth-grade basketball team. The University of Tennessee hired her, at 22, to be the assistant women’s basketball coach; when the head coach unexpectedly quit soon afterward, Summitt took her job. She supplemented her pay — $250 a month — by winning poker games. She took the Lady Vols to the Final Four in her third season.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":6, \"pNum\":6} --><p>Summitt avoided overt politics and the word “feminism.” She made statements through victories. She filled the arena, secured lucrative TV contracts and became the first female coach to earn $1 million a year. She refused offers to coach the University of Tennessee men’s basketball team and made sure everybody knew she did not consider the job a promotion.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":7, \"pNum\":7} --><p>She forbade the cutting of corners. She once benched her star player, the 6-foot-4 forward Candace Parker, for the entire first half of a game in Chicago — Parker’s hometown, with Parker’s family and friends in attendance — because Parker missed bed check by 20 minutes two nights earlier.</p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004827856\", \"dropzone\":8, \"pNum\":8]} --><p>Her team was ready when it reached that crucial moment at the 2007 Final Four, down by double digits with less than eight minutes left. At practice, she had put them through persistence drills: two or three Lady Vols trying to keep five male practice players from scoring on five straight possessions. So her players had the experience and confidence to do the same against U.N.C. During those last minutes, they confronted U.N.C. with shifting defenses. Their opponents became flustered; the Vols remained calm and got their five stops. Summitt’s players outscored U.N.C. 20-2 and won the game. Two days later they won again. Summitt cut down the championship net.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":9, \"pNum\":9} --><p>The following season, the Lady Vols won the N.C.A.A. finals once again. It was Summitt’s eighth title, her last. Over the next few years she grew a little less sharp, a little more withdrawn. “I did notice she stopped yelling at me,” one of the Lady Vols from that era says. Summitt started losing her key ring three or four times a day. “She went from Wonder Woman, juggling 10 things at once, to normal person,” Tyler says. Everyone hoped this was a side effect from her arthritis medication. But after the 2010-2011 season, at age 59, Summitt found out she had early-onset dementia.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":10, \"pNum\":10} --><p>She announced her condition to the world and coached one more season. She knew the power of performing before an audience, whether as coach or middle-aged woman with dementia: If you play hard, with discipline, you command respect. So Summitt continued pacing the sidelines in her impeccable pantsuits. She kept wanting to do TV interviews, even as the words came more slowly. She kept trying to talk to the reporters who attended practices, determined to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s, just as she had done for women’s athletics. But she could not win. Nobody defeats dementia through hard work. But even in later years, when Summitt could no longer walk because of rheumatoid arthritis, she demanded that Holly Warlick, a former Lady Vol and now the head coach, wheel her in to watch practice. “Warlick, I ain’t going away,” Summitt told her.</p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":11, \"pNum\":11} --><p><em>Elizabeth Weil is a contributing writer for the magazine.</em></p><!--NYTREF {[\"region\":\"Embedded\", \"id\":\"100000004836747\"]} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-pat-summitt","promotional_media":100000004827854,"module_top":100000004827854,"modules_body":{"100000004836747":"LARGE","100000004834600":"embedded","100000004827856":"LARGE"},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004831419":{"data_id":100000004831419,"print_headline":"Bill Cunningham","headline":"Andy Warhol on Bill Cunningham","summary":"‘I just wish I could do what he does.’","dateline":"","eventinfo":"<p>B. 1929</p>","byline":"photographed by ANDY WARHOL","byline_prefix":null,"authors":["photographed by Andy Warhol"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p><strong>“Ran into Bill Cunningham on his bike, I just wish I could do what he does, just go everywhere and take pictures all day.” </strong><em>From “The Andy Warhol Diaries,” entry dated Thursday, May 17, 1984</em></p><!--NYTDROP {\"id\":1, \"pNum\":1} -->","scoop_slug":"the-lives-they-lived-bill-cunningham","promotional_media":100000004824762,"module_top":100000004824762,"modules_body":{},"ad_frequency":"","ad_sizes":"","ad_adjacencies":"","ad_positions":""},"100000004831545":{"data_id":100000004831545,"print_headline":"Quiet Places","headline":"The Rooms They Left Behind","summary":"After the deaths of these 10 notable people, The New York Times photographed their private spaces — as they left them.","dateline":null,"eventinfo":"<p>Photo Essay</p>","byline":"Photographs by MITCH EPSTEIN","byline_prefix":"Photographs by","authors":["Mitch Epstein"],"kicker":"The Lives They Lived","body":"<p>Across the length of 2016, the photographer Mitch Epstein — known for making careful large-format images that draw rich meaning out of places and objects — arranged to visit the living and working spaces of some of the monumental figures we lost this year.
