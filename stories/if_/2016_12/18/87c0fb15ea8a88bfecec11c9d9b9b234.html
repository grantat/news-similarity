Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their now-obliterated life in Syria.

But Canada’s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another’s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. “What they gave us, a brother wouldn’t even give to his own brother,” Mr. Mohammad said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="3301">Still, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons — which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday?</p><figure id="canada-refugees-series" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-xsmall layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="4813" id="story-continues-8">But in Syria, children are bound to respect the authority of their parents, even in adulthood. The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="108" data-total-count="4921">“She’s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,” her mother explained.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="5217">Bayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group.

She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl’s integration into Canada.

She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. “My mom and dad, they will not do that,” she declared.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="514" data-total-count="6977">The Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband’s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah’s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="407" data-total-count="7384">Now she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="7762">Meanwhile, she found new purpose:<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161218003144/http://gersteincentre.org/arabic/"> helping lead a therapy group</a> for Syrian women coping with trauma and displacement. Standing in front of a whiteboard, she peppered her presentations with motivational statements: “Nothing is impossible.” “When we work, we are helping society around us, not ourselves alone.” She earned about 70 Canadian dollars for each weekly session.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="100" data-total-count="7862">Being in Canada “opened new doors for me that I didn’t even know existed,” Mrs. Mohammad said.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-12">Continue reading the main story</a>

The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil.

Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="399" data-total-count="9986">The Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband’s authority — before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one’s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, “flexibility.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="10478">Even as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls’ school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="10624">Now that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter’s life. “I want to try everything here,” Bayan said.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-15">Continue reading the main story</a>

But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="11661">Just then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family’s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve.

In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="12266">In the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="12471">Abdullah Mohammad headed home early; Bayan pleaded to stay later.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="13969">This was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan’s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning; that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="131" data-total-count="14100">Sunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="14450">For the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an 18-year-old whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. “Sometimes there are tests in life,” she told the children. “And sometimes they break us.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="14711">Then she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. “It’s really, really difficult to break things when they’re all together, right?” Ms. Ali asked. “And that’s exactly like us.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="15141">But it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan’s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at “Cat in the Hat” level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="15404">Other classmates’ parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is foreign-born, a reflection of Canada’s openness to immigrants.
