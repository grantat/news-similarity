                    <p> Dateline NBC's social and digital series 'Missing in America' began on December 5, 2013, following a question the night before to our Facebook community, &quot;Do you know anyone who has simply vanished?&quot; The response was overwhelming. Since that first post, every Monday, we have featured the story of a different missing person brought to our attention from a member of our online communities. </p>

                    <p> Jessica Heeringa was working alone at a gas station in Norton Shores, Michigan on April 26, 2013, when she disappeared. A witness told police he saw the 25-year-old mother being forced into a silver Chrysler minivan. Investigators found Jessica's cell phone, keys and purse inside the store. In September of this year, officials charged Jeffrey Willis, 46, with open murder and kidnapping in relation to Jessica's case. Her body has not been found. Willis also faces charges in connection with the 2014 killing of another woman, Rebekah Bletsch, and the April abduction of a teenager who ended up escaping. Willis is set to face trial for the charges relating to Jessica in early 2017. If you have any information regarding Jessica's case, please call the Norton Shores Police Department at (231) 733-2691 or the Silent Observer at (231) 722-7463. </p>

                    <p> Despite active pursuits on social media for many years now, the families of five young men who went missing in the San Francisco, California area over the past several years still have few answers. Jackson Miller, missing May 15, 2010, Cameron Remmer, missing October 6, 2011, Shawn Dickerson, missing December 2, 2011, Crishtian Hughes, missing February 7, 2013, and Sean Sidi, missing May 21, 2013, all vanished from various areas of San Francisco without a trace. Leads and searches have unearthed virtually no clues in any of their cases, but members of every family have banded together to help in the search efforts and cope with their shared emotional pain. If you have any information regarding any of these five cases, please contact the San Francisco Police Department at (415) 558-5508. </p>

                    <p> Heather Elvis was last seen on December 18, 2013, near her Myrtle Beach, South Carolina apartment after a date. The 20-year-old was reported missing the following day. Heather's car was found at Peachtree boat landing on the outskirts of town several days later. In February 2014, more than a year after Heather's case captivated the nation, Sidney and Tammy Moorer were charged with murder and kidnapping in the case. Murder charges against the pair were later dropped. Sidney was tried for kidnapping Heather in June of this year, but the jury could not reach a decision and a mistrial was declared. Officials say they will retry Sidney on the kidnapping charge, but a new trial date has not yet been set. A trial date for Tammy has also not been set. Heather's body has not been found. If you have any information regarding Heather's case, please call the Horry County Police Department at (843) 915-8477. </p>

                    <p> It's been more than three years since Brookelyn Farthing disappeared. The teen reportedly disappeared in the early hours of June 22, 2013, from a friend's home outside Berea, Kentucky. Brookelyn, 18 at the time, had spent the night with her younger sister, cousin, and some friends at a party. When the group decided to head home for the night, Brookelyn decided to stay. The details after the preceding hours are hazy, but it was around 4:00 a.m. the next morning, when several of her friends said they received text messages from Brookelyn. One of the messages said she need a ride home, 'because I'm scared.' Several hours later, the friend, whose rural home Brookelyn was at, told police he left to let some horses out. He told police he returned home to find burn damage from a small fire and no sign of Brookelyn. A massive search was launched, but turned up little evidence. To date, police have not named any persons of interest or suspects in the case. Brookelyn's family has a website, findbrookefarthing.com, and has offered a $14,000 reward &quot;for information leading to the return of Brookelyn Farthing or capture and conviction of those responsible for her disappearance.&quot; If you have any information regarding Brookelyn's case, you're urged to call the Kentucky State Police at (859) 623-2404. </p>

                    <p> College junior Phoenix Coldon was last seen on December 18, 2011, pulling out of the driveway of her family's home in Spanish Lake, Missouri. About three hours later, the 23-year-old's car was found abandoned in East St. Louis, about a 25-minute drive from her home.

                    <p> Kara Nichols, an aspiring model, was reported missing on October 9, 2012. At the time of her disappearance, the then 19-year-old was en route from her home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where she lived with two roommates, to Denver for a modeling shoot. After four years of searching and countless interviews, a Facebook page dedicated to finding Kara indicated in October of 2016, that there may have been a credible lead phoned in around the time of her birthday. The El Paso Sheriff's office has not confirmed any leads, but they are encouraging anyone with information to reach out. They note the case is still considered open and active, but have not said if they believe foul play is involved. Anyone with information about Kara's case should call the El Paso County Sheriff's Office at (719) 390-5555 </p>

                    <p> Donald Cavanaugh and David Neily both had done work for the same small horse ranch in California outside Westport, a town with only 60 residents. Both men have also been missing for more than a decade and are feared dead. Donald Cavanaugh, then 63, was reported missing in May 2005, in Ukiah, California after a dispute with his nephew, James DeNoyer, who was the ranch owner. David Neily, then 69, was reported missing in Westport, California just one year later, also reportedly after a confrontation with DeNoyer. Both men's vehicles were found on James DeNoyer's ranch property. DeNoyer denies having any information or involvement in either man's disappearance and has not been named a suspect, but is considered by police to be a person of interest in both cases. According to the Mendocino County Sheriff's office, the investigations are considered open and ongoing. If you have information about either of these cases, you are encouraged to call the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office at (707) 234-2100. </p>

                    <p> Claudine Jaquier Gifford, 43, was last seen late on the night of July 6, 2014, at Pelican's at the Point, a beachfront tiki bar in White Stone, Virginia. According to the bar manager, she consumed a &quot;couple of drinks,&quot; and watched a band play. She was last seen by a witness, who said she was being helped out of the bar by her male acquaintance, James Todd Kessler. Kessler was the last person to see Claudine before she disappeared. After police investigated Kessler's home, traces of Claudine's blood were found, and he was charged in connection with her death. In August of 2015, a jury found Kessler guilty of second-degree murder and concealment of a body. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison for Claudine's murder. However, Claudine's body has still not been found. While the police consider the case closed, they are willing to assist in the search for Claudine's body if further leads become available. If you have any information regarding Claudine's case, please call Crime Solvers at (804) 462-7463. </p>

                    <p> The mysterious case of Megan Nichols started the night of July 3, 2014, at the home in Fairfield, Illinois, where she lived with her mother and stepfather. Megan's mother, Kathy Jo Hutchcraft, discovered her daughter missing from her room around 11:00 p.m., and reported her missing soon after. Kathy later found a note Megan reportedly left behind, telling her that she loved her, but she would never be happy at home. According to authorities, Megan, who was 15 at the time, withdrew money from a local bank while on her bicycle, prior to her disappearance. She also left her cell phone behind. It had been wiped clean. Family and friends continue to search for her and post in the Facebook group '<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161206011656/https://www.facebook.com/groups/724804574245276/">Prayer Circle for Megan Nichols</a>'. Authorities consider Megan a runaway, but her family believes she did not leave alone and have strong suspicions regarding one individual in Megan's life. If you have any information regarding Megan's case, please contact the Fairfield Police Department at (618) 842-2151. </p>

                    <p> Moreira &quot;Mo&quot; Monsalve, 46, was last seen on January 12, 2014, at the house of her ex-boyfriend, Bernard Brown. Mo's daughter, Alexis, reported her mother missing two days later. Several days later, Mo's belongings were found just a few miles from her Maui, Hawaii home in a dumpster behind the Wailuku Community Center. Police have indicated they suspect foul play and consider Brown a person of interest in the case. However, Brown has since left the state and Police say there has never been enough evidence to lead to naming Brown a suspect. Monsalve's family and friends continue to post on a 'Mo-watch' page dedicated to finding their lost loved one and to helping other families of missing persons in Hawaii spread awareness. If you have any information on Mo's case, please contact Detective Oran Satterfield of the Maui Police Department at (808) 244-6431. </p>

                    <p> Christina Morris was last seen on August 30, 2014, after spending a night out with friends at a Plano, Texas shopping and dining development. The 23-year-old was seen on security video walking into a parking garage at about 4:00 a.m. that Saturday with acquaintance Enrique Arochi. Arochi was later arrested on a charge of aggravated kidnapping in connection with Morris's disappearance. In September, a jury found Arochi guilty in connection with the case. He was sentenced to life in prison. Christina is presumed dead by authorities, but her body has not been found. If you have any information regarding Christina's case, please call the Plano Police Department at (972) 424-5678. </p>

                    <p> Dail Dinwiddie, was just 23 years old when she went missing on September 24, 1992. She would now be 47. She had just completed an art history degree at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, VA (now Randolph College), and returned to her native Columbia, SC to enroll at the University of South Carolina for graduate school. The night she went missing, she had attended a U2 concert with some friends at Williams-Brice stadium. After the concert, the friends went to a local bar called Jungle Jim's, now renamed The Horseshoe. Dail somehow got separated from the group and was never seen again, despite many extensive searches. Her case is the oldest on the Columbia Police Department's books. If you have any information about what may have happened to Dail, please contact the Columbia Police Department at (803) 233-8474. </p>

                    <p> Former Harlem Globetrotter Rico Harris was in the middle of a big life move from California to Oregon, and was traveling to visit his girlfriend in Seattle when, on October 10, 2014, he mysteriously disappeared. Rico, then 37, was last seen leaving his home in Alhamba, California that he shared with his mother. Three days later, his vehicle was found in the Yolo County Regional Park region near Rumsey, CA, about 450 miles north of Alhambra. His wallet, cell phone and backpack were all located nearby. Police receive about one lead per month related to the case, but none so far has led to a break in the case. Anyone with information about Harris should contact the Yolo County Sheriff's Department at (530) 668-6612. </p>

Several days after she was reported missing, Sullivan was allegedly spotted, wearing baggy clothes, near a local soccer field, but the sighting was never confirmed. Her husband and father both continue to lead the search for answers. Matthew told police that he and his wife had been experiencing marital problems prior to Elizabeth's disappearance. Police do not consider Matthew a suspect in the case at this time. There have been no other leads in the case.

                    <p> Rhonda Daugherty vanished on Tuesday, December 2, 2014, from her home in LaFollette, Tennessee. Her husband, Charles Daugherty, told police that he arrived home that evening to find the back door wide open. All of Rhonda's belongings, including her cell phone, purse, keys and vehicle, were located at the home. The 49-year-old, however, was nowhere to be found. In January of this year, a Campbell County grand jury indicted former Campbell County teacher Lonnie Vann, who reportedly knew the family, with first-degree murder and kidnapping charges in connection with Rhonda's disappearance. Vann plead guilty and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Rhonda's body has not been found. If you have any information that could help in the case, please call the Campbell County Sheriff's Office at (423) 562-7446. </p>

                    <p> Jayme Bowen was last seen the night of April 10, 2014, leaving her sister's home in Columbus, Ohio. The 23-year-old was headed to her parents' house a few blocks away. She never made it. Family members believe she met with foul play, and think her disappearance may be linked to human trafficking. Jayme is described as a devoted mother to her two young boys. In July of 2015, a caller submitted a tip, saying they had possibly spotted Jayme in Flint, Michigan, but police have not confirmed the sighting. If you have any information about Jayme's case, please contact the Columbus Police Department at (614) 645-4545. </p>

Nicole's vehicle was later found abandoned on Highway 2 outside Poplar. The 32-year-old's belongings and her three children's pet guinea pigs were inside.

A jury found him guilty on all charges in October. Nicole's body has not been found.

Sheila's mother reported her missing after family members had not heard from her in nearly a month, according to police. The 38-year-old left behind a young son. Officials believe her disappearance may be connected to the case of Danielle Bertolini who vanished shortly after. Danielle's remains were found in March 2015, in California's Eel River. She had been murdered. Both women were reportedly last seen with the same man, and police have said that person is considered a person of interest in both cases. However, no charges have been filed. If you have any information regarding Sheila's case, please call the Humboldt County Sheriff's Department at (707) 445-7251. </p>

They indicated that Nautica had recently expressed interest in finding her biological mother. The high school freshman reportedly had a rough upbringing, but was excelling in school and was planning on attending culinary school in the future, her family said. Family members believe she may have been traveling towards the Des Moines area.

Both dogs later returned without their leashes -- and without Rudy. According to family members, the 18-year-old had been dealing with depression at the time of his disappearance. He had watched his older brother, who was his best friend, die at the scene of a motorcycle accident several years earlier and he was still trying to cope with the loss. Police do not suspect foul play in the case. If you have any information regarding Rudy's case, please contact the Houston Police Department at (713) 731-5776 or Private Investigator Brenda Paradise at (281) 642-7299. </p>

                    <p> It was shortly after Elizabeth Salgado moved to Provo, Utah to learn English, after serving a mission in Mexico for the Mormon Church that she vanished. The 26-year-old was last seen on April 16, 2015, leaving class at the Nomen Global Language Center. Salgado's family lives in Mexico, but her uncles have made public pleas in the United States for her return. Elizabeth Smart, a former abductee, and now missing person's activist, has also advocated publicly on behalf of the family. There remains a $50,000 reward compiled from various donations offered for Elizabeth's safe return. If you have any information that can help bring Elizabeth home, please contact the Provo Police Department at (801) 852-6210. </p>

Family members said the young mother of one son had fallen into a life of drugs and addiction before she vanished. Many have said Lancaster's case is eerily similar to the cases of several other missing women in surrounding counties over the past several years.

                    <p> It was New Year's Eve, 2014, when Marina Boelter was seen leaving work at the IGA grocery store in Bloomfield, Indiana around 6:00 p.m. D.J. Lockhart, Marina's former boyfriend, and father of her young son, was reportedly in the parking lot of the store at the time. He told police he saw the 18-year-old being driven away from the store by an older man. Just six weeks after Marina disappeared, Lockhart was found stabbed to death. Indiana Police say, however, they have no evidence to suggest the two incidents are connected in any way. Marina's family continues to search for her and posts updates on the Facebook page '<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161206011656/https://www.facebook.com/FindMarinaBoelter/">Find Marina Boelter</a>.'

                    <p> Janet Castrejon disappeared the afternoon of June 19, 2015, from a camping area in the Chiricahua Mountains in southern Arizona, where she was spending the weekend with her family. Janet and her mother had gone to mail a letter at the pay station not far from where they parked their camper, and stopped to use the restroom, family members said. Janet was going to wait outside, but when her mother came out of the bathroom, Janet was gone. Janet had suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident in 1988 and, as a result, family members said, she has a hard time remembering simple things and has poor vision. Her family has spent the past year and a half desperately searching for her. If you have any information regarding Janet's case, please contact the Cochise County Sheriff's Office at (520) 432-9500. </p>

                    <p> Crystal Rogers, a mother of five, was last seen on July 3, 2015, at the home the 35-year-old shared with her boyfriend Brooks Houck and the couple's young son. Two days later, her unlocked Chevy Impala was found along Kentucky's Bluegrass Parkway with a flat tire, her belongings still inside. The Nelson County Sheriff officially named Crystal's boyfriend Houck a suspect in her disappearance in October of 2015. Houck's brother, who worked as a Bardstown police officer, was terminated from the department after officials say he interfered with the investigation into Crystal's disappearance. No official charges have been filed in connection with the case, but officials have said they believe Crystal is dead. If you have any information regarding Crystal's case, please contact the Nelson County Sheriff's Office at (502) 348-3211. </p>

                    <p> Seattle software engineer Jeremiah Foco was last seen on July 22, 2015, leaving his apartment in Seattle, Washington. Security footage shows the 34-year-old pulling into the garage of the complex in Seattle's International District at 12:07 a.m., but there is no confirmed video of him leaving the complex. Seattle police do not suspect foul play, but family and friends insist Jeremiah would not just simply disappear. There have been few clues as to what may have happened to Jeremiah, and police say the case remains open and active. If you have any information that may help bring Foco home, please contact the Seattle Police Department at (206) 625-5011. </p>

                    <p> On July 25, 2015, Diamond Bynum, 21, and her nephew, King Walker, 2, went missing from the house where Diamond lived with her stepmother and father, Eugene, in Gary, Indiana. The two reportedly had been taking a nap that afternoon, as had Diamond's stepmother. When her stepmother woke up, the two were gone. The family had recently moved to Gary with Diamond, who is described as mentally challenged. At their old home, Diamond was able to go on walks around their neighborhood because she knew the area. The family fears Diamond may have taken King on a walk and gotten lost. Family members have spent the past year and a half pleading with the public for any information they may have, but few clues have been uncovered. The Northwest Indiana Major Crimes Task Force is now investigating their disappearance. If you have any information regarding Diamond and King's cases, please contact the Gary Police Department at (219) 881-1260. </p>

                    <p> Caleb Diehl was last seen running errands for his employer on March 30, 2015, in and around Nocona, Texas. Caleb, 18 at the time, had borrowed a pickup truck from the employer, Ricky Dale Howard, who is also a family friend. The truck mysteriously reappeared just days later, its keys found on their proper hook at the business. Foul play has not been ruled out in the case, and Caleb's cell phone and social media accounts have not been used since he disappeared. Caleb's employer, Howard, was arrested in May of 2015 on an unrelated weapons charge. Officials had found several firearms when he gave them permission to search his properties after Caleb vanished. Then, in December 2015, Howard was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child. In January of this year, two more counts were filed after authorities in Montague County say a second victim came forward. A trial date has not yet been set. Officials have said Howard has not been cleared in connection with Caleb's disappearance, but he is just one of several people they have questioned in relation to the case. If you have any information regarding Caleb's case, please contact the Nocona Police Department at (940) 825-3281. </p>

                    <p> Travis Murrow was last seen on August 24, 2014, in Enid, Oklahoma. According to authorities, the father of four had texted several people that day saying he was in the Enid and Canton areas. Several days after family and friends stopped hearing from the 40-year-old, Murrow's truck was found abandoned near Canton Lake. The Alva Police Department requested assistance from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), which has since taken over the investigation. Few clues have been discovered in the case. Investigators have not ruled out foul play. A $5,000 reward offered by the Murrow family remains for information that brings Travis home. If you have any information regarding Travis's case, please call the OSBI hotline at (800) 522-8017. </p>

                    <p> Utah teen Macin Smith was last seen on September 1, 2015, leaving his St. George, Utah home for what his parents believed was another day of high school. The 17-year-old never showed up to Desert High School. All of his personal belongings, including his cell phone and wallet, were found at home. In the year since, family members have desperately searched for the teen, who police have classified as a juvenile runaway.

                    <p> The last time anyone saw Rebecca Henderson Paulk was the afternoon of Tuesday, September 8, 2015, at a local business in Meridian, Mississippi. She had spent Labor Day weekend at her parents' Alabama home. Several days after the 26-year-old was last seen, her vehicle was found abandoned in a rural area not far from her last known whereabouts. Inside were a number of her valuable personal items, including her laptop. There appeared to be a break in the case when police questioned John Bentley Poisso Jr., 57, after he was arrested on unrelated misdemeanor charges. He is now being considered a person of interest, as he was the last person known to have seen Rebecca before she vanished. He has not, however, been charged in the case. Rebecca's family continues to offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to Rebecca. If you have any information regarding Rebecca's case, please contact the Lauderdale County Sheriff's Department at (601) 482-9806. </p>

                    <p> High school teacher Christina Bastian was last seen in the early morning hours of November 1, 2015, at a friend's home near Apple Valley, California. Her belongings were later found strewn along Highway 247 near Lucerne Valley. Her truck was located, abandoned, on a dirt road. The next day, her maltipoo dog 'Coco' was found by a stranger nearly 70 miles from where the truck was located, but the connection between the two was not made until weeks later. In the year since Christina vanished, there have been few clues discovered in the case. Her mother, Cheryl Denny, continues to post in the Facebook page '<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161206011656/https://www.facebook.com/HelpFindChristinaBastian/">Help Find Christina Bastian</a>' and tirelessly searches for her daughter.

                    <p> It was on November 15, 2015, when nurse and mother Peggy McGuire, 29, dropped her son off at school near Eufaula, Oklahoma. She then headed back to the home she shared with the boy and his father, with whom she reportedly no longer had a romantic relationship. A grainy security video, captured the next morning around 5:00, shows Peggy's Toyota truck being parked at T&amp;J's Ice House, a rural bar along Highway 9. A dark, unidentified figure can be seen walking away from the vehicle through an early morning storm. In the year since, there have been few clues uncovered in the case.

                    <p> It was in the early morning hours of August 29, 2014, that Jake Latiolais told friends he was headed towards West Baton Rouge outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana. That was the last time anyone heard from the 22-year-old. Shortly after, police received an anonymous call about a person going over the railing of the Mississippi Ridge Bridge. Responding officers found Jake's truck running on the shoulder of the bridge and his cell phone on the pavement next to it. A dive team was called in, but nothing of significance was found. Officials have not ruled out foul play. Family members insist Jake would not simply disappear on his own or take his own life. If you have any information regarding Jake's case, please call the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office at (225) 389-8617. </p>

                    <p> Deanne Hastings left her fiancé a note the night of November 3, 2015, saying she was headed to the store. That was the last time anyone heard from her. She had just finished her last day of cosmetology school that afternoon. The following morning, her credit card was used at a store not too far from her home outside Spokane, Washington. Security video shows Deanne leaving the store around noon. Her car was later discovered parked in downtown Spokane. It appeared to have been left there the night she vanished. Inside were her purse, cell phone and wallet. Earlier this year, a man was arrested and charged with using Deanne's credit cards. He spent several months in jail and was released in September. Neither he, nor anyone else, has been charged in connection to Deanne's disappearance. If you have any information regarding Deanne's case, please call the Spokane Police Department at (509) 456-2233. </p>

                    <p> Nancy Bromet left her father's home in Sunrise, Florida on November 12, 2015, to head to Bakersfield, California with her boyfriend, a long-haul truck driver. Several days later, the 37-year-old called her sister Laura saying she was in distress and wanted to come home.

                    <p> Tyarra Williams was last seen the afternoon of January 7, 2016, walking in the parking lot of the apartment complex in Greensboro, North Carolina where she lived with her family. She left on foot to go see a friend, but never returned home. Officials have said the then 19-year-old disappeared under suspicious circumstances, but little information has been released in the case. Family members insist Tyarra would never have run away, and was planning to start classes soon on early childhood development at the Guilford Technical Community College nearby. If you have any information regarding Tyarra's case, please call the Greensboro Police Department at (336) 373-2287. </p>

                    <p> Donna Chatterton's home went up in flames on February 4, 2015. There were no remains found in the charred remnants of the home, but no one knew where Donna was. Authorities have said they believe the fire was accidental, most likely started by a space heater that was left on. However, officials believe Donna met with some type of foul play. Family members said authorities came close to charging someone in connection with Donna's disappearance, but there was not enough evidence to move forward. If you have any information regarding Donna's case, please call the Lee County Sheriff's Office at (239) 477-1810. </p>

                    <p> It's been nearly two years since grandmother Noemi Gonzalez disappeared from her North Miami, Florida home. Noemi, who is described as a pillar of her community, was last seen in the early morning hours of February 12, 2014. Her adult son, Pedrito, was staying with her at the time and awoke to find her missing. Her bed was unmade, the front door was unlocked, and her purse and cellphone were left inside. Few clues have ever been found in connection with the case. If you have any information regarding Noemi's case, please call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.

                    <p> Michael Vanzandt was last seen the evening of March 5, 2016, while out with friends in downtown Hermosa Beach, California. The Air Force veteran, and father of three, was going through a divorce, but family members said there were absolutely no red flags in his personal life that would have led to his disappearance. Because he is an avid swimmer, they fear he possibly headed towards the water for a late night dip. None of Michael's belongings were found on the beach, or anywhere for that matter. Authorities say the case is still active and ongoing. If you have any information regarding Michael's case, please call the Hermosa Beach Police Department at (310) 318-0360. </p>

                    <p> Morgan Bauer mysteriously vanished after she moved across the country from Aberdeen, South Dakota to Atlanta, Georgia. According to Sherri Sichmeller, Morgan's mother, the 19-year-old had arranged to stay with a man she met on Craigslist, offering to clean and do other chores until she settled into a job. But for an unknown reason, Morgan was reportedly kicked out of that temporary home and was living at a local motel. She stopped posting on social media, and last spoke with family members and friends, on February 29, 2016. Authorities continue to investigate Morgan's disappearance, but say they do not suspect foul play in the case. Morgan's mother Sherri vows to continue to search for Morgan until she hears from her daughter that she is somewhere safe. If you have any information regarding Morgan's case, please call the Atlanta Police Missing Person Unit at (404) 546-4235. </p>

                    <p> Texas friends Krislyn Gibson and Sidney Taylor, both 35 at the time, disappeared on April 2, 2016, while on a trip to Austin, Texas. The friends, who both live in Houston, were in town to attend the Urban Music Festival. They were staying with one of Sidney's cousins for the weekend. They headed to a club late that Friday night with a friend, but never returned. That friend was later arrested on unrelated firearms charge. The day after Krislyn and Sidney disappeared, Sidney's 2010 Dodge Charger was found abandoned in a parking lot in the Midtown district back in Houston. Krislyn is a single mother to a young son, and Sidney is a married father of four. Family and friends insist they wouldn't disappear on their own. If you have any information regarding Krislyn and Sidney's case, please call the Houston Police Department at (713) 308-3600 or Crime Stoppers at (713) 222-TIPS. </p>

                    <p> College student Martin Roberts was last seen on April 21, 2016, near the campus of Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. In the six or so months since he vanished, there have been very few clues as to what may have happened to the 19-year-old. Martin vanished without his cell phone and did not have access to a vehicle, which makes his disappearance all the more troubling to his family. Thousands continue to follow the Facebook group <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161206011656/https://www.facebook.com/groups/HelpFindMartinRoberts/">'Help Find Martin Roberts'</a>, where Martin's family posts updates, and others share words of encouragement. If you have any information regarding Martin's case, please call the Boone Police Department at (828) 268-6900. </p>

                    <p> It was Mother's Day this year when Kianna Galvin's mother Fiona had to report her 17-year-old daughter missing. Kianna was last seen around 12:30 p.m. on May 6, 2016, leaving her family's South Elgin, Illinois home. She told her younger sister she was headed to a nearby park to meet a friend and would return home in several hours. She never returned home, and her phone either was turned off or died later that afternoon. Authorities said the search continues to be active and ongoing, but few details are available to be released. A search warrant was executed in connection with the case several weeks after Kianna's disappearance on a property not far from the apartment complex where Kianna's family lives. Investigators were not able to release specifics on that development. Kianna's family continues to post on social media pleading for anyone with information to call police. If you have any information regarding Kianna's case, please call the South Elgin Police Department at (847) 741-2151. </p>

                    <p> It's been more than six months since mother-of-three Bianca Carrasco disappeared from her San Antonio, Texas home. The details of what happened the night of May 1, 2016, are sketchy, but when Bianca didn't show up for her job as an oncology nurse the next day, it was clear to family and friends something was wrong. According to Bianca's sister, Jovanna Burney, and close friend, Monica Nevarez, Bianca had recently told her husband she wanted a divorce and had met someone else. Foul play has not been ruled out in the case, but few clues have been uncovered. Family and friends continue to post almost daily on the Facebook page 'Help Find Bianca Carrasco.' If you have any information regarding Bianca's case, please call the San Antonio Police Department at (210) 207-7660. </p>

                    <p> Monique Figueroa told her family on May 19, 2015, that she was heading from her father's home in Littlerock, California to visit friends in Los Angeles. Police recovered her 2004 Mercedes abandoned in a rural area outside the city several days later. Forensic tests were conducted, but no clues to Monique's disappearance were uncovered. After an anonymous tip was phoned in, a search was conducted near Palmdale, California in June of this year, but nothing of significance was found. It was only one of several searches conducted over the past year in relation to the case. Foul play has not been ruled out. If you have any information regarding Monique's case, please call the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department at (323) 890-5500. </p>

Several drivers called 911 to report the vehicle on the shoulder and seeing a man described as white with light brown or red hair jumping out and running into the woods. The case continues to boggle the community and those who know Logan. More than 6,500 people are part of the Facebook group 'Logan Schiendelman Missing' and family members continue to post periodic updates on the case. Foul play has not been ruled in or out in the case, but Logan's loved ones said they cannot imagine that he would run away.

                    <p> Charlene Voight, 36, had just moved to Littleton, Colorado from her family's home in Southern California when she disappeared. The move, in part, was so she could finally be with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jeff Beir. The &quot;always happy&quot; blonde had just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in Landscape Architecture, and she was excited to start a new career. After not hearing from their daughter for several days, which was extremely unusual, Charlene's parents reported her missing on July 8, 2016. A few weeks after Charlene vanished, her boyfriend Beir was arrested on unrelated charges of sexual assault involving another woman. Several weeks ago, authorities began conducting a search of a landfill north of Denver in connection with the case. It's unclear what evidence, if any, was recovered. If you have any information regarding Charlene's case, please call the Littleton Police Department at (303) 794-1551. </p>

                    <p> A desperate search has continued since July for missing disabled teen Aleah Beckerle. The 19-year-old had suffered a stroke as an infant that left her almost completely immobile and in need of constant care. She was last seen on the night of July 17, 2016, at her family's Evansville, Indiana home. Aleah's mother told police when she awoke the next morning, Aleah was gone. Her wheelchair and daily medication were left behind. Authorities continue to actively investigate, and have questioned dozens of people in connection with the case. If you have any information regarding Aleah's whereabouts, please contact the Evansville Police Department at (812) 436-7979. </p>

                    <p> Shannah Boiteau was last seen on June 22, 2016, jumping, barefoot, out of a vehicle along Highway 94 outside St. Cloud, Minnesota. She then ran into the woods. The 23-year-old had been driving with her boyfriend at the time, who called Shannah's father Cleatus &quot;Bud&quot; Boiteau telling him the couple had an argument and Shannah had taken off into the woods. The police were called and officers searched the brush near where Shannah was seen by witnesses, but nothing was found. Shannah had recently broken the terms of her probation, and had left a note at her apartment, that reportedly said she was afraid she'd be sent back to jail and there were things she needed to take care of first. Very few clues have been discovered in the case. If you have any information regarding Shannah's case, please call the Chippewa Falls Police Department at (715) 723-4424 or the St. Cloud Police Department at (320) 251-1200. </p>

                    <p> The last time anyone saw paramedic Eric Pracht was just before midnight on July 22, 2016, outside his Lakewood, Colorado condominium. He and his fiancée had a group of friends over, and the talk turned to the recent police shootings from that month. Eric became upset, and he told his fiancée he needed to take a short walk and get some air. He never returned. Several searches have been conducted around the area he was last seen, but few clues have been uncovered. If you have any information regarding Eric's case, please call the Lakewood Police Department at (303) 987-7111. </p>

                    <p> Mother-of-two Keila Freeman was last seen the morning of September 6, 2016, at her home in the Hickory Hill neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee. The 29-year-old's husband, Randall Freeman, told investigators he last saw his wife around 3:30 a.m. that morning when she returned home. He said she pulled her car into the garage, but she not come inside. He called Keila's mother around 6:00 a.m. saying he could not find her. Keila's car keys were still in the ignition of her car and her purse was inside the house on the coffee table. In a twist police say is unrelated, Keila's husband Freeman was arrested on charges of arson for throwing a flaming object into the home of a family of five several days after his wife vanished. The relationship between Randall and that family is not clear. Authorities have called Keila's disappearance suspicious and have not ruled out foul play. If you have any information regarding Keila's case, please call the Memphis Police Department at (901) 636-3300. </p>

                    <p> The last time anyone heard from Shadow McClaine, also known as Branice Willis, was through a text message to her mother the evening of September 2, 2016. The Fort Campbell solider had told her mom that she was supposed to house sit for a friend. The following day, Shadow didn't pick up her phone and there were no texts or phone calls to any family or friends that weekend. Authorities located her 2013 silver Hyundai Elentra the following week in a parking lot in downtown Nashville. In late October, authorities announced that two Fort Campbell soldiers were being held as persons of interest in Shadow's disappearance. It was also uncovered that Shadow's ex-husband, Jamal McCray Williams, was booked into the Montgomery County Jail on an out-of-state warrant. It's unclear if he is one of the persons of interest in connection with the case. If you have any information regarding Shadow's case, please call the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command at (270) 798-9406. </p>

                    <p> It was in the small town of Alpine, Texas the night of October 11, 2016, when Zuzu Verk reportedly went on a date to the movies with on-again, off-again boyfriend, Robert Fabian. The details of that night are hazy at best, but Zuzu stopped responding to texts the following day. When someone checked the 22-year-old's apartment, she wasn't there. Massive searches have been conducted since Zuzu's disappearance, and the reward for her safe return has been increased to $200,000. Fabian has been named a suspect in Zuzu's disappearance, and some of his family members and friends are being called persons of interest as well, according to authorities. A grand jury was convened early in November in connection with the case, but no charges have been filed. If you have any information regarding Zuzu's case, please call the Alpine Police Department at (432) 837-3486. </p>

                    <p> The last images of Cecilia Cabrera were captured on surveillance footage from the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California. It was just before 1:00 a.m. on June 9, 2016, when the 31-year-old was seen leaving the casino in her dark grey Chevrolet Malibu. Several hours later, a call came in to the California State Highway Patrol that a burning vehicle had been discovered in an orchard near Goshen, about 30 miles away from the casino. Cecilia was last seen with her husband, Francisco Valdivia. Valdivia was later arrested on unrelated drug charges. Authorities have not cleared him in connection with Cecilia's disappearance. If you have any information regarding Cecilia's case, please call the Tulare County Sheriff's Department at (559) 735-1880. </p>

                    <p> Brandon Herring was last heard from on November 22, 2016. His mother, Rhonda Herring, spoke with him around 1:00 p.m. that day to check in, and he told her he was out and loved her. Nothing seemed amiss about the conversation. When she called back 15 minutes later to ask him another question, his phone was off. After no one else was able to get ahold of him, and he didn't return to the family home in Raytown, Missouri, family members reported him missing. Several days later, a woman called saying she saw Brandon sitting on the steps of the Park Meadows Apartment complex in Kansas City. Family members went to the complex, where they say they found several shell casings and a shot in window. It's unclear if the scene there is connected in any way to Brandon's disappearance. If you have any information regarding Brandon's case, please call the Kansas City, Missouri Tips line at (816) 474-8477. </p>

                    <p> Kristy Porter, mother of two, disappeared on November 11, 2016, after leaving a fundraiser at Peppermill Casino in Reno, Nevada. The fundraiser, which her husband Paul's company helped run, was to raise money for the local Boys and Girls Club. Kristy reportedly got into a taxi around 8:00 p.m. that evening, but never returned to their home in Sparks. The couple's children were being watched that evening by Kristy's uncle. Paul says when he returned home, the uncle said he had not seen Kristy. Family members are insistent that Kristy would not have left her children on her own. If you have any information regarding Kristy's whereabouts, please contact the Sparks Police Department at (775) 353-2231. </p>
