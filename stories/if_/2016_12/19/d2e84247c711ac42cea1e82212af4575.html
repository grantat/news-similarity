Though the average rate of ice growth was faster than normal for the month, over five days in mid-November the ice cover lost more than 19,000 square miles, a decline that the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado called “almost unprecedented” for that time of year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="1660">In the southern Beaufort Sea, where Kaktovik’s 260 residents occupy one square mile on the northeast corner of Barter Island, sea ice loss has been especially precipitous.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="1978">The continuing loss of sea ice does not bode well for polar bears, whose existence depends on an ice cover that is rapidly thinning and melting as the climate warms.

Men from the whaling crews had dumped the carcass of a bowhead whale on the pile earlier in the day. As two visitors watch from the safety of a pickup truck a few hundred yards away, the bears devour the leftover meat and blubber.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="5987">The Inupiat people, who have been whaling here for thousands of years, believe that a whale gives itself to the crew that captures it. Once the animal’s body is pulled to shore, water is poured over it to free its spirit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="6220">Even a few decades ago, most polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea remained on the ice year-round or, if they did come to shore, stopped only briefly. The sea ice gave them ready access to seals, the staple of their high-fat diet.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="6633">But as the climate has warmed, the spring thaw has come earlier and the fall freeze later. The pack ice that was once visible from Kaktovik even in summertime has retreated hundreds of miles offshore, well beyond the southern Beaufort’s narrow continental shelf. The edge of the pack ice is now over deep water, where seals are few and far between and the distance to land is a long swim, even for a polar bear.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="544" data-total-count="7177">As a result, researchers have found, a larger proportion of the bears in the southern Beaufort region are choosing to spend time on shore: an average of 20 percent compared with 6 percent two decades earlier, according to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161219050444/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155932" title="Journal abstract.">a recently published study</a> by Dr. Atwood of the Geological Survey and his colleagues that tracked female bears with radio collars.

I will Photoshop them when I get home.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="8910">Susan Trucano, who arrived in early September with her son, Matthew, said they wanted to see polar bears in the wild before they were driven to extinction.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="145" data-total-count="9055">“It was an urgency to come here,” Ms. Trucano said. “My fear was that we would lose the opportunity of seeing these magnificent animals.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="532" data-total-count="9587">The increasing tourism has been a financial boon for some people in Kaktovik, but it has upset others. Tourists take up seats on the small commercial flights in and out of the village during the fall months when the bears are there, crowding out residents who need to fly to Anchorage or Fairbanks. And some visitors wander through town snapping pictures without asking permission, or get in the way of the rituals that accompany the whale hunt. Last year, an intrusive tourist nearly came to blows with one of the whaling captains.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="9907">For the most part, polar bears and people have coexisted peacefully here. Village residents are tolerant of the bears — “They could break right in here, but they know the rules,” said Merlyn Traynor, a proprietor of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161219050444/http://waldoarmshotel.com//" title="Web site.">Waldo Arms Hotel</a> — and with the whale remains, they have little reason to come after humans.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-7">Continue reading the main story</a>
