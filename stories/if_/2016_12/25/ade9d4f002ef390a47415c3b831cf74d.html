<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="341">WASHINGTON — Realizing that his presidency could face potentially crippling questions over conflicts of interest, Donald J.

Many ethics experts still say the only way Mr. Trump can eliminate his most serious conflicts is to liquidate his company, and then put the money into a blind trust — a move Mr. Trump has so far rejected as impractical and unreasonable.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a>
