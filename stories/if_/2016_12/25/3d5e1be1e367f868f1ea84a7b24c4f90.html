<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="223">The Rev. Roderick Dwayne Belin, a senior A.M.E. Church leader, stood before a gathering of more than 1,000 pastors in a drafty Marriott ballroom in Naperville, Ill., this month and extolled the virtues of a Hollywood movie.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="531">“Imagine this clip playing to your congregation, perhaps tied to a theological discussion about our sacred lives and our secular lives and how there is really no division,” he said, before showing the trailer for “Hidden Figures,” which 20th Century Fox will release in theaters nationwide on Jan. 6.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="612" data-total-count="1143">The film has no obvious religious message. Rather, it is a feel-good drama about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960s. But Fox — working with a little-known firm called Wit PR, which pitches movies to churches — sought out Mr. Belin to help sell “Hidden Figures” as an aspirational story about women who have faith in themselves. He became a proponent after a visit to the movie’s set in Atlanta, where Wit PR invited seven influential pastors to watch filming and hang out with stars like Kevin Costner and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/02/cookie_monster_how_cookie_lyon_became_the_most_compelling_character_on_tv/">Taraji P.

But movie studios and their partners have quietly — very quietly, sometimes to the degree of a black ops endeavor — been building deep connections to Christian filmgoers who dwell elsewhere on the spectrum of politics and social values. In doing so, they have tapped churches, military groups, right-leaning bloggers and, particularly, a fraternity of marketing specialists who cut their teeth on overtly religious movies but now put their influence behind mainstream works like “Frozen,” “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/movies/the-conjuring-puts-lili-taylor-in-a-haunted-house.html">The Conjuring</a>,” “Sully” and “Hidden Figures.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a>

Trump, have realized the degree to which they are out of touch with a vast pool of Americans. Tens of millions of voters did not care what stars had to say in support of Mrs. Clinton.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="2869">Are those voters also ignoring the likes of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.alternet.org/environment/leonardo-dicaprio-vote-leaders-who-understand-science-and-urgency-climate-change">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/democratic-national-convention-watch-meryl-streep-speech-hillary-clinton-914727">Meryl Streep</a> when they promote movies?

Despite a growing population, North America’s moviegoing has been more or less flat — not exactly what investors want to hear. Last year, 1.32 billion tickets were sold, up from the year before but down from the 10-year high of 1.42 billion in 2009, according to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MPAA-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-2015_Final.pdf">Motion Picture Association of America</a>. More troubling, cheaper and more convenient in-home entertainment options are threatening the grip that multiplexes have long had on young adults; the number of frequent moviegoers ages 12 to 24 has fallen for three consecutive years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="3903">Hollywood is under pressure to reverse that trend. Churches may seem like an unusual path toward young people, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.pewforum.org/2010/02/17/religion-among-the-millennials/">41 percent of millen</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.pewforum.org/2010/02/17/religion-among-the-millennials/">n</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.pewforum.org/2010/02/17/religion-among-the-millennials/">ials</a> engage in some form of daily prayer, according to a 2010 Pew Research paper. To reach them, many ministers have built vast social media networks. The Rev. Jamal H. Bryant, a megachurch pastor in Baltimore, has 250,000 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/https://twitter.com/jamalhbryant">followers on Twitter</a>.

That tactic is still used for summer blockbusters, but it is expensive and increasingly ineffective in the DVR age. As a result, studios are aggressively trying to plumb niche markets that can be reached through word of mouth.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="4442">“Someone like Jamal Bryant, because he has such a prodigious network online, becomes a pipeline to other youth pastors,” said the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.phillytrib.com/lifestyles/religion/mitchell-installed-as-salem-baptist-pastor/article_a714324e-c858-58ce-82b0-20ce2854cefa.html">Rev.

Last month, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced the introduction of Light TV, a faith and family broadcast network. Other media companies are considering the creation of faith-based streaming services, essentially Netflix for the pious.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="551" data-total-count="6703">At the same time, consultants are refining their efforts. Kevin Goetz, the chief executive of the movie research company Screen Engine/ASI, recently initiated a proprietary Faith Tracker that monitors moviegoing in a sample of 800 people — evangelical, traditional Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon and those whom he calls “spiritual but not necessarily religious.” It’s a tool designed to help studios understand whether their faith-based advertising and publicity efforts are connecting with the target audience before a film’s release.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="6971">An even bolder Screen Engine/ASI initiative involves a 1,000-member “influencer” service made up of movie-attuned pastors.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="8615">For instance, Fox broadly positioned <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/movies/review-the-revenant-welcome-to-paradise-now-prepare-to-fall.html">“The Revenant”</a> as bloody revenge thriller, but Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Pons emphasized themes of man’s inhumanity toward his fellow man and honor versus greed. The R-rated movie collected $533 million worldwide for Fox.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="8898">“It’s amazing watching people in Hollywood discover there is interest in their content they never knew existed,” Mr. Pons said. “On the faith side, some people are surprised to learn that, hey, there is good content coming from studios. Hollywood isn’t always the enemy.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="450" data-total-count="9348">Movie executives tend to view the Christian audience as monolithic. It is not, of course. That may be why<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/movies/russell-crowe-confronts-lifes-nasty-weather-in-noah.html"> “Noah”</a> sold fewer tickets in 2014 than Paramount had hoped. The studio figured the big-budget movie about the biblical figure would attract religious viewers en masse, but “Noah” <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/movies/noah-floats-to-top-of-the-box-office.html">landed poorly</a> with more literal interpreters of Scripture, who objected to the film’s depiction of fallen angels as “Transformers”-style rock monsters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="9671">The increasing number of consultants arriving in Hollywood to help forestall such problems — for fees starting at about $300,000 per film and going up to $3 million — is also leading to gridlock at church offices. Some megachurch pastors, for instance, complain that they are being inundated with film-related requests.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="9932">“Nobody wants to feel used, and sometimes the movie business acts like people of faith are there to be turned on and off as the marketers see fit,” said DeVon Franklin, an ordained minister, an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://producedbyfaith.com/index.asp">author and a</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://producedbyfaith.com/index.asp">producer</a> of films like “Miracles From Heaven.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="495" data-total-count="10427">Undoubtedly aware of that perception, studios try to keep a tight lid on their efforts, sometimes even insisting that no faith outreach is happening on behalf of a film, when there is actually a coordinated effort. Studios live in equal fear that obvious appeals to religious audiences will alienate more secular ticket buyers. Almost all studio executives contacted for this article rejected repeated interview requests, citing policies not to publicly discuss marketing strategies of any kind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="10752">But the basic rules in selling a film are the same, said Jonathan Bock, the founder of Grace Hill, which has quietly marketed movies to spiritually minded people, including <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/movies/man-of-steel-depicts-a-striving-stranger-in-a-strange-land.html">“Man of Steel.”</a> “What religious people want most when they go to the movies, like people who aren’t religious, is to be entertained,” he said.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="10991" id="story-continues-8">For decades, religious audiences had little tolerance for many of the movies produced by Hollywood. By the 1990s, when films like Quentin Tarantino’s violent “Pulp Fiction” entered the mainstream, the culture gap seemed unbridgeable.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="472" data-total-count="11463">But a pronounced swing toward family fare, helped by a growing overseas appetite for animation and PG- or PG-13-rated superhero fantasies, opened the door to new connections between Hollywood and faith audiences. If “The Passion of the Christ” showed that a mass audience existed for overt religious stories on screen, “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/movies/20blindside.html">The Blind Side</a>,” a 2009 family sports drama about a young black man taken in by a white family, showed the promise of less obvious storytelling.</p><figure class="promo media video embedded layout-large-horizontal " data-videoid="100000003383178" data-media-action="modal" data-autoplay="false" data-embedded="false" data-adsensitivity="" data-live="false" aria-label="media" role="group">

Mr. Bock and Grace Hill circulated film clips and sermon outlines to 22,000 pastors, some of whom preached its story of personal determination and racial conciliation. One suggested “sermon starter” involved a scene where the lead character, played by Sandra Bullock, abruptly persuades her husband to stop their car and offer a young man a ride.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="53" data-total-count="11960">“Has God ever nudged your heart?” the notes read.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="495" data-total-count="12455">Mr. Bock, who is Presbyterian, is credited with being the first Hollywood marketer to realize that churches had started to install enormous screens to use during their services, sometimes just to display hymn lyrics. More recently, $35,000 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.churchproduction.com/story/main/is-an-led-video-wall-in-your-churches-future">video walls</a> have become more common in sanctuaries. “It makes church feel more contemporary,” Mr. Bock said, adding that ministers are becoming adept at “building vibrant social media communities that expand their reach far beyond Sunday morning.”</p><figure id="media-100000004837672" class="media photo embedded layout-small-vertical media-100000004837672" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/25/business/25FAITHJP4/25FAITHJP4-master180.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="550" data-total-count="13005">Sony’s faith-based unit, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.affirmfilms.com/">Affirm Films</a>, has lately been working to tap Christian audiences overseas, an area that studios have largely ignored. “There are pockets of evangelical Protestants around the world, but it takes a lot of preplanning,” said <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://variety.com/2013/biz/exec-shuffle-people-news/rich-peluso-upped-to-senior-veep-of-affirm-films-exclusive-1200560060/">Rich Peluso</a>, a Sony executive vice president. “You have to develop a relationship with them.” In some cases, Sony has bypassed film distributors and made release deals for dramas like the prayer-focused “War Room” with Christian media companies in countries including Italy and Australia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="13185">“People are sometimes surprised to find me, a conservative Christian guy, working in Hollywood,” Mr. Peluso said. “There are a lot of us, actually. More than people think.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="13387">“Hidden Figures,” produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, has been marketed with all of the usual Hollywood bells and whistles.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="466" data-total-count="13853">A trailer came out in August. In September, Fox staged <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/movies/12pharrell-tarajiphenson-toronto.html?_r=0">a publicity stunt</a> at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/toronto_international_film_festival/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the Toronto International Film Festival." class="meta-classifier">Toronto International Film Festival</a>, showing 20 minutes of the film followed by a free concert by Pharrell Williams, who contributed to the score.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="23" data-total-count="13876" id="story-continues-9">So why also employ Wit?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="14161">Elizabeth Gabler, the president of Fox 2000, the studio division behind “Hidden Figures,” said in a statement, “Corby and Marshall help to locate these important faith audiences and leaders who are hungry for aspirational content without feeling like they are going to church.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="489" data-total-count="14650">Mr. Mitchell, 46, and Mr. Pons, 39, went to work early last year, reading the “Hidden Figures” script, written by Theodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder (and based on Margot Lee Shetterly’s book). They decided that this film, because it was not overtly religious, needed to be “poured with Dixie cups instead of buckets,” as Mr. Pons put it. Translation: Spread the word by facilitating discussion rather than hammering home a message through blanket ads in Christian publications.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="14965">“We see this as a healing movie,” Mr. Mitchell said. “At a moment when so many people — right and left, black and white — are arguing over what America is or what America isn’t, here is a chance to come together in a theater and look up, to space quite literally in this case, but metaphorically too.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="524" data-total-count="15489">Wit PR operates with one foot inside Hollywood and one foot out. Mr. Pons, lanky and self-deprecating, lives in Los Angeles with his wife and is the five-person company’s primary contact with studios. He works from a home office. Prone to folksy sayings that charm the slick Hollywood crowd — “your cheese done slid off your cracker” is a frequent one and means “you’re out of your mind” — Mr. Pons grew up in the rural North Carolina hills, where his parents run the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.lifeisrelationships.com/">Christian Training Center International</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="397" data-total-count="15886">Mr. Mitchell, quick-witted and single, operates from an office near the historic Salem Baptist Church in Jenkintown, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb; he has served as the church’s pastor since 2012. He sometimes speaks with the fiery conviction of a preacher but has a secular background. His résumé includes a stint as a senior enrollment and operations official at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://wilberforce.edu/">Wilberforce University</a> in Ohio.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="382" data-total-count="16268">The two men met in Washington. Mr. Mitchell, already at Wilberforce, had served as chief of staff to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://allencathedral.org/about-us/allen-ame-floyd-flake/">Rev. Floyd Flake</a>, then a New York congressman and now senior pastor at a Queens megachurch. Mr. Pons was a young aide to a North Carolina congressman, helping him to scrutinize public relations efforts around the Iraq war, work that ended up as part of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1118-10.htm">a Rolling Stone expos</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161225054501/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1118-10.htm">é</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="16527">In 2008, along with a third friend, they formed a publicity company called Different Drummer. Mr. Pons and Mr. Mitchell split from that firm in 2014 and founded Wit PR, picking a name that is meant to convey smarts but also stands for “whatever it takes.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="16887">That kind of gumption was recently on display on a Wit PR conference call. The principals were going through a list of “activations” planned for “Hidden Figures.” Mr. Mitchell announced that he had just arranged with two Christian sororities to bring students and alumnae together for “Hidden Figures” screenings and discussions on opening weekend.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="17052">“Through those faith relationships, we’re going to end up selling at least 1,000 tickets,” he said. “Delivering a measurable result like that is the goal.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
