He is replacing Archbishop John J.

But perhaps it should not have. For what his unassuming bearing does not reveal is that he is no stranger to the corridors of power in the church. He is a friend of Pope Francis. And under Francis’ predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, he had helped lead the Vatican office that oversees the roughly one million men and women in religious orders around the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="3310">That position did not end so well. It was an open secret that Cardinal Tobin was sent to Indiana as a kind of exile most likely because he questioned an inquiry by his office into supposed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161223232829/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/us/02nuns.html">doctrinal lapses</a> among the roughly 50,000 nuns in the United States.

With the help of a trainer, Shane Moat, he learned how to deadlift 425 pounds. “Big breath, explode, keep it close,” Mr. Moat coached him earlier this month. Cardinal Tobin strained and hoisted the weight to his waist. “You the man!” someone shouted.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="11687">“No, I’m not,” Cardinal Tobin said after dropping the weight with a bang.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="12041">That morning, Mr. Yeary, the salesman, presented him with a goodbye gift: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161223232829/https://twitter.com/joetobin">a framed photo</a> of the cardinal with his seven workout buddies, whose ages range from 27 to over 70. “Oh, man, that’s wonderful, thank you,” the cardinal said. Then he reverted to his lighthearted tone: “None of those Sopranos are going to mess with me. This is my crew.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="310" data-total-count="12351">Cardinal Tobin has had a hard time saying goodbye. He choked up at his farewell Mass and had only one request of the congregation that had packed the cathedral: Pray for him. But his admirers here and elsewhere are hoping that Cardinal Tobin will become a more public voice for Pope Francis and his priorities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="12510">He has already done that once, in a showdown with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican who is now the vice president-elect, over welcoming Syrian refugees.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="12884">In November 2015, Mr. Pence announced that he would suspend Syrian refugee resettlement programs, citing security fears. Cardinal Tobin felt that was not only illegal, but also immoral. He met with Mr. Pence, discussed his objections and told him he would continue the Catholic Charities resettlement program. A federal court has since overturned the governor’s directive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="138" data-total-count="13022">In an email, Mr. Pence said, “Cardinal Tobin is a personal friend, and I deeply respect his commitment to his faith and his ministry.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="13244">While Cardinal Tobin did not tell anyone whom to vote for in the presidential election, he said he was disturbed by appeals to fear during the campaign of Donald J. Trump, particularly his views of refugees and immigrants.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="13493">Mr. Trump, he said, “was appealing to the dark side of the divisive forces, to the unredeemed part of us.” And while the cardinal believes American democracy will ultimately resist such appeals, “you can’t be too Pollyannish about things.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-10">Continue reading the main story</a>

One of his priorities, he said, would be to ensure that the archdiocese is fully compliant with church and criminal protocols on handling sexual abuse allegations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="382" data-total-count="15220">At the Vatican in the late 1990s, the cardinal recalled, it was difficult to convince people that the abuse issue was serious. “I think they just believed it was an American problem,” he said, adding, “I don’t want to make it like I was a great crusader over there, but I did take it seriously.” He later led an effort to establish protocols for abuse claims in his order.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="15590">Yet the most outspoken American victims group, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161223232829/http://www.snapnetwork.org/">Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests</a>, said that Cardinal Tobin, like the church as a whole, must do more, such as posting the names of all credibly accused priests online. “Certainly there are worse bishops, but that fact should comfort no one,” David Clohessy, the organization’s national director, said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="15865">Cardinal Tobin assumes his role in an uneasy time. He said that he hoped to lead with joy and transparency, and that he intended to encourage dialogue to bridge divisions. But he would go further if he believed that policies ran counter to the moral values that Jesus taught.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="16136">On the threats by President-elect Trump to carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants, for example, Cardinal Tobin was clear. He recalled how Pope John XXIII, before he became pope, issued false baptismal certificates to help Jews escape the Nazis in World War II.</p><div id="story-ad-8" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">
