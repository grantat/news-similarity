Ahead of and behind Mr. Langer were voters who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote, Mr. Trump said, according to the staff members — but they were nonetheless permitted to cast provisional ballots. The president threw out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from. … The anecdote, the aides said, was greeted with silence, and Mr. Trump was prodded to change the subject by [Reince Priebus] and [John Cornyn] … In the emerging Trump era, the story was a memorable example, for the legislators and the country, of how an off-the-cuff yarn — unverifiable and of confusing origin — became a prime policy mover for a president whose fact-gathering owes more to the oral tradition than the written word.”</p> <p><strong>-- If it's possible that millions of illegal votes were cast, isn't it possible that such massive fraud could have&nbsp;also helped him? No, says Trump. In fact, zero illegal votes were cast for him, he told ABC last night.</strong> “Of those votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of 'em come to me,” Trump said.

In the scuffle, U.S. mayors have emerged as key players in the resistance to Trump’s agenda. At the center of the sanctuary city debate is a disagreement over whether local police officers should be required to help immigration officials enforce federal immigration laws.

A number of Latin American analysts have suggested over the past year that it's useful to view Trump through the lens of the ‘<em>caudillo</em>,’ or strongman.

Hall retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 2015 after 30 years. Most of Hall’s career was spent abroad, running covert operations in the countries of the former Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact. He writes <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170126232138/https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/strategic-view/its-win-win-win-scenario-russia-1090">in a piece for The Cipher Brief</a>: “The list of wins for the Russians in the wake of the hacks, despite the fact that in the end, they have been found out, is significant. While there may be even more benefits down the road, a brief tally gives a general sense for how well the Russians have done.” Four examples:</p> <p><strong>Disruption of the American political system:</strong> “Disrupting the U.S. is usually Putin’s default setting (see also: Syria), because Putin believes that which weakens the U.S., usually strengthens Russia. Remember, Putin views democracy as an existential threat to his regime, and the more distracted the U.S. is with internal political matters, the less it will be fomenting color revolutions and attempting to unseat dictators (e.g. Assad). Cracks in the U.S. political system – especially in a bedrock piece of it like elections – also plays to a favorite Kremlin theme, namely that democracy is a fatally flawed, hypocritical system, and that autocracies, such as Russia’s or China’s, are no worse, and in many ways better.”</p> <p><strong>Disrupting and discrediting the U.S. intelligence system:</strong> “It is difficult to imagine Putin himself doing a better job of scripting what Trump has said about the U.S. Intelligence Community in the wake of the hacks. … This is a win on two levels for Putin. First … Russians always believe that U.S. intelligence enjoys much more political power than it really does. So Putin probably believes the CIA, NSA, and FBI have been badly hobbled, and their influence with the White House seriously eroded. Second, on an emotional level, it must please the former KGB officer in Putin to see his arch enemies take hits from the incoming president. Morale, the Kremlin probably assumes, must be low inside U.S. intelligence. This can only be good for Russia.”</p> <p><strong>Recognition of Russia as an equal, at least on cyber: </strong>“It is worth recalling that a great deal of what drives Russian foreign policy is Putin, and Russia’s need to feel they are strategic players on the world stage. … Search on your computer how many times senior Russian officials use terms like ‘respecting Russia’ and ‘Russia is a great power.’”</p> <p><strong>Intense American focus on the hack, not the larger influence operation: “</strong>The hacking of the DNC, as well as other targets in the U.S., has caused a great dust storm of media and public attention on all things cyber, which is excellent news for the other, arguably more important parts of the much larger Russian influence operation.”</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo"> <img class="zoom-in" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20170126232138im_/https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/d7f5dce541927220a095abd1d588f180-908-724-Visa_Program0190f.jpg"> <div class="pb-caption"> Mike Rounds at work in Sioux Falls.

He plans to do so with at least one full committee hearing. … Following that, at an undetermined point in the future, the plan is to hand off the day-to-day of that investigation to the head of a new cyber-security subcommittee.”</p> <p><strong>Backstory: Lindsey Graham was supposed to chair this new subcommittee</strong>. BUT it would have been his third gavel, so under the conference rules he’d need to get a waiver from GOP leadership. They might not have wanted to give someone willing to criticize the president a bigger platform to highlight Trump’s links to Russia. So McCain is giving the spot to Rounds, but he’s also giving himself a spot on the subcommittee.</p> <p><strong>Rounds will not have a free hand: </strong>In an interview with Karoun, Rounds said he has confidence in the new administration because of James Mattis as Pentagon chief. <strong>Rounds also said that he is “not looking for a fight” with the Trump administration, </strong>but added that he is prepared “to go wherever the information takes us,” promising “we’re going to get results.”</p> <p><strong>The obscure South Dakotan has lobbied for cyber security responses in relatively quiet anonymity</strong>, <strong>but his signature mark in the arena is the current law, passed as part of a massive defense bill last year, insisting the Pentagon define when a cyber breach or attack constitutes an act of war. </strong>“His goal now is to craft policy describing what to do in the event of a cyber attack,” Karoun reports. “He would not outline his ideal terms, pledge to fully publicize the results or endorse new sanctions on Russia. … But Rounds said that would-be hackers and adversaries should understand there will be ‘serious repercussions’ for anyone trying in the future to interfere with an election through cyberspace.”</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:</strong></p> <p>First, Lindsey Graham made an #alternativefacts joke:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mainstream media misses scoop of the year - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170126232138/https://twitter.com/TheOnion">@TheOnion</a> nails it.

Trump complains that Zucker should be programming CNN more favorably toward him because of their long relationship, which can be traced back to 2004 when Zucker put The Apprentice on NBC. <strong>Trump has also said … Zucker owes him because Trump helped get him the job at CNN.</strong> According to CNN sources, Trump’s claim that he assisted Zucker in landing the top job at the network is false. Trump seems to have gotten the idea because he praised Zucker to Turner Broadcasting’s then-CEO Phil Kent at a charity dinner in the fall of 2012, a few months before CNN hired Zucker. But CNN sources say Turner had already decided to hire Zucker ... ‘This is entirely personal,’ one CNN high-level source said. ‘Trump thinks just because he’s known Jeff that CNN should be covering him like Fox News does.’”</p> <p><strong>-- Bloomberg Businessweek, “</strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170126232138/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-uber-airbnb-99-billion-idea/"><strong>The Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World</strong></a><strong>," by Brad Stone:</strong> “In January 2009 the three founders of a little-known website called Airbedandbreakfast.com decided at the last minute to attend the inauguration of Barack Obama.
