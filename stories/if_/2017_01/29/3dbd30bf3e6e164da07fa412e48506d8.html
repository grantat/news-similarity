<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="512" data-total-count="2965" id="story-continues-3">Mr. Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for deep-seated insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="534" data-total-count="3499">Nearly 30 years ago, in his best-selling book “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html">“truthful hyperbole,”</a> which he described as “an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.” It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="592" data-total-count="4091">Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s cascade of falsehoods was “a direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy” in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/alternative-facts-trump-brand.html">“alternative facts”</a> on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell’s “1984,” in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="4418">“In a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,” Mr. Schmidt said. “All authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="4648">Mr. Lewis argued that the president’s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation’s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. “Fact-checking becomes an act of war by the media,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="599" data-total-count="5247">Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C.I.A. employees that he had <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html">“a running war with the media”</a> and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth.” The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to “delegitimize” the new president and promised, “We are not going to sit around and let it happen.” By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html">“the opposition party”</a> during an interview with The New York Times.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="72" data-total-count="5319">“It feels like this was part of the plan all along,” Mr. Lewis said.</p><figure id="media-100000004899687" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004899687 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/29/us/29Trumptruths-2/29Trumptruths-2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="525" data-total-count="5844">Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s brazen willingness to deny “objective reality” had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. “I don’t know that he is doing it strategically,” she said, “but it certainly had the impact of a magician’s sleight of hand.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="709" data-total-count="6553">Deception, dissembling, exaggeration — what <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/http://fortune.com/2000/04/03/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/">Fortune magazine called</a> his “astonishing ability to prevaricate” — has deep roots in Mr. Trump’s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/politics/trump-university.html">Trump University students who said they had been defrauded</a>, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to small-time contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="702" data-total-count="7255" id="story-continues-4">In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a “spurious” lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump’s denials, there was “strong evidence” he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had “handpicked” each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="518" data-total-count="7773">The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="8193">Once he stepped into the political arena, however, fact-checking operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/">has scrutinized 356</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129001039/http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/"> specific claims</a> by Mr. Trump and found that more than two-thirds of the claims were “mostly false,” “false” or, in 62 cases, “Pants on Fire” false.</p><figure class="promo media video embedded layout-large-horizontal " data-videoid="100000004888922" data-media-action="modal" data-autoplay="false" data-embedded="false" data-adsensitivity="" data-live="false" aria-label="media" role="group">
