That’s why Mr. Pruitt is the first E.P.A. nominee from either party that the Environmental Defense Fund has opposed in our 50-year history.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="4183">Some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases, environmental protection is probably not one of them.
