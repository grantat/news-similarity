                    When the New Horizons space probe flew by Pluto in 2015, it picked up something strange: a big red spot on the north pole of Charon, Pluto&#x27;s largest moon. By modeling the temperatures of Pluto and Charon over time, scientists discovered that the red spot was caused by gases in Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere getting frozen at Charon&#x27;s poles.
