He was 26 and she was 23. The ceremony took place at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Fredonia, the town in western New York where the bride had grown up. The bridegroom was from Jamestown. They were married Sept. 10, by the Rev. T. P. Tyler. The announcement was a mere sentence, a bare-bones beginning for a Times institution.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">So why were John and Sarah the chosen ones?</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Based on old newspaper clippings and census reports, it appears that the Mulletts were a prominent family in Fredonia. The bride’s father, James, epitomized upward mobility. He grew up on a farm in Vermont, the oldest of 13 children, and made his way to Fredonia, where he became a self-taught lawyer (such a thing was possible in those days). He eventually became a State Supreme Court justice.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">The bridegroom was a cousin of Ulysses S. Grant, then an Army lieutenant, who would go on to become a general and president.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Today, oil portraits of John and Sarah hang side by side in the New Haven family room of Wendy Grant Haskell, 63, who is a psychotherapist and the Grants’ great-great-granddaughter. Each is wearing black, and a similarly dour and humorless expression, as if they had whispered to each other beforehand, “Don’t smile!”</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">“I think they are trying to project importance, status and prestige,” Ms. Haskell said, adding that the portraits were probably painted soon after the wedding.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">(When I first called Ms. Haskell to inquire about John and Sarah Grant, she was flummoxed; I think she thought I was trying to sell her a Times subscription. When I explained my reason for calling, she said she had no idea the Grants had appeared in the newspaper’s first wedding announcement. “What a hoot!”)</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1851/09/18/109921024.html?pageNumber=4"><em><strong>See the announcement in the first issue of The New-York Daily Times.</strong></em></a></p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Her brother David Marshall Grant, an actor you might recognize from “The Devil Wears Prada&quot; or his Tony-nominated performance as Joe Pitt in &ldquo;Angels in America,&rdquo; said: “I would guess, looking at those portraits, that it was a less joyful time. I’m sure there were struggles just to get by. I can’t imagine what it was like just to make breakfast. I’m angry when there’s a line at Starbucks.”</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">John and Sarah Grant’s lives probably did not turn out exactly as they envisioned. After the wedding, they settled in Jamestown, where John was co-owner of a grocery store dealing in tea, fruit, molasses and salt, among other products. Sarah kept house, according to the census, and had a live-in Irish servant. The couple had one son, James Mullett Grant, who married and also had one son, Havens Grant. Then, sometime before the turn of the century, James Mullett Grant traveled alone to Havana and never returned.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">“John and Sarah Grant were all about the promise of being a really significant couple starting a whole line of prosperity, but then look at what happened,” Ms. Haskell said. “Their son fell off the edge of the earth.”</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">On June 2, 1883, John Grant’s obituary appeared in The Evening Observer, a local newspaper. As brief and terse as his wedding announcement, the notice merely reported that he had “dropped dead” in his home at age 60. Sarah Grant died 29 years later.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Then things got even more interesting.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">The couple’s grandson, Havens Grant, went to Yale, became a lawyer in New York City, married a free-spirited poet and ran a moonshine business on the side during Prohibition.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Today, the Grant descendants gather every Christmas at Ms. Haskell’s home in Connecticut and take a family photo with John and Sarah’s portraits in the background. In a recent photograph, everyone is wearing colorful tie-dyed scarves or shirts. David Marshall Grant appears with his husband, KC Reischerl, and their daughter, Evelyn May Reischerl Grant, who is 6 and the youngest descendant. She is also the only female family member in the photo. Ms. Haskell’s three sons are gay and appear with their partners.</p>

That the nuptials of a black woman, born into slavery 33 years earlier, could make the front page of The Times, speaks to a woman who was, by definition, remarkable.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">By the time Ms. Wells married Ferdinand L. Barnett in Chicago, she had risen from being orphaned as a child to one of the most forceful voices against the lynchings of black Americans. A muckraking journalist, she investigated the true motivation behind a vicious lynching in Memphis — a white businessman’s retaliation against a successful black store. In 1892, she was run out of the city, after she wrote about her discovery that white mobs often murdered black men under accusations of rape to cover up consensual sex between white women and black men.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">At a time when women still did not have the vote and black Americans were fighting for basic civil rights, Ms. Wells, outspoken and passionate, refused to live within the roles defined for people like her. Three decades before Rosa Parks was born, Ms. Wells was arrested after refusing to give up her seat in a whites-only railroad car and then took her case all the way to the Tennessee Supreme Court, where she lost.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">She was a feminist long before it was popular and “a race woman” when the leadership of the growing civil rights organizations of the time were resoundingly male. She refused to be sidelined by white feminist organizations, which worried that working for the equality of black women would slow down progress on rights for white women, and was marginalized by organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which she helped found.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">A sharp-tongued career woman uninterested in being tied down, Ms. Wells had many suitors before meeting her match in Mr. Barnett, a lawyer, “a race man” and a fellow feminist. Still, once she agreed to marry, she postponed the wedding three times in order to keep up with her rigorous antilynching speaking schedule.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/06/28/102516084.html?pageNumber=1"><em><strong>Read “Ida Wells Married” on Page 1 (June 28, 1895)</strong></em></a></p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">When the day finally came, the 27th of June, 1895, the event was fitting for an icon. “The interest of the public in the affair seemed to be so great that not only was the church filled to overflowing, but the streets surrounding the church were so packed with humanity that it was almost impossible for the carriage bearing the wedding bridal party to reach the church door,” Ms. Wells wrote in her autobiography.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">The bridesmaids wore lemon crepe dresses set off with white ribbons, slippers and bows, and the bride strolled down the aisle in a white satin trained gown trimmed with orange blossoms. Newspapers, for both white and black readers, reported on the affair.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Ms. Wells, an originator of “leaning in,” did not allow marriage or motherhood to change her focus on career. “Having always been busy at some work of my own, I decided to continue to work as a journalist, for this was my first love,” she wrote. “And might be said, my only love.”</p>

  <p itemprop="articleBody text">Of course, not all wedding stories had happy endings. On June 6, 1855, The New-York Daily Times ran a Page 1 story on a wedding celebration turned tragic: “At a late hour it was found that most of the party, who had partaken of a lot of custard, were suffering from the effects of some deadly poison.”</p>

  <div class="summary">
  <p itemprop="articleBody text">When The New York Times (then still called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/http://www.nytco.com/who-we-are/culture/our-history/#1835-1880">The New-York Daily Times</a>) made its debut in 1851, New York society was the exclusive domain of the Knickerbocker elite, the descendants of the Dutch and English merchants who had arrived in New Netherland in the 17th century. For this old-money set, marriage announcements were déclassé. Those who needed to know already did, and weddings had yet to become public social events.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">But the city was changing. Through marriage, an emerging class of industrial titans had begun to assert itself on upper-crust turf, and it was the marriage of a Schermerhorn to an Astor that changed everything.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Their 1853 wedding received no notice: It was still unseemly to announce a Knickerbocker wedding in the newspapers. But everyone certainly knew that the marriage of Caroline Webster Schermerhorn to William Astor would be the biggest power coupling of 19th-century New York. The match connected one of New York’s oldest families with one of its wealthiest. Caroline was a daughter of the city’s Dutch aristocracy; William was a grandson of the merchant and real estate magnate John Jacob Astor. In consolidating new money with old New York, their marriage portended the arrival of a newly influential elite.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">After she elbowed a sister-in-law out of the way to become known as “<em>the</em> Mrs. Astor,” Caroline set about remaking New York’s social world. It seemed as though she never gave another party that didn’t make the newspapers.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">To wit: For all but the 0.1 percent of the era, invitations to her daughter <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/11/19/103627336.html?pageNumber=5">Caroline (yes, also a Caroline) “Carrie” Schermerhorn Astor’s 1884 wedding</a> to Marshall Orme Wilson were impossible to come by. Even a guest list of 2,000 was a byzantine array of rankings, tiers and omissions — guests included Stuyvesants, Pierreponts, a bearded former general and president and, very grudgingly, Vanderbilts (Mrs. Astor found the Vanderbilts unbearably nouveau riche). Only 250 people were invited to the ceremony itself; B-listers were merely asked to the reception.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">The party may have been exclusive, but it wasn’t private. In fact, anyone with two cents, the cost of the paper at the time, could practically be there. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/11/19/103627323.html?pageNumber=5">The article in The Times the next morning</a> vividly conjured the gown bedecked with diamonds and orange blossoms, the $75,000 necklace draped across the bride’s décolletage and, minus the couple’s new mansion, every opulent gift on display. There were more details, and gossip aplenty, to come in the weeks that followed.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/11/19/103627323.html?pageNumber=5"><em><strong>Read “A Wedding Amid Flowers” (Nov. 19, 1884)</strong></em></a></p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170125012200/http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/11/30/106167880.html?pageNumber=13">Mrs. Astor hadn’t been thrilled about the match</a>, her own mixed marriage aside; Marshall Wilson’s father was a former Confederate general and a railroad magnate of recent vintage. Any tawdry details The Times omitted — like the staggering $400,000 marriage settlement the Astors demanded from the Wilsons — appeared in The New York Tribune or The New York Herald or the scandal sheet American Queen.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody text">Parsing power couplings, reading between the lines to spot a smudge or two of dirt, getting a look at that expensive gown — sounds familiar, doesn’t it? The wedding announcements let us in on the maneuverings of those at perhaps the joyous peaks of their lives, which remains a seductive draw for audiences today.</p>
