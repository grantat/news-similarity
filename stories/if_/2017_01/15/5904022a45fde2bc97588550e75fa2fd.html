<p class="paragraph--story" data-para-count="477" data-total-count="2669">Cameras flashed. The next day, “our phones just exploded,” Mr. Scott said. Their son was on the front page of The New York Times, smiling at Mr. Obama. “I think he realized something special was happening,” Mr. Scott said.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Jedi is 8. “We actually watched the farewell speech with him and our daughter, Kaia,” Ms. Joseph said. “Jedi understands the history and the importance of it — that he was the first African-American president and what that meant to so many people.”</p>

<p class="paragraph--story" data-para-count="454" data-total-count="4334">Leland Shelton, pictured above center, said he felt some “cognitive dissonance” when Mr. Obama held him up as an example for young black men in a May 2013 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170115061929/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/19/remarks-president-morehouse-college-commencement-ceremony">speech</a> at his graduation from Morehouse College in Atlanta. Mr. Shelton, who was raised with his siblings by their grandmother because their parents were addicted to drugs, was graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Morehouse — a historically black college — and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School.</p>
<p class="paragraph--story" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="4639">The mixed feelings came as the president congratulated Mr. Shelton but also used his story to tell black men not to make excuses for their personal failings. In doing so, Mr. Obama invoked the kind of respectability politics that has often driven a wedge between him and younger generations of black men. </p>
<p class="paragraph--story" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="4944">Mr. Shelton, who is 25, said he appreciated the shout-out but wished it had come with an acknowledgment of the impacts of systemic racism.  “I think it was a good move, just to show that beating the odds is not impossible,” Mr. Shelton said. “But you also want to address the fact that those odds exist.” </p>

<p class="paragraph--story" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="5886">Patricia McCoy, who became principal in 2014, said photos of the president’s visit, which hang around the school, inspired her to keep working harder in a job that could be grueling and thankless. “I have days when I think, ‘God, I can’t do this anymore,’” she said, adding of the visit, “I felt like it was a miracle to jump-start me back up.”</p>
