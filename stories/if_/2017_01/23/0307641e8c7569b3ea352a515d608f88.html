The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="1690">The issue “is the third rail” for the Republicans, said Michael Turpin, a longtime health industry executive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="1952">Before the law, a fairly typical life event — like a divorce or the loss of a job — and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person’s health coverage options. Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="2373">Mr. Trump insists he wants to keep the pre-existing requirement for insurers, and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away. Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged, but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea — known as high-risk pools — that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="2561">The challenge for lawmakers is this: How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care — and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="2944">The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty. That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance, distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population. The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up, the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="3054">Top Republicans, though, say the system is not working and point to double-digit price increases for premiums.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="3235">“There is a better way to fix that problem without giving everybody else all these massive premium increases,” the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said at a recent televised forum.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="3582" id="story-continues-4">Finding a fix is far from simple. Before the law was passed, insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy, and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care. The companies wanted to minimize the risk of losing money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="3828">Often, insurers offered no options to people with pre-existing conditions, because they considered the potential costs to be too high. As a result, 35 states had high-risk pools, the program again on the lips of top lawmakers, including Mr. Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="4274">The high-risk programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions. The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy, insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people. Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions, but they would also rely on other sources of funding, including from the government, to cover their costs.</p><figure id="media-100000004885265" class="media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000004885265" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/21/business/22preexisting3/22preexisting3-blog427.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

They enrolled in Colorado’s high-risk pool for three years. She paid about $375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="4931">In 2014, though, the high-risk pool was closed, and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost around $900 a month and came with a family deductible of around $12,000, much higher than it was before. His income was too high for him to receive any government subsidies, which help about 80 percent of people buying such plans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="5159">“I had coverage but no access,” said Mr. Nassimbene, 55.

Washington’s annual maximum was $2 million, while California’s limit was $75,000 a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans cannot have such a limit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="6576">In California, the program dwindled away until it served only 6,300 at the end of 2011.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="6916">Dennis Carr, for example, worked as an independent real estate agent when the financial markets crashed in 2008.
