But long before the first buses roll to Washington and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170109215456/https://womensmarch.squarespace.com/sisters">sister demonstrations </a>take place in other cities, contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers, exhilarating some and alienating others.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="439" data-total-count="1849">In Tennessee, emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from “Women’s March on Washington-Nashville” to “Power Together Tennessee, in solidarity with Women’s March on Washington.” While many applauded the name change, which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville, some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="2000">In Louisiana, the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="2250">“I got a lot of flak locally when I stepped down, from white women who said that I’m alienating a lot of white women,” said Candice Huber, a bookstore owner in New Orleans, who is white. “They said, ‘Why do you have to be so divisive?’”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="2542">In some ways, the discord is by design. Even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week, the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="2800">“This was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places,” said Linda Sarsour, a Muslim who heads the Arab American Association of New York and is one of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170109215456/https://www.womensmarch.com/team/">four co-chairwomen</a> of the national march. “Sometimes you are going to upset people.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="3099">The post that offended Ms. Willis was part of that effort. So was the quotation posted on the march’s Facebook page from Bell Hooks, the black feminist, about forging a stronger sisterhood by “confronting the ways women — through sex, class and race — dominated and exploited other women.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="102" data-total-count="3201">In response, a New Jersey woman wrote: “I’m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor.”</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="456" data-total-count="3657" id="story-continues-4">A debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily, or were having a hard time yielding control. A young white woman from Baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being “asked to check their privilege,” a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages, but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="3912">No one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout; even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="4056">“I will march,” one wrote on the march’s Facebook page, “Hoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it’s too late.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="4307">But these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of Trump. Should the march highlight what divides women, or what unites them? Is there room for women who have never heard of “white privilege”?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="4513">And at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won — with half of white female voters supporting him — is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="425" data-total-count="4938">“If your short-term goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don’t want to alienate people,” said Anne Valk, the author of “Radical Sisters,” a book about racial and class differences in the women’s movement. “But if your longer-term goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="5080">The discord also reflects the variety of women’s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march, as well as a generational divide.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="5361">Many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted. Many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies — issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="145" data-total-count="5506" id="story-continues-5">“Yes, equal pay is an issue,” Ms. Sarsour said. “But look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and Latina women.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="589" data-total-count="6095">For too long, the march organizers said, the women’s rights movement focused on issues that were important to well-off white women, such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same high-powered positions that men do. But minority women, they said, have had different priorities. Black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the White House. Undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights, they said, but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="6437">This brand of feminism — frequently referred to as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170109215456/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/09/24/why-intersectionality-cant-wait/?utm_term=.57d0384a6d96">“intersectionality”</a> — asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier. It speaks candidly about the history of racism, even within the feminist movement itself. The organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on Washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="359" data-total-count="6796">The issue of race has followed the march from its inception. The day after the election, Bob Bland, a fashion designer in New York, floated the idea of a march in Washington on Facebook. Within hours, 3,000 people said they would join. Then a friend called to tell Ms. Bland that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170109215456/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/it-started-with-a-grandmother-in-hawaii-now-the-womens-march-on-washington-is-poised-to-be-the-biggest-inauguration-demonstration/2017/01/03/8af61686-c6e2-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.3aa2a18a7aab">a woman in Hawaii</a> with a similar page had collected pledges from 12,000 people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="62" data-total-count="6858">“I thought, ‘Wow, let’s merge,’” Ms. Bland recalled.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="7229">As the effort grew, a number of comments on Facebook implored Ms. Bland, who is white, to include minority women on the leadership team. Ms. Bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. Within three days of the election, Carmen Perez, a Hispanic activist working on juvenile justice, and Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control activist who is black, joined Ms. Bland.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="7443"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170109215456/https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/gloria-steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>, honorary co-chairwoman of the march along with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170109215456/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/opinion/campaign-stops/harry-belafonte-what-do-we-have-to-lose-everything.html">Harry Belafonte</a>, the honorary co-chairman, lauded their approach. “Sexism is always made worse by racism — and vice versa,” she said in an email.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="7637">Ms. Steinem, who plans to hold a town hall meeting during the march with Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, said even contentious conversations about race were a “good thing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="100" data-total-count="7737">“It’s about knowing each other,” she wrote. “Which is what movements and marches are for.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="131" data-total-count="7868">But the tone of the discussion, particularly online, can become so raw that some would-be marchers feel they are no longer welcome.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Ms. Willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages, and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="163" data-total-count="8872">But, she said, “The last thing that is going to make me endeared to you, to know you and love you more, is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="9033">Ms. Rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
