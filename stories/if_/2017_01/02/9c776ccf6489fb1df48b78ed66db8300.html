<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="2483" id="story-continues-3">As for the 53-year-old Mr. Jain, his carefully crafted plan to finish what his mentor, Mr. Mitchell, started at Deutsche Bank has ended in disappointment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="2792">In the years since the financial crisis, many investment banks have had to pay significant amounts to atone for their various sins. And while the sum of Deutsche’s fines is in the middle of the pack, the bank has been drawn into some of finance’s furthest frontiers when it comes to the pursuit of profit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="434" data-total-count="3226">Deutsche has been a primary offender in two of the biggest banking scandals of the past decade: promoting toxic mortgages to unwitting investors and manipulating for profit the main lending rate for banks in London. In the process, it has agreed to pay over $9 billion in fines and consumer relief. The bank has sold tax-reduction products to hedge funds, and is alleged to have helped Russian investors illegally move money overseas.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="252" data-total-count="3478">This is also a bank that marketed complex derivatives to Europe’s sickliest bank, Monte dei Paschi in Italy. And it is one of the largest lenders to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170101193821/http://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Donald J. Trump." class="meta-per">Donald J. Trump</a>, having extended roughly $300 million in loans to the president-elect’s businesses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="3791">Analysts calculate that of the 20 billion euros in profits that Deutsche’s trading and banking unit accumulated since 1995, as much as 15 billion euros will ultimately be returned to regulators via fines and penalties. Of course, not all of this lands in the lap of Mr. Mitchell — and more recently, Mr. Jain.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="4028">The investment bank they created remains a power in bond and foreign currency trading worldwide. And from the beginning, it was overseen by a strong-willed German board that knew well the risks and rewards that came with such a business.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="4375">It is also the case that when Mr. Jain became co-chief executive of Deutsche in 2012, one of his first priorities was lowering the bank’s risk, which he did by unloading opaque, hard-to-trade assets. In spring 2015, Mr. Jain put in place his own plan for reforming the bank, which his C.E.O. successor, John M. Cryan, has not entirely abandoned.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="4773">That said, Mr. Cryan has made it clear that his Deutsche Bank will be markedly different from Mr. Jain’s. Since taking over last year, Mr. Cryan has preached simplicity, less risk, better internal controls and reduced reliance on derivatives. As for the investment bank he inherited from Mr. Jain, he has said that he is committed to it but that it will be a very different institution under him.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

That could mean a cashiered chief executive seeing his career and reputation ruined. Or a rogue trader who loses billions of dollars and ends up in prison.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="131" data-total-count="5463">But there have been few instances in which the personal toll surrounding a bank’s rise and fall has been as profound as this one.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="5487">Out of Chaos, Efficiency</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="5806">By December 2000, Mr. Mitchell seemed to have accomplished the impossible. In just five years, he had hired thousands of traders and bankers from firms all over Wall Street (an effort that got a boost by the acquisition of Bankers Trust in 1999), forging not just a strong culture but also a highly profitable business.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="6026">While there were numerous deposit-driven banks in Europe that made a play for American investment banking business in the 1980s and 1990s, none did it with the zeal of Deutsche Bank under Mr. Mitchell and later Mr. Jain.</p><figure id="media-100000004846313" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004846313 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/01/business/01DB-DEUTSCHEJP2/01DB-DEUTSCHEJP2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="496" data-total-count="6522">Even before he moved to London, Mr. Mitchell had developed a reputation for being one of Wall Street’s premier recruiters, with a pied-piper-like ability to attract, and keep, the best traders and bankers around. He had a special methodology in his choosing, inclining toward those who came from big families and played team sports in college, because he felt that these traits would give him “athletes” capable of working well together in the large competitive grouping of a trading floor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="6866">“It was as if entropy was his vision — that out of this chaos would emerge a greater efficiency,” said<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170101193821/http://observer.com/2001/07/exgoldman-trader-stung-in-arms-plot-shocks-colleagues/"> Kevin Ingram</a>, a former top bond executive at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170101193821/http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/goldman-sachs-group-inc?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about Goldman Sachs Group Inc." class="meta-org">Goldman Sachs</a> whom Mr. Mitchell recruited in 1996 and who left Deutsche Bank in 1998 and later pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges. “He did an extraordinary job in managing egos.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="487" data-total-count="7353">At Merrill, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Jain and Mr. Broeksmit had used their expertise in derivatives and swaps to carve out market share from established players like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. As Mr. Broeksmit would recount in an unpublished interview with a reporter for Bloomberg News, the strategy worked because of Mr. Jain’s skill, while at Merrill, in enticing his hedge-fund clients into volatile yet profitable investments — such as bond futures, swaps and other derivatives.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="479" data-total-count="7832" id="story-continues-5">“He was persistent and persuasive and able to show it would make good economic sense,” Mr. Broeksmit said, according to an email exchange with the reporter. Mr. Broeksmit’s son, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170101193821/https://twitter.com/bikinirobotarmy?lang=en">Val</a>, provided documents and email communications from Mr. Broeksmit’s files to The New York Times. A musician, the younger Mr. Broeksmit taught himself finance, and for several years he has been looking into his father’s career at Deutsche in a search for answers as to why he took his life.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="7900">The plan was to use a similar strategy in London with Deutsche Bank.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="8214">“I remember Edson called me up and said, ‘I have just been given the keys to the kingdom at Deutsche Bank — we can do whatever we want,’” recalled Michael G. Philipp, one of the first Merrill executives to follow Mr. Mitchell to Deutsche; “2,500 people in 18 months — it has never been done since.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="8435">Mr. Mitchell’s untimely death in 2000 was a devastating blow to the bank and more so to his many friends and followers. But it did not alter the bank’s mission, the mantle of which was eventually taken on by Mr. Jain.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="8676">By the time of the financial crisis, 90 percent of the bank’s profits would come from the London-based global market’s division — fueled mostly by derivatives-driven trading bets and its dominant positions as a foreign currency trader.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="8706">All that changed in late 2008.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="9081">With one investment bank after another going bust, Deutsche’s board had become increasingly concerned as to the bank’s derivatives holdings, according to documents reviewed by The Times. In October 2008 the bank’s derivatives exposure, net of cash collateral, was 181 billion euros, these documents show, a sizable sum given its equity cushion of just 30 billion euros.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="9308">Starting in 2007, Mr. Jain had already taken steps to materially reduce Deutsche’s risk profile. However, he and his team pushed back hard against the view that the investment bank’s power should be significantly curtailed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="385" data-total-count="9693">“This underlines the paradox of D.B.,” read a briefing paper for Mr. Jain prepared in advance of the bank’s general executive committee meeting in mid-December 2008. “However much some at the G.E.C. would like to see D.B. return to its roots as a continental commercial bank, it is clear that international sales and trading will represent the bulk of value creation at D.B.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="10063">Sales and trading would also become the focus for regulators in Germany, London and the United States who, in the wake of the crisis, cracked down severely. The $7.2 billion penalty announced in December represents, in effect, the final bill to be paid toward the Mitchell and Jain plan of paying bankers outsize sums to take outsize risks in pursuit of outsize profits.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="257" data-total-count="12530" id="story-continues-7">Mr. Broeksmit was always an ardent advocate for Mr. Jain. He was the Deutsche Bank executive who cited Mr. Jain’s salesmanship abilities as a formative contributor to the bank’s early success in the book that celebrated the unit’s 10-year anniversary.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="372" data-total-count="12902">Mr. Broeksmit had originally been persuaded by Mr. Mitchell to move to London with the first wave of Merrill Lynch defectors in 1995 and 1996. As the brains behind Mr. Mitchell’s ambition for Deutsche to become a leading derivatives bank, he was what financial hands call a plumber — an expert in the piping and flow of money, largely unknown beyond the trading floor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="13276">Bookish, though not without a touch of the trader’s swagger, Mr. Broeksmit was also a man of loyalties, always quick to share the burdens of a friend in need. So when Mr. Jain asked him to take on a larger risk role at Deutsche in 2007, he said yes, even though he had been enjoying his more relaxed life as private consultant after stepping down as a full-time executive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="13350">After a time, though, the drumbeat of investigations began to wear on him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="13512">There was Deutsche’s role in the rate-rigging scandal, for which it paid $2.5 billion, the highest sum of the roughly $9 billion paid by major investment banks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="13809">There was a<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170101193821/https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/34-75040.pdf"> $55 million fine</a> Deutsche had to pay for misstating its derivatives positions. And finally, there were the withering criticisms by the New York Fed regarding Deutsche’s troubled American operations — where, at the behest of Mr. Jain, Mr. Broeksmit had become a member of the board.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="14245">In the days after Mr. Broeksmit’s death in early 2014, Mr. Jain ordered up a report, with help from outside lawyers, to determine whether the suicide had been work-related. Mr. Broeksmit’s ties, direct or indirect, to Deutsche’s many regulatory woes were examined in detail. In September of that year, the report concluded that there was “nothing that shows a direct link between Bill’s death and his work at Deutsche Bank.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="14677">The executives who produced the report said that he was “not unhappy” during his last days at the bank in 2013. He had officially stepped down that summer, although, in his usual style, he was not cutting ties completely, staying on as a director at Deutsche’s New York Bank. “Had my retirement luncheon hosted by Anshu last week,” Mr. Broeksmit wrote to a friend that November. “It’s the third time I have retired!”</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="14699">A Guarded Private Life</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="14811">The extent to which Deutsche’s legal woes played a role in Mr. Broeksmit’s untimely death remains a mystery.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="513" data-total-count="15324" id="story-continues-8">In mid-2013, with investigations into Deutsche’s conduct mounting, Mr. Broeksmit did pay a visit to a psychiatrist in London that became part of the coroner’s examination into his death. According to the doctor’s diagnosis, Mr. Broeksmit had “imagined being investigated, being prosecuted, losing his wealth and his reputation.” But, in the same letter, the doctor said his patient recognized that these thoughts were not a “realistic possibility,” even if they caused him sleeplessness and anxiety.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="107" data-total-count="15431">There are no records of Mr. Broeksmit paying further visits to a psychiatrist in the year before his death.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="15752">Outwardly, friends and colleagues do not recall Mr. Broeksmit showing signs of stress, although they do say he had always been very private in terms of his inner life. While he peppered his lawyers for updates on various investigations, he also made plans with a group of former colleagues to take a ski trip in February.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="16090">But on Jan. 26, 2014, instead of meeting his wife and son for lunch, Mr. Broeksmit slung a dog leash over a door in his London home, and hanged himself from it. Left by his side was a neat stack of company documents related to Deutsche’s New York banking operations, and suicide notes addressed to relatives, as well as one to Mr. Jain.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="16215">“You were good to me,” Mr. Broeksmit wrote to the man he had known for over 30 years, adding, “I am eternally sorry.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
