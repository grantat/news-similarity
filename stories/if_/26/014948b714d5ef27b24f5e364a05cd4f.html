And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trump’s campaign or by his advisers. Two people considered to be in the running to head the Environmental Protection Agency — Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an energy lobbyist, and Robert E. Grady, a venture capitalist — also have experience in the complex machinations of the federal government.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="2943">“Every new administration comes in with an overestimation of what it can accomplish and how quickly it can accomplish it,” said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, a Washington law firm.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="3181">If Mr. Trump does decide to withdraw from the Paris agreement, he will find it difficult: The accord went into force this month.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="3687">One of the most powerful methods to hobble Mr. Obama’s domestic environmental initiatives would be to block financing for the E.P.A. and other agencies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="4034">“Congress can always pass an appropriations rider that for one year prevents any funding for the implementation or enforcement of a particular regulation,” said Scott H. Segal, a partner and director of the policy resolution group at Bracewell. Riders can be passed year after year, effectively neutering a specific regulation, Mr. Segal said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="4261">Such an approach can be “stealthier” than trying to undo the regulation itself, Professor Freeman said. “You don’t have to repeal these statutes,” she said. “You just have to make it impossible to implement them.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="4452">Another opening for Mr. Trump lies in regulations that were proposed by the Obama administration but are still technically “in motion.” In theory, he could pull back or block these rules.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="394" data-total-count="4846">But a departing administration can also use a regulation’s “in motion” status to its own advantage. Last week, the Obama administration banned drilling in the Alaskan Arctic under the Interior Department’s proposed five-year plan regulating oil and gas leases. Republicans could kill the plan. But to do so would mean crafting a replacement, a process that could take two years or more.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="5045">Last week, the White House unveiled a sweeping plan to try to stiffen environmental regulations before Mr. Obama leaves office. Environmental groups can be expected to fight any efforts to undo them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="5296">“Donald Trump can’t just snap his fingers and change climate policy,” said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We have ways to thwart him in Congress and the courts that we could employ.”</p> <figure id="what-is-climate-change" class="interactive promo  layout-large">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="514" data-total-count="5922" id="story-continues-5">Some environmental policies — like “guidance” issued by the White House earlier this year, instructing agencies to consider the effects of climate change when conducting environmental reviews — do not have the force of law that agency regulations do, and can be abolished with a pen stroke. Undoing a regulation is more complicated. Some of the E.P.A.’s new methane rules are completed, for example, but other rules, both at the E.P.A. and at the Interior Department, are not and can simply be abandoned.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="6289">If a rule is final, the options are different. The new administration cannot just rescind these regulations, but it can order agencies to revisit them. That reopens the rule-making process, however, including the opportunity for public comment. Any revisions or replacement regulations must have a basis in facts and a cost-benefit analysis, not politics or ideology.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="424" data-total-count="6713">There are other potential options for specific regulations. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, is completed but not yet in effect because of a judicial stay imposed while legal action against it plays out in a federal appeals court in Washington. If there is no ruling by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, Mr. Trump’s Justice Department can ask the court to put the case in abeyance, effectively extending the stay indefinitely.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="6952">“In some respects, this is in the Department of Justice’s hands,” said Tom Lorenzen, a lawyer at Crowell &amp; Moring who argued against the plan before the appeals court. “They will make a determination of how they want to proceed.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="7345">Mr. Segal said the Republican Congress might also be able to overturn some recently completed regulations under a law that gives both houses up to 60 legislative days to reject them. That law, the Congressional Review Act, usually comes into play only when the party of the incoming president is different from the departing one’s and the same party controls both houses, as is the case now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="7528">William K. Reilly, a Republican who was E.P.A. administrator under President George Bush, said Mr. Trump needed to be careful about whom he picked for the top jobs in each department.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="7907">He cited the Reagan administration’s experience with Anne Gorsuch, who incurred the wrath of politicians of both parties when, as administrator of the E.P.A., she cut the agency’s budget by more than 20 percent, gutting research and regulatory enforcement. She resigned under fire in 1983 in the midst of accusations that she had mismanaged a hazardous waste cleanup program.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="8102">“The administration got badly burned by discounting the sensitivities and public support for what the E.P.A. protects us from,” Mr. Reilly said. “It’s a public health agency above all.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
