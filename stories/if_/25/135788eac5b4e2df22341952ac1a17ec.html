	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> On paper, the latest iPhone doesn’t look like much of an upgrade. But many small improvements to Apple’s flagship phone, including some waterproofing and an upgraded camera for more stable pictures and better low-light snaps, make it well worth the update. That’s particularly true if you have an older iPhone, such as the 5s or earlier. The 7s is snappier, looks better and takes better pictures than its predecessors.

The new iPhones do lack one big feature: a standard headphone jack. The phone comes with a pair of headphones that plug into its Lightning port, also known as the charging port. So, yes, that means that without buying extra wireless headphones you can’t power up your phone and listen privately to music at the same time. For long commuters and desk DJs, that may be a deal-breaker; for those who don’t listen to music or podcasts for long stretches, it’s less of a problem.

If you’re interested in the larger iPhone 7 Plus, you should know that the stand-out feature is its dual camera sensor, which Apple has used to make the zoom much better than any other phone camera on the market. The iPhone 7 Plus also has a longer battery life. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> It’s been a rough year for Samsung fans, who may have had their hearts set on the now-defunct Galaxy Note 7. But the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are both excellent phones worth a look on their own. These models haven’t suffered from the same battery woes as the Note, and both have powerful processors, gorgeous screens and beautiful styling. The phones both have an always-on display, which keeps critical information such as the time on your screen without draining the battery. 

The S7 edge, in particular, is great to read or watch video on thanks to a screen that drapes over the sides of the phone like the edge of an infinity pool. The display is 5.5 inches — the same as the iPhone 7 Plus — but it feels somehow more expansive thanks to those edges. Without a case, both the S7 and the S7 edge can be a little slippery and prone to accidents; they also run a little (though not alarmingly) warm under a heavy load. But both models are among the best Android phones out there, with a few features such as wireless charging that you don’t get from the iPhone. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Google seems to be getting more serious about its smartphones with the introduction of the Pixel and Pixel XL. While this phone was built by HTC, it was completely designed by Google to show off the full extent of the Android system it created and its fancy new software, including the voice-controlled Assistant. The Pixels will get the latest updates of Google’s software first, and both models come out of the box with the company’s latest system, Android Nougat. 

The Google Assistant shows a lot of promise, providing much of the same information and features as Siri in a smoother and more conversational style. It isn’t perfect, but it is impressive — especially for a first try at creating an artificial intelligence assistant. As a piece of hardware, the Pixel is slim and sits well in hand — its fingerprint reader is on the back, which makes the sensor easy to use while holding the phone. The only downsides are the camera, which while good isn’t quite as crisp or stable as the cameras on competing phones, and the fact that this phone is not waterproof. It’s also a Verizon “exclusive,” though buyers can pick up an unlocked version from Google itself to operate on other networks. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> LG has struggled a bit to produce a solid smartphone, but the V20 is a fairly good offering from the company and has a key feature that many other phones lack: a removable battery. 

Battery life on this phone is not as long-lasting as on some of its similarly sized competitors, but being able to swap out the battery for a fresh one is a perk. This phone is also supposed to be a bit more rugged than its competitors, and designed to withstand a good drop or two — just don’t get carried away. It’s not the world’s prettiest phone, and has a utilitarian look about it. 

Yet while the V20’s styling may not be worth writing home about, it is a bold design with very square edges and a dual camera on the back with an added wide-angle lens that gives you the opportunity to take some pretty expansive and impressive shots.

LG also boasts that this phone has excellent audio, and includes a pair of B&amp;O Play headphones in the box, to show off its audio quality even more. (Because, yes, this phone does have a headphone jack.)</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Huawei is probably not a household name for most smartphone buyers, but this Chinese firm is certainly starting to impress with the quality of its phones at a much more palatable price. The Huawei Honor 8 may not have the polish of an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, but it packs a decent punch and manages to look refined 

At $390, the Huawei Honor 8 delivers a 5.7-inch screen and reasonably good performance — certainly better than you might expect from a mid-range device. It also has a fairly good camera, with a dual camera that should please even picky casual photographers. It’s certainly good enough for an Instagram feed. This phone’s main drawback is its short battery life. But, hey, you had to expect some sort of tradeoff for the dip in price. Overall, you’re getting what you paid for — and then some. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The Motorola Z PLay offers a modular take on the smartphone, giving users the option to buy accessories to snap on and off the phone to further customize it. If you want a better camera or a better speaker, you can buy the appropriate “Moto Mod” and amp up your phone’s specs that way. It’s a little gimmicky, sure, but a nice option if you have a very specific need for your smartphone and don’t mind making its already slightly bulky frame a little bulkier for some personalized perks.

Overall, the phone performs well — it handles normal tasks without a noticeable stutter and will serve your smartphone needs. This is a more mid-range phone, so it probably isn’t as suited to heavy-duty mobile gaming or other demanding tasks but perfectly good for streaming music and video. The Z Play also, unlike other Moto Z phones, retains its headphone jack. It also has an impressive battery life for its size and can probably go more than a day of normal use without having to be plugged in.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Another phone from a most cost-effective Chinese firm, the OnePlus 3 is a good option for people who want a decent smartphone but don’t want to break the bank to get it. In terms of performance, this phone can compete with rivals that cost far more than its $400 pricetag, and should make people rethink what they can expect from a “cheap” smartphone.

The processing power of this phone is particularly impressive for its price, and it has a nice-looking aluminum body that feels premium. Its camera is also excellent, taking very good pictures in bright and low light. The OnePlus 3 also has a Dash Charging function that makes it easy to top up the phone’s long-lasting battery when it runs low on power.

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Civilization,&quot; in which players choose a world leader and set out to conquer the world one parcel of land at a time, is one of those franchises that manages to stay familiar while never getting too stale. With the latest installment, the developers have done it again, by introducing what is actually a fairly radical change without giving devoted fans a case of whiplash. The big change is that the cities, always the lifeblood of a player’s civilization, are now able to sprawl and allow players to actually do some urban planning. 

Districts, a new feature in this game, can specialize in things such as trade, education and military training and get boosts from the terrain around them. Placement, in other words, really matters. This change requires players to think more critically about their resources and consider how they want to fit their cities together — almost like a jigsaw puzzle.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Overwatch&quot; has only been out for several months, but it’s already creating its own culture — and for good reason. The online multiplayer game lets players pick from a variety of unique characters, which then work together as a team toward their goals. Lifespans are short in this game, and players can switch between characters often (read: between deaths) to provide different sorts of support for their team throughout the matches.

The game is arguably only as good, however, as the people you play it with. If you don’t have a thick skin or are unfamiliar with the culture of online gaming, you may want to make sure to play with a buddy or two, at least at the beginning. The community has been fairly well-behaved, but coordination and communication are important, and it’s generally far more fun to play with the devils you know.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot; is set in a time after a global incident caused all humans with cybernetic implants to lash out with unspeakable violence. As the game’s own enhanced protagonist, Adam Jensen, players must fight their way through a world that calls for combat of all kinds, from high-tech hacking to good old-fashioned brawling.

The weak point of this game is likely its story, which takes some interesting, even convoluted twists and has drawn complaints about an abrupt ending. It’s true that the game could grapple more deeply with questions about humanity and machinery that are inherent in the plot. But the story at least doesn’t distract too much from some seriously solid gameplay that is fun and rewarding. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> War is cruel, and &quot;Battlefield 1&quot; takes players back to one of the most brutal and unforgiving wars ever — World War I. In an age where the industry seems obsessed with space marines and future tech, it’s a bold step. And it’s one that pays off for &quot;Battlefield,&quot; which takes pains to recreate (as much as is possible) the muddy, bloody experience of trench warfare. The game actually flits between several perspectives, giving players a small taste of the settings and people caught up in this pivotal conflict.

The game is still fairly young, and so it’s hard to say how the atmosphere of the multiplayer will evolve. Multiplayer is a huge part of any &quot;Battlefield&quot; game, and so this a major component of the game that’s still, essentially, under development. That said, the modes are fun, and familiar to anyone who’s played any iteration of this franchise before. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Mafia III&quot; puts players in the shoes of Lincoln Clay, a biracial gangster recently returned from Vietnam and looking for revenge against the Sicilian mob that took out his crime family in a stylized version of New Orleans. New Bordeaux, as the game’s city is called, is divided into districts and players have to conquer each part of the city as they build their own empire from the ashes of the old one. &quot;Mafia III&quot; gives Clay his own lieutenants, which also sets up an internal power struggle to offset the larger battle.

&quot;Mafia III&quot; starts off strong but can get bogged down as players work their way through the story and the city and can eventually lose some of its momentum. The game has missed some opportunities, particularly to shine a light on the era that the developers very consciously chose. But on balance, &quot;Mafia III&quot; is still worth a look for players who like the franchise and those with an appreciation for a good setting.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;XCOM 2,&quot; a turn-based strategy game, carries over all the tension and high-stakes play of its predecessor, &quot;XCOM.&quot; The world, conquered by aliens, is in need of your armed resistance and careful planning for the sake of humanity. But be warned: this game is not designed to be easy. It is hard and purposefully random, sometimes to the point of cruelty — but not necessarily in a bad way. Just expect to feel your fair share of frustration, and don’t get too attached to any of the characters you direct.

&quot;XCOM 2&quot; is a solid game, though at times there can be some cosmetic hiccups that keep players from getting a full view of the map around them — critical information to have when creating a battle strategy. But these problems are likely to be fixed in future patches and shouldn’t prevent anyone from picking the game up. The random nature of the game also gives it great replay value, since you’re unlikely to get exactly the same experience twice. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Unravel&quot; is perhaps best-described as a game of pure whimsy. This title puts players in the place of a small creature made of Yarn — Yarny, actually — who must make his way through the world using only the yarn contained in his own body. Players can use the free end of Yarny to swing from branch to branch and attach themselves to points in the environment to get around a host of obstacles. As long as you can find another supply of yarn, you’re fine to keep unraveling yourself to move forward. 

This tender game actually does have a plot that touches on longing, love, loss and nostalgia, but it’s mostly a meditative puzzle game that requires just a dab of critical thinking. Puzzles can get a bit repetitive, and the controls are not always as responsive as players might like. But overall, it is a sweet tale and one worth checking out if you like a slower pace to your play.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Battlezone VR&quot; puts players in the cockpit of a hovertank, thanks to the PlayStation VR virtual reality headset. The game, which one can play seated, places players on a stylized version of a battle field but still manages to convince your senses that you’re actually driving and moving around in your very own enormous vehicle. A reboot of an old Atari franchise, the game certainly retains an arcade feel that should appeal to plenty of players.

Players can shoot enemies and take territory in battles, all while working toward a broader victory. It can feel at times like you’re constantly under siege, particularly with the VR, so it’s probably a game best left to short bursts of play. Players can participate in online matches, or stay offline if they prefer. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Inside&quot; is going to make a lot of top independent game lists this year, and with good cause. This puzzle-platformer has a unique feel to it, and deftly sketches out a terrifying world. Players inhabit a small boy who’s running from guards in a very eerie world inhabited by zombie-like people. Using the boy’s powers of mind control, players can solve puzzles as he makes his way through the environment. 

The game has a dark humor augmented by its indie aesthetic, which while certainly not in the style of a photorealistic blockbuster, does help set the mood for what is, ultimately, a pretty horrifying world. Plot twists add to the excitement of the game, which admittedly isn’t very long — a dedicated player could probably knock it out in an evening. That said, even though it’s short, it’s well worth the time and money to play it.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Minecraft&quot; has become the gold standard of “builder” games, which let players create their own worlds from materials they mine and hone into the tools of their choosing. &quot;Dragon Quest Builders&quot; could have easily been a &quot;Minecraft&quot; clone that just happened to be set in the world of the classic series, but the developers have deftly avoided that trap and made it into a full-fledged concept on its own.

Building is a big part of this game, and players are asked to construct buildings in four different main areas throughout the story, to serve different purposes. Each of the areas has its own rules about what should be built and how, and each advances the game in its own way. But story — an area that &quot;Minecraft&quot; has always largely ignored — also plays a big part in &quot;Dragon Quest Builders.&quot; The role-playing elements of the central series shine through in this spinoff as well, making it distinctly different from most builder games.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Kids can tap their inner Walt Disney in this game, which offers basic instruction on how to sketch characters from the Disneyverse while secretly teaching kids (gasp!) some of the basics of drawing. Younger players may particularly like learning how to draw characters they recognize, even if the game does stick mostly to the fundamentals.

It is true that this game will not make you a stunning artist overnight — or, indeed, replace a good drawing class in any meaningful way. The stylus on the 3DS doesn’t always feel like the most precise tool. And the game itself can lose its luster over time. But it is fun, and could help get players thinking about how to apply their creative skills to their own characters down the line. For parents, it’s a purchase they can make without worrying about what content may show up in the game.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The Lego video game adaptations of popular movies are always fun for the whole family, and &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; is no exception. As always, Lego has adapted this game to be part love letter and part parody, staying true to the original material while also putting a snarky spin on it. The game itself is a combination of action, adventure and puzzler — a well-rounded game that should have appeal for most types of players. 

The game carries a rating of 10 and up, which is appropriate for its humor. While things never get blue or bawdy, there is some humor that will appeal more to older children (and adults) than your little ones. There is also some cartoon violence, though certainly nothing that could be called disturbing — just objects dissolving into piles of Legos. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> &quot;Skylanders&quot; is a perennial favorite for young players, who can play with the characters both in-game and in the real world -- the game comes with real figurines that you can collect and play with offline as well. With &quot;Skylanders Imaginators,&quot; the game has taken another creative leap forward, giving players the option to design their own Skylanders in the game, choosing from several attributes in a number of combinations.

Core gameplay in &quot;Imaginators&quot; is very similar to past games, which means it will feel familiar (maybe even perhaps a little boring) to those who have played the series in the past. But there are some updates, including very powerful figures that can really tip a battle in your favor when used judiciously. Parents should know that there are some micro-transactions in this game, as well as the option to have custom characters 3D printed and sent to your doorstep. You can play together to avoid surprise charges — but also play together because it’s fun.</p>

The sense of movement in this underwater game is excellent and gives players a distinct experience and environment for players of all ages. Cerebral and oddly soothing, this game offers a lot of bang for its buck with a lot of playtime and surprises to uncover.

It’s true that the puzzles in &quot;Song of the Deep&quot; can get a little samey-samey after a while and that some of the challenges are not as difficult in the later game. But the overall game provides a strong challenge and a great ambience for younger players — and it’s not bad for older players either. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> From a visual standpoint, it’s hard not to be impressed with &quot;Paper Mario: Color Splash,&quot; which, as one may intuit from the title, delivers a big and richly hued world while retaining its own unique paper cutout style. The art style and music add so much to this game’s charm that it’s easy to get swept up in its aesthetics. 

The gameplay, however, can get a little boring — players have to collect in-game Battle Cards that let them attack enemies, and engaging in fight after fight can get tedious at times. This is a problem that has shown up in previous &quot;Paper Mario&quot; games as well; if action is what you’re looking for, this may not be the game for you. That said, Wii U owners looking for a nice game to pick up this holiday may find it worth a play, particularly if they’re fans of the series already.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Mesmerizing may be the best word for &quot;Thumper,&quot; which is one of the games supported by the PlayStation VR headset this holiday season. (Support for other headsets, the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, are on the roadmap as well.) It’s a little hard to explain &quot;Thumper,&quot; which is all about finding your rhythm, as you take on the perspective of a metal beetle racing down a long track toward menacing figures in the distance. As odd as that may sound, &quot;Thumper&quot; is addictive, particularly in VR, when you can be completely immersed by the music and entirely bent on the next twist or obstacle in your way.

&quot;Thumper&quot; advertises itself as a “rhythm violence” game, but there isn’t exactly a lot of overt violence — though the trippy backgrounds may get a little scary for very young players who spook easily. On the flip side, older players who are looking for a complex challenge may find its gameplay too simple. &quot;Thumper&quot; is best for players in the middle, who want something engaging.</p>

The sound quality is clear, but probably better suited for accompanying a run than a deep appreciation of the music. Audiophiles should look elsewhere. But if you’re looking for something waterproof, wireless, relatively cheap and sturdy, this is a good pair to consider. </p>

Pencil by Fifty Three is a tried-and-true stylus for sketchers and writers who want to split the difference between the digital and analog worlds — and who like a little heft to their implement. The Pencil comes in a variety of shades and materials, giving you some personalization options without breaking the bank. Think of it as the modern equivalent of a pen and pencil set. 

The quality can help you feel as though you’re getting your money’s worth, though honestly these can still feel a little pricey for what you get. That said, they’re nice to give as gifts — a splurge for someone else that they may not treat themselves to. Just be sure to get a case with a loop, since Pencil by Fifty Three does not come with a clip. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Bluetooth speakers are often a welcome gift, since they are great for parties all year round. The JBL Clip 2 is a wonderful, compact little speaker that will serve small spaces well, whether you’re trying to add some mood music to a corner of your party or just looking for a speaker that can help cheer you up in the kitchen.

The JBL Clip 2 is also waterproof, meaning that it functions well as a shower radio, in case you need some tunes to get you going in the morning. Of course, that also means that’s it’s a winner at the pool, since it can stand up to splashes and the occasional immersion. It’s not the loudest speaker on the market, but it is an excellent value for its price.</p>

You can channel your inner Jedi with this toy, which has a program that simulates Force combat training and can also be used to help you uncover “hidden” spots around the real world where the Force is unusually strong. You can sense these with the band, and learn more through its companion app on your phone.

The Force Band can be used on its own, but it’s more fun if you also have Sphero’s hot toy from last year — the BB-8 robot. The combination of these two toys will really make you feel like you’re mastering the Force, since you will be able to control the little robot wirelessly with your hand gestures. This toy is, ostensibly, for kids. But it’s hard to imagine that there won’t be an adult here and there who will want to live out their own Star Wars dreams as well.</p>

This holiday season, Nintendo is introducing a mini version of its classic system that can fit in the palm of your hand. 

The system comes pre-loaded with 30 games from the NES era, including some favorites such as &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong.&quot; But not every game for the system has made the cut, and players won’t get to pick and choose. So if you have a very specific memory you’re trying to relive, be sure to check the full game list before you buy.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Amazon’s smart Echo speaker has been a big hit for the company, thanks to its voice-activated Alexa assistant, which lets users set timers and alarms, will answer basic questions and can sync with an increasing number of services such as Uber. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) The Echo Dot is a downsized version of the full Echo — it’s much smaller and its speaker is best used for alarms rather than music. You can plug the Dot into another speaker if you want.

Users can still ask the Dot for all the information that Alexa can provide, and it can control a number of other smart home devices if you connect everything together. Those who aren’t that into the smart home or talking to thin air won’t get as much out of the Dot, but those who’ve dreamed of having a computer to chat with will be more than happy.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The proud and unabashed nerds among us probably have fond memories of going to the planetarium as kids; those were field trips that took us not only out of town, but out of the galaxy. Now, thanks to modern technology, you can recreate a part of that experience for your own home and your own kids with Universe2 Go, which uses your smartphone to power a personal planetarium.

Universe2 Go has a goggle-like housing for your phone which, with a companion app, can immerse you in a beautiful star field wherever and whenever you want. Leave the sound on, and you get excellent information about what you’re seeing. It can be a little difficult to fit your phone in the headset, though the kit comes with foam spacers to ensure a snug fit. This won’t completely replace a real planetarium visit, but it sure is nice to visit the stars without having to hop a rocket, or a school bus.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Virtual reality is a big theme this holiday season, and Sony’s PlayStation VR headset is probably going to be the best buy for most people. It lacks some of the fidelity and clarity of other, more expensive VR headsets. But it has the easiest setup of any quality model, works with the PlayStation 4 instead of with a high-end gaming computer and is — oh, you know — objectively a heck of a lot of fun to use. This is obviously best for games that are designed for virtual reality, but even non-immersive games are fun in the headset, because players can feel like they’re playing on an enormous personal screen.

Sony’s headset sits very lightly on your face as compared to other virtual reality headsets and is perhaps the most comfortable one out there. It still lacks an absolutely must-have game, but with the power of Sony behind it, that’s not likely to be the case for long. Besides, the games it has now are pretty fun. If you’re looking for an easy onramp to the virtual reality world, PlayStation VR is definitely your best bet.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> HTC’s Vive headset offers the best virtual reality experience on the market right now, thanks to its well-designed headset and controllers, which let users immerse themselves in digital, interactive worlds. The Vive has a lot of little features that put it over the edge, not the least of which is a mode that lets you see what’s going on in the real world while you’re wearing it. It’s not for all homes, however: To get the full benefit of it, gamers will have to clear a minimum of 5 feet by 6.5 feet for its games, and sometimes even more than that.

The Oculus Rift, made by a Facebook-owned company, is also a worthy purchase and requires a little less space; prospective buyers may want to compare game lists before making such a huge investment. Both also require a pretty powerful gaming computer to work, which adds a hidden cost to the price of VR. But the HTC Vive offers the best overall package and the most immersive fun — as long as you’ve got the room, the money and the right computer. </p>

Now it’s all about drones — specifically, drones like the Yuneec Breeze, which advertises itself as the first flying selfie stick. The very compact (for a drone) Breeze is easy to set up and easy to fly. It is, however, very noisy, thanks to its four propellers. This is not for selfies you want to take in quiet places. (Pets may also not be huge fans of the whir.)

This is probably not the most practical gift in the world, but it is a fun one to be able to pull out for some epic family pictures. Potential buyers should also remember to review the FAA’s rules about drone flying and heed Yuneec’s own rules about operating the drone. </p>

It also adds built-in GPS, which is a blessing for all the runners, bikers, hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts out there.

And it’s pretty good when you’re not working out as well. The Apple Watch can improve users’ lives in a lot of little ways: a more accessible screen for getting driving directions, a handy place to keep track of your calendar, and a way to check on your calls or messages without taking out your phone. A selection of stylish bands and finishes gives users lots of style options as well. So, sure, this isn’t a must-have device for everyone. But it certainly is lust-worthy — and sometimes that’s all a gift needs to be.</p>

The new version of the Sense also lets you set alarms with your voice, rather than just through the app, and will also connect with other smart devices (Philips Hue lightbulbs and Nest thermostats for now) to set your home up for ideal sleeping conditions. As with most trackers, the Sense takes works best once you’ve given it at least a couple of weeks of consistent data. But if you have the patience, it’s a great tool for understanding what goes on when you’re off in dreamland.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The Nest Cam Outdoor does essentially what it says on the box — it’s a simple-to-use outdoor security camera. The device works with an app on your phone to alert you when it senses movement in its field of vision and lets you tune in from wherever you are to see live photos of what’s happening at home. An additional subscription to Nest Aware, the company’s cloud service, will save up to 30 days of video footage for you to review at any time.

The set-up for the Nest Cam Outdoor isn’t arduous, but does require a little bit of do-it-yourself initiative, and you will need an external outlet to keep it running. Nest does an excellent job of making this whole process as easy as possible. Besides, a few minutes up on a ladder is arguably a small trade-off for peace of mind.</p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Apple’s iPad Pro came out early this year in the standard 9.7-inch screen size we’ve come to expect from the iPad, making this super-capable tablet super-portable as well. Alone, the iPad Pro is probably Apple’s best tablet, thanks to its booming sound and ultra-fast processing. But the iPad Pro is best used with its add-on keyboard accessory, which lets you turn it into a very good word processing machine. Add the option Apple Pencil, and it becomes a perfect digital sketchbook as well.

As nice as the iPad Pro is, one could still argue that it can’t completely replace a laptop, particularly if your laptop is your primary work machine. For those who always have a lot of programs open, or who need to have more than two things up on the screen at once, they will likely feel the iPad Pro is slowing them down. That said, if you’re mostly looking for something that lets you single-task — whether that’s to write, draw, browse the Web or watch movies — it’s great. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Are you really serious about getting in on this drone trend? Consider the DJI Mavic Pro, which is an excellent option if you have about $1,000 to spare. (As drones go, that’s not too insane.) The DJI Mavic Pro has a camera capable of shooting 4K video and is foldable — meaning it can go where you can, and beyond.

DJI has earned high praise for its intuitive flying system and impressive build quality, as well as for packing a lot of value into its drones. Holiday buyers should know, however, that the company has faced some issues getting this product into its customers’ hands this year. And, of course, any drone present should also come with a reminder to study the FAA’s rules for flying drones (and an assumption of common sense).</p>

But it also has some modern tricks up its sleeve, not the least of which is that its cord is fully detachable, in case users want to be untethered from their phones during long flights or commutes.

It can connect to two devices at once over Bluetooth, and also has noise cancellation — meaning that it can make anywhere in the world into your own little oasis. Consumer reviews have shown that noise cancellation on these headphones doesn’t get marks as high as some wired competitors, but as an overall package, buyers can be pretty confident that they are getting what they’re paying for. </p>

	            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Bose boasts that its Soundlink Bluetooth Speaker III is the loudest and best-sounding from the line to date. And its fairly compact and clean styling makes it a beautiful addition to any desktop, kitchen counter or sound system. It also remembers up to six Bluetooth connections, so users shouldn’t have to spend too much time on set-up, even if they are using multiple devices.

It’s true that there may be more portable speakers out there (in fact, there is a mini version of this speaker), as well as some with more features. One big drawback of this particular speaker is that it doesn’t have a speakerphone, so you can’t take calls through it if someone interrupts your afternoon jam session. But overall this is an excellent device — particularly when considering the punch this packs at just three pounds. </p>
