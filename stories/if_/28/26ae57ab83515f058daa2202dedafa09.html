B. Antonio</a> hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila’s poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="628">In October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Mr. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila’s financial district — a 57-story symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://www.facebook.com/pg/trumptowercenturycity/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1317830394933885">“Live Above the Rest.”</a> And now his partner on the project, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="1002">After the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the president-elect’s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio’s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including Trump-branded resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio’s son Robbie Antonio said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="1246">“We will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,” the elder Mr. Antonio, one of the<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.forbes.com/profile/jose-antonio/"> richest men in the Philippines</a>, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his star-studded celebration in Manila.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

His antidrug crusade has resulted in<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/world/asia/philippines-duterte-mayor-police.html"> the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial</a>, prompting criticism from the Obama administration.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="470" data-total-count="2304">Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America’s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family’s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="2619">“It is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,” said <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://www.csis.org/people/michael-j-green">Michael J.

Mr. Trump’s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What’s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump’s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="3313">In an<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-interview-transcript.html"> interview with The Times</a> on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business — and his family’s ability to keep it running after he takes office.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="3514">“I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world,” Mr. Trump said, adding later: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="3671">In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="3849">“Vetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,” she said.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="4117" id="story-continues-7">But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="4470">In Brazil, for example, the beachfront <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://www.trumphotels.com/rio-de-janeiro">Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro</a> — one of Mr. Trump’s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake — is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="4890">Several of Mr. Trump’s real estate <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/india/trump-towers-pune/">ventures in India</a> — where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America — are being built through companies with family ties to India’s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump’s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="5303">In <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.trumpgolfireland.com/">Ireland</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.trumpgolfscotland.com/">Scotland</a>, executives from Mr. Trump’s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization’s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail’s habitat — a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="562" data-total-count="5865">And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump’s name be removed from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/istanbul/trump-towers/">Trump Towers in Istanbul</a> after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan — suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup — the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump’s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="449" data-total-count="6314">Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. “I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” he said during a radio <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2015/12/01/trump-blasts-obama-warning-world-war-iii/">interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. </a>“It’s a tremendously successful job. It’s called Trump Towers — two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It’s two.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="6559">These tangled ties already have some members of Congress — including at least one Republican representative — calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-11-23-GAO_Letter_On_Trump_Transition.pdf">perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them.</a></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="6803">“You rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,” Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/800914868039655425">said in a Twitter message</a> on Monday. “If you have contracts w/foreign govts, it’s certainly a big deal, too.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://twitter.com/hashtag/DrainTheSwamp?src=hash"> #DrainTheSwamp”</a></p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Kramer</a>, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump’s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency — and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="114" data-total-count="7321">“This will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,” Mr. Kramer said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="7645">Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president’s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="475" data-total-count="8120">“The working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,” said <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/bureau/204807.htm">Michael H. Fuchs</a>, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. “They will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="8352">At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump’s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="8614">Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="670" data-total-count="9284">What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump’s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump’s daughter<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.trump.com/the-next-generation/ivanka-trump/" title="Ivanka Trump link"> Ivanka, who is in charge of planning </a>and development of the Trump Organization’s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders — of Turkey, Argentina and Japan — having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="9593">Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="500" data-total-count="10093" id="story-continues-9">Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/politics/donald-trump-conflict-of-interest.html">emoluments clause</a>, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="10460">“I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “The only thing that matters to me is running our country.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="243" data-total-count="10703"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/experts/4/robert_d_blackwill.html"> Robert D. Blackwill,</a> a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="10888">“Let’s listen and not prejudge,” said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I want to see what he does as president.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-10">Continue reading the main story</a>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="365" data-total-count="12339" id="story-continues-12">The Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds — Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State — put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="12661">Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil’s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="349" data-total-count="13010">But Brazil’s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="13349">The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="429" data-total-count="13778">The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of “highly suspicious” potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. “It is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,” Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="508" data-total-count="14286">In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="14632">Mr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/world/americas/donald-trump-hotel-rio-immigration.html"> grandson</a> of João Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil’s 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="14828">In a statement, Mr. Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="15103" id="story-continues-13">Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company — given that it does not own the hotel — and “has no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="15523">The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister José Serra, Brazil’s top diplomat, publicly<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2016/07/31/internas_polbraeco,542408/a-era-petista-foi-uma-era-de-retrocesso-diz-jose-serra.shtml"> declared</a> in July that a Trump presidency would be a “nightmare.” Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="15866">Even if Brazil’s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="16217">“Brazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that’s about all they can do,” said Maurício Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “This is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-14">Continue reading the main story</a>

He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="396" data-total-count="17049">The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump’s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were “requesting a concession that could not be given.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="17210">By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump’s presence had not worked any magic.

Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="505" data-total-count="34993">Certainly, Mr. Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland have remained at the fore in the president-elect’s mind, even in recent days. Shortly after his election, he <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/business/with-a-meeting-trump-renewed-a-british-wind-farm-fight.html">urged a group of “Brexit” campaigners </a>led by Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party, to fight against wind farms in Britain. Wind farms have been a favorite target of Mr. Trump’s in both Britain and Ireland, where he has railed against proposed installations as a potential blight on the views from his resorts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="35211">After a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump initially denied that the matter had been raised with Mr. Farage’s group, Mr. Trump conceded during his interview with The Times this past week that “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/801130374566998016">I might have brought it up</a>.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="35458">Tony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Mr. Trump had once called him because Mr. Lowes’s group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Mr. Trump’s Irish course on environmental grounds.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="35544">“He certainly hates wind farms, that’s for sure,” Mr. Lowes said about the call.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="35648">His group decided against working with Mr. Trump, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="35919">“The dune system will not be able to develop naturally,” Mr. Lowes said. “It will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die.” He added, “The whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="528" data-total-count="36447">Mr. Trump’s representatives have advanced a number of rationales for the sea wall, with the most straightforward being that they simply want to buffer the land from a continuing erosion problem. The proposal has previously<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-climate-change-golf-course-223436"> attracted attention</a> because an environmental-impact statement submitted by Mr. Trump’s team highlighted the risks of climate change and its influence on “coastal erosion rates.” That was a noteworthy claim, since Mr. Trump has called global warming a hoax perpetrated “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en-gb">by and for the Chinese</a>.”</p><div id="story-ad-15" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Hugh McNally, the owner of<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://morrisseysdoonbeg.ie/"> Morrissey’s Bar</a> in Doonbeg Village, about two miles from the course, said the issue had been “sensationalized by the media” because of the Trump connection.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="37414">“I’ll give you an example,” he said. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced last year that it would<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161127162552/http://www.irishtimes.com/business/health-pharma/roche-close-irish-plant-with-240-job-losses-1.2427527"> close a plant</a> in nearby Clarecastle, causing the loss of more than 200 jobs. “If someone told them you’d save those jobs by building any wall, everyone would do it,” he said. “The only reason people are objecting here is because of Trump.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-31">Continue reading the main story</a>
