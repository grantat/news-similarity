(Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Chicago Police officials hold a press conference in Garfield Park in Chicago on Nov. 15, 2016, to announce that an arrest has been made in the death of 2-year-old Kyrian Knox, whose body parts were found in the park's lagoon. (Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter A man who was caring for 2-year-old Kyrian Knox in the summer of 2015 \"snapped\" and killed the toddler after the lactose-intolerant boy was fed milk and cried for a whole afternoon, police said. Kyrian's dismembered remains were found in the Garfield Park Lagoon on the West Side on Sept. 5, 2015. Police said in a news conference at the park Tuesday that a 41-year-old man is awaiting murder charges at Area North police headquarters in Kyrian's slaying. He was brought to Chicago on Monday from the Winnebago County Jail, where he was in custody on unrelated charges. The man had made a false missing person report last year claiming that the toddler had disappeared, police said. While the Cook County medical examiner's office ruled Kyrian's death a homicide, Area North Police Cmdr. Kevin said Tuesday that no one has been able to determine exactly how Kyrian was killed. \"Based on third party statements,\" Kyrian ingested milk one day, even though he was lactose intolerant, Duffin said. The toddler then kept crying all afternoon, said Duffin. The man \"kind of just snapped and couldn't deal with it anymore,\" he said. The break in the case came when police late last in 2015 found blood in the man's vehicle, yet the man denied that the toddler had been in the vehicle, Duffin\u00a0said.\u00a0 The blood was tested and this summer, police learned it matched the slain boy, said Duffin. \"Unfortunately, it took several months, I believe it was late July or early August of this year, when it was confirmed to be the baby's,\" he said. The remains of a\u00a0toddler found in Chicago's\u00a0Garfield Park Lagoon over Labor Day weekend in 2015 came\u00a0back as matching the DNA of 2-year-old Kyrian Knox, who was\u00a0reported missing in September\u00a0in Rockford. On Nov. 15, 2016, it was announced that an arrest had been made in the death of Knox. (Chicago Tribune) \"Once we took the vehicle with a search warrant, we...tore out the carpeting and recovered the baby's blood in the vehicle,\" he said. Police believe that Kyrian's remains were dumped in the lagoon because the man has family in the area of the park. \"As a father of a 6-month-old myself, it's hard to fathom why someone would do this to a child,\" said Ald. Jason Ervin, whose 28th Ward includes the park. \"But we are glad that this is the first step in bringing this case to justice.\" Kyrian wasn't reported missing until the foot of a toddler was found in the lagoon on Sept. 5, 2015. More remains were found over the course of two days. In mid-November last year, Chicago police said they were searching for a person of interest to question about the disappearance of Kyrian. Later that month, police said the couple who were last caring for Kyrian were refusing to cooperate in the investigation. At the time, they were not identified as suspects. Kyrian Knox Kyrian Knox is seen in this undated handout photo provided by Rockford Police.\u00a0 Kyrian Knox is seen in this undated handout photo provided by Rockford Police.\u00a0 (Rockford police) Police later said they had received DNA analysis matching the remains of Kyrian, who was reported missing from Rockford in mid-September. The medical examiner's office ruled Kyrian's manner of death was homicide, but the office did not determine a cause of death. Kyrian was believed to be in the care of a family friend before he was reported missing, according to Rockford police. Officials said the child could have been missing since August 2015. The toddler's mother, Lanisha Knox, 24, had moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with a high school friend who also has a 2-year-old. Both women left their children in the care of the high school friend's father who lived in Rockford, an official said. ",

    "text": "Nov 15 2016, 6:11 pm ET Keeping Trump Tower Safe Will Be an 'Unprecedented Challenge' by Cynthia McFadden, Anna R. Schecter and Tracy Connor Share advertisement Trump Tower has long been a magnet for millionaires, a mecca for tourists, and a monument to one man's need to put his name on everything. Now that its owner-occupant has been elected president, the 58-story glass tower smack-dab in the heart of Manhattan is something new: a headache for the Secret Service and the NYPD. And with Donald Trump reportedly thinking about commuting between his Fifth Avenue penthouse and the White House, it could turn into a full-blown migraine. \"It's an unprecedented challenge,\" said William Bratton, who was New York City's police commissioner until two months ago. \"You are in one of the busiest cities in the world, on one of the busiest streets in the world, and one of the most well-known buildings in the world.\" People are screened by security before Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrives at Trump Tower in New York for meetings with President-elect Donald Trump November 15, 2016. TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP - Getty Images Jonathan Wackrow, who was a Secret Service agent on three presidential details, said he has no doubt the agency and the NYPD can meet the challenge. \"Trump Tower will be secure. Period. That's not even a question,\" he said. \"The bigger issue here is the impact that those security measures will have on the people of New York.\" Other presidents have used retreats \u2014 the compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, or the ranch in Crawford, Texas, for the Bushes \u2014 but they were in easily protected locations. Trump Tower, on the other hand, has hundreds of tenants in 263 apartments, according to its website. That's on top of 26 floors of offices and a five-story public atrium with stores ranging from Starbucks to Gucci. Trump has not left the building since Thursday, and SWAT teams, barricades and sand-filled trucks are already fixtures \u2014 along with protesters. The sky above it is a no-fly zone until the inauguration at least. \"It's like living in the White House,\" said resident Rachel Adjmi Kaimowitz, who voted for Trump but isn't thrilled about all the new security in her building. \"It's distracting, it's nerve-wracking, it's a big problem.\" Law enforcement agencies are meeting this week to discuss plans for securing the skyscraper going forward. Possible scenarios include closing lanes on Fifth Avenue, home to Tiffany's and other world-famous retailers, NBC New York reported . A woman under an umbrella pulls her suitcase on Fifth Avenue by police barricades outside the Trump Tower building in New York, Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016. Richard Drew / AP New Yorkers can also expect to see restrictions on the side streets, bomb-sniffing dogs on the sidewalks and security booths popping up around the building, Bratton said. When there are large demonstrations, a section of Fifth Avenue may be shut down altogether, he said. All of it takes money, but how much is unclear. A senior NYPD official said the costs will be \"very significant.\" and another source estimated the price tag will be tens of millions of dollars. In a statement, the Secret Service said it has a long relationship with the NYPD \"involving large-scale complex security operations.\" \"We will continue to apply creative problem solving with our partners to achieve the highest level of security with the least amount of public impact,\" the agency said. Kaimowitz is already thinking of getting far away from Trump and his tower. \"Every time you have guests that come in you have to have them check in at a certain area and there's Secret Service all over,\" she said. \"I'm renting now and I'm considering not renting when my lease runs out. I think the people who own apartments are probably anxious to sell but they're not going to find anybody.\" But Frederic Bouin, 57, who has been living in the tower since 1990, has no complaints about the security lockdown. \"It's great,\" he said. \"It's the most secure building in the world.\" Cynthia McFadden ",

    "text": "Gun Control Groups Aim Their Money At States \u2014 And The Ballot That's what national reciprocity would do \u2014 it would give a concealed-carry-permit holder in a state such as Texas the right to carry a gun in a state such as New York, regardless of New York's concealed-carry laws. There are two versions of this law that have already been proposed in Congress, the broader of which would allow a person to get a concealed-carry permit outside his state of residence. \"That's the more controversial version of national reciprocity,\" Winkler says. \"I'm not sure that's the one we'll get, but the NRA is most likely going to push for the broadest version of national reciprocity.\" Winkler believes that some version is likely to pass, but he says that Democrats could filibuster. He also notes that some Republicans could withhold support from national reciprocity because of states' rights. \"If you believe in any local autonomy, as Republicans claim to, then the broad version of reciprocity undermines that significantly,\" Winkler says. \"Because a state or city like Los Angeles would no longer be able to control who carries guns in public.\" 2. An end to gun-free military zones At a rally in January, Trump said , \"My first day, there's no more gun-free zones.\" He was talking about schools and military bases. He later clarified his position on schools, saying that school resource officers or teachers should be allowed to carry them. He has not publicly changed his opinion on military bases. Currently, most gun owners on military bases must register their firearm and store it in an armory while on base. The only people who can carry guns while on a military base are on-duty military, state or local police. There have been pushes by the NRA and Republican lawmakers to allow more military personnel to carry firearms on base, following mass shootings at Fort Hood in 2009 and the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard in 2013, but the Department of Defense has not changed its position. Under Trump, it might. \"This is very easy,\" Winkler says. \"Allowing carrying of firearms on military bases is something that the president will probably be able to do through executive order. I believe that [Trump] will.\" 3. Removing suppressors from the National Firearms Act Gun owners can already use suppressors \u2014 or silencers \u2014 in most states, but gun rights groups say that the process to get one is onerous. Suppressors are regulated under the National Firearms Act, which was originally enacted in 1934 following the St. Valentine's Day Massacre to tax the making and transfer of certain firearms. The underlying purpose of the act, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was to \" curtail, if not prohibit, transactions in NFA firearms .\" Gun rights advocates and shooters have long argued that suppressors should not be regulated by the NFA and have made a public health argument for their use: Guns are loud. \"Everybody that you know that's an old shooter is deaf,\" says Michelle Camp, the leader of the Utah chapter of The Well-Armed Woman. \"To have the ability to get [suppressors] easier would be really helpful.\" Winkler says it would take legislative action to get suppressors off the NFA list and that a piece of legislation already exists: the Hearing Protection Act of 2015 , proposed in the House of Representatives. Winkler says he doesn't expect it to be a priority for Congress, but \"if the NRA decides to get behind silencer legislation, I think it will pass,\" he says. Hours after Trump won last week's election, the NRA dropped this tweet: \u2014 NRABlog (@NRAblog) November 9, 2016 4. Revamping federal background check process Nobody is entirely happy with the federal government's current background check process or its database, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Gun control groups argue that there are too many loopholes in it, and many gun rights groups concur \u2014 a rare show of agreement \u2014 though not in the details. The system is supposed to prevent a felon or someone who is mentally ill from purchasing a gun, but it has obstacles like underfunding and inaccurate, out-of-date data. Gun control groups would like to see things in the current system fixed, including the straw purchasing loophole. Gun rights groups say they'd like to find ways to get the system better data to work with. During his campaign, Trump said that he was against expanding background checks and that the current system needs to be fixed. \"Unfortunately, I feel the efforts to 'fix' the background check system will be really efforts to gut the background check system,\" Winkler says. \"To make it less effective, less streamlined, and make it harder for prosecutors to find gun criminals. That's been the NRA's practice with regard to background checks in the past.\" ",

Vice President-elect Mike Pence is also in charge of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Noah Bierman and Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporters The shoot-from-the-hip style that helped Donald Trump win the presidency is now playing out in his transition to governing. An insular group of loyalists and family members are at the helm, giving the public little information. A top establishment figure abruptly departed the transition team. And officials from across the federal government say they have heard nothing from the people who are supposed to take their place two months from now. By Tuesday, a week after his election, Trump\u2019s team had yet to discuss even basic elements of the government handoff with key players at the Pentagon, the State Department and other vital agencies, in large part because of a delay in signing the paperwork dictating the nuts and bolts of the process. \u201cWe are standing by ready to assist,\u201d said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. \"We stand ready,\" said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau. The Trump campaign kept mum throughout the day\u00a0as confidants and family members streamed in and out of Trump Tower in New York, occasionally stopping to speak with reporters cordoned behind a red velvet rope in the lobby, but giving up little before riding the elevator to Trump\u2019s office. Leaks about internal squabbles and personnel moves, many involving close campaign allies competing for top posts, were left to fill the information void. \"No. No,\u201d retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith\u00a0Kellogg, a Trump advisor,\u00a0said when asked about rumors of infighting on the Trump team. \u201cIt\u2019s all been good.\" Armand Emamdjomeh But one of Trump\u2019s most respected links to the Republican foreign policy community, Rep. Mike D. Rogers of Alabama, abruptly announced he was leaving the transition team. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, had been an important\u00a0bridge between Trump and skeptics in his party. Rogers had been a holdover from the transition team assembled by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was replaced as the team\u2019s leader last week by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect. A person close to Rogers called his departure part of an effort to distance the team from Christie.\u00a0 \"Anyone close to Chris Christie got dumped,\" said the Rogers ally, who would not be named discussing internal transition team dynamics.\u00a0\"All the level-headed people are stepping aside.\" Another potential bridge was also cut off when\u00a0Eliot Cohen, a prominent conservative critic of Trump, portrayed himself as walking\u00a0away angrily from an attempt at reconciliation. Cohen, a supporter of the war in Iraq who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s State Department, had organized a letter signed by dozens of former officials denouncing Trump during the campaign. \u201cAfter exchange [with]\u00a0Trump transition team, changed my recommendation,\u201d Cohen wrote on Twitter. \u201cStay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming 'you LOST!\u2019\u00a0Will be ugly.\u201d \u00a0 Trump had insisted during the campaign, contrary to evidence , that he had always opposed the Iraq war. Another potential player in the administration,\u00a0retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, also took himself out of the running for an administration job, according to Terry M. Giles, finance chairman during Carson\u2019s presidential campaign. Christie\u2019s departure was also responsible for the delay in setting up meetings between Trump\u2019s team and the leaders of federal government agencies. Christie had signed an agreement\u00a0with the Obama administration prior to election day that\u00a0set parameters for interactions between White House officials and designated representatives of the president-elect's team. This is America's state of mind on election day Open link That agreement, which is required by federal law and sets the conditions for access to documents, staff and facilities of federal agencies, no longer applied once Christie was removed from his position.\u00a0The White House said it received a new agreement signed by Pence late Tuesday. \u201cThe government is ready for the Trump folks, and the Trump folks need to get moving,\u201d said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that focuses on good governance.\u00a0 Stier said Trump seems to be figuring out how to move from campaigning to governing, one of the stiffest challenges that any president-elect faces, particularly one who campaigned\u00a0as an outsider. The task is enormous, he noted: hiring 4,000 people, implementing policy, learning enough to avoid national security risks, preparing a budget a month after inauguration and preparing for \u201cthings you can\u2019t expect, the asteroids that come in.\u201d \u201cWith two houses of Congress now held by the Republicans, they have to produce\u201d quickly, said\u00a0Martha Kumar, an expert in presidential transitions.\u00a0 Those most affected by Trump\u2019s\u00a0agenda are also anxious about the lack of clarity. Hospital groups, health insurers, consumer advocates and others have been scrambling since the election to learn how the Trump administration and it allies on Capitol Hill will fulfill their pledge to repeal and replace\u00a0the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Industry officials and others say it has been almost impossible to find out what the new administration is planning. Even identifying who is making decisions on what was a signature issue for Trump during the campaign has been a challenge, health sector leaders said. In 2008, President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s team moved faster, signing an agreement to meet with top officials in Bush\u2019s White House four days after he was elected. Eight years earlier, Bush\u2019s transition team could not begin meeting with agency officials for weeks because the result of the 2000 election was in doubt. Kumar and Stier both said that Trump has time to regain his footing. Kumar believes Pence, who served in Congress,\u00a0was a wise choice to lead the effort, given his ties to top lawmakers. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) tried to reassure the public that the effort remained on track\u00a0and that he was in touch with Trump almost\u00a0daily. \"We\u2019re going to do everything we can to help make him be as successful as he's going to be,\" Ryan said. Trump's team tapped Rep. Chris Collins of New York \u2014\u00a0the first in the House to support him \u2014\u00a0as a liaison to House Republicans, and sent an aide\u00a0to Tuesday's meeting of the House GOP as a legislative emissary.\u00a0 Yet even as the process moves forward, all new administrations face hurdles in getting their Cabinet choices approved by the Senate, even if their party has control. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a leading libertarian voice who briefly mounted his own presidential run, told CNN on Tuesday that he would not support John Bolton, once Bush\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, as a potential secretary of State, and would also have trouble supporting\u00a0Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, for the job\u00a0because of their support for the war in Iraq. \u201cGiuliani and Bolton are very similar,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBolton just has a more extensive cheerleading background with regard to the Middle East.\u201d Liberal critics have also begun taking aim at Trump\u2019s choices. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, speaking to corporate leaders at a Wall Street Journal forum, said Trump had already broken his promise to clean up Washington. \"He's putting together a transition team that's full of lobbyists,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kind of people he actually ran against.\" Times staff writers Michael A.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 At least four congressional investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email use and mishandling of classified information are expected to go forward even after the former secretary of state\u2019s election loss last week, Republican lawmakers tell Fox News. The probes, which cover allegations that Clinton lied to Congress about her email practices in October 2015 and\u00a0that government records were destroyed, are ongoing and not dependent on the election's outcome, two senior Republican senators said. \"I still don't have the information I need,\"\u00a0Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told Fox News. Johnson said the work of his committee, with jurisdiction over government records and the mishandling of classified information, would be careful not to disrupt President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the messages of this election that the public is disgusted when they see double standards, when they think people in high places, high government officials can get away with what ordinary citizens can't,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I just think it\u2019s extremely important to follow this thing through and get all the information. Make it public.\u201d A spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said answers, not the political calendar, are driving investigators. \"Senator Grassley has always followed inquiries through to their logical end, until he feels he's received the answers he needs to be able to satisfy the questions he posed on the public's behalf.\u00a0He performs oversight regardless of which party holds the White House, just as he initiates oversight inquiries irrespective of politics,\" the spokesperson said. While the senators have more latitude to conduct committee investigations, there is an expectation on the House side that leadership will set immediate priorities for the new session. Both the House judiciary and government oversight committees have pending investigations that cover allegations of a quid pro quo between a State Department executive and an FBI official over stripping an email of its classified status in return for coveted slots for the bureau overseas. Congressional sources said lingering questions about the FBI probe into the Clinton Foundation, and pay-to-play allegations, must also be resolved \u2013 though FBI Director James Comey sought to close the book on the email case right before the election, after briefly re-opening the matter. \"We still have some questions because [Comey\u2019s] latest letter narrowed the scope of their investigation to the time that she was secretary of state, but we're also interested in what happened before and what happened after that. It's this huge \u2026 mess that has to be cleaned up. So we would be remiss if we just dismiss it and moved on,\"\u00a0Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d Congressional sources said some committee requests for the State Department are over a year old, and others from the FBI, including for a handful of remaining interview summaries known as 302s, have yet to be fulfilled. \"[The requests] go back probably about a year. I've asked for information on who else, what other high-level administration officials were engaged on these emails,\" Johnson said.\u00a0 President Obama, among others, used an alias to correspond with Clinton on her personal email which resided on a private, unsecured server. During a weekend conference call with top donors, Hillary Clinton blamed Comey for her defeat. Clinton said Comey's decision to reopen the email case 11 days before the election put her campaign on the defense and blunted her ability to make a strong closing argument. While Comey announced two days before the polls opened that he continued to believe there was no basis for criminal charges, Clinton told donors the FBI director's decision reinforced a central Trump campaign theme -- that the system is rigged -- and it drove Trump voters to the polls on Election Day. On CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning,\u201d Clinton\u2019s former Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders said the failure goes beyond the emails. \"It's not a question of what happens in the last week,\" Sanders told Charlie Rose. \"The question is she should have won this election by 10 percentage points. The question is why it is millions of white working-class people voted for Obama, turned their backs on the Democratic Party.\" Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

Got it President-elect Donald Trump listens as President Obama talks to the media in the Oval Office of the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller November 15 at 6:14 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump, who clashed with leading Republicans throughout his campaign, faced growing tumult in his national security transition team on Monday as key members of his own party appeared to question his views and personnel choices. Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), a respected voice on national security thought to be a leading candidate to run the CIA, was among those pushed out of the team over the past two days, two individuals with direct knowledge said, in a series of moves that have added to the anxiety across the upper ranks of U.S. intelligence agencies. The changes came as Trump met Tuesday with incoming Vice President Mike Pence to discuss Cabinet and top White House personnel choices. Pence last week replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) as head of Trump\u2019s overall transition efforts, and Christie\u2019s associates \u2014 who had been Trump\u2019s link to the GOP mainstream for months \u2014 now find themselves losing influence. [ It\u2019s not just the Cabinet: Trump\u2019s transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees ] A number of Christie allies have been told they were no longer in line for top posts, according to several people familiar with the transition, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Paul Farhi discuss the appointments by President-elect Donald Trump of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus as chief of staff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Also on Tuesday, perhaps the most influential Republican on national security matters, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), weighed in on Trump\u2019s efforts to work with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, saying any efforts to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia are unacceptable. McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman who had a difficult relationship with Trump during the campaign, issued a statement blasting Putin as \u201ca former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America\u2019s allies and attempted to undermine America\u2019s elections.\u2019\u2019 A former U.S. official with ties to the Trump team described the ousters of Rogers and others as a \u201cbloodletting of anybody that associated in any way on the transition with Christie,\u201d and said that the departures were engineered by two Trump loyalists who have taken control of who will get national security posts in the administration: retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Rogers had no prior significant ties to Christie but had been recruited to join the Trump team as an adviser by the New Jersey governor. At least three other Christie associates were also pushed aside, former officials said, apparently in retaliation for Christie\u2019s role as a U.S. prosecutor in sending Kushner\u2019s father to prison. Rogers\u2019 departure adds to the list of positions for which the Trump team is struggling to find suitable candidates, and came as Eliot Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump among former GOP national security officials during the campaign, blasted Trump\u2019s transition team for its treatment of perceived foes. Now operating below Pence on the transition team, the people said, are advisers who are close to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \u2014 himself a top Trump associate known for his hardline views on immigration \u2014 and former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon. Bannon\u2019s recent appointment as chief White House strategist was denounced by advocacy groups and Democrats, who accuse him of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynist views. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday, in his first speech on the Senate floor speech since Trump\u2019s victory, that the president-elect should retract Bannon\u2019s appointment, calling the latter a \u201cchampion of white supremacy\u201d whose hiring undermines Trump\u2019s call for national unity following the election. 1 of 22 What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington View Photos Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders. Caption Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders. Nov. 10, 2016\u00a0 President Obama talks with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cBy placing a champion of white supremacy a step away from the Oval Office, what message does Trump send?\u201d Reid said. \u201cI say to Donald Trump, take responsibility. Rise to the dignity of the office of the president of the United States instead of hiding behind your Twitter account. ... Show America that racism, bullying and bigotry have no place in your White House.\u201d Inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, where the president-elect is planning his government, the shift is seen as a clear signal that Trump will govern more in line with the populist, hardline campaign he ran, the people said. In another surprising development on Tuesday, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. \u201cThe way I\u2019m leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,\u201d Carson said in an interview. \u201cI want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area.\u201d Carson, who is Trump\u2019s most high-profile African American supporter, has been under consideration for several positions in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, including secretary of health and human services. Adding to the uncertainty, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared to take himself out of the running for attorney general. Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney and a top Trump adviser, had been considered a leading candidate for the prestigious post. \u201cI won\u2019t be attorney general,\u201d Giuliani said Monday at a Wall Street Journal event. Cohen, meanwhile, drew widespread attention for his tweet. \u201cAfter exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They\u2019re angry, arrogant, screaming \u201cyou LOST!\u201d Will be ugly,\u2019\u2019 tweeted Cohen, who served from 2007 to 2009 as counselor to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He was a driving force behind an open letter last spring \u2014 eventually signed by 122 Republican national security leaders \u2014 who opposed Trump\u2019s candidacy. Cohen, who last week had urged career officials to serve in Trump\u2019s administration, said in an interview that a longtime friend and senior transition team official had asked him to submit names of possible national security appointees. After he suggested several people, Cohen said, his friend emailed him back in terms he described as \u201cvery weird, very disturbing.\u201d \u201cIt was accusations that \u2018you guys are trying to insinuate yourselves into the administration\u2026all of YOU LOST.\u2019\u2026it became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls,\u201d said Cohen, who would not identify his friend. Cohen also said the transition official was \u201ccompletely dismissive\u201d of concerns raised about Trump\u2019s appointment of Bannon, who Trump\u2019s advisors have strongly defended. His friend\u2019s email conveyed the feeling that \u2018we\u2019re so glad to see the bicoastal elites get theirs,\u2019\u201d added Cohen, who described the response as \u201cunhinged.\u2019\u2019 Trump transition officials had no immediate comment Tuesday, but Jason Miller, a senior transition communication adviser, told reporters Monday night that Trump and Pence know the urgency of filling key positions. \u201cObviously, inauguration day is not getting further away. And people need to get going. This is an absolute top priority understood by the president-elect and the vice president-elect,\u201d Miller said. Some political observers were also stunned to hear that Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, an adviser to Trump, was being considered as a candidate for agriculture secretary in the new administration. Miller was widely criticized for recently calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cc\u2013t\u201d on Twitter. He later placed blame for the tweet on a \u201cthird-party vendor\u201d who he said would be removed from his campaign staff. As for the president-elect, Trump jumped back on Twitter on Tuesday morning to argue about his expected loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Trump was known for his incendiary tweets during the campaign, but has tweeted only sporadically since his victory. \u201cIf the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y., Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily,\u201d Trump wrote at his personal account, @realDonaldTrump. Six minutes later, Trump changed his tone and defended the electoral college, where his victory was secured. The system is \u201cactually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!\u201d he wrote. Amid the widespread uncertainty, coordination between Trump\u2019s transition team and the Obama White House is now on hold until Trump\u2019s team signs a key document, the Associated Press reported. The document, a memorandum of understanding smoothing interaction between the two teams, has yet to be signed by Pence, who recently replaced Christie as head of Trump\u2019s transition planning. White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the Obama administration is working with Trump advisers to get the document signed. Some of Trump\u2019s biggest campaign fundraisers and super PAC donors were rewarded Tuesday with seats on his presidential inaugural committee, which will be headed by investor Thomas Barrack Jr., a Trump business associate who hosted the candidate\u2019s first fundraiser in May. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam \u2013 who together gave at least $11.2 million to his campaign and allied super PACs, making them Trump\u2019s biggest donors -- were named as finance vice-chairs. Other major financial backers on the committee include New York financier Lew Eisenberg, who headed the Republican National Committee\u2019s joint fundraising effort with the campaign; Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks, who gave at least $1.9 million to support Trump; and Laurie J. Perlmutter, the wife of Marvel Entertainment chief executive Isaac Perlmutter, who gave $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC days before the election. Other major campaign fundraisers were also give slots, including New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Dallas executive Roy Bailey, Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard, New York financier Anthony Scaramucci, Florida developer Mel Sembler, Dallas investor Ray Washburne and former RNC finance chairman Ron Weiser. Casino mogul Steve Wynn, who declined to say during the campaign which candidate he was backing, also secured a spot. The cascading developments followed a telephone call Monday between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they agreed that relations between their countries were \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement. Moscow said the two men discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about \u201ca settlement for the crisis in Syria\u201d and agreed that their aides would begin working on a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump\u2019s office later said that Putin had called to \u201coffer his congratulations\u201d and that they had discussed shared threats and challenges, \u201cstrategic economic issues\u201d and the long-term relationship between the two nations. The president-elect spoke admiringly of Putin during the campaign, praising him as a stronger leader than President Obama and saying the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria. Those views put Trump at odds with many GOP defense hawks, who are uniformly suspicious of Moscow and have denounced Russian actions in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Syria. The offer of cooperation could also immerse Trump in a deep controversy with the Pentagon, where military and civilian leaders have strongly opposed collaboration with Russia, particularly in Syria. Protests, meanwhile, continued for a sixth straight day in major cities and on college campuses over last week\u2019s election results, in which Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

    "text": "Last Updated Nov 15, 2016 4:19 PM EST By Arden Farhi, Major Garrett and Steve Chaggaris State of the transition The state of the transition is \u201cstalled...scrambling...and on pause,\u201d according to several sources familiar with the transition. The team at this point is not \u201cup and running fully\u201d after \u201cblowing up\u201d the team, beginning with Chris Christie\u2019s recent ouster as the chairman of the transition team.\u00a0 One sign -- personnel announcements that were supposed to be made this week have been put on hold.\u00a0 Members of the transition staff are waiting for further instructions from Trump Tower.\u00a0 For all intents and purposes, Christie no longer has a role in the transition, although formally he was merely demoted to the level of vice chair, a title held by several members of the team. He\u2019s \u201cgone, not involved -- on the sideline,\u201d according to one source, as is ally Mike Rogers . \u00a0 A Republican member of the national security establishment told CBS News\u2019 David Martin that Rogers was forced off the transition team because of his closeness to Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition before he was demoted last week. Trump replaced Christie at the top of the transition team with Pence. The other strike against Rogers, according to Martin\u2019s source, was that he had done his own investigation of Benghazi and found that Hillary Clinton had done nothing wrong. Rick Dearborn, a top aide to Senator Sessions, has filled some of the void left by Team Christie\u2019s departure. His is an operational role inside the transition, researching potential appointees.\u00a0 CBS News reports that Trump can be expected to name a national security team before other posts. The economic team is expected to be named second. Ben Carson will retain his advisory role within the transition but he will not have a job in the administration. Tom Barrack will be named chairman of the inaugural committee as soon as Tuesday. Lew Eisenberg is expected to be finance chair for the inaugural committee, and Ray Washburne will serve as one of the vice chairs. The transition has begun staffing an advance unit that will work through the inauguration. One source told CBS that Mr. Trump is expected to hold rallies in January to build on the election result in an effort to create some resonance with the public and produce a pro-Trump atmosphere about his promises and early initiatives. These rallies -- planning for which is in disarray -- were initially conceived as a seven-state thank-you tour before the inauguration. \u00a0 Cabinet appointments Secretary of State: Rudy Giuliani is pushing \u201chard, hard, hard\u201d for secretary of state, according to a source. He wants it and is the leading contender at this point. However, one source called the speculation a potential ego boost to Giuliani and his appointment has not yet been finalized. Attorney General:\u00a0Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is under consideration.\u00a0 Secretary of Defense: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, is among those being considered. She\u2019s seen as qualified, available and Trump needs to include a woman in his cabinet. Ayotte rescinded her support of Trump during the campaign over the 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video on which Trump could be heard using lewd language about women. Ayotte lost her re-election race against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan. Secretary of Commerce: Ray Washburne, a Texas-based businessman and Republican fundraiser, is under consideration. There is at least one other candidate.\u00a0 Trump and Pence in meetings at Trump Tower Donald Trump has been in meetings with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, as he works on filling out his Cabinet, including top national security posts. Pence was seen entering Trump Tower armed with a thick briefing book. ",

    "text": "Rudy Giuliani Emerges as Contender for Secretary of State By JUSTIN FISHEL Nov 15, 2016, 4:54 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Rudy Giuliani: In a Minute 0 Shares Email Former New York City mayor and fierce Donald Trump campaign surrogate Rudy Giuliani has emerged as a contender for secretary of state, a Trump transition team insider told ABC News. While he has also been under consideration for attorney general, aides told ABC News that he has said he would prefer a position as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Giuliani has spent most of his career in domestic politics and would be considered an outsider among the foreign service officers who walk the halls of the State Department. But Giuliani\u2019s experience as the mayor of New York City during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and his subsequent foray into security politics falls right in line with Trump\u2019s most urgent foreign agenda item: combating Islamic extremism and ISIS. \u201cISIS, short-term, I believe, is the greatest danger,\u201d Giuliani said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday. \u201cAnd not because ISIS is in Iraq and in Syria but because ISIS did something al-Qaeda never did \u2014 ISIS was able to spread itself around the world.\u201d Defeating ISIS might seem like a job for the Department of Defense, but the top diplomat plays a role in building alliances to defeat terrorist organizations. Secretary of State John Kerry has spent much of the past year meeting with leaders of the many foreign countries with interests in Syria and Iraq, including Arab League nations, European Union members, Russia, Turkey and Iran. Many of those countries have conflicting agendas. Trump has not revealed his strategy for defeating ISIS on the battlefield, insisting that he doesn\u2019t want to tip off the enemy. However, he has said he would be inclined to let Russia and its ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad lead the fight against ISIS in Syria. That would be a stark contrast from Barack Obama\u2019s policy. Giuliani also told The Wall Street Journal that while he would be willing to reset relations with Russia and China, a projection of U.S. military force has been missing from the relationship. \u201cRussia thinks it\u2019s a military competitor. It really isn\u2019t,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt\u2019s our unwillingness under Obama to even threaten the use of our military that makes Russia so powerful.\u201d A failed attempt to restart relations with Russia worsened with its annexation of Crimea and Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria, which often targeted U.S.-backed rebel forces. Trump seems willing to abandon those opposition forces, saying no one really knows who they are. 5 Major Foreign Policy Challenges Facing President-Elect Donald Trump Giuliani also said Trump could undo the Iran nuclear deal, Kerry\u2019s signature policy achievement. The next president \u201ccan disavow it, as a matter of law, like that,\u201d Giuliani said, snapping his fingers. In reality, walking away from the deal or renegotiating it with the six nations that signed it would be complicated and time consuming. It is, however, entirely possible to undermine the deal and get Iran to walk away from it, setting up a recipe for a military standoff should Iran continue to pursue a nuclear weapon. Unqualified? Not surprisingly, anti-Trump forces are already saying Giuliani is unfit to serve as secretary of state. Correct the Record, a political action committee that supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, says that Giuliani \u201chas little foreign policy knowledge and almost zero formal diplomatic experience\u201d and that \u201cinstead of fighting for American interests, he\u2019s spent the past 15 years making money off deadly dictators and sworn enemies of this country.\u201d The website questions some of Giuliani\u2019s business dealings with the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, an anti-Iranian group that was formerly designated a terrorist organization with a complex background and strong lobbying arm in Washington, an oil company owned by Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, a Serbian nationalist party and other organizations . Early Career Rudolph William Louis Giuliani (born May 28, 1944, in New York City) graduated from Manhattan College in the Bronx in 1965 before graduating magna cum laude from New York University Law School in 1968. He stayed in New York to do a clerkship for Judge Lloyd MacMahon, a U.S. district court judge for the Southern District of New York before moving to Washington, D.C., to work for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Giuliani would bounce between New York and D.C. several times \u2014 to New York for four years at a private practice, then back to D.C. to launch a political career. In 1981, Giuliani served as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s associate attorney general. Two years later, he was appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he did his clerkship. For six years, Giuliani earned a reputation as a tough U.S. attorney fighting drugs, violence and organized crime in the city. He prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including that of Wall Street trader Ivan Boesky, and indicted 11 heads of organized crime in the Mafia commission trial. David McNew/Getty Images Republican presidential nomination hopeful, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, talks to the reporters as he campaigns, July 24, 2007, in Riverside, California. Mayor of New York Despite a failed run for New York mayor in 1989, Giuliani ran again as the Republican candidate in 1993 and won. He went on to serve two terms and cement his place in the city\u2019s history. Giuliani worked to reform the New York City welfare system by requiring able-bodied people to work or perform community service to receive payments. The welfare-to-work initiative caused welfare rolls to drop more than 50 percent during his eight years in office. With his appointee Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, Giuliani aggressively tackled the city\u2019s crime problem. By the time Giuliani left office, the violent crime rate had fallen 56 percent, according to PolitiFact. Robberies plummeted by 67 percent. Murders fell by nearly two-thirds. Some critics point to data from the U.S. Justice Department that show New York City crime rates began to drop in the years before his mayoralty, saying the declines were part of a broader trend also seen in Chicago, San Diego, Miami and other cities. Others have criticized the tactics used to achieve those results \u2014 tactics like stop and frisk, which raised concerns about racial profiling but which Giuliani continued to defend as recently as this September. But Giuliani is best known for his leadership in the aftermath of the attacks against the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11. He was on the scene minutes after the second plane hit, and he coordinated rescue operations. \u201cTomorrow, New York is going to be here, and we are going to rebuild, and we are going to be stronger than we were before,\u201d he said in a late-night news conference on the day the towers fell. His approval rating grew dramatically after the attacks as he worked to restore American confidence, and he became known affectionately by his supporters as America\u2019s mayor. But some New York City firefighters and Sept. 11 family members later said they believed Giuliani capitalized on the attacks for political gain. Giuliani was named Time magazine\u2019s 2001 person of the year, with an article titled \u201cMayor of the World.\u201d Robert F. Bukakty/AFP/Getty Images PHOTO:New York Governor George Pataki, left, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, center, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, tour the site of the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 12, 2001 in New York. Personal Life In 2000, Giuliani ran against Hillary Clinton for the U.S. Senate while still serving as mayor. A diagnosis of prostate cancer caused him to withdraw from the race. At the time, his personal life was thrust into the spotlight when his extramarital affair with Judith Nathan became public. Weeks after he learned of his cancer diagnosis, Giuliani announced he was separating from his second wife, Donna Hanover, with whom he had two children. His first wife, Regina Peruggi, whom he married in 1968, was his second cousin. Giuliani married Nathan in 2003. 0 Shares ",
