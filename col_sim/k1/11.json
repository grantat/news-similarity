    "text": "OBAMA, TRUMP DISCUSS TRANSITION OF POWER The differences are even more stark when it comes to advertising.\u00a0 The Clinton campaign and its allies accounted for about 75 percent of all TV ads aired during the general election in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to data from the Center for Public Integrity provided to Time . Yet Trump won all four of those swing states, beating Clinton by a combined 820,518 votes. Romney unleashed $156.8 million in advertisements against President Obama's $241.5 million in ads last cycle, Politico reported. Clinton spent $211.4 million on ads in the 2016 general election. But Trump needed to spend just $74 million in ad dollars to capture the 279 electoral votes that assured his victory on Tuesday, with three states yet to be called. Not only did Clinton\u2019s monetary advantage fail to win her an Electoral College victory, it also didn\u2019t help turn out Democratic voters in the same numbers as the two previous presidential elections. With less money spent, Trump captured about the same number of total votes as Romney in 2012 \u2013 just fewer than 60 million (though 2016\u2019s tally hasn\u2019t been completely counted). Clinton was leading Trump in the popular vote total by about 200,000 votes as of Thursday morning. But that total badly trails the numbers put up by President Obama in 2008 (69.4 million) and 2012 (65.9 million), despite a comparable amount raised and spent on ads. In the final analysis, the man who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d ended up with a great one. Trump spent about $13.29 per individual vote and $2.8 million per Electoral College vote. Clinton spent about $21.63 per individual vote and $5.7 million per Electoral College vote. Advertisement ",

While many Democrats before Tuesday had put little real thought into the concept of a Trump White House, there was also little doubt after he won that they should accept the reality and try to make the best of it.

Related: In Capitol Hill Meetings, Trump Reveals Top Priorities Democrats in Washington are uneasy working with Trump, but worry he'd be more dangerous if left to his own devices. And as the the party of government, Democrats feel compelled to make it work for their constituents as much as possible. Dysfunctional government will generally benefit the anti-government party, which is the GOP. \"My number one priority in the next two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful,\" President Barack Obama said Thursday after meeting with Trump. As much as Democrats fear Trump's idiosyncratic agenda, they also fear he might end up a rubber stamp \u2014 wittingly or not \u2014 for the traditional conservative economic principles embodied by House Speaker Paul Ryan.

But Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress \u2014 and their way of doing business \u2014 were rejected. Rejected by their own primary voters, rejected during the campaign, and rejected in Tuesday's election,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said at the AFL-CIO on Thursday. \"If Donald Trump is ready to make good on his promise to get corruption out of politics,\" she continued, \"Then count me in. I will work as hard as I can. I will pull as many people as I can into the fight.\" But she drew a bright line around defending the rights of minority groups. \"That is Democrats' first job in this new era: We will stand up to bigotry. No compromises ever on this one,\" she said.

Bernie Sanders said in a statement. \"To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,\" Sanders added. The clarity of vision from the populist-left has made the muted response from the Democratic establishment more noticeable. Related: Obama Gives Trump White House Welcome The first real-world test of any cooperation be an infrastructure-spending bill, which was going to be a top priority of a President Hillary Clinton as well. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told colleagues that she spoke with Trump to offer \"the support of House Democrats to find common ground for a robust infrastructure jobs bill,\" according to an aide. Pelosi also suggested a path forward on child care and family leave issues, for which Trump expressed support during his campaign. But beyond that, the outlook is bleak for Democrats. Play ",

    "text": "WATCH SPECIAL REPORT: Trump, Obama Meet at White House 0 Shares Email The swamp placed a red carpet over itself to welcome Donald Trump . And the president-elect played it the way you would expect from pretty much any other president-elect. The scenes out of Washington today were striking to anyone who has watched Trump and the wild campaign he just concluded. There was Trump seated next to President Obama in the Oval Office, being wished well by the man whom he will replace. The president whose very legitimacy Trump questioned was praised by Trump as a \u201cvery good man,\u201d and for the \u201creally great things that have been achieved\u201d during his time in office. Just an hour later, there was Trump on Capitol Hill, sitting between his wife and House Speaker Paul Ryan . The man Trump labeled a \u201cweak and ineffective leader\u201d less than a month ago uttered Trump\u2019s signature phrase: \u201cMake America great again.\u201d Paul Ryan Meets With Donald Trump to Build Relationship, Plan Agenda It\u2019s not a question of whether this era of jovial banter and mutual praise will last -- it won\u2019t. But the scenes that played out in official Washington today serve as a vivid reminder of the key choices ahead for the biggest outsider ever elevated to this ultimate insider post. Not many details about the coming Trump era can be derived from the largely ceremonial motions of the two days since Hillary Clinton conceded the race to the White House. Today, the president-elect briefly mentioned jobs, immigration, and controlling health care costs as among his top priorities, though with scant details. As leaders in Washington size him up, it\u2019s worth remembering that Trump\u2019s rise came at the expense of the establishment of both political parties. He didn\u2019t just not have their support -- he plowed right through their collective strength. Trump rode a populist, angry wave based on a promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d and sported a biography where a lack of government experience was a plus. He took on the Obama legacy, the Republicans\u2019 hierarchy and ideology, the congressional leadership in both parties, and even the nation\u2019s military leaders -- and, yes, exploited racial and ethnic tensions and suspicions. Trump has never shown an accommodating side as a politician. It seems folly to expect he will adjust his agenda to fit those of other leaders in a city where he\u2019s pledged to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d But he comes to Washington largely liberated of the traditional special interests that have long held sway over the agenda. He will have a window to operate and make deals, buffeted by congressional majorities that remember, for now, that Trump helped them stay in power this election. His first trip to D.C. as president-elect also suggests he might benefit from an overall political weariness. Obama showed Trump a path, with his gracious recognition of his election, and what that means from here. \u201cI believe that it is important for all regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together,\u201d Obama said. The fights, and maybe even the tweets, will come later. But a political system that fought Trump every step of the way may not be in a fighting mood when he takes office. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump meets with Obama at White House in symbolic start to transition of power President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump took a triumphant tour of the nation's capital Thursday, holding a cordial White House meeting with President Barack Obama, sketching out priorities with Republican congressional leaders and taking in the majestic view from where he'll be sworn in to office. Trump's meeting with Obama spanned 90 minutes, longer than originally scheduled. Obama said he was \"encouraged\" by Trump's willingness to work with his team during the transition of power, and the Republican called the president a \"very good man.\" \"I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including his counsel,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. He'll begin occupying the office on Jan. 20. While Trump noted that he and Obama had never met before, their political histories will forever be linked. Trump spent years perpetrating the lie that Obama was born outside the United States. The president campaigned aggressively against Trump during the 2016 campaign, warning that his election would put the republic at risk. Click and drag within the image to explore a 360-degree view of President Barack Obama meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 10, 2016. (Jim Watson / AFP) But at least publicly, the two men appeared to put aside their animosity. As the meeting concluded and journalists scrambled out of the Oval Office, Obama smiled at his successor and explained the unfolding scene. \"We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed the country succeeds,\" Obama said. From the White House, Trump headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to discuss the GOP legislative agenda. Ryan, who holds the most powerful post in Congress, was a sometime critic of Trump and never campaigned with the nominee. Emerging from the meetings, Trump sketched out priorities for his presidency. \"We're going to move very strongly on immigration,\" he said. \"We will move very strongly on health care. And we're looking at jobs. Big league jobs.\" (Tribune news services) Ryan took Trump on a tour of the Speaker's Balcony overlooking the National Mall, the scene of Trump's upcoming inauguration. The view, Trump said, was \"really, really beautiful.\" Trump was also beginning the process of putting together his White House team. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who worked his way into Trump's inner circle during the election, and top campaign official Kellyanne Conway were emerging as possible picks for White House chief of staff, according to two people familiar with the transition planning. A third person said conservative media executive Steve Bannon was also in the mix, though others insisted Bannon would not have a White House role. Those involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days. First lady Michelle Obama met privately in the White House residence with Trump's wife, Melania, while Vice President Joe Biden saw Vice President-elect Mike Pence late Thursday. Trump's team was said to be sketching a robust role for Pence, an experienced Washington hand, that would include both domestic and foreign policy responsibilities. President Barack Obama met with President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 10, 2016, at the White House. Obama and Trump met alone, with no staff present, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters following the discussion. \"The two men did not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office,\" Earnest said. \"We're on to the next phase.\" Trump traveled to Washington from New York on his private jet, breaking with protocol by not bringing journalists in his motorcade or on his plane to document his historic visit to the White House. Trump was harshly critical of the media during his campaign and for a time banned news organizations whose coverage he disliked from his events. At the White House, Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough was seen walking along the South Lawn driveway with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. A handful of Trump aides trailed them. 2009: Oval Office of the White House J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press President George W.

Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) The show of civility at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue contrasted with postelection scenes of protests across a politically divided country. Demonstrators from New England to the heartland and the West Coast vented against the election winner on Wednesday, chanting \"Not my president,\" burning a papier-mache Trump head, beating a Trump pinata and carrying signs that said \"Impeach Trump.\" More than 100 protesters held a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House. The mostly student protesters held signs saying \"Love Trumps Hate,\" a phrase Democrat Hillary Clinton often used during the campaign. Trump's advisers, many of whom were stunned by his unexpected victory, plunged into the huge task of staffing government agencies. A transition website, GreatAgain.gov, referenced 4,000 political appointee openings. Officials at the Pentagon and State Department said they had not yet been contacted. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency stood ready \"to work with the incoming team once that team is designated and arrives here. But we don't have any firm word as to when that will be.\" As president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same daily intelligence briefing as Obama \u2014 including information on U.S. covert operations, information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by America's 17 intelligence agencies. The White House said it would organize two exercises involving multiple agencies to help Trump's team learn how to respond to major domestic incidents. Associated Press ",

Experts and educators say an alarming succession of racist behavior, graffiti and crime since Election Day can be linked to\u00a0Trump's victory. And they say the Republican president-elect could play a crucial role in curbing the disquieting\u00a0conduct. Obama says he and Trump had 'excellent conversation' Carlos Wiley, director of the Paul Robeson Cultural Center at Penn State University, said he believes the attacks represent a backlash from people who suppressed racial hatred for years during the Obama presidency. Now they feel it is safe to openly display their contempt. \"People looked at the way protesters were manhandled at Trump rallies, and they think 'oh, if someone disagrees with us, we can do those things\u00a0as well,' \" Wiley said. Enid Logan, who teaches sociology and African-American studies at the University of Minnesota, says Trump's victory legitimized white supremacists' point of view. \"There was nothing subtle with Trump \u2014 extreme vetting and ideological testing of Muslims, deporting all undocumented people, Mexicans are rapists and murders,\" she said. \"And he won. White people supported him.

President Obama said they had an \"excellent\" and \"wide-ranging\" conversation. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS on Publish Date November 10, 2016. Photo by Stephen Crowley/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and Donald J. Trump made a public show on Thursday of putting their bitter differences aside after a stunning election upset. The Oval Office meeting brought together a president who has darkly warned that Mr. Trump could not be trusted with the nuclear codes and a successor who rose to political prominence questioning Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace and legitimacy. \u201cI want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Mr. Obama told Mr. Trump as the two sat side-by-side after the roughly 90-minute meeting. The president called the session \u201cexcellent\u201d and wide-ranging. Mr. Trump, who said he had never met Mr. Obama before and expected the meeting to last only 10 or 15 minutes, said it had been a \u201cgreat honor\u201d to sit with the president. \u201cWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Mr. Trump said. It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites \u2014 Mr. Trump a brash real estate executive and reality television star whose campaign was defined in opposition to the sitting president, and Mr. Obama, a cool-tempered intellectual who has pressed a progressive agenda in office. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump, whose election on Tuesday stunned the president and rocked the political establishment in Washington, arrived in the White House driveway on Thursday out of sight of the crowds of reporters and news media cameras assembled there. His staff had refused to arrange for journalists to document his movements, as is customary both for the president and the president-elect, and Mr. Obama\u2019s team did not arrange for the traditional photograph of the sitting president and his wife greeting their successors in front of the White House. Mr. Obama said his wife, Michelle, who emerged this fall as an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, met with Melania Trump while their husbands spoke in the Oval Office. \u201cWe want to make sure that they feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Trumps. The meetings unfolded as Mr. Obama\u2019s staff was starting the daunting business of handing over the vast bureaucracy of the United States government to Mr. Trump\u2019s staff, including vital national security information and resources he would need in the event of a catastrophic attack. Ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington on Thursday morning, top advisers to Mr. Obama had spent months preparing for a transition, a highly complex venture condensed into the 72-day period between now and the Jan. 20 inauguration. It is up to them and the Trump team to set it in motion, pairing Obama administration staff members with representatives of the president-elect for crash courses in the inner workings of the White House and federal agencies. Two war-gaming exercises are planned to help ready the new team for a terrorist strike or other national security crisis. Mr. Obama said Wednesday that he had instructed his staff to follow the example set by President George W. Bush in 2008 and provide a professional and smooth transition for Mr. Trump\u2019s team, despite the vast policy differences that separate the president and his successor. For all the public drama and division of the presidential campaign, in private, Mr. Obama\u2019s aides have since July been quietly working with advisers to both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump to plan for the passing of power.

By David Nakamura and Juliet Eilperin November 10 at 2:38 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @eilperin Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was \"very encouraged\" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump and President Obama met for the first time Thursday and pledged to work together, starting the whirlwind transition that will unfold over the next 10 weeks until Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump later met with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) at the Capitol and said they also would work together \u2014\u00a0but on Republican goals that are opposed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. \"We're going to lower taxes,\" Trump told reporters, with Ryan seated by his side. \"We're going to fix health care and make it affordable and better.\" He appeared to be referring to a plan to lower taxes that heavily benefits top earners and to the GOP's aim of repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Following his meeting with Ryan, Trump conferred with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) in the Kentucky senator's Capitol office. An hour and a half after Trump entered the White House through the South Lawn entrance \u2014 avoiding news cameras and the president's staff \u2014 a group of reporters was ushered into the Oval Office, where the president and president-elect were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room. In a sign of how tensions between the two politicians have not disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the election, the White House did not arrange for the traditional photo-op between the current first couple and the incoming one, a custom that George W. Bush and his wife Laura observed when the Obamas visited the White House in 2008. Melania Trump met\u00a0separately with Michelle Obama. [ Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington ] Still, Trump told reporters Thursday that he expects to work closely with Obama now and in the future to\u00a0seek his advice in guiding the country. He noted that a session that was supposed to last 10 to 15 minutes went on for an hour and a half. \u201cAs far as I'm concerned, it could have lasted a lot longer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.\u201d \u201cSo Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future,\u201d he added, calling Obama \u201ca very good man.\u201d 1 of 22 What President-elect Donald Trump is doing on his trip to Washington View Photos Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Obama, for his part, said, he was\u00a0encouraged by \"the interest in President-elect Trump's wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces. And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face.\u201d The president said that the men's two wives had enjoyed spending time together\u00a0Thursday morning. \u201cWe want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMost of all, I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed \u2014\u00a0because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s victory exposes Obama\u2019s inability to connect with white working class ] Later, Trump and his wife, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, met with Ryan at the Capitol, where Trump pledged to work closely with Republican congressional leaders. Ryan ushered Trump out onto the Speaker's Balcony and gestured toward the Washington skyline and the monuments west of the Capitol. He pointed to an inaugural platform being built on the Capitol grounds, appearing to show Trump where he would be taking the oath of office as president. McConnell joined Trump and his entourage on a walking tour through part of the building. At the White House, first lady Michelle Obama and Melania Trump met for tea in the private residence and took a tour that included stepping onto Truman Balcony, as well as a tour of the State Floor with the White House curator. They talked about raising children in the White House, and then they visited the Oval Office to meet the president and president-elect. As\u00a0the two leaders met, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough gave a tour to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and other aides, notably Dan Scavino, across the edge of the Rose Garden. Afterward McDonough led\u00a0Kushner on a walk down the South Lawn for nearly 20 minutes, at which point the two men rejoined Trump's senior staff\u00a0and reentered the White House. During Obama and Trump's press availability, Kushner snapped photos with his iPhone. A slew of journalists, including international reporters, milled about on the driveway leading to the West Wing ahead of Trump's arrival. Some did live updates to their networks. Across West Executive Drive, dozens of White House staffers gathered on a steps in hopes of a glimpse of the president-elect. This is the scene on the West Wing driveway right now. pic.twitter.com/KoLxqek8qo \u2014 David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 10, 2016 Obama has pledged his administration's full cooperation with Trump's transition team, citing the close working relationship he enjoyed with President George W. Bush during their transfer of power eight years ago. The White House said\u00a0that Pence met with Vice President Biden in the afternoon. \u201cI have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect,\u201d Obama said in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. The president said he called to congratulate Trump early Wednesday morning after news networks had formally announced Trump as the winner over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after the meeting that the two men did not try to resolve all of their differences, but he said it was \"a little less awkward\" than reporters might have anticipated. Obama and Trump met privately without any other staff in the room. A large part of the Oval Office session was devoted to talking about how to staff and organize the White House. \"That's complicated business,\" Earnest said, noting that presidents have to deal with multiple challenges and crises at the same time. It is \"something President Obama has thought about extensively over the past eight years.\" Obama had denounced Trump as \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d for the White House during a long and brutal campaign. But he said that \u201cwe are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\u201d Trump, and Clinton, already had been receiving national-security briefings as the nominees of the two major political parties. The White House said Thursday that Obama has convened a coordinating council to facilitate a smooth transition, including providing briefings from federal agencies to Trump's transition team, headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). Officials from the Trump transition team are starting to set up shop in agencies across the federal government, where they can consult with top Obama officials as they assemble their staffs. The current White House has already begun to transfer a massive amount of information to the National Archives and Records Administration: so far it has sent 283 million files, comprising 122,000 gigabytes of data. In an interview Wednesday, White House communications director Jennifer Psaki said the president has talked privately with his staff, as well as publicly, about\u00a0putting institutional interests ahead of political ones. Referring to the speeches Obama delivered upon winning the presidency and at his first inaugural, she said: \u201cHe reflects a lot about the cog in the wheel that you are as president. He was taking the baton, he\u2019s handing it off. But I think it\u2019s a recognition that it\u2019s bigger than individual aspirations and it\u2019s bigger than yourself, and bigger than anything that you\u2019ve accomplished. Because we as a country need to be stable, need to have continuity.\u201d In the wake of protests over Trump's win, Earnest said that while the president believes the protesters have a right to express their opinions, his\u00a0message to them is that \"we're Americans and patriots first\" and that an orderly transfer of power ranks as a top White House priority. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who ran unsuccessfully in the GOP presidential primary and harshly criticized Trump, was at the White House on Thursday to attend Obama's ceremony for the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Kasich said he saw people protesting Trump's election as he entered the White House gates, and he called for unity. \u201cI just want to remind everyone in our country that the office of the presidency needs to be respected,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cToday, I said my prayers on the plane for the success of Donald Trump. And I think as Americans, we all need to come together.\u201d There is long-standing bad blood between Trump and Obama, after the New York businessman led a public campaign to try to force the president to disclose his long-form birth certificate in 2011 over unfounded questions from some conservatives who thought the president was not born in the United States. As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) During the White House Correspondents' Association dinner that year, Obama lit into Trump, mocking him before a ballroom of 2,000 guests and on live television. During the campaign, Trump promised to repeal the president's signature health-care law and overturn many of his executive actions. Obama said Trump was not to be trusted with the nation's nuclear codes and represented an existential threat to democracy. Obama sought to play down their differences and said Trump's victory speech was magnanimous and set the right tone to help try to heal the nation's political divisions that were exposed and inflamed over the past 15 months. \u201cThey do not have an extensive personal relationship,\u201d Earnest said Wednesday, drawing laughs from reporters. \u201cThis is not a situation where they\u2019ve had many conversations or played golf together or any of that business. So I guess that will be among the many, many, many reasons that tomorrow\u2019s meeting will be rather interesting.\u201d After his meeting with Trump, Obama will welcome another high-profile visitor with his own large media contingent when LeBron James and the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers arrive for a South Lawn ceremony with the president. 1 of 51 ",

His chief legislative triumph, the healthcare reform law known as Obamacare,\u00a0is one that Republicans in Congress are eager to repeal and Trump has promised to replace. \"We\u2019re going to fix healthcare, make it more affordable\u00a0and better,\u201d Trump said Thursday\u00a0after his first meeting with Republican leaders in Congress. \u201c...

Aides had hoped that if Hillary Clinton won the presidential race and Democrats made gains in Congress, the outgoing Republican majorities might agree to deals with Obama on trade, criminal justice reform\u00a0and perhaps even his Supreme Court nomination eight\u00a0months ago of Merrick Garland, which Republicans have refused to consider. Instead, as Republicans prepare to\u00a0take control of the executive and legislative branches, Obama is planning a farewell tour of the country, aides say, to send a message of unity but also to remind Americans of what they stand to lose if Republicans peel back his actions. On Obamacare, for example, 20 million people stand to lose healthcare coverage if the law were repealed. Obama\u2019s strategy is to remind those consumers about what they stand to lose, in turn pressing Republicans to come up with a replacement that ensures their coverage remains intact. \"A lot of his signature programs are going to get gutted,\" predicted presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. \u201cBut this idea that Obama\u2019s suddenly losing his legacy is premature. He may lose the Affordable Care Act, which is a major part of his legacy. But the amount of things he\u2019s been able to do over eight years will be looked upon well in history.\" Obama aides hope to take advantage of divides within the GOP about the best path forward, and Democratic allies in Congress are plotting how to fend off Republican efforts to undo Obama\u2019s key accomplishments and to work with Trump on issues where there is some agreement. House Minority Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), for instance, has cited a \"robust infrastructure jobs bill\" and child care and paid family leave issues,\u00a0which Trump campaigned on but that Republicans have opposed,\u00a0as areas of potential cooperation. This is America's state of mind on election day Open link Nullifying other key Obama accomplishments might not be as easy as Trump made it sound on the campaign trail. For example, the nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which Trump repeatedly assailed as a sign that Obama is a weak negotiator, can\u2019t be easily undone without the other countries involved. Trump could conceivably reimpose sanctions on Iran that Obama eased as part of the agreement, but that would free Iran to fire up its reactors again. As for other international agreements, like the global landmark climate accord reached in Paris in December, Trump can refuse to take the steps toward carbon reduction that Obama agreed to. Other administrative actions on climate are easier to undo, like regulations of coal-fired power plants or fuel efficiency standards for cars. Still, many industries have already adapted to the regulations and made investments they can\u2019t recoup; that could put corporate pressure on Trump to preserve them. Trump may also find, as Obama did, that declaring intent to act doesn\u2019t always bring about change right away. Eight years after ordering the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, for example, Obama still hasn\u2019t been able to make it happen. Obama and Trump met for 90 minutes at the White House on Thursday. Aides said Obama had not planned to litigate old grievances with Trump in their first sit-down meeting, and so probably did not bring up the issue of birtherism\u00a0with the man who used it to undermine his presidency for years. Afterward, the two exchanged pleasantries and sounded flattering notes in their remarks to reporters in the Oval Office, and Trump dashed to Capitol Hill to weigh in more specifically on agenda items. Meeting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan in the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s ceremonial office, Trump ticked off the big items he campaigned on: immigration, lower taxes and healthcare, saying his administration was \u201cgoing to make it more affordable.\u201d \u201cWe are going to do absolutely spectacular things for the American people,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand I look forward to starting.\u201d Whatever parts of the Obama presidency Trump has pledged to undo, Brinkley predicted, Obama was likely trying to preserve as he opened a new chapter in his relationship with Trump. \"One thing I know Barack Obama is not going to do,\u201d said Brinkley, \u201cis start belittling Donald Trump.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States , Kamala Harris becomes the first black politician to represent California in the U.S. Senate , a heavily-armed man killed one and injured two others in Azusa, \u00a0and the L.A.
