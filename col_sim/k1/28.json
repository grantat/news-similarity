Advertisement Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged \u201ca separation\u201d from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years\u2019 time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial , prompting criticism from the Obama administration. Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America\u2019s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite. \u201cIt is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,\u201d said Michael J. Green , who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department. Continue reading the main story The Trump Brand Around the World Donald J. Trump has business interests in at least 20 countries, in addition to extensive hotel and real estate holdings in the United States, according to an analysis of his financial disclosure report . Each dot represents a city where he has at least one enterprise. The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What\u2019s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders. In an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business \u2014 and his family\u2019s ability to keep it running after he takes office. \u201cI\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it.\u201d In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings. \u201cVetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies. In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake \u2014 is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India \u2014 where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America \u2014 are being built through companies with family ties to India\u2019s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans. In Ireland and Scotland , executives from Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail\u2019s habitat \u2014 a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States. And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump\u2019s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan \u2014 suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup \u2014 the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests. Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It\u2019s two.\u201d These tangled ties already have some members of Congress \u2014 including at least one Republican representative \u2014 calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them. \u201cYou rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,\u201d Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. \u201cIf you have contracts w/foreign govts, it\u2019s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story David J. Kramer , who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump\u2019s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency \u2014 and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad. \u201cThis will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president\u2019s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials. \u201cThe working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,\u201d said Michael H. Fuchs , who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cThey will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies. Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president? What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization\u2019s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders \u2014 of Turkey, Argentina and Japan \u2014 having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide. Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause , appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels. \u201cI mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in. \u201cLet\u2019s listen and not prejudge,\u201d said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI want to see what he does as president.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Trump\u2019s project in Rio de Janeiro. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a Brazilian federal prosecutor, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. Credit Lianne Milton for The New York Times BRAZIL Nation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect\u2019s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish 171-room beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a 4,000-square-foot nightclub. \u201cThis is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time. But just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the president-elect in their dealings in Latin America\u2019s largest country. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds \u2014 Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State \u2014 put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra. Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil\u2019s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries. But Brazil\u2019s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades. The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic. The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of \u201chighly suspicious\u201d potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. \u201cIt is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,\u201d Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October. In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies. Mr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil\u2019s 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently. In a statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Alan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company \u2014 given that it does not own the hotel \u2014 and \u201chas no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.\u201d The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Serra, Brazil\u2019s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect. Even if Brazil\u2019s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent. \u201cBrazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that\u2019s about all they can do,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Trump Tower Mumbai is one of five Trump Organization projects in India, a country where connections between developers and officials are common. Credit Asmita Parelkar for The New York Times INDIA Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles On the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing. In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state\u2019s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization\u2019s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed. The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump\u2019s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were \u201crequesting a concession that could not be given.\u201d By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,\u201d Mr. Chavan said. Kalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai , the Trump Organization\u2019s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor. \u201cThe notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,\u201d Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. \u201cThe Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.\u201d This example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians \u2014 officially or unofficially \u2014 to push projects through the bureaucracy. Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats \u201cwhose main goal in life is to attract rent,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, Trump Towers Pune , is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country\u2019s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad. In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs. It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans. Top officials might \u201cthink in some way the U.S. president will help them,\u201d and \u201ccan put in a friendly word with the banks\u201d to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure. \u201cIf the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will think the president is meeting them.\u201d Photo Donald J. Trump\u2019s real estate partners from India met with him in New York on Nov. 15 as the presidential transition was underway. Another pitfall is that Donald Trump\u2019s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits. ",

    "text": "CBS News Francisco Lopera: They were getting disease very early in the life. It all began many years earlier, back in the 1980s when Lopera was a young medical resident. \u00a0He had read about small numbers of people scattered around the world who\u2019d developed Alzheimer\u2019s in their 40s.\u00a0 So when a 47-year-old man came into his Medellin clinic with Alzheimer\u2019s-like symptoms, he was intrigued and decided to investigate. Lesley Stahl: You met this one man and you decided to go to where he was from? Francisco Lopera: I decided to go to the town where he was living. Lopera learned that the man\u2019s father and grandfather had also lost their memories in their 40s.\u00a0 Then, a few years later, another similar patient came into the clinic, this time a 42-year-old woman from a town 40 miles away. \u00a0Dr. Lopera\u2019s then-nurse, Lucia Madrigal, asked if any of her relatives also started losing their memories when they were young. Lucia: They told us yes, that the father, the uncles, the grandfather, the great grandfather, so I started making a little family tree, on one page, and I showed it to Dr. Lopera and I told him \u201cLook what we have here. What is this? So many with the same disease\u2026\u201d And so began a detective hunt that lasted more than a decade. Lopera and Madrigal traveled all over the region, finding more and more people afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and compiling family trees.\u00a0 They thought it might be genetic, so Madrigal spent days at parish churches, poring over heavy ledgers where priests for generations had recorded village births, marriages, and deaths.\u00a0 Thanks to these meticulous records, she was able to trace the disease back hundreds of years, and to make an important discovery -- the different families were actually one huge extended family, connected generations back by common ancestors who had died young, with an unusual cause of death written down by the priest: \u201csoftening of the brain.\u201d This is what \u201csoftening of the brain\u201d looks like in real life.\u00a0 Fernando is 46 years old, a descendant of that second patient years ago. He started forgetting things when he was in his late 30s, and now can no longer speak, feed himself, or do just about anything on his own. His aunt takes care of him round the clock just as she did with his mother when she got the disease at the same age. Norelly is at an even later stage of the disease.\u00a0 Despite her appearance, she is just 58 years old. Patients were going from mild symptoms to complete dementia and then death within about a decade -- as Dr. Lopera showed us in these cognitive test results. Francisco Lopera: You can see, at 38\u2026 Even at age 38, this man struggled -- as many older Alzheimer\u2019s patients do -- to copy a complex drawing accurately. Francisco Lopera: At 45.\u00a0 And things got worse from there.\u00a0 Francisco Lopera:\u00a0 He lost more. At 50. Lesley Stahl: Ah! Oh! Francisco Lopera: At 51. Lesley Stahl: Oh! Dr. Lopera was convinced that what he and Madrigal were discovering was scientifically important, but even as they found more patients and more related families, he couldn\u2019t get anyone outside Colombia to take notice. Until 1993, when a Harvard professor came to give a talk about Alzheimer\u2019s in Bogota, several hours away. Ken Kosik: There was a person in the audience, Francisco Lopera, who came up after the talk and said, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s-- I have a family here that w-- has-- early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d Ken Kosik, now at UC Santa Barbara, was that professor. Lesley Stahl: A family. Could\u2019ve been four people. Ken Kosik: It could\u2019ve been just four people. But he started to tell me how many it was. And as I listened to him, I became just so absorbed and taken with what he was telling me that I changed all my plans, went with him to Medell\u00edn. And, we began a collaboration that goes on to this day. They showed Kosik what Lucia Madrigal showed us -- the family tree they had compiled based on all that searching through church records, for just one of the affected families, going back all the way to the 1800s. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: This is one family? Lucia: Una sola! (Only one!) It just kept unfolding and unfolding. Covering these pages are small squares representing men, circles for women. The colored-in squares and circles mean the person got sick with Alzheimer\u2019s at an early age.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Look, she had these sons and a daughter. And then it just kept going down-- through the generations\u2014 Lucia:\u00a0 Si. Ken Kosik: When we looked at the family trees, about 50 percent of the offspring were getting the disease. That\u2019s a clear signature of a gene. But what gene? Kosik connected Dr. Lopera with leading geneticists in the U.S., and they started collecting blood samples and searching.\u00a0 Within a year, a major breakthrough. They found a specific mutation in a gene on chromosome 14 \u2013 one tiny flaw in the DNA responsible for all this family\u2019s suffering.\u00a0 The discovery was published in 1997 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Lopera had identified the largest concentration of early onset Alzheimer\u2019s cases in the world. Lesley Stahl: If a person has that mutation, do they get Alzheimer\u2019s? Ken Kosik: Yes, they do. Lesley Stahl: If they have it, they definitely get the disease. Ken Kosik: Right. There are some mutations where you don\u2019t definitely get it. But this is a bad one. And if you have this mutation, you get it. For families like Alonso\u2019s, discovering the mutation was a blessing \u2013 a crucial first step toward finding a way to fight the disease.\u00a0 But it was also a curse, because it meant that anyone whose parent had the mutation has a 50/50 chance of having inherited it too. Lesley Stahl: Do any of you know if you have that mutation? Do you know? Victor: No. Freddie: Nobody knows. Lesley Stahl: Nobody knows. Well, somebody knows.\u00a0 Dr. Lopera and his team have been testing for the mutation and compiling a database, but their policy is not to tell family members if they have the mutation or not -- and not even to reveal the results to Dr. Lopera -- since at this point there is nothing that can be done to help.\u00a0 Cecilia: Sometimes I ask, which one will get it? But I throw that thought away, because I don\u2019t want to think about that. I pray a lot to God that none of them gets it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see my children with that disease. Lesley Stahl: Each one of you knows, because of your father, that you have a 50/50 chance. So what kind of a weight does that put on you, day in and day out? Julio: I\u2019ve even prayed to God that if there\u2019s one person who has to have the disease, I say to God, \u201cLet it be me.\u201d Sara: I thank God that I\u2019m a nurse and that I would be able to take care of them, but I tell myself, \u201cFirst I had to go through it with my dad, the experience of the disease, and I may have to go through it with one of my siblings, or with several, we don\u2019t know.\u201d Sara told us she would love to have children of her own, but given her risk of developing the disease, she\u2019s decided against it. Sara: So that my children don\u2019t have to go through my same experience. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019ve been working on this 30 years. How do you cope with all this pain? Francisco Lopera: [breaks down] It was not the response we had expected.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: It\u2019s that hard? It\u2019s that hard. But Dr. Lopera knew that even in the midst of all this tragedy, there might just be a glimmer of hope.\u00a0 Because what he had discovered in these families -- hundreds of people destined to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, and easily identifiable with a simple genetic test -- presented a unique scientific opportunity to test whether it\u2019s possible to step in and stop early-onset, and maybe all, Alzheimer\u2019s disease before it starts. That part of the story, when we come back. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.\u00a0 More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s right now, and given the aging baby boomer population, that number is projected to nearly triple by mid-century.\u00a0 Yet unlike many other leading killers, there is no effective treatment. An Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is essentially a prescription for a slow descent into oblivion -- an inexorable loss of the memories, spatial skills, and ability to think that make us who we are. \u00a0 Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patients like the hundreds of family members in Colombia are a tiny fraction of the whole, but to scientists, they could be everything.\u00a0 Because they are offering researchers something they have never had before -- a way to test whether intervening years before people start having symptoms, might halt the disease in its tracks. Answers are still years away, but with more than a thousand Americans developing Alzheimer\u2019s every day, a way to prevent it can not come soon enough. The scene we witnessed in Dr. Pierre Tariot\u2019s exam room at the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute in Phoenix is one that plays out in neurologist\u2019s offices every day. Dr. Tariot: So if I asked you what city we\u2019re in right now, what would you say? Norm: Uh, you know, right, I don\u2019t know at this moment. Norm, age 72, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s -- the typical, late-in-life form so many of us fear. It begins with mild memory and thinking problems and spirals into full-on dementia. Dr. Tariot: Who is that young lady over there? Norm: Betsy. Dr. Tariot: Betsy. And is she a friend? Norm: Yes. Dr. Tariot: How do you know Betsy? Norm: Because I\u2019ve been loving her for a long time. Dr. Tariot: OK. Is she your sister? Norm: A little bit of both. Dr. Tariot: Uh-huh. Is she your wife? Norm: I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I think you\u2019re-- somebody.\u00a0 I wish I was, but\u2026 They\u2019ve been married 51 years. Unlike early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, there\u2019s been no single gene identified that causes this. No way to know who among us is destined to get it. Lesley Stahl: What percentage of all people are going to be get Alzheimer\u2019s? Pierre Tariot: One percent of us 60 or older will have a dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But by the time you hit 85\u2014 Lesley Stahl: What percent? Pierre Tariot: --that-- that percentage is approaching 40ish percent. Norm: That\u2019s a Dogan and these are Gogans. Pierre Tariot: Alzheimer\u2019s disease has been called out by the World Health Organization as the coming pandemic of the West. We have to do something to put it behind us. Claudia to female patient: Can you draw the numbers for a clock? But Dr. Claudia Kawas, a leading Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and clinician at the University of California Irvine, says she\u2019s frustrated that she can\u2019t offer her patients any hope. Claudia Kawas: I have to say I\u2019ve been doing this now for a third of a century. And when I started, I just never would have believed we would still not be closer than we are now to making a real difference. It has been a little disappointing. It hasn\u2019t been for lack of trying. Kawas gave us a quick primer on the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in the brain after autopsy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Claudia Kawas: Every place you see a brown spot, that is a senile amyloid plaque. In contrast, you see these black things that tend to be triangular shape. Those are what we call neurofibrillary tangles. The relationship between plaques and tangles isn\u2019t completely understood, but because it\u2019s been shown that amyloid plaques build up in the brain before tangles -- and years before patients develop symptoms -- pharmaceutical companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars since the early 2000s developing drugs to remove amyloid from the brain, and hundreds of millions more to test those drugs in patients like Norm. Lesley Stahl: Of all the trials that have been done, what percent have succeeded? Pierre Tariot: About one percent. In other words, a resounding failure.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So what does that say, do you think? Claudia Kawas: Well, it says either amyloid is not the right thing to go after. Or it says we need to remove it earlier on in the process before it\u2019s made all the other things cascade after it. You know, if you give a polio vaccine once somebody has polio, you can understand why it doesn\u2019t work. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re saying that maybe those drugs haven\u2019t worked because the person already had Alzheimer\u2019s? Claudia Kawas: Exactly. And maybe if we give \u2018em early enough, it might work. But how can you test drugs on people before they develop the disease, when you don\u2019t know who among us is going to get it?\u00a0 Dr. Tariot and the executive director at the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute, Dr. Eric Reiman, realized there was a place where you could know who was going to get Alzheimer\u2019s --- Antioquia. Ken Kosik: And that\u2019s when my phone began to ring. By then, Ken Kosik had been studying the Colombian extended family for 15 years.\u00a0 Ken Kosik: Received a call from the people at Banner. And they said, you know, \u201cYou have this family. We know when they\u2019re gonna get it. We know who\u2019s gonna get it. Can we start treating before the disease strikes?\u201d Kosik connected Tariot and Teiman with Dr. Lopera, who by that time had identified hundreds of people who carried the gene mutation, guaranteeing they would be struck with Alzheimer\u2019s in the prime of their lives. Reiman and Tariot traveled to Medellin and met with both healthy and sick members of the extended family. Lesley Stahl: Is this particular family, in the world-- extraordinary? Pierre Tariot: There\u2019s nothing else like it. The idea that there\u2019s this concentration within roughly 100 miles of each other is-- just an extraordinary phenomenon. And a perfect scientific laboratory. To lay the groundwork for a large clinical trial, Banner flew a group of extended family members from Medellin to Phoenix for PET scans.\u00a0 One goal: to compare the brains of those with and without the mutation years before any memory loss began, when they were in their 30s.\u00a0 Dr. Reiman showed us the results. Eric Reiman: This is somebody who doesn\u2019t have the gene. They have no plaques in the brain. But in members of the family with the mutation, it was a different story.\u00a0 \u00a0 Eric Reiman: Extensive amyloid deposition in the brain. Lesley Stahl: That\u2019s the red. Eric Reiman: Red is more amyloid. But yellow is also amyloid. This brain had even more. The images showed that amyloid plaques build up in the brain more than a decade before memory loss begins. So if a drug could remove that red and yellow, maybe the disease could be prevented.\u00a0 Banner developed a plan for a multimillion dollar drug trial and convened a meeting with leading scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and representatives of the NIH.\u00a0 Pierre Tariot: The end of the meeting, each scientist was allowed to say one closing thought. And Francisco had the last word. Lesley Stahl: Lopera? Pierre Tariot: And he paused a long time. And you could hear a pin drop in the room. Francisco Lopera: I said to them-- \u201cWe w-- the families are waiting for you.\u201d Lesley Stahl: They\u2019re waiting for you. Pierre Tariot: That\u2019s the point when, you know, the goose bumps came, and we said, \u201cWe really have to make this work. We really do.\u201d And they did.\u00a0 With a commitment of $15 million from NIH, another $15 million from philanthropists, and the rest from drug company Genentech, the trial -- on an immunotherapy drug to remove amyloid plaque -- enrolled its first patient three years ago, and they\u2019ve been enrolling more people ever since. \u00a0 Freddie: They told me about the study and I said yes. I\u2019ll go right away, and anything that you need it, I am here. Freddie and all his siblings signed up.\u00a0 The plan is to enroll a total of 300 members of the extended family who are healthy and have no memory loss yet -- 200 who have the mutation and another 100 who don\u2019t.\u00a0 That way, no one will learn their genetic status just by being accepted into the study. Of the 200 with the mutation, half will get injections of the drug; the other half will be injected with a harmless placebo.\u00a0 The study is double-blind: neither patients nor investigators will know who\u2019s getting what. They have to come in every two weeks, for at least five years -- long enough to see whether the group taking the drug does better than the group taking placebo. Final results aren\u2019t expected until 2021. Lesley Stahl: Is this the first time in all these years of seeing these patients that you can actually offer them hope? Dr. Lopera: Yes, this is the first time. Because in the past we only offer them education-- better quality of life but no hope to have a solution.\u00a0 And now they have hope, a big hope. Lesley Stahl: What would be the best outcome? Pierre Tariot: Nobody who receives the immunotherapy experiences any worsening of their thinking or memory ability. Doesn\u2019t change at all. Doesn\u2019t decline. That would be fabulous. That\u2019s a stretch goal. And that would be just the beginning. Claudia Kawas: If it makes a difference for them, I think there\u2019s a reasonable chance it could make a difference for all the rest of the people who get Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And that of course is the ultimate goal: to help prevent the late in life form of Alzheimer\u2019s that we\u2019re all susceptible to. The hope is that one day every one of us could be screened and when necessary, treated before problems begin. Claudia Kawas: It might be the case that just like when you go to your doctor to get your cholesterol checked in your blood to see if you need drugs to lower your cholesterol, you would go, and get an amyloid PET scan, and-- it would be part of\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Routine. Claudia Kawas: --routine prevention. Lesley Stahl: What if the drug removes the amyloid, and they still get the disease? Claudia Kawas: I think that\u2019ll mean that there are other things we need to be targeting besides amyloid. Lesley Stahl: But will you say that the drug test was successful? Claudia Kawas: Hard as this is to say, yes. I think that we need to know the answer. The answer to whether the field\u2019s focus on amyloid plaque removal for the last 15 years has been a failure.\u00a0 If this test doesn\u2019t work, they will at least know they need to go in a different direction. Lesley Stahl: You know, Victor, all the other drug trials that have gone on for years have all failed. Lesley Stahl: You know that. Victor: But this is going to be the exception. This is the exception. Lesley Stahl: If it does work, this saves this community. Ken Kosik: Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing? Lesley Stahl: That would be amazing. Ken Kosik: To me, I am always impressed that these families that come from such a remote area of the world-- have the potential for informing all of us, globally, about a path forward for conquering Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Paul Kane November 27 at 6:36 PM Follow @pkcapitol President-elect Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud. As his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretary of state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton\u2019s tally of 64\u00a0million votes \u2014 more than 2\u00a0million beyond what he garnered \u2014 by suggesting without evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election. \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\u201d Trump tweeted late Sunday , one of more than 10\u00a0tweets on the recount issue. [ Fact Checker: Donald Trump\u2019s bogus claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton ] But Trump\u2019s embrace of the claim created even more instability around the election results from both ends of the political spectrum, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein leading calls among liberal activists for recounts in key battleground states to make sure voting fraud did not give the election to Trump. The charges and countercharges could present a highly toxic issue for the Justice Department, including Sen. Jeff Sessions \u00ad(R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, whose tenure, if confirmed, comes amid a long-running battle over renewal of the Voting Rights Act. The two parties are already locked in fights over ballot access, with Republicans advocating ID requirements and other limitations that Democrats say are aimed at suppressing the votes of minorities and others more likely to vote Democratic. Trump spent the Thanksgiving weekend out of the public spotlight, holed up inside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and continuing his private deliberations about building the next administration. Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now senior adviser to the transition team, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump and President Obama spoke by phone for about 45\u00a0minutes on Saturday, the latest in a series of conversations the two men have had since the bitter campaign concluded. Conway also led a remarkable rear-guard attack on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a possible secretary of state, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor was disloyal to Trump and should not be considered for the post. The remarks highlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whether Romney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment or instead whether a loyalist such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should get the nod. Rather than referee that dispute, however, Trump\u2019s only public proclamations came over Twitter \u2014 his favorite means of communication \u2014 beginning at 7:19\u00a0a.m. Sunday, when he lambasted the Clinton campaign for agreeing to take part in a recount of votes in Wisconsin spearheaded by Stein. \u201cHillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump then composed five tweets quoting parts of Clinton\u2019s responses at the third presidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator Chris Wallace that he would \u201ckeep you in suspense\u201d rather than outright promise to accept the election results. At the debate, Clinton had called Trump\u2019s answer \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201ca direct threat to our democracy.\u201d On Saturday, Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias said Clinton\u2019s advisers had been monitoring voting patterns in critical states to see whether there were any signs of foul play, particularly in the wake of hacking of emails at the Democratic National Committee and of senior campaign officials earlier this year. Elias wrote that no evidence of wrongdoing had emerged in their preliminary review. But once Stein\u2019s campaign formally started the recount process in Wisconsin, Elias said Clinton\u2019s campaign would join the effort even if her top advisers did not expect the outcome to change in any of the Midwestern states that tipped the electoral college balance to Trump. \u201cWe had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\u201d he said. Clinton\u2019s campaign plans to do the same if Stein, who has raised more than $5\u00a0million to help fund the recounts, follows through on plans to ask for the same process in Michigan and Pennsylvania. The total margin in those three states was 107,000 votes out of nearly 13.8\u00a0million cast, with a combined 46\u00a0electoral votes among them \u2014 enough to give the race to Clinton had she won those three battlegrounds. Clearly irritated by losing the popular vote, Trump suggested that the math to getting to the 270-vote margin in the electoral college made him come up short. \u201cIt would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited,\u201d he tweeted. Meanwhile, the extraordinary feud over his pick for secretary of state hit a fevered pitch when Conway took to three Sunday television shows to attack Romney\u2019s credentials to be the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidants who are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence the \u00adpresident-elect\u2019s decision. Romney\u2019s supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents \u2014 Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trump loyalists \u2014 have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt. Those opposed to Romney have been advocating Trump to reward Giuliani with the secretary of state position, stressing his loyalty vs. Romney\u2019s refusal to publicly say whom he voted for in the presidential race. \u201cI don\u2019t think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position,\u201d Conway said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d suggesting Romney went too far in questioning Trump\u2019s character and intellect during the presidential race. \u201cThere was the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.\u201d The Conway offensive, which began Thursday on Twitter and continued in her three appearances Sunday, led the echo chamber of opposition to the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich said most Trump supporters could not countenance Romney\u2019s selection for any high-profile posting in Trump\u2019s new administration. \u201cI think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority,\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News. Others inside Trump\u2019s orbit, particularly Vice President-elect Mike Pence, are viewed as Romney supporters, believing he has a steady hand that would benefit Trump in the turbulent world of diplomacy, according to people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also has a long-standing relationship with Romney since he served as Republican National Committee chairman during Romney\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid. Infighting over such a prominent position is not unusual. Four years ago, President Obama faced internal division over his choice to succeed Clinton as secretary of state, with one possibility being Susan E. Rice, who had been a longtime Obama confidant. Senate Democrats preferred their colleague, John F. Kerry, and eventually Obama made Rice his national security adviser and gave Kerry the State Department. However, that internal Democratic feud played out in the traditional Washington manner \u2014 behind closed doors and in anonymous background quotes to news outlets. Today\u2019s Republican battle has been carried out in an unusually public fashion that left some old Washington hands stunned and wondering whether this would be the new normal over the next four years. \u201cI have never, ever, seen any aide to a POTUS or PEOTUS publicly try and box the boss in like this. Extraordinary,\u201d David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns, wrote on Twitter, using the acronyms for president and president-elect. Axelrod later questioned whether Conway was assigned the job of trashing Romney, or else it was an \u201cunbelievable breach\u201d for a staffer to do so while Trump was still making his choice.

In the posts, Trump claimed that \"millions\" of people cast illegal votes in this month's presidential election, and claimed that the press was covering the matter unfairly.\u00a0 In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump further contended that if the popular vote determined the presidency, \"It would have been much easier for me to win\" it because he would have altered his campaign to pile up overall vote totals, not Electoral College votes. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 The real estate mogul also tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she told supporters they must accept that \"Donald Trump is going to be our president,\" and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nominee for refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict. There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting or hacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. It's that very lack of evidence that suggests Trump is likely to prevail in recounts. Trump's social media storm came one day after a Hillary for America lawyer said that Clinton would join in a vote-recall effort by Green Party Candidate Jill Stein. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 The attorney, Marc Elias, said Clinton was taking the step \u201cto ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" Stein has already raised at least $5.4 million in her effort to recount votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- states that were the key to Trump's upset victory. She began the process Friday by officially requesting a review in Wisconsin. Stein has argued the recount is intended to test the integrity of the U.S. voting system, amid so-far unfounded speculation that Russia tampered with the process. However, the effort also could undo the 70-plus electoral votes by which Trump beat Clinton. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and, as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost 11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday. Stein received only about 1 percent of the national vote, which has prompted Trump to call her effort a fundraising \u201cscam.\u201d \u201cI would say (Trump) has been incredibly gracious and magnanimous to Secretary Clinton at a time when for whatever reason her folks are saying they will join in a recount,\u201d senior Trump transition team adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cShe congratulated him and conceded to him on election night. \u2026 The idea that we are going to drag this out now where the president-elect has been incredibly magnanimous to the Clintons and to the Obamas is incredible.\u201d Meanwhile, Conway refused to rule out the possibility of further investigating Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state between 2009 and 2013.\u00a0 Conway made clear that Trump said only that he wouldn\u2019t rule out another possible email probe because new evidence could emerge and he wouldn\u2019t want to undercut the authority of federal and congressional investigators. The FBI this summer concluded its one-year investigation into Clinton using the private server by saying she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and that some of the emails included classified information. However, the investigation was effectively closed without criminal charges being recommended to the Justice Department. Trump, in his presidential debates with Clinton, also suggested that if elected he would appoint a special prosecutor for the matter. Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgiving weekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said the president-elect had scheduled a series of meetings Monday with prospective administration hires. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Rishard Matthews The  Bears\u2019 season continued its downward spiral with a 27-21 defeat at the hands of the Tennessee Titans on Sunday at Soldier Field. During their third consecutive defeat that dropped their record to 2-9, the Bears were outplayed on both sides of the ball for much of the game before mounting a fourth-quarter comeback. Marcus Mariota was 15-for-23 for 226 yards and two touchdown passes for the Titans, who improved to 6-6 on the season. On the flipside, Matt Barkley\u2019s first NFL start ended in defeat before a crowd of 48,408 on the lakefront. Playing in place of injured starter Jay Cutler, Barkley was 28-for-53 for 316 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Key drops by Bears receivers didn\u2019t help Barkley\u2019s bid for his first career victory. The Bears took the lead in the game when Barkley found Daniel Brown for a 7-yard score late in the first quarter. But the Titans reeled off 27 consecutive points starting with a Derrick Henry 11-yard run to tie it.Mariota then hit Delanie Walker with a 4-yard TD pass and followed that with a 29-yard scoring strike to a diving Rishard Matthews. Ryan Succop then booted two field goals to extend the Titans\u2019 lead to 27-7. The Bears cut the deficit to 27-14 midway through to the fourth when Barkley connected with Marquess Wilson on an 8-yard TD pass. A Barkley to Deonte Thompson 6-yard TD pass got the Bears to within 27-21 but they couldn\u2019t finish off the comeback. \u2014 Chris Kuc ",

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives at the government palace in Lima, Peru, on Nov. 21, 2016. (Ernesto Arias / European Pressphoto Agency) Jonathan Kaiman and Jessica Meyers Contact Reporter Just months ago, world leaders were fretting over the threat posed by an increasingly assertive China. The country\u2019s\u00a0government oversaw the worst crackdown on dissent in nearly three decades. The Chinese\u00a0built, then militarized, islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea. They tightened controls over the Internet, freezing out foreign firms while allowing their domestic competitors to prosper.\u00a0 Then the United\u00a0States\u00a0elected Donald Trump as president. Now some of those same countries are looking to Beijing to defend international cooperation on matters as diverse as trade and climate change, propelling\u00a0China to new heights on the world stage. And yet China doesn\u2019t sound particularly enthused about its elevation. The Global Times, a Communist Party mouthpiece, this week called it \u201cbeyond imagination to think that China could replace the U.S. to lead the world.\u201d\u00a0 The 21st Century Business Herald, China\u2019s leading business newspaper, referred to the country as \u201ca promoter, a reformer, not a revolutionary.\u201d\u00a0 China \"wants to be a force of stability,\u201d said Min Ye, an associate professor at Boston University\u2019s Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. \u201cBut it\u2019s not into changing the global order. It's a big responsibility \u2026 China still sees itself as a growing power.\u201d \u00a0 Donald Trump comes under unusual pressure to choose his secretary of State Nov. 27, 2016, 7:29 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now: Trump warned supporters will feel betrayed if he picks Mitt... (Matt Pearce) China, whose leaders\u2019 greatest concern is domestic stability, is also battling a slowing economy and rampant income inequality at home. \u201cFactor one is whether China has the capacity to be leader, and factor two is whether China has the willingness to be leader,\u201d said Chen Dingding, professor of international relations at Jinan University in Guangzhou.\u00a0 \u201cIf the U.S. \u2014\u00a0No. 1 power \u2014 not interested in global leadership, why should China be?\u201d \u00a0 The election of a U.S. president who takes an inward and sometimes\u00a0contradictory approach to foreign policy has already handed China major geopolitical wins, analysts say.\u00a0 The president-elect\u2019s vow to block President Obama \u2019s signature trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, has drawn some countries\u00a0closer to\u00a0China\u2019s economic orbit. Malaysia, once a backer of the 12-nation free trade deal, is shifting its focus to a Chinese alternative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Vietnam recently decided not to ratify the U.S.-backed agreement, leaving an opening for China\u2019s pact. Even longtime American ally Australia plans to seek out other\u00a0trade options. Obama saw the TPP \u2014 which excluded China \u2014 as vital to expanding America\u2019s influence in the region. China considered it a blatant attempt to contain its growing economic and political clout. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the pact \u201cleaves a gap,\u201d said Claire Reade, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u00a0\u201cIs China going to walk into that gap to encourage regional and global integration? I think the answer is yes.\u201d President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria.

In a brief, presumably\u00a0final, face-to-face encounter, President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria. The night before, Obama sat with his Chinese... (Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons) The region\u2019s pivot toward China on economic matters\u00a0hurts the\u00a0United States\u2019\u00a0ability to shape developments on the political front.\u00a0The U.S. typically ties its international aid and loans to causes such as gender equality, government transparency and\u00a0human rights\u00a0\u2014 issues on which China\u2019s authoritarian leaders rarely engage. \u00a0 \u201cU.S. hegemony is not great, but it's the best hegemony we've had in a long time,\u201d said David Zweig, a Canadian who researches Sino-American relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. China has reason to defend globalization. Although Beijing has chafed at perceived U.S. incursions, including criticism of its human rights record and U.S. naval operations in the South China Sea, it\u00a0has benefited greatly from closer economic cooperation with the rest of the world.\u00a0The struggling country that entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 has grown\u00a0into the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u00a0 While Trump has been promoting his \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform, China has\u00a0sought to reassure world leaders about its reliability and consistency on international matters. \u201cChina will not shut the door to the outside world but will open it even wider,\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping said Nov. 20 at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.\u00a0 Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin last week dismissed Trump\u2019s assertion that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d invented by China to destroy U.S. competitiveness and pledged to defend a landmark agreement to fight global warming \u201cwhatever the circumstances.\u201d This year, China opened the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Beijing-based rival to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country has also greatly expanded its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, which aims to revive ancient Silk Road trade routes by building roads, ports and other infrastructure across\u00a0Asia, Europe and North Africa.\u00a0 Nations far outside China\u2019s regional\u00a0sphere of influence are paying heed. The election of Donald Trump , who has called global warming a \u201choax\u201d and has threatened to \u201ccancel\u201d U.S.... Negotiators from nearly 200 countries wrapped up two weeks of talks Saturday vowing to press ahead with the fight against climate change \u2014 with or without the help of the next U.S. president. The election of Donald Trump , who has called global warming a \u201choax\u201d and has threatened to \u201ccancel\u201d U.S.... (Alexandra Zavis and Mythili Sampathkumar) In 2012, China struck a deal with 16 Central and Eastern European countries\u00a0to deepen\u00a0economic, tourism and education ties. That framework has encouraged Eastern European countries\u00a0to see China as \u201csort of a savior\u201d\u00a0in difficult economic\u00a0times,\u00a0when there is a need for investment that the West cannot provide, said Anastas Vangeli, a sociologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences. China\u2019s economic rise, combined with the shock of the recent global financial crisis and the wave of populism now sweeping the U.S. and Europe, has\u00a0some\u00a0people in the region\u00a0questioning the virtues of Western-style democracy. \u201cWhen you take a lot of people who don\u2019t know much about China, and you show them snatches of Beijing and Shanghai, they get fascinated with it,\u201d Vangeli said. \u201cOften in their statements, they say things like, \u2018Maybe China got some things right.\u2019\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

    "text": "How Does The Electoral College Work, And Is It Fair? Trump currently has 290 Electoral College votes according to the Associated Press, well more than the 270 he needs to win the presidency. That total is expected to grow when Michigan certifies its vote on Monday. Trump leads in that state by more than 10,000 votes and the state's 16 Electoral College votes would push Trump's total over 300. Trump started tweeting on Sunday amid a push for recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Those states essentially delivered Trump victory in the presidential election, as they had made up the Democrats' so-called \"blue wall\" \u2014 industrial states that secured victories for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Trump's tweets over the weekend have both criticized the calls for recounts in the three key industrial states he won, while simultaneously raising questions about the integrity of the vote nationwide. Trump tweeted another claim without evidence on Sunday evening, regarding voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California \u2014 all states Clinton won. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla responded with a statement: \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\" As the recount proceeds in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton's legal team will participate, citing concerns from supporters over the integrity of the vote, though the campaign says it has not seen any evidence to support those concerns. Jill Stein told NPR that she does not expect the outcome to change. Trump's margins in the states in question measure in the tens of thousands. Recounts have generally only had an impact on the result of an election when the margins are in the range of several hundred. Stein and Clinton's teams cited concerns over the integrity of voting systems, which Trump himself discussed during the campaign. He would often say that the only way he could lose would be if the election was \"stolen\" and Clinton called Trump's remark in a debate that he might not accept the results if he lost \"horrifying.\" Clinton conceded the race to Trump in the early morning hours of Nov. 9 and gave a speech later that day declaring, \"Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" The former Democratic nominee is not pulling back from that position, and her campaign is trying to distinguish between its decision to have legal representatives participate in the Wisconsin recount and actually promoting it, which the campaign says it has not done. \"Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\" Marc Elias, the general counsel for Clinton's campaign, wrote on Saturday . But Elias also said the campaign had received \"hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton.\" No evidence has emerged to support those claims. Wisconsin granted the request for a recount on Friday. It's expected to start at some point this week. It will have to be completed by Dec. 13, in compliance with federal law that requires any recounts to be finished 35 days after the election. In Wisconsin, the request came from Stein and independent candidate Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, and they will have to cover the costs of the recount. Stein has raised more than $6 million in support of these efforts. The deadline to formally request a recount in Pennsylvania, where Trump had his biggest margin of victory of the three states in question, is Monday. Michigan appears to be Trump's closest margin of victory, and the state is set to certify the results at 2 p.m. ET on Monday, and then a request for a recount must be submitted by Wednesday. ",

    "text": "Trump Makes Baseless Claim That 'Millions' Voted Illegally, Costing Him Popular Vote By Katherine Faulders Nov 27, 2016, 10:36 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Lashes Out at Election Recount Efforts of Jill Stein 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump spent his Sunday lashing out against the movement to force general election vote recounts in three states that were critical to his Electoral College victory, but he is now alleging that \"millions of people\" voted illegally, costing him the popular vote. \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump inaccurately claimed in a tweet, alleging -- without any factual basis to make the claim -- that millions of people voted for Hillary Clinton illegally. Clinton currently leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes. In subsequent tweets Trump said \"It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 -- states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" In one tweet, he named Virginia, New Hampshire and California as three states with \"serious voter fraud.\" In none of the tweets did Trump point to any evidence of voter fraud to account for his claim and no other evidence of his assertion has emerged since the election. ABC News reached out for comment to election officials in the three states Trump named, but had not received a response Sunday evening. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla denied Trump's claim about illegal voting in his state, calling them \"unsubstantiated allegations\" in a tweet Sunday night. \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect,\" he tweeted. The Trump transition team had not responded Sunday evening to a request for evidence Trump may be citing in his claims. Kay Stimson, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State, said they \"have no information that can help to explain what sources or information are behind the basis of the tweets\" by Trump. Kellyanne Conway Slams Mitt Romney: He Went 'Out of His Way' to Hurt Trump The Clinton campaign's general counsel Marc Elias tweeted Sunday night that \"We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn't ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud.\" Elias announced Saturday in a post on Medium that the campaign would participate in the recount efforts, but is not seeking to cast any doubt on the Electoral College results, adding they have not found \"any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,\" after looking into the matter. In a tweet-storm Sunday morning, Trump attacked the Green Party-backed efforts to recount the vote in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania this weekend, calling the effort 'sad,' while criticizing the Clinton campaign's participation in the effort. \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\" Trump tweeted. A senior administration official told ABC News Saturday there did not appear to be any malicious activity related to the vote count, and remained confident regarding the overall assessment of the election's integrity. \"The Federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting out electoral process on election day ,\" the official said. \"As we have noted before, we remained confident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out on election day. As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.\" Jill Stein and the Green Party said Friday they raised more than $4 million in three days to support recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three key battleground states where Trump narrowly defeated Clinton. Stein has maintained her activities are in no way intended to benefit Clinton, whom she leveled strong criticisms against during the 2016 election. George Martin, a former co-chair of the Wisconsin Green Party who's involved in Stein's recount effort, said the party has been approached by computer scientists, election lawyers and other experts advocating vote recounts because of what they see as persuasive evidence of tampered election results. So far there has not been any verifiable evidence or proof of tampering or hacking. He said the recounts are not to change the outcome of the results but are rather a check and balance on the process of counting votes.

Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump's consulted the president on his Cuba policy and the two spoke this weekend. \"He's even been talking to President Obama. You know, beyond the sit-down they had 30 hours or so after President-elect Trump won the election, they've been talking regularly on any number of issues. They talked just yesterday,\" she said. The latest conversation went on about 40-45 minutes, she said, though she wouldn't offer details on what was discussed. But the two \"get along nicely,\" Conway added, despite their differences. A Trump transition team official later told NBC News that the president-elect and his predecessor have spoken several times since they met in the Oval Office two weeks ago. \"I can tell you from President-elect Trump's side that he very much enjoys speaking with President Obama, talking about the serious issues that face this country and the world,\" Conway said. \"They get along nicely. They disagree on many things. That's not going to change.\" In response, the White House would only refer to previous comments made by press secretary Josh Earnest noting that the Trump and Obama have talked since the first Oval Office meeting \u2014 and a desire to keep those conversations private. Play Conway: I'm 'Not Campaigning Against' Romney for Secretary of State 1:10 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161128010637if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/818427971969\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> It's one of many shifts in tone and sentiment from Trump following his election victory just weeks ago. Conway also suggested Trump was disinclined to pursue an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use, despite the fact that \"lock her up\" was a rallying cry for his supporters on the campaign trail. \"He said he wouldn't rule it out,\" Conway said on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" referencing Trump's recent sit-down with the New York Times, but \"he said it's not his focus right now.\" During her interview on CNN, Conway also wouldn't rebut reporting from the Washington Post, confirmed by sources to NBC News, that Trump has received only two intelligence briefings since the election and turned down others. Asked outright if he'd turned briefings down, Conway replied: \"I can't discuss that publicly.\" Related: Donald Trump Has Attended Only Two Intelligence Briefings \"What I can tell you is that he is the most engaged individual I've ever met, and brilliant to boot, and he is certainly availing himself of the information that is provided to him from a number of sources, including those intelligence briefings,\" she added. Conway insisted Trump is receiving \"a steady stream of information\" to prepare him to become commander-in-chief, including dozens of meetings he's held with elected officials and business leaders over the past few weeks as he's been interviewing candidates for his cabinet. One particular cabinet slot has taken center stage as a handful of contenders have waged a behind-the-scenes battle for the position. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former UN Ambassador John Bolton, among others, are all reportedly under consideration for secretary of state, but Romney in particular has faced public opposition from Conway and other Trump loyalists who believe his fierce criticism of the president-elect during the campaign disqualifies him. Related: Mitt Romney Lays Out Scathing Critique of Donald Trump Conway has made no secret of her concerns with Romney, tweeting out veiled critiques and going even further in television interviews. Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Conway insisted that \"I'm not campaigning against anyone. I'm just a concerned citizen.\" But she then went on to warn that Romney's consideration for the position has some feeling \"betrayed,\" noting the former Massachusetts governor still hasn't publicly said who he voted for, and aggressively criticized Trump during the presidential campaign. \"People feel betrayed to think that Governor Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump, now our president-elect, would be given the most significant cabinet post of all, Secretary of State,\" she said, adding she's simply reflecting what she's hearing from the \"grassroots.\" In another appearance, however, on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Conway did acknowledge that it wasn't \"wrong to say\" that she has personal concerns with Romney. Conway continued: \"I'm all for party unity, but i'm not sure that we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position.\" Romney infamously called Trump a \"phony, a fraud\" and unfit for the presidency during the GOP primary. But the two met last week and Romney has emerged as a leading contender for the secretary of state position. Alexandra Jaffe ",

The president-elect did not elaborate on his illegal voting claim. Clinton topped Trump by more than 2 million votes in the election, but her support was not distributed in key states. Trump captured more states and claimed victory in the Electoral College. As he has in post-election interviews, Trump said he would have campaigned differently if the popular determined the presidential winner. In a series of two tweets, Trump said \"it\u00a0would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College\" if he had focused on three or four big states rather than the 15-state strategy he employed against Clinton. \"I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" Trump tweeted. Trump's claim\u00a0of illegal voters drew derision. William Kristol , editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, said on Twitter: \"Every time you decide that maybe a Trump Administration could work out ok, you're reminded (as by his tweets today) of one obstacle: Trump.\" In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J.
