    "text": "How Fake News Goes Viral: A Case Study By Sapna Maheshwari Image Images posted on Twitter by a marketer in Austin, Tex., the day after the presidential election. Credit Eric Tucker, a 35-year-old co-founder of a marketing company in Austin, Tex., had just about 40 Twitter followers. But his recent tweet about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations against President-elect Donald J. Trump fueled a nationwide conspiracy theory \u2014 one that Mr. Trump joined in promoting.\u00a0 Mr. Tucker's post was shared at least 16,000 times on Twitter and more than 350,000 times on Facebook. The problem is that Mr. Tucker got it wrong. There were no such buses packed with paid protesters. But that didn't matter. While some fake news is produced purposefully by\u00a0 teenagers in the Balkans \u00a0or\u00a0 entrepreneurs in the United States \u00a0seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. Here, The New York Times deconstructs how Mr. Tucker\u2019s now-deleted declaration on Twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon. It is an example of how, in an ever-connected world where speed often takes precedence over truth, an observation by a private citizen can quickly become a talking point, even as it is being proved false. Nov. 9, shortly after 8 p.m. Eastern Image CreditSnopes Mr. Tucker, who had taken photos of a large group of buses he saw near downtown Austin earlier in the day because he thought it was unusual, saw reports of protests against Mr. Trump in the city and decided the two were connected. He posted three of the images with the declaration: \u201cAnti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin\u201d Mr. Tucker said he had performed a Google search to see if any conferences were being held in the area but did not find anything. (The buses were, in fact, hired by a company called Tableau Software, which was holding a conference that drew more than 13,000 people.) \u201cI did think in the back of my mind there could be other explanations, but it just didn\u2019t seem plausible,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he had posted as a \u201cprivate citizen who had a tiny Twitter following.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m also a very busy businessman and I don\u2019t have time to fact-check everything that I put out there, especially when I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going out there for wide consumption.\u201d Nov. 10, 12:49 a.m. Eastern Image Credit Several hours later, the first important step occurred. Mr. Tucker\u2019s tweet was posted to the main Reddit community for Mr. Trump under the heading: \u201cBREAKING: They found the buses! Dozens lined up just blocks away from the Austin protests.\u201d It quickly generated more than 300 comments, some of which blamed the protests on George Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist, who is a frequent target of the group. Nov. 10, around 9 a.m. Eastern The next morning, the frenzy began. A user on Free Republic, a conservative discussion forum, linked to the Reddit thread about Mr. Tucker\u2019s post, increasing the attention and spreading it further into the online world. Later, Facebook pages like Robertson Family Values, which is named for but not affiliated with the stars of \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d and Donald Trump Commander in Chief 2020, linked to the Free Republic discussion. Those posts were shared more than 5,000 times each, and more than 300,000 Facebook users have linked to the Free Republic thread. Image Credit Nov. 10, late morning through the afternoon Sean Hughes, the director of corporate affairs for the bus company Coach USA North America, said he learned about the rumor involving its vehicles after receiving a couple of curious emails and hearing from a friend in New Jersey who had seen the claim on Facebook and wanted to know if it was true. A reporter at the Fox television station in Austin contacted Mr. Hughes later that day, and he responded with a statement noting that \u201cat no point were Coach USA buses involved in the Austin protests.\u201d But that did little to stem the online furor. \u201cThat reporter said, \u2018You\u2019re probably going to get a lot more phone calls because it\u2019s all over the place,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hughes said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019re the second journalist to actually call me to see what was going on, no bloggers or anything, and we\u2019re easily accessible on our website,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. He added, \u201cI just kind of wish people looked into facts before they go ahead and do something like that, because it could be easily debunked based on a quick phone call or two, or a couple emails.\u201d During this time, Mr. Tucker was replying to queries on Twitter about whether he had proof to support his claim. He confirmed in a post that he \u201cdid not see loading or unloading\u201d but that the buses were \u201cquite near protests at right timing.\u201d That admitted lack of evidence, however, had little effect. By about noon, Mr. Tucker\u2019s initial post had been retweeted and liked more than 5,000 times. There was more to come. @stevendenoon I did not see loading or unloading. There were even more busses than in pics. Quite near protests at right timing. ",

Obama urged his fellow Democrats to try to work with Trump's team if what it's doing is good for the country. But he cautioned that if the Trump administration begins to attack American values, he might be compelled to speak up, and so would the Democratic Party. \"As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes,\" he said.

Obama said he was \"very clear about the strong differences we had on policy.\" \"The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us,\" he said.

    "text": "Bears offense lacks talent on the field \u2014 and on the sideline Photos from the Bears-Giants game at MetLife Stadium on Nov. 20, 2016. Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog The Bears weren\u2019t expected to beat the Giants at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, except according to the insane. The Giants came in with four straight wins. They\u2019ve proven to be a contender for the NFC East title and the postseason. The Bears came in with four losses in their last five games. They\u2019ve proven to be a contender for the first overall draft choice. What\u2019s more, the Bears were going to play without Alshon Jeffery because of the wide receiver\u2019s stupidity when it came to taking supplements. That left John Fox \u2019s team searching for players who could make something happen. Fox\u2019s offense, the one he said was still here no matter that Adam Gase went to Miami, needed playmakers. Or perhaps Fox\u2019s offense needed a playcaller to find the playmakers if they existed in more than someone\u2019s fantasy or bad coaching. The Bears fell to 2-8 after losing 22-16 to the New York Giants. A late interception by Jay Cutler in the fourth quarter iced the game for the Giants. Leonard Floyd, the Bears' first-round draft pick from Georgia, was removed from the field on a stretcher with 5:53 to go in the game. The entire... (Chicago Tribune staff) As that search for playmakers occurred, and as that search continues to occur this season, let\u2019s remember that Fox wanted productive tight end Martellus Bennett traded because Fox apparently doesn\u2019t like or can\u2019t coach players with personalities, maybe both. Whatever the case, the point is that Fox has a pattern of neutering the Bears offense of talent, a self-inflicted wound that can\u2019t be dismissed because of injuries. In fact, because of injuries, Fox\u2019s stubbornness and inflexibity that have led to a pathetic record becomes more acute. It certainly became more acute still when injury-prone tight end Zach Miller limped off the field before halftime with a foot problem that prevented him from finishing the game, costing Jay Cutler his most productive target in the first half. That\u2019s highlighted just one of the many holes the Bears created for themselves in offensive talent and depth. Somebody wanted guard-center Matt Slauson cut from an offensive line that Slauson proved he could lead. Maybe it wasn\u2019t Fox, but he certainly could\u2019ve stopped that decision because he seems to be making more than his share of personnel decisions on offense, and finding some reason for his continuing to do that is painful and difficult. If you want to argue that Brandon Marshall had to go because the franchise bosses said so, then fine. Explain why Jeffery isn\u2019t a No. 1 receiver when everybody\u2019s double-teaming him. Bears right guard Kyle Long will require two surgeries before he gets back into football action. Long will undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his right ankle suffered last Sunday in the loss at Tampa. The surgery isn\u2019t considered serious and it will be done before Long has surgery to... Bears right guard Kyle Long will require two surgeries before he gets back into football action. Long will undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his right ankle suffered last Sunday in the loss at Tampa. The surgery isn\u2019t considered serious and it will be done before Long has surgery to... (Brad Biggs) If you want to argue that Matt Forte could leave because the running backs by committee could cover it, then fine. Explain why none of them can catch the ball out of the backfield as well as Forte. Or at all. A couple painful examples were Jordan Howard \u2019s consecutive drops in the flat in the fourth quarter. Howard dropped passes all over the place. For all his talents as a runner, be has been exposed as a lousy pass catcher. But before that, bad coaching hurt an offense that needs every bit of smarts it can find. The Bears defense had just forced the Giants to punt, so the offense took over with 12:49 to go and trailing by just six points. A TD and an extra point would\u2019ve given the Bears the lead, if not the win. More than 12 minutes remained. That\u2019s plenty of time. That\u2019s certainly plenty of time to concentrate on running the ball to make it easier on the offensive line that was finding different bodies in different positions. But interim offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains, who must have a bonus clause for abandoning the run at the worst time, called a pass play that the Giants turned into a sack in the shadow of the Bears goal posts. So there you go: A head coach neutering the offense of talent, which neuters the roster\u2019s depth, compounded by an offensive coordinator who doesn\u2019t seem to know what kind of roster and game he has in front of him. You can argue that it was close down to the end. That would only make a sucker believe the Bears have something going on offense. They don\u2019t. And they might never if Fox continues to make offensive roster decisions. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s White House transition effort is starting to look like a 2016 GOP presidential primary reunion, with former rival Rick Perry scheduled for talks Monday as part of an apparent effort to mend fences and build party unity ahead of Inauguration Day. On Sunday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a primary rival-turned Trump backer, was part of a parade of officials who visited the president-elect, who moved his transition team's headquarters for the weekend from Manhattan to Trump\u2019s private golf club in Bedminster, N.J. The most high-profile visit this weekend was the arrival Saturday of former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who during the 2016 campaign called Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and publically backed several of the other 16 major candidates whom Trump vanquished in the primary. Trump, a first-time candidate, in turn called Romney a \u201cchoke artist\u201d for his failed 2012 White House bid against President Obama. Both men suggested their roughly 90-minute meeting went well. But it remains unlcear whether apologies were exchanged or if Romney is interested in the secretary of state post. \u201cThey did have some private time together, and you can ask either one of them what they talked about,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d However, Pence did confirm the widely-held assumption that Romney is indeed being considered to run the State Department, as Trump attempts to fill dozens of Cabinet-level posts and other high-level jobs. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 He also said that Trump \"wants to focus out of the gate\" on repealing \"ObamaCare\" -- a plan that new Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York acquaintance of Trump\u2019s, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he\u2019ll strongly oppose. Other contenders for secretary of state are said to be former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who met with Trump on Thursday. Trump on Saturday also met with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, a possible candidate for defense secretary. He later said on Twitter that Mattis was \u201cvery impressive\u201d and called him a \u201ctrue General's General!\" Also Sunday, Trump met with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, a possible secretary of commerce; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is also purportedly in the running for secretary of state; and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach served as an adviser to the Trump campaign on immigration issues and has a background in designing laws cracking down people who are here illegally. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a finalist in the hard-fought GOP primary, last week visited Trump at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. \u201cI think we had a very good and productive conversation about how we can work together to really deliver on the promises made to people,\u201d Cruz said afterward on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d On Friday, Trump picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism.

The night before, Obama sat with his Chinese counterpart to note important cooperation on climate change and regional security issues, particularly with regard to North Korea, before President Xi Jinping warned that relations with the U.S. were at a \u201chinge moment.\u201d Left unsaid in the diplomatic readouts by American officials\u00a0 was the specter of President-elect Donald Trump and the likelihood that he would take a far different approach in managing the most complex U.S. relationships abroad. Under different electoral circumstances, Obama\u2019s trip this week \u2014 his last, scheduled presidential tour overseas \u2014\u00a0could have been something of a valedictory march: a sweeping speech on democracy in its birthplace, Greece; a final fond farewell and early endorsement in Berlin for his most important partner, German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; and an economic summit in Peru of Asian and Pacific leaders. White House officials had even envisioned a chance of\u00a0putting a bow on Obama\u2019s strategy of reorienting U.S. attention to\u00a0Asia by persuading\u00a0a lame-duck session of Congress to consider\u00a0the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal. Trump\u2019s election put an end to all that. Instead, Obama was warning about the threats to democracy in an era of \u201cactive disinformation\u201d that left the public struggling to separate fact from fiction. He and Merkel sternly lectured Trump from a distance\u00a0about the obligations of leadership and the need\u00a0to abide by international norms of behavior. When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jagged exclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats . Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewer House seats and perhaps a dozen fewer governors than in 2009, during President Obama \u2019s first... When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jagged exclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats . Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewer House seats and perhaps a dozen fewer governors than in 2009, during President Obama \u2019s first... (Mark Z. Barabak) In a Sunday night news conference before leaving Peru, Obama said he thinks \u2014 though he can't guarantee \u2014 that Trump may govern more moderately than the way he campaigned. \u201cI can't be sure of anything,\u201d Obama said of Trump\u2019s approach. But the presidency, he said, \u201chas a way of shaping your thinking and in some cases modifying your thinking because you recognize the solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility America has as the most powerful country in the world.\u201d Obama had\u00a0thought he would be handing off leadership of the Western powers\u00a0to Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of State who ran a campaign largely on a platform of continuing Obama\u2019s policies. Instead he appeared ready to pass that mantle\u00a0off to another leader, Merkel, who now plans to seek a fourth term as chancellor. \u201cI do believe that Chancellor Merkel and Germany are a linchpin in protecting the basic tenets of a liberal, market-based democratic order that has created unprecedented prosperity and security for Europe, but also for the world,\u201d Obama said in a joint interview with German television and print reporters.\u00a0 In his news conference, however, he cautioned against any U.S. withdrawal from leadership of global institutions, warning that for all the world\u2019s problems, the globe is\u00a0far safer, more secure and prosperous than it was when the current international system was put into place. \u201cThe United\u00a0States really is an indispensable nation in our world order,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore that\u00a0order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of 30 years,\u201d he noted. \u201cIn the second one, 60 million people were killed,\u201d he added, \u201centire continents in rubble.\u201d In Asia, \u201cyou routinely saw famines of millions of people,\u201d he said. America can\u2019t carry the sole burden of sustaining the modern global system, but other countries can\u2019t replace U.S. leadership. If the U.S. shuns the role of heading the global order,\u00a0\u201cthen it collapses \u2026 there\u2019s nobody to fill the void,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a burden we should carry proudly,\u201d Obama added, \u201can extraordinary privilege.\" As he concluded his trip, Obama also made it clear that he plans to govern through\u00a0to the final day of his term, without regard for what Trump may have in the works. In his brief\u00a0conversation with Putin, for example, he said he held fast to his position that Russia should respect the sovereignty of Ukraine and work for a peaceful resolution in Syria. He also made it clear that his administration will move ahead with new environmental rules, even though Trump and the Republicans may not like them. The\u00a0proposals are well-considered rules that have been under scrutiny and public discussion for a long time, he said, and they shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. \u201cI feel strongly these are the right things to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to do them.\u201d Still, though, a postelection funk continued among the White House staff, defying Obama\u2019s best efforts to shake them out of it\u00a0 and his\u00a0frequent pleas to just about everyone to give the new president-elect time to prove skeptics wrong. Those traveling with the president could not help but monitor the president-elect\u2019s appointments to key positions.\u00a0Many of Obama\u2019s aides considered the choices curious, in some cases troubling and in almost all cases a signal of\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0intention for a clean break with the policies of the last eight years. They also digested the feedback of foreign leaders who had manage to speak with Trump directly after the election, hopeful to put concerns to ease but not always finding reason to. Obama spent his two terms\u00a0working to strengthen global institutions, both out of his conviction that collective action is the best way to achieve success, but also to reduce the burden on the United States to singularly solve the world\u2019s problems. The president now has little choice but to put his faith in those institutions to bring along, or ultimately stand up to, a successor who appears to have very a different vision for U.S. leadership in the world. The task before Obama over the last few days \u2014 to try to explain how his successor might act \u2014 seemed nearly impossible, given the\u00a0adversarial history between the two men and the uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s contradictory\u00a0pronouncements on foreign policy throughout the campaign. Based on a single face-to-face meeting in the Oval Office days after the election, Obama felt assured enough to make one commitment to the international community: that Trump understood and would remain committed to the NATO alliance. When it comes to the more thorny issues of confronting Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria and keeping up the campaign against Islamic State, Obama locked arms with key partners to send a different message to Trump: color within the lines. \u201cWhat I can guarantee is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues,\u201d Obama said Sunday\u00a0night. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way this office works.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

So should the NFL even consider the city for future expansion? USA TODAY Sports In this Oct. 2, 2005, file photo, Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, Mexico is shown prior to the start of a regular season NFL game between the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers. Eleven years after the network telecast an NFL game from Mexico City, it will do so again when the Raiders \"host\" the Texans on Monday night. (Photo: MARCO UGARTE, AP) MEXICO CITY \u2013 As the National Football League seeks to further broaden its international reach with Monday\u2019s\u00a0clash between the Oakland Raiders and Houston Texans, the match-up is already guaranteed to be the high point of the season in one regard. Azteca Stadium sits at 7,280 feet above sea level, higher than\u00a0Denver\u2019s Sports Authority Field at Mile High, which is by far the NFL\u2019s most-elevated venue at 5,280 feet. The height, plus the atmospheric conditions of Mexico\u2019s capital, could cause significant issues for the players. \u201cAzteca Stadium is the worst place to ever play a sporting event,\u201d former United States national team soccer star Eric Wynalda told USA TODAY Sports. Dallas Cowboys aren't just America's Team. They're Mexico's, too \u201cYou can\u2019t breathe. The pollution is so bad that if you don\u2019t have some form of rain that\u2019s brought all that down you are going to be sucking wind. \u201cThey (will) break a record for how many oxygen masks they have on the sidelines. The combination of being that high up with pollution is just devastating to the body.\u201d The U.S. soccer teams \u00a0Wynalda played on are among many sporting visitors to the venue that have struggled desperately. The altitude of Mexico City, added to the smog that accumulates in the bowl-like natural topography that surrounds it, gives home teams a huge advantage. Both the Raiders and Texans are in the same position of unfamiliarity, \u00a0each being coy on the measures they are using\u00a0to combat the elements. Local sports medicine and respiration doctor Jorge Avendano Reyes warned that the players are in for a rough ride. \u201cThere can be headaches, dizziness, sensation of fatigue, accelerated heartbeat, hyperventilation,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cWe can also have respiratory symptoms, when we are exposed often to the pollution. Raiders' Marquette King punts, dances, has fun \u201cThe amount of oxygen that reaches the cells decreases, leading to the faster heartbeat and cardiac activity. The body tries to ventilate more quickly.\u201d The Azteca is an iconic venue in Mexico, \u00a0the only stadium to have hosted two soccer World Cup finals. Teams familiar with the surroundings\u00a0claim that the complaints of visitors are nothing but sour grapes. Yet science suggests otherwise. Reyes said bigger players such as linemen would find things more testing than leaner athletes, while adding that typical oxygen masks may do little to help aid respiration. \u201cWe\u2019re on an equal playing field,\u201d Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown said. \u201cNo one\u2019s more used to the altitude than the other team, so we\u2019re all going out there with the same struggle, if there will be a struggle.\u201d Some players believe the slower pace of American football, rather than the constant movement of soccer, may help lessen the effects. Wynalda disagrees. \u201cYou don\u2019t really feel it until you stop and when your heart starts to beat and tries to slow down,\u201d Wynalda said. \u201cYou just have these moments where you click out. You almost feel like you are going to pass out. The players stop for a second, you try to catch your breath, and then it is almost like you\u2019ve just had a very long blink, and something bad happens. \u201cFor American football I really am curious to see how these guys handle it. It is going to have a massive effect on their body. These are some big bodies out there, 300 pounds\u00a0people who are trying to get oxygen into their muscles and to their brains. I think you will see a lot of delay of game penalties.\u201d Conventional wisdom suggests that teams should either come in two weeks early to allow the body to adapt to the conditions \u2013 or very late to reduce the amount of time for the elements to make an impact. Given that the former option was impossible, both teams were due to arrive on Sunday. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 20, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump is greeted at the front steps of Lamington Presbyterian Church in Bedminster, N.J. Mike Segar/Reuters By Sari Horwitz November 20 at 7:28 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Job seekers, advisers and would-be allies paraded through Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., over the weekend as President-elect Donald Trump worked on filling his Cabinet. By Sunday, Marine Gen. James Mattis had emerged as a leading contender for secretary of defense. Members of the Trump team took to the Sunday talk shows. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who heads Trump\u2019s transition, and the incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks so far and elaborated on Trump\u2019s more controversial campaign promises, including the reinstatement of waterboarding and a ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump, who met Saturday with Mattis, called him \u201cthe real deal\u201d and a \u201cbrilliant, wonderful man.\u201d In a tweet early Sunday morning, Trump said \u201cGeneral James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General\u2019s General!\u201d A person familiar with transition discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that no decision has been reached about whether Mattis will join the Trump administration. Now a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, Mattis has publicly criticized Obama\u2019s defense and national security policies. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, whom Trump met with on Saturday for more than an hour, is under \u201cactive and serious consideration\u201d to serve as secretary of state, Pence said. \u201cI know the president-elect was very grateful that Governor Mitt Romney came here to New Jersey yesterday,\u201d Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe spent the better part of an hour together with him. And then I know that the two of them actually had some private time together. I would tell you that it was not only a cordial meeting but also it was a very substantive meeting.\u201d It is still an open question whether Romney, once a fierce critic of the president-elect, would be willing to serve in a Trump administration. After Trump and Pence attended services at nearby Lamington Presbyterian Church in Bedminster, they began back-to-back meetings with a dozen people, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been ousted as chairman of Trump\u2019s transition team; former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said \u201cthere definitely is a possibility\u201d that more Cabinet announcements could be made Monday. In his interview on CBS, Pence did not rule out the possibility that Trump could reinstate waterboarding as an interrogation technique against accused terrorists during his administration, a practice that Congress made illegal after its use during the George W. Bush administration. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), speaking Saturday at the Halifax International Security Forum, insisted that any attempt to bring back waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would be quickly challenged in court. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe will not torture. My God, what does it say about America if we\u2019re going to inflict torture on people?\u201d Pence said he has \u201cgreat respect for Senator McCain\u201d but added that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a president again who will never say what we\u2019ll never do.\u201d \u201cWhat I can tell you is that going forward, as he outlined in that famous speech in Ohio, is that a President Donald Trump is going to focus on confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism as a threat to this country,\u201d Pence said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff Reince Priebus on Nov. 20 defended Trump\u2019s picks for his incoming administration. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) In December, as a candidate, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country. Asked about the idea of such a ban, Priebus, who appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, said \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule out anything, but we\u2019re not going to have a registry based on a religion.\u201d Priebus was asked on another Sunday television show about a tweet in February by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom Trump has chosen as his national security adviser. Flynn tweeted \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL.\u201d \u201cIs that the official policy of the Trump administration, that fear of Muslims is rational?\u201d asked Jake Tapper, host of the CNN show. \u201cWell, of course not,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cLook, I think, in some cases, there are radical members of that religion that need to be dealt with, but certainly we make it clear that that\u2019s not a blanket statement for everyone. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to lead.\u201d Priebus also vowed that Trump\u2019s White House counsel will ensure that Trump avoids all conflicts of interest with his business ventures during his administration. Last week, Trump held a meeting at Trump Tower with three business partners building a Trump property south of Mumbai. His daughter Ivanka Trump, a vice president at the Trump Organization and one of the family members who will be in charge of Donald Trump\u2019s businesses after he takes office, attended his meeting last week with the Japanese prime minister. Tapper cited those examples and asked Priebus, \u201cAs White House chief of staff, you\u2019re supposed to look out for any political or ethical minefields. Is it seriously the position of the Trump transition team that this is not a huge cauldron of potential conflicts of interest?\u201d \u201cObviously we will comply with all those laws and we will have our White House counsel review all of these things,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWe will have every \u2018i\u2019 dotted and every \u2018t\u2019 crossed, and I can assure the American people that there wouldn\u2019t be any wrongdoing or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making.\u201d [ Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fan ] Priebus also defended Trump\u2019 s choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general . Several minority and civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, have spoken out against the selection week, sharply criticizing Sessions and referring to accusations of racism that kept him from a federal judgeship in 1986. \u201cIt is outrageous and outright dangerous to have one of the most racist politicians in Congress, who has made it his life\u2019s mission to hurt Latinos, immigrants and African Americans, as the head of the Department of Justice,\u201d said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, a group dedicated to increasing the number of Hispanics in office. Sessions has denied that he is racist or insensitive to minorities. Priebus called such criticism \u201cvery political, very unfair\u201d during an interview with Martha Raddatz on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Priebus said that Sessions should not be judged on accusations of statements he made decades ago and called Sessions an \u201cunbelievably honest and dignified man who started his career working against George Wallace.\u201d In 1966, Sessions campaigned against Lurleen Wallace, who was running for governor to keep in place the policies of her husband, then-Gov. George Wallace, a staunch proponent of segregation. But Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming minority leader, said that Sessions \u201cis going to need a very thorough vetting.\u201d \u201cMany of those statements, they\u2019re old but they\u2019re still troubling,\u201d Schumer said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cAnd the idea that Jeff Sessions, just because he\u2019s a senator he should get through without a series of very tough questions \u2014 particularly given those early things \u2014 no way.\u201d The consideration of Mattis, who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East from 2010 to 2013, could be seen as a rebuke to President Obama. Mattis was said to have consistently pushed the military to punish Iran and its allies, including calling for more covert actions to capture and kill Iranian operatives and interdictions of Iranian warships. Former defense officials said Mattis\u2019s views on Iran caused him to fall out of favor with the Obama administration , which was negotiating the Iranian nuclear deal at the time. Mattis, who also clashed with the administration over its response to the Arab Spring and over how many troops to keep in Iraq, was forced to retire earlier than expected to clear room for his replacement at U.S. Central Command. In another development, the New York Post reported that future first lady Melania Trump and the couple\u2019s 10-year-old son, Barron, will stay in New York and not move to the White House after Donald Trump is inaugurated in January so that Barron can continue to go to his school on the Upper West Side. When Trump was asked by reporters Sunday afternoon about the story and whether Melania and Barron would join him in the White House, he said, \u201cVery soon. After he\u2019s finished with school.\u201d His spokesman, Miller, said, \u201cNo formal statement has been released yet with regard to the family and their transition plans to Washington. But the one thing I will say is that there\u2019s obviously a sensitivity to pulling their 10-year-old out of school in the middle of the school year.\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Amy B Wang, Kristine Guerra, Greg Jaffe and Missy Ryan contributed to this report.

    "text": "Dan Sipple/Ikon Images/Getty Images Dan Sipple/Ikon Images/Getty Images Rachael Garrity posted a farewell message on Facebook. She told her \"friends\" \u2014 that's how she puts it in an email to NPR, in quotes \u2014 that she would delete her account. An email from her son followed: Are you OK? \"I am finding Facebook to have a negative impact on my continuing to keep a positive feeling regarding some of the people I have known longest and cherish most,\" writes Garrity, who has worked in not-for-profit marketing and publishing since the 1970s. I unfriended nearly everyone. ... I am building my own wall now. Susan Brubaker Knapp Garrity was one of more than 150 people who have shared their stories with NPR, recapping how they are recalibrating their attitude toward social media after this year's election. Donald Trump's surprise victory ended an emotional roller-coaster of a presidential race, which has left Facebook, Google and Twitter scrambling to rein in a proliferation of fake news and harassing behavior . \"What was really shocking to me was how many people who I consider to be smart were sharing things that were not so smart, definitely obviously fake but matched whatever viewpoint that they pushed or agreed with,\" says Michael Lowder. He's Garrity's grandson \u2014 and he shared her story with NPR because, true to her word, she has quit Facebook, where NPR posted the call-out . Article continues after sponsorship From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg As for himself, Lowder has no plans to abandon social media \u2014 and a few people wrote in to say they are actually doubling down, regretting not speaking out more before the election, or feeling freed to speak their minds now that Trump is president-elect, or finding support in like-minded communities. But the vast majority of emails \u2014 some of them nearing 1,000 words in length \u2014 read like testimonials to a therapist: I'm having a hard time focusing. I have questioned my friendships. I can't stop scrolling. I'm exhausted. One email to NPR ended with: \"It was good to get that off my chest.\" People are turning off TVs (one even canceled her cable \u2014 mass media are not off the hook, either), deleting social apps from their phones, rationing time spent on Facebook and Twitter, and shrinking their digital friend lists. Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating, drawn-out illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma. Emily Prymula, Wadsworth, Ill. Facebook is a source of news for a majority of American adults , but in the vitriol and propaganda of the 2016 election, its proverbial public square for many users has devolved into a never-ending Thanksgiving-dinner debate \u2014 or an omnipresent Speakers' Corner . As Lowder says his father put it, opining on social media is the equivalent of shouting off a soapbox in the street: a declaration, rather than discussion. This view, of course, cuts against the way Facebook views itself. \"Friends and family come first\" was said to be its guiding value in a shakeup of the News Feed algorithm revealed in June . Susan Brubaker Knapp writes: \"The day after the election, the hate and darkness got to be too much. I unfriended nearly everyone. Now I have three friends: my husband and children. ... I do hold (Facebook) responsible for helping to spread disinformation that contributed to both the election results and the level of vitriol and hate in this country. I am building my own wall now.\" A similar sentiment from Todd Neigum: \"(The election) simply turned me off of Facebook. I started by unfollowing people I've known for 40 years. Neighbors, friends, family doesn't mean I have to wade through untold numbers of gloating, trashtalking, flamethrowing posts.\" Much of the consternation does come from the supporters of Hillary Clinton, who find themselves inundated and overwhelmed by news about a candidate they oppose. But then there are people like Tin Samuel, a tech consultant from Kansas City, Mo., who did vote for Trump. Zuckerberg Denies Fake News On Facebook Had Impact On The Election Back in 2015, Samuel set up a second profile, splitting his closest connections from more professional ones, theoretically carving out a space to comfortably express his opinion. It hasn't worked out that way, he writes, as people who disagree with him \"lob insults\" and he has found he's censoring himself on both profiles: \"It's not just strangers that are engaging in this kind of behavior. It's people I've known for 20 years. ... It's one thing when you're insulted by a stranger on an NPR or CNN newsfeed. It's quite another when you're being threatened by someone who knows where you live. ... \"For the rest of the year at least, I'm going to stop talking about politics altogether online, and focus on the topics and things that I find more interesting. Technology, silly cat memes, Brazilian dance music, and food videos. You know, all that stuff the internet was always supposed to be about to begin with.\" And actually, a few people have reported creating a dual presence on the platform, turning to a new profile void of political pages and opinionated friends or family. Writes health care worker Jackie Prack from Greenville, S.C.: \"The election was the last straw for me. In the days after, all I saw was hate. From both sides. ... I decided that day to get rid of my original Facebook and create my 'new' Facebook ... full of running, bikes, breweries, cat videos, satire, art, music, hiking, food, and good people. ... If the world is falling apart, my head is solidly in the sand right now ... and it's nice down here.\" Rationing of social media time has been a common response, too. Clicking on Facebook in the morning is like blunt trauma to the brain https://t.co/Q5hzgum1jx \u2014 Rani Molla (@ranimolla) November 18, 2016 Greg Jeffers, a teacher from Rowlett, Texas, describes himself as a \"deeply religious\" person and a social conservative \u2014 he voted for Evan McMullin , a former CIA officer who is a Mormon. Jeffers says before the election, he obsessively shared \"every article I was reading on Facebook\" and getting into arguments with friends and friends of friends, who as conservatives supported Trump. Unlike many users struggling to burst or embrace ideological bubbles formed on Facebook, Jeffers faced a different challenge: \"Since (Trump) won, I realized I would have at least four more years of being ideologically separated from my tribe. I also realized that I had become a meaner, more cynical person. ... \"I decided not to totally delete Facebook. It really is a good way to stay in touch with people. But, I did decide to have my wife change my password. And I decided that I would allow myself an hour a week (30 minutes on Saturday and 30 minutes on Tuesday or Wednesday) to peruse Facebook and stay caught up.\" Jeffers writes that he's thinking of shifting his time from Facebook arguments to something practical, spending time with his wife and daughters, his students, his church family. \"Maybe I can, through my church, teach ESL to refugees,\" he writes. Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016? And then there's Emily Prymula from Wadsworth, Ill., who says, in her rebound from social media overdose, she began researching how to run for local elected office: \"I can't make a difference or change someone's opinion through a Facebook discussion, but I can do so through being present in my community.\" She describes herself as an independent, which she says turned her news feed into an \"ideological battleground\": \"Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating, drawn-out illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma, trying to convince one another that their preferred course of treatment had less severe side effects and a better long-term outcome for the patient. ... I turned off my notifications, and vowed to only post positive news about my life for my family and friends.\" Monica Eskin makes an interesting observation: \"There is a reason that voting is anonymous: so it doesn't destroy your ability to live with your neighbors. As their neighbor I know less about them than I do as their (Facebook) friend, and maybe that's the way it is supposed to be with your neighbors and coworkers, etc.\" But of course, many emails make the counter-point: \"Let's be honest, most political conversation happens on social media these days ... for better or for worse,\" writes Carmen Jenkins, who describes herself as a moderate, pro-life, anti-Trump Republican. \"If I want to have a voice in this conversation, I better engage,\" she says. \"I better engage in a way that promotes dialogue rather than shutting it down with judgments and generalizations.\" How effective Jenkins and others like her will be just might determine how social media shapes up (is it too soon to say this?) for the next election.

    "text": "James Mattis Has Emerged as a Favored Contender for Defense Secretary By Martha Raddatz Nov 20, 2016, 3:57 PM ET 0 Shares Star Mike Segar/Reuters President-elect Donald Trump (L) and Vice President-elect Mike Pence (R) greet retired Marine General James Mattis for a meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Nov. 19, 2016. 0 Shares Email Retired Marine Corps Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, has emerged as a favored contender for nomination as secretary of defense in the Trump administration, ABC News has learned, winning strong public praise from the president-elect and an endorsement from retired Gen. Jack Keane. Keane, who met with Trump earlier this week at Trump Tower, told ABC News that he was offered the job as secretary of defense but withdrew his name from consideration because of other commitments and personal reasons. (He lost his wife earlier this year). Trump transition officials would not confirm whether an offer was made but indicated the president-elect had been very interested in Keane, even as he expressed reluctance to accept a cabinet appointment. Keane told ABC that at the meeting last week he recommended Mattis and retired Gen. David Petraeus to the president-elect as candidates for the defense secretary job. Trump met with Mattis on Saturday at Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, after which Trump said the retired general, who formerly headed the U.S. Central Command, was \"the real deal.\" Today, Trump tweeted that Mattis \"is being considered for secretary of defense.\" General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Federal law requires that defense secretary appointees are at least seven years removed from active duty, so an appointment of Mattis would require a waiver from Congress, if he were nominated and confirmed. Such an action is not without precedent. Gen. George C. Marshall, who served as Army chief of staff and as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during World War II , needed a waiver to serve as secretary of defense under President Harry Truman . He is believed to be the last defense secretary who needed a waiver. 0 Shares ",

So are many of his countrymen, who feel that their Western allies care more about their own interests than Turkey\u2019s. Most of the tension and anti-Americanism can be traced back to the night of July 15th here in the heart of Istanbul. Factions of the Turkish military shut down the Bosporus Bridge that connects Europe and Asia and launched a coup to overthrow the elected government. It wasn\u2019t long after that F-16s commandeered by a rogue faction of the Air Force streaked fast and low across the skies of Istanbul and Ankara\u2026sonic booms shattered windows. The plotters used tanks and troops, to seize strategic buildings and military bases, and shut down Istanbul\u2019s main airport. And in something never seen before in the capital of NATO country, the parliament in Ankara was bombed, and helicopter gunships strafed the presidential palace. Soldiers stormed television stations and announced that Turkey was under martial law. President Erdo\u011fan, was on vacation with his family when he learned a coup was underway. He wanted to address the country, but had no access to the media. So he used the FaceTime app on a borrowed phone to call into a Turkish television station. He pleaded for people to take to the streets and fill the squares. Tens of thousands responded. Facing down tanks and helicopters. As volleys were fired into crowds, Erdo\u011fan boarded a plane and flew towards Istanbul. Steve Kroft: were you afraid for your life and the lives of your family members? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: Steve, in our faith there is a concept. We surrender ourselves to death. If you\u2019re the leader you have to communicate the message of immortality to your people. Because I believe if a leader hides behind a rock, then the people will hide behind a mountain. His return to Istanbul proved to be the turning point by daybreak the coup attempt had failed. More than 200 were dead. Who is Fethullah Gulen? Erdo\u011fan immediately blamed the revolt on his arch-enemy, an elderly and exiled cleric name Fethullah Gulen, whose followers had infiltrated the highest levels of the Turkish military, judiciary, and civil service. For the past 17 years, Gulen has been leading a reclusive life in the United States on a 26-acre retreat in the Pocono Mountains. For months, Erdo\u011fan has demanded that his American ally return Gulen to Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: This man is the leader of a terrorist organization that has bombed my parliament. We have extradited terrorists to the United States in the past. And we expect the same thing to be done by the United States. The U.S. is insisting that the extradition process must be handled through U.S. courts to evaluate the evidence. The delay has created widespread suspicions here that the U.S. government is protecting Gulen and that its intelligence agencies may have been involved or had advance knowledge of the coup. Members of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government have suggested that publicly. The U.S. has denied it. Steve Kroft: Do you believe that there was any U.S. involvement? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: I\u2019m not going to blame the United States. But that\u2019s what my people will think. Why are you still keeping that man? So as long you harbor him there, I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t get offended. But this is the-- perception of the Turkish nation and the Turkish people. Steve Kroft: I\u2019m taking it from your answer that you have done nothing to discourage the Turkish people from believing that. Turkish past and Turkish present Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: I cannot deceive my people. I cannot deceive my people here. Because I\u2019m suffering right now. The United States is not suffering. But I\u2019m suffering because of the 241 martyrs that we have buried. Erdo\u011fan had begun a crackdown on the Gulenist movement and other perceived enemies before the attempted coup. After it, he used a state of emergency to begin a massive effort to purge them from government and Turkish society. More than 30,000 people have been arrested or detained including generals, judges, prosecutors, mayors, members of Parliament, teachers and journalists. Another 100,000 people have been fired or suspended from government jobs. And 150 media outlets have been shut down. Steve Kroft: Some critics in Turkey and some people in the United States have said that this is an overreaction. This is a crackdown on the political opposition, not a crackdown on terrorists? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: In Turkey, they attempted to destroy my state. And of course, we could not remain silent. We could not remain indifferent. And these measures are being taken by prosecutors and judges in full accordance with the rule of law. There are not many people in Turkey today eager to publicly criticize the government. Soli \u00d6zel is an academic and a prominent political commentator. Soli \u00d6zel: I think this has gone beyond only the Gulenists. A lot of teachers have been dismissed who probably have nothing to do with the Gulenists. A lot of newspaper people have been dismissed although they have nothing with the Gulenists. And I think a lot of people who really had nothing to do with the coup attempt itself are now being burned. Steve Kroft: Do you think the government is becoming more and the presidency is becoming more authoritarian? Soli \u00d6zel: We are moving in that direction, yes. The presidency has now accumulated a lot more power than is stipulated in the constitution. And it will continue to accumulate more. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: This is misperception. It is out of the question. We have saved our country from the hands of a heinous coup. And we are very much determined to protect our democracy. There is a strong bent of authoritarianism that runs through Turkish history and Turkish life and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s message and actions have played well with the public. After the failed coup, his approval rating jumped to 68 percent. Much of that support comes from more traditional, conservative Muslims, who have long been marginalized in Turkish society. Erdo\u011fan has embraced them, courted them and included them in his government. Ece Temelkuran: He is a brilliant politician when it comes to talking to common people and with their discourse. Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish writer who chronicles the country\u2019s cultural and political changes. She believes this is all part of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vision for a new Turkey. Ece Temelkuran: The new Turkey does not ask you to be more religious. It asks you to be more obedient. It has to be obedient. It has to be male, conservative, religious and, you know, supporting the governing party. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s new Turkey has been a source of concern in Washington. While the two NATO allies still share the same goals of replacing the Assad government in Syria and defeating ISIS, each country has its own special interests and priorities. And in some cases its own allies. The United States is obsessed with ISIS. Turkey is obsessed with Kurdish separatist groups that have been waging a decades-long war inside their country. This is where it gets complicated. The U.S. is supporting and arming Kurdish groups that Turkey considers bitter enemies, and they have responded by bombing the U-S allies. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: You cannot defend another terrorist organization just because they are fighting ISIS as well. You cannot make a distinction between a good terrorist organization and a bad terrorist organization. But this is something that we did not come to an agreement with the United States about. Into all this acrimony between Erdo\u011fan and the United States has stepped Russian President Vladimir Putin, one of first world leaders to express solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup. Since then the two countries have finalized a major pipeline deal\u2026 and agreed to step up military and intelligence contacts. Steve Kroft: Are you reevaluating your alliance and relationship with NATO and the United States? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: Right now, such a thing is not in question. We are moving in the same direction with NATO that we have always done. According to one informed observer, what Erdo\u011fan is really looking for is an answer to this question: Is the U.S. truly committed to use all of its power, including its military, to preserve order in the region, stop terrorism and protect the interests of Turkey. Yes, or No? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer because the Middle East is such a messy place. But right now it looks like the answer from Donald Trump may be yes. His aides have described Turkey as a vital ally and called for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen and Trump himself has suggested he has high hopes for a closer relationship. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
