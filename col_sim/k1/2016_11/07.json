    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 6, 2016 10:19 PM EST FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to Congressional leaders Sunday that the agency has not found anything new that would warrant charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Comey wrote Sunday, in a letter sent to members of Congress and released by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California).\u00a0 This summer, the FBI announced that after a full investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, it was not recommending criminal charges against her. However, in a surprise move, Comey wrote to Congress on Oct. 28 -- barely ten days before Election Day -- to say that the agency was taking steps to review new emails relating to Clinton\u2019s case. That news was then leaked by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and the letter began to circulate more widely. The new emails came from the laptop of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. That announcement upended the 2016 race between Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump, with the Trump campaign praising Comey\u2019s actions and Democrats expressing concern that the FBI would make such an \u201cunprecedented\u201d move so close to Election Day. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d Comey wrote on Sunday. \u201cDuring that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State \u2026 I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.\u201d A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Comey reached his decision on not recommending charges Sunday shortly before he sent the letter to Congress. Comey reportedly had interaction with the Department of Justice before sending the letter to Congress, the source said. However, it\u2019s not clear as to whether he spoke with Attorney General Loretta Lynch directly. The bulk of emails to and from Clinton which were discovered on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop were found to be either personal emails or duplicates of emails previously reviewed by the FBI, the source said. Others had to be painstakingly investigated to determine if they contained sensitive national security matters. Dozens of FBI agents worked as fast as they could to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review. The assistance of special software helped in the efficiency of the process. Speaking to reporters aboard the campaign plane, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters they are happy the issue has been \u201cresolved.\u201d \u201cWe have seen Director Comey\u2019s latest letter to the Hill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were glad to see that as we were -- that he has found as we were confident that he would that he has confirmed the conclusions that he really -- reached in July and we\u2019re glad this matter is resolved.\u201d Trump, too, responded to the news at a rally in Minneapolis. \u201cYou have to understand, it\u2019s a rigged system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s protected.\u201d And then in Sterling Heights, Michigan, he cast doubt on the FBI\u2019s ability to process the emails so quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,\u201d Trump told the rally. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, folks.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the FBI\u2019s initial findings about Clinton\u2019s email practices were \u201ca damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment\u201d -- and that the new statement doesn\u2019t change anything. \u201cThe FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNone of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Part of a Nov. 6, 2016, letter from FBI director James Comey to Congress is photographed in Washington, Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016. Jon Elswick / AP The investigative team had \"been working around the clock to process and review\" emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop \u2014 using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state. In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said, \"The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.\" The news comes after the FBI announced it would review a new batch of emails that appeared to be \"pertinent\" to the investigation that was suspended in July, which had looked into Clinton's use of a private server. Multiple federal sources told NBC News that the emails were found as a part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl.

On Twitter, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump surrogate, started the campaign's pivot back to the \"rigged system\" claims they shared earlier in the election season. \u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 6, 2016 A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on Weiner's laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton's server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reacts before boarding her campaign plane at Miami international airport in Miami, Florida, U.S., October 26, 2016. Carlos Barria / Reuters There were unseen emails, the official said, but they were unrelated to government business. The new letter indicates that the FBI's review is completed. Neither Comey nor the FBI are expected to release any other statements. FBI Dir just informed us \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton\" \u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) November 6, 2016 Democrats and Republicans had starkly different reactions, although both sides indicated that, beyond Clinton's vindication, the FBI still had much to resolve. \"In the days that come, we will have many questions about the FBI's handling of this investigation,\" said John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. \"In the meantime, however, I welcome this news confirming again that no charges are warranted in this matter.\" Republicans quickly countered. \"Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server \u2014 including to transmit classified information \u2014 was extremely careless and a dereliction of duty,\" said Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \"There are also several open questions about the FBI's examination of these facts.\" Play ",

Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images FBI Director James Comey testifies during a hearing before House Oversight and Government Reform Committee July 7, 2016 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images Updated at 7:46 p.m. ET Following up on his letter that set off a firestorm of speculation just two weeks before U.S. voters head to the polls to choose a new president, FBI Director James Comey says the investigative team that analyzed a new trove of emails that were either to or from Hillary Clinton has finished its work \u2014 and that the review doesn't change the findings he put forth in July, when he said no charges will be pursued against Clinton. \"Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\" Comey wrote Sunday, in an official communication with 16 chairmen and ranking members of relevant House and Senate committees. A Changing America Faces A Stark Choice This Election \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\" Comey wrote Sunday. Two sources familiar with the investigation tell NPR's Carrie Johnson the material the FBI recently discovered and reviewed largely contained copies of messages the agents had already seen or personal emails. In response to Comey's letter, Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri said the campaign had been confident that the FBI would reach this conclusion, adding, \"we're glad that this matter is resolved.\" The topic of Clinton's use of a private email server gained new immediacy on Oct. 28, when Comey sent a letter to leading members of several congressional committees, in which he said federal agents had obtained a search warrant, as NPR reported , \"to examine the thousands of emails found on a computer belonging to former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner that could be pertinent to the investigation\" into Clinton. Article continues after sponsorship Hillary Clinton's Path To Election Day: Plans, Luck And Self-Inflicted Wounds News of a potential new angle in the email investigation opened the way for Clinton's Republican rival Donald Trump to attack her \u2014 a crucial development that was seen as helping his candidacy rebound from the devastating release of a 2005 audio recording in which Trump bragged about groping women. In the wake of the FBI director's letter , the race tightened and Clinton was forced to play defense. At a rally Sunday evening in Sterling Heights, Mich., Trump directly responded to Comey's new letter to Congress. \"Right now, she's being protected by a rigged system,\" he told the crowd. \"You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days \u2014 you just can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.\" Earlier in the day, his vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence, touched on the matter at a rally in Hickory, N.C. \"Mishandling classified information is a crime,\" Pence said. \"Hillary Clinton said that she never sent or received any classified information, and the director of the FBI told the Congress classified information was sent.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Sunday afternoon that despite the FBI's findings, the incident shows \"a pattern,\" saying of Clinton, \"She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules.\" Comey's new letter comes after two weeks in which the FBI has been criticized for inserting the nation's top law enforcement agency into the closing weeks of a tense political season; Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid even wondered whether Comey had violated the Hatch Act . The new letter also comes four months after the legal issues at stake had seemed to be resolved: It was on July 5 that Comey announced that while Clinton and her staff were \"extremely careless\" in handling classified data via a private email server that Clinton used while she was secretary of state, the FBI was recommending no charges be brought against her.

    "text": "FBI clears Clinton after round-the-clock review of new emails, Comey says James Comey J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press FBI Director James B. Comey. FBI Director James B. Comey. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) David Lauter and Del Quentin Wilber Contact Reporters The FBI 's much-trumpeted new scrutiny of emails related to Hillary Clinton has turned up nothing that would cause the bureau to recommend charges against her, the bureau's director, James B. Comey , has told Congress. Nine days after rocking the presidential race with word that a new trove of emails had been discovered, Comey sent a brief letter to Capitol Hill that, in effect, put an end to the renewed controversy. The letter said that agents \"have been working around the clock to process and review\" the emails, which had been found on a computer owned by former Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin . FBI letter on Hillary Clinton emails Open link \"During that process, we have reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,\" Comey wrote. \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\" In July, Comey sharply criticized Clinton for being \"careless\" in handling classified materials but said there was no basis for bringing any criminal charge against her. A law enforcement official familiar with the matter said that almost all of the emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer were either duplicates of messages the FBI already had reviewed or were personal in nature. None rose to level that would cause agents to reconsider whether Clinton or her aides had knowingly mishandled classified information, the official said. Clinton\u2019s campaign quickly expressed satisfaction with the announcement. \u201cWe are glad this matter is resolved,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri.\u00a0 But the news from the FBI seems unlikely to calm the anger of many Democrats who have called for Comey to resign. His announcement that the emails had been discovered had violated Justice Department rules designed to prevent investigative actions from influencing elections, many prominent Democrats have said. Even if Clinton wins the presidential election, many Democrats fear that the controversy set off by Comey\u2019s announcement, which dominated news coverage of the campaign for the past week, had\u00a0damaged their prospects in several close Senate races that could determine control of the chamber. Comey was appointed by President Obama in 2013 to a 10-year term as head of the FBI. He prides himself on his independence and tangled with the White House in his previous job, as a senior Justice Department official\u00a0in the George W. Bush administration. The fact that Comey\u00a0is a Republican, however, coupled\u00a0with a seeming deluge of leaks damaging to Clinton from current or former FBI agents in recent days, has caused concern among many Democrats. The substance of Comey\u2019s announcement was not surprising \u2014\u00a0although the timing was. Former government officials and outside legal experts with knowledge of the case had said in recent days that the chances were slim that any of the newly found emails would change the FBI\u2019s previous conclusions. Bringing a charge would require\u00a0finding evidence that\u00a0clearly demonstrated that Clinton or her aides knowingly broke the law, exchanged materials they knew to be classified\u00a0or attempted to interfere with the investigation by withholding or destroying evidence, according to former federal prosecutors and legal scholars. During its nearly yearlong investigation of Clinton\u2019s email practices, FBI agents already had interviewed dozens of witnesses, conducted forensic tests and examined\u00a0tens of thousands of messages. In that previous phase of the investigation, the bureau had discovered information that officials said should have been considered classified in 193 emails that were part of 81 email chains. Eight of the chains should have been treated as top secret, the highest level of classification, the FBI reported. None of the emails was\u00a0marked with a classified header, however, and officials said they had not turned up evidence that Clinton or her aides had known that the information was considered classified. Indeed, State Department officials continue to dispute whether at least some of the messages should have been considered classified at all.

(Photo: Brennan Linsley, AP) 7135 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 174 COMMENTEMAILMORE For 17 months, I\u2019ve traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams. I\u2019ve been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare \u2014 Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof. It also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA and China deals that have deindustrialized the United States \u2014 importing unemployment and exporting our wealth. It means we don\u2019t have to keep kids trapped in failing schools \u2014 that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton: Why you should vote for me Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis \u2014 Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt. America has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation. It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people. That\u2019s what I\u2019m offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It\u2019s there for you to read at www.TheTrumpContract.com. In my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs. In my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged \u201copen borders,\u201d mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America\u2019s immigration officers described Hillary\u2019s extremist plan as \u201cthe most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history.\u201d I will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same. Finally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities. I am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the White House. Together, we will take our government back from the special interests \u2014 and we will Make America Great Again. Donald J. Trump is the Republican nominee for president.

    "text": "FBI sends letter to Congress saying email review completed, decision not to prosecute Clinton stands Published               November 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI\u2019s original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would in the unrelated case review additional emails related to Clinton\u2019s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,\u201d Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. \u201cDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.\u201d Reaction from the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill to the letter, which still appears to leaves some unanswered questions, was swift and largely partisan. \u201cWe're glad this issue is resolved but for the record, this could easily have been learned before 1st letter was sent,\u201d tweeted Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton Democratic presidential campaign. \u00a0 The new case is purportedly related to ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner using a laptop he shared with estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin for \u201csexting\u201d an apparently underage female.\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Comey\u2019s letter last month said only that a new batch of emails \u201cappeared to be pertinent\u201d to the FBI\u2019s original Clinton email investigation. The Clinton campaign and it supporters howled that Comey with his letter had injected himself in the closing days of a very close White House race, while providing little information about the emails and the new probe. \"Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Sunday night. \u201cShe simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules. ... The American people should not have to endure four more years of their scandal and baggage. \u2026 Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump\u00a0on Tuesday.\" Neither Clinton nor Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has yet to comment on the Comey letter. Trump landed in Minnesota for a rally moments after\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement. He made no direct mention of the FBI decision and continued to insist that Clinton would be under investigation during her potential presidency. \"She's protected by a rigged system,\" he told supporters. \"She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president.\" Comey in July concluded the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of the private server system while at the State Department by saying some of the emails included classified information and that Clinton has been \u201cextremely careless.\u201d However, he declined to recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department, and the case was effectively closed. Clinton had appeared to be heading for a sweeping victory before the FBI review, but\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement blunted her momentum. Since then, national polls and battleground states have tightened, though Clinton still appears to hold an edge over Trump in the campaign's last moments.
