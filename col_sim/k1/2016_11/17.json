    "text": "By Julianna Goldman CBS News November 16, 2016, 7:05 PM Trump's rhetoric and financial interests in China present conflicts of interest Email WASHINGTON -- During the campaign, President-elect Trump threatened to start a trade war with China. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said on the trail. Yet he has also bragged about his great business relationship with the Chinese. Donald Trump's transition team is now exploring how the president-elect's kids could receive top secret security clearances. That might create a ... \u201cThe thing they most want - you know what one of the ten things: anything Trump. You believe it? My apartments, my ties. They love me,\u201d he said at a 2014 event. Trump\u2019s web of financial interests in China only adds to the unprecedented conflicts posed by his global business which will be run by his children, who are also his key advisers.\u00a0 His daughter Ivanka once told the Wall Street Journal \u201cfor us there is a great future in China.\u201d They have eyed potential hotel projects in Beijing and Shenzhen. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure lists companies such as Trump China Development LLC. Will the Trumps be able to separate businesses from government? In 2012, Ivanka said they had a team based in Shanghai. \u201cThere\u2019s such interest in the brand being here,\u201d she said to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe\u2019re really ramping up our commitment to meeting the right partners and finding the right opportunities.\u201d Scott Kennedy CBS News But taking those steps is all but impossible without also doing business with the Chinese government, according to Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe line between business and government is a lot fuzzier and much more complex,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can open and close doors to individual deals in a way that you can\u2019t elsewhere in the world.\u201d China also owes the president-elect money: The state-run Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower .

Marco Rubio meets with Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas Cuban-American leaders and human rights activists within the island nation are hoping that the incoming Trump administration will scale back President Obama\u2019s efforts to restore relations between the two countries, measures they say emboldened the communist regime and brought the U.S. little in return. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that a top priority for him next year will be to roll back sweeping changes President Obama implemented that significantly eased trade and travel restrictions. Rubio, like many Cuban-Americans who have opposed the normalization of relations, said Obama\u2019s overtures to the Cuban government have not yielded the hoped-for reforms. \u201cBy any objective measure, President Obama\u2019s unilateral policy changes have failed, and they are not in the best interest of the American people or the people of Cuba,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cRolling back President Obama's one-sided concessions to the Castro regime, a key campaign promise shared with President-elect Trump, will be a top priority for me next year.\u201d Rubio met on Tuesday with Guillermo Farinas, one of Cuba\u2019s most prominent human rights activists, during the dissident\u2019s visit to Washington D.C. Farinas, who has been jailed numerous times by Cuban authorities, has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration\u2019s surprise decision two years ago to normalize relations with the Cuban government after more than a half-century of hostilities between the two nations. Farinas and other dissidents, as well as some international human rights organizations, say the Cuban government continues to oppress its critics. Farinas went on a month-long hunger strike earlier this year after he was detained and beaten by Cuban authorities when he asked about a fellow dissident who had been arrested. Farinas, who was in New York Wednesday to meet with Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told FoxNews.com Obama\u2019s U.S.-Cuba policy betrayed the cause of human rights. \u201cI have faith that President Trump will be better for the people of Cuba and press the cause of freedom and democracy,\u201d Farinas said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say no one can possibly be worse than Barack Obama has been for our cause.\u201d During the GOP primary, Trump signaled support for thawed relations, provided the Cuban government reformed its approach to human rights. After he won the nomination, Trump addressed the issue again in Miami, assailing Obama\u2019s approach to Cuba. \u201cAll of the concessions Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,\u201d he said, adding that he intended to \u201cunless the Castro regime meets our demands.\u201d Top officials of the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), one of the oldest and most influential anti-Castro organizations, say they are lobbying members of Trump\u2019s transition team for a meeting with the president-elect. \u201cWe want Donald Trump to understand the reality of the situation faced by Cubans in Cuba,\u201d CANF co-founder Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Hernandez, a Bay of Pigs veteran, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe want a U.S.-Cuba policy that will bring democratic results.\u201d Other Cuban-American groups pressed Trump before he sealed the nomination. Brigade 2506, Miami-based veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion, endorsed Trump for president, the first endorsement in the organization's 55-year history. \u201cFor Donald Trump, it was a great honor to be recognized by the brigade,\u201d said Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cHe was deeply moved by it. This is an important issue to him, he has said you can\u2019t negotiate with human rights.\u201d Rubio is not the only lawmaker waiting to see what Trump will do regarding Cuba. Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton and also sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, told FoxNews.com that he does not know quite what to expect from a Trump administration. \u201cIt depends on which Donald Trump shows up,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cThe Donald Trump who said earlier in his campaign that he thinks it was good to engage Cuba, or the Donald Trump toward the end of the campaign who said he\u2019d consider rolling back much of what Obama did unless there\u2019s advantage for the Cuban people.\u201d Elizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

Since 2013, the DWP has been plagued by a faulty computer billing system. (Richard Vogel / Associated Press) The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power owes its customers at least $67.5 million in refunds and credits after the utility overbilled them, an independent monitor has concluded. The latest estimate represents a significant increase from the proposed $44-million class-action settlement announced in August 2015. The DWP has been plagued by a faulty computer billing system launched in 2013\u00a0that overcharged tens of thousands of customers while failing to bill others at all.\u00a0 Officials said this week that after a year of working with the independent monitor and revising the settlement agreement, customers can expect to get refunds as early next summer. Under the terms of the settlement, DWP will refund customers 100% of the amount they are owed, officials said. Customers can also file claims for reimbursement if they disagree with the refund amount. Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the nation\u2019s largest public utilities. The tally for Measure RRR as of Wednesday afternoon was 52% against and 48% in favor, with 100% of precincts... Voters appear\u00a0to have rejected a ballot measure aimed at granting more autonomy to the scandal-plagued Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the nation\u2019s largest public utilities. The tally for Measure RRR as of Wednesday afternoon was 52% against and 48% in favor, with 100% of precincts... (Jack Dolan) The $67.5-million estimate is \u201ca floor,\u201d said Tom Merriman, an attorney with Landskroner Grieco Merriman, the law firm representing the ratepayers. He said his team expects \u201cthe\u00a0total value of the settlement to go up,\u201d in part because ratepayers have the right to make claims for \u201cconsequential damages\u201d stemming from the billing debacle, such as if a check bounced or if a customer unnecessarily hired a plumber.\u00a0 Both the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and DWP officials said they hope the court will grant preliminary approval to the revised settlement at a hearing Friday. If the court OKs the settlement, customers affected by the overbilling will receive letters detailing how much money they are owed within 90 business days, Merriman said. The $23-million increase brings the total estimated value of the settlement to about $90 million, according to court documents. The agreement requires LADWP to spend about $20 million\u00a0\u201cto remediate and stabilize\u201d its billing system. Not everyone is satisfied.\u00a0 Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said ratepayers have been waiting years to get refunds and still don\u2019t have a clear sense of what went wrong with\u00a0the billing system.\u00a0 Plaintiffs will ask the court to award attorneys up to $19 million \u2014 a $6-million increase from a previous version of the agreement \u2014\u00a0while the independent monitor can be reimbursed as much as $2.5 million, according to court documents. Those fees would be added to the $90 million already allocated by the settlement. But Court deems those\u00a0fees excessive. The lawyers in this case, he said, are \u201ccreating a very large \u2026 bill to enrich themselves.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAny extra money should be given to the ratepayers as interest on the three years of waiting,\u201d he said. Merriman, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, said\u00a0the judge will decide on the level of fees, and they may not total the maximum allowance. The flawed customer billing system was designed and implemented by PricewaterhouseCoopers , according to the DWP. In a statement, the nation\u2019s largest public utility said it has partnered with the city of Los Angeles and continues to \u201cpursue full repayment by PwC of \u2026 damages\u201d through separate litigation.\u00a0 City and utility officials have alleged\u00a0that the consulting firm misrepresented how it could help launch the\u00a0DWP's\u00a0system. The firm's initial contract with the city was $60 million; it was later increased by $9.2 million. Earlier this summer, attorneys for the city accused senior managers at PricewaterhouseCoopers of inflating their time records to earn additional payments and spending that money on liquor and prostitutes in Las Vegas. Representatives for the firm deny any wrongdoing and have called the original lawsuit \u201cmeritless.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Northern Californians who voted for Trump feel forgotten by the state , Megyn Kelly's new book took a new turn due to the elections , Twitter is trying to clean up , and the Crystal Cathederal is getting a new look.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Republican president-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon stand on stage during the election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) Words of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist \u2014\u00a0\u201cturn on the hate\u201d \u2014\u00a0 trended\u00a0on Twitter Monday, offering something of a Rorschach test for the vitriol increasingly spewed in America\u2019s political landscape. Trump\u2019s strategist, Stephen Bannon, typed the phrase in a 2014 email discussing Republican leadership, as reported in the Daily Beast . At the time he ran Breitbart News, a website popular among\u00a0white nationalists. \u201cLet the grassroots turn on the hate,\u201d Bannon wrote, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty.\u201d Bannon\u2019s call for hatred resurfaced Monday in a the headline of a New York Times editorial that described the adviser\u2019s appointment as a sign that a \u201ctoxic ideology\u201d had found its way into the White House. By the time the phrase crested on Twitter, there seemed to be some confusion over why it was trending and its source. Wow 'Turn On The Hate' is trending...from a group that preaches love and tolerance... \u2014 Caitlin Tierney (@KatieTierneyH) November 15, 2016 Its the title of a news article --> Steve \u2018Turn on the Hate\u2019 Bannon, in the White House https://t.co/jH50DSv7mc https://t.co/JDCY4IGPqT \u2014 Unimpressed (@brownricediva) November 15, 2016 Trump\u2019s supporters accused his detractors of \u201cturning on the hate\u201d amid days-long protests, some of which involved violence. Those detractors said the hatred lies\u00a0with supporters of Trump, who in Bannon appointed a man who once called progressive women \u201ca bunch of dykes,\u201d as the Times noted . Liberals love to turn on the hate when things don't go their way. #RepublicansUnitedForPeaceAndLove \u2014 SaLtY DoGz (@SaLtYdOgZ) November 15, 2016 \"Turn on the hate\" would've never happened, if Trump wasn't a hater! \u2014 Ivy Bliss (@MsiBliss) November 15, 2016 On Tuesday, NPR host Steve Inskeep asked a Breitbart editor to explain\u00a0Bannon's incendiary past. The editor, Joel Pollak, responded by calling NPR's programming \" racist .\" While both sides\u00a0continue to volley accusations, experts who study hatred and public discourse say that Bannon\u2019s appointment stands to only worsen Americans\u2019 blame game until real listening can occur. Gordana Rabrenovic, a sociologist, serves as a director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict at Northeastern University. She co-authored the book, Why We Hate, and said the violent protests and racially charged hate crimes unfolding since Trump\u2019s election provide an all-too-easy, if unfruitful, answer to Americans\u2019 frustrations. \u201cHate and intimidation is meant to silence people, which can push people away from this public discourse about how we\u2019re going to solve our really challenging questions we save as a nation and world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t face them by blaming particular groups of people. Although that\u2019s the easiest way: You don\u2019t have to put forth a particular solution as long as you blame people.\u201d And the high-level White House appointment of a figure like Bannon can only hamper public discourse, said Timothy Shaffer, a researcher with the National Institute for Civil Discourse. The fringe ideas that Bannon peddled at Breitbart don\u2019t represent most Trump supporters, Shaffer noted, and many didn\u2019t know who he was until this week. But that hasn\u2019t stopped accusations of white nationalism from being hurled at Trump\u2019s supporters, he said \u2014 a guilt by association that has to stop. \u201cThis conflation becomes a real obstacle for public dialogue and discussion,\u201d said Shaffer, who teaches communications studies at Kansas State University. Equally important, he added, is for Republicans not on board with Bannon to say so. \u201cThe people I grew up with, in my hometown in Ohio, who voted for Trump for reasons not aligned with Bannon\u2019s rhetoric, those Republicans need to be able to step up and say something,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve exercised your right to vote. But these seemingly intensified elements need to be stood up to.\u201d ",

Kushner, who has been married to Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, since 2009, has been a close adviser to Trump and a mainstay at the Trump Tower while the transition teams maps out next year's administration. Like Trump, Kushner is the son of a wealthy real estate developer and has become an extremely successful businessman in his own right. Trump Receives 1st Presidential Daily Brief The request for Kushner's security clearance comes one day after Trump and his Vice President-elect Mike Pence received their first presidential daily brief, or PDB, a highly sensitive rundown of the days most urgent national security issues typically reserved for the president and a handful of his top officials. It is customary for the president to offer that same briefing to the president-elect. Kushner's advisory role within Trump's innermost circle has been elevated since it was announced on Friday that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would be taking over control of the transition process from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who was let go. The 35 year-old Harvard graduate was one of only a handful of advisers Trump brought with him to the White House last week, and he was seen walking the south lawn with President Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough . Ron Sachs/Polaris Jared Kushner and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough walk through the Rose Garden as they discuss the Presidential Transition in the Oval Office of the White House, Nov. 10, 2016, in Washington. Trump denied reports that he had previously requested security clearances for his children, tweeting today that \"this was a typically false news story.\" 0 Shares ",

Got it The Post\u2019s Greg Miller explores what\u2019s behind the national security shake-up within President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller November 16 at 4:50 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to push back against news coverage describing a chaotic transition to power, saying the process of selecting Cabinet secretaries and working with the Obama administration \u201cis going so smoothly.\u2019\u2019 As Trump met with senior advisers to discuss potential Cabinet candidates, there were further signs that power in his transition effort was consolidating within an ever-smaller group of loyalists generally not aligned with Republican members of the Washington establishment. [ The latest news on the Trump presidential transition ] Among them is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump adviser known for his hard-line views on immigration. His former staff director at the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is now helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump\u2019s team, according to two prominent Republican lawyers with knowledge of the matter. 1 of 8 Here\u2019s what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 11, 2016\u00a0 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/\u201d60 Minutes\u201d via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Benczkowski replaced Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former U.S. attorney and associate attorney general who had been managing the Justice Department transition, the lawyers said. A white-collar defense attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski previously worked in a number of senior Justice Department jobs and is a respected lawyer. His elevation is likely another indication that power has shifted away from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who was recently replaced as head of the transition team by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and who had been considered an emissary to more mainstream Republicans. Benczkowski declined to comment. The new developments came as Sessions himself emerged as a top candidate for defense secretary, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Both would bring hawkish views and military experience, but neither has executive experience running a massive bureaucracy such as the Pentagon. Trump was also visited Wednesday by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who emerged from a meeting with the president-elect saying that he told Trump that \u201cso many New Yorkers are fearful\u201d of what he plans to do as president. De Blasio, a liberal Democrat, has clashed with Trump in the past. And like mayors in many of the nation\u2019s major cities with diverse cultures, he has said New York City authorities would not assist federal immigration officials with the deportations of immigrants who are here illegally, providing them sanctuary. Despite such differences, De Blasio said the hour-long session was \u201crespectful\u201d and added that Trump \u201cloves this city.\u2019\u2019 Here are the people the rumor mill says Trump might pick for Cabinet spots Transition turmoil On his Twitter account, Trump took particular aim at a favorite target, the New York Times, which reported Wednesday that the transition has been marked by firings and infighting, and that U.S. allies were having trouble reaching Trump at New York\u2019s Trump Tower as he plans his government. \u201cThe failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. . . . I have received and taken calls from many foreign leaders,\u2019\u2019 Trump wrote in a series of posts on the microblogging site. He also denied reports that his transition team has sought security clearances for his children. In his tweets, Trump falsely implies the Times reported that he had not spoken with foreign leaders and never points out exactly what the Times had in error. The Times did report that American allies were \u201cblindly dialing in to Trump Tower\u201d in an attempt to reach the president-elect and that key members of the transition team had been fired. The paper reported that even key U.S. allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May had been patched through to Trump \u201cwith little warning,\u201d citing a Western diplomat. Later in the day, the transition team released a list of foreign leaders that Trump and Pence have spoked with. [ Trump\u2019s gripes about the Times are usually about stories that prove accurate ] The Washington Post has also reported about turbulence in Trump\u2019s transition . But Peter Hoekstra, a Republican former congressman from Michigan, defended Trump in an interview Wednesday, saying the president-elect\u2019s team has \u201ca monumental job to do and a short time to do it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just watching all the sniping coming in. They\u2019re not doing this right. They\u2019re not doing that right,\u2019\u2019 said Hoekstra, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman who is reportedly under consideration for CIA director. \u201cThis is what any transition team would do. You start with the people who brought you. I think the Trump team is going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they\u2019re going to do it in a methodical way.\u2019\u2019 The reported bloodletting in Trump\u2019s transition team that began with last week\u2019s ouster of Christie had escalated Tuesday with new departures, particularly in the area of national security. Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) announced that he had left his position as the transition\u2019s senior national security adviser. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leading candidate for CIA director, was among at least four transition officials purged this week, apparently because of perceived connections to Christie. As turbulence within the team grew, some key members of Trump\u2019s party began to question his views and the remaining candidates for top positions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Trump\u2019s efforts to work more closely with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin amounted to \u201ccomplicity in [the] butchery of the Syrian people\u201d and \u201can unacceptable price for a great nation.\u201d Trump met Tuesday with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who replaced Christie at the head of the transition Friday, to discuss Cabinet and White House personnel choices. Little to no information was released by the transition office, leaving a clutch of reporters gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower to hustle after team members passing between the front doors and the elevators. Trump posted a message Tuesday night on Twitter saying that a \u201cvery organized process [is] taking place\u201d as he decides on Cabinet and other positions. \u201cI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d As he had during the campaign, Trump appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable with outsiders and suspicious of those considered part of what one insider called the \u00ad\u201cbicoastal elite,\u201d who are perceived as trying to \u201cinsinuate\u201d themselves into positions of power. Those in the inner circle reportedly were winnowed to loyalists who had stuck with Trump throughout the campaign and helped devise his winning strategy. They include Sessions, former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and members of Trump\u2019s family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. \u201cThis is a very insular, pretty closely held circle of people,\u201d said Philip D. Zelikow, a former director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and a senior figure in the George W. Bush transition. \u201cConfusion is the norm\u201d for transitions, he said, \u201cbut there are some unusual features here, because they\u2019re trying to make some statements.\u201d \u201cThey feel like their election was a lot of the American people wanting to throw a brick through a window,\u201d Zelikow said. \u201cThey want to make appointments that make it sound like glass is being broken.\u201d [ President Obama warns against \u2018a crude sort of nationalism\u2019 in the U.S. ] Increasingly, among the shards are more mainline Republicans in the national security field. In an angry Twitter post Tuesday, Eliot A. Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump during the campaign who had advised those interested in administration jobs to take them, abruptly changed his mind, saying the transition \u201cwill be ugly.\u201d After responding to a transition insider seeking names of possible appointees, Cohen said, he received what he described as an \u201cunhinged\u201d email from the same person saying \u201cYOU LOST\u201d and accusing Trump critics of trying to infiltrate the administration\u2019s ranks. \u201cIt became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls, instead of the sense that actually what you\u2019re trying to do is recruit the best possible talent to fill the most important, demanding, \u00adlowest-paying executive jobs in the world,\u201d Cohen said. Rogers\u2019s departure coincided with word from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose possible selection as secretary of state comforted more mainline Republicans, that he was unlikely to be chosen. \u201cHas my name been in the mix? I\u2019m pretty sure, yeah. Have I been having intimate conversations? No,\u201d Corker said in an interview. \u201cDo I understand that it\u2019s likely that people who\u2019ve been involved in the center of this for some time, and have been surrogating on television, are likely front-runners? I would say that\u2019s likely, yes.\u201d The two people whose names are mentioned most often for the diplomatic job \u2014 former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and John R. Bolton, an undersecretary of state and one-year ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 are Trump loyalists. But both could be problematic, even among Republicans who would have to confirm them. Giuliani, thought to be an early choice for attorney general, was said by a person close to the transition team to have personally appealed to Trump for the diplomatic job. He has virtually no diplomatic experience or knowledge of the State Department bureaucracy. Bolton, a national security hawk who got his U.N. job through a recess appointment after the Senate refused to confirm him, was a leading advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, contradicting Trump\u2019s campaign position opposing it. Congress voices concern Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that Bolton would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that he would actively oppose his nomination. Others were more supportive. \u201cIf he picks John Bolton, then I\u2019ll support John Bolton. If he picks Rudy, I\u2019ll support Rudy,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The shortlist for defense secretary is said to include Sessions, Flynn and Cotton. Although Sessions serves on the Armed Services Committee, his main issue there has been immigration. Cotton is a Harvard Law School graduate who just seven years ago was a first lieutenant in the Army. Senate confirmation of Flynn, who also has voiced interest in serving as director of national intelligence, could be difficult, said the person close to the transition team. He was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency after two years over concerns about his leadership, and he has potentially problematic connections to foreign governments. [ A profile of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a key Trump national security adviser ] Flynn has admitted that he accepted money for appearing at a lavish gala with Putin in Moscow last year. He recently criticized the Obama administration\u2019s treatment of Turkey in an opinion column, without disclosing to the Trump campaign that his consulting firm has financial ties to that country, said the person close to the transition, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Another possible barrier for \u00adFlynn, who retired as a three-star general after leaving the DIA in 2014, is the statutory requirement that the defense secretary be at least seven years removed from active duty. Flynn has told members of the transition team that getting a waiver to this requirement would be \u201cno big deal,\u201d said the person involved with the team. But that assertion has been met with at least some internal skepticism, including from Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who asked at meetings whether such a waiver \u201chas ever been done before.\u201d The Senate waived the provision, part of the 1947 National Security Act, when President Harry S. Truman appointed retired Gen. George C. Marshall to the post in 1950. The person with ties to the transition said support for Flynn has waned as it has become evident that \u201che has some confirmation-type problems.\u201d But Flynn\u2019s influence in the transition remains high, and several sources on the transition team or with ties to Christie said Flynn and Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had seized control of the national security posts in the new administration and engineered the purges in what they described as a troubling episode of political score-settling. Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean Sr. (R), a longtime mentor to Christie, said in an interview that Kushner was widely considered unhappy with Christie\u2019s handling of the transition. There was \u201csome shock\u201d within Christie\u2019s circle at their abrupt dismissal from the transition ranks, Kean said. Tensions between Christie and Kushner date back more than a decade. In 2005, Christie, then the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, led the successful prosecution of Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, a prominent real estate developer and philanthropist, who was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion and witness tampering. Christie also has been beset by scandal of his own making. After a month-long trial that put his gubernatorial administration in a negative light, two of his former top aides were found guilty Nov. 4 for their roles in disruptive 2013 lane closures on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge. In addition, Christie is believed by some Trump intimates to have been insufficiently loyal in the final weeks of the campaign. Those who have been ousted along with or following Christie include Richard H. Bagger, a former Christie chief of staff who had been executive director of the transition, and William J. Palatucci, a New Jersey Republican who served as the transition team\u2019s general counsel. Most recent departures, a transition official said, include Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former Justice Department official who was in charge of that agency in the transition. The New York Times also reported the exit of Matthew Freedman, a protege of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who headed the National Security Council transition team. Earlier, Freedman privately told associates that the Trump team would be \u201cvery punitive\u201d toward Republicans who signed letters opposing him during the campaign and was looking to put \u201ctrue loyalists\u201d in top jobs. None responded to repeated efforts to contact them. The person close to the transition team said it was made clear to Rogers when he received a call from Trump adviser Rick Dearborn that he was being moved aside because of connections to Christie. In an interview after announcing his departure from the team, Rogers said: \u201cI still want them to be successful. I want them to be able to get a handle on the national security infrastructure of the United States and get it in the right direction. I still think it can happen.\u201d Ellen Nakashima, Philip Rucker, Robert Costa, Missy Ryan, Adam Entous and Julie Tate contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump denied Wednesday that his transition was in disarray, assailing news media reports about firings and infighting and insisting in an early-morning Twitter burst that everything was going \u201cso smoothly.\u201d But legal and procedural delays by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team continued on Wednesday, all but freezing the traditional handoff of critical information from the current administration more than a week after Mr. Trump won the presidential election. The president-elect criticized a report in The New York Times about his early telephone contacts with foreign leaders. In a post on Twitter , he said he had made and received \u201ccalls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.\u201d The Times reported that Mr. Trump had taken calls from the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Russia and Britain, but said they had been conducted haphazardly and without State Department briefings that traditionally guide conversations with foreign leaders. Of the transition effort, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cIt is going so smoothly.\u201d Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that the effort to fill staff positions in the new administration was \u201cvery calm, it\u2019s very structured.\u201d He said that reports of chaos were being spread by disgruntled former members of the transition or people bitter about the election results. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was put in charge of the transition last Friday, has counseled Mr. Trump not to feel pressured to make announcements rashly, according to people familiar with the deliberations inside Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Miller said Mr. Trump was taking a \u201ca very structured, methodical approach\u201d to staffing. Mr. Miller also rejected as \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d reports that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had been purging the transition team of people allied with Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, who was removed last week as head of the transition effort. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Picking His Cabinet. Here\u2019s a Shortlist. But Mr. Miller confirmed that Mr. Pence had directed that the transition should not include lobbyists, confirming reports that some existing members of the team had been asked to leave. Mr. Miller said that officials were \u201cmaking good on President-elect Trump\u2019s promise that we\u2019re not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts. When we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps. And so, the bottom line is, we\u2019re going to get the transition team where we need it to be.\u201d White House aides said Obama administration officials at agencies across the government remained legally barred from delivering the normal guidance and briefings to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team because essential documents had still not been completed. A wholesale shake-up of Mr. Trump\u2019s team \u2014 replacing Gov. Christie and the transition staff he had assembled \u2014 has forced Mr. Pence to sign a new memorandum of understanding, a legally required document. White House officials said Mr. Pence delivered that document to them on Tuesday. But by Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s team still had not delivered a series of required, supporting documents, including certifications that each transition member would abide by a code of conduct and would not divulge sensitive information about the inner workings of the government. \u201cThe next step is for the president-elect\u2019s transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the White House. \u201cOnce we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts.\u201d Advertisement ",

Do we always bat 1,000? Not necessarily,\" Trump Communications Director Jason Miller told reporters gathered at Trump Tower on Wednesday. \"Last night probably was an example of where we could have been [in] a little bit better communication, but again, our goal going forward is to give you guys the best information in a timely fashion.\" Play Donald Trump Ditches Press, Steps Out for Dinner 0:47 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161117000427if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/809998403809\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump flouted years of tradition Tuesday night when he left Trump Tower without letting the reporters covering him that day know, and after his press secretary had told media his day had ended and not to expect any more movements from the president-elect. He visited a restaurant with his family, and the first indication the public was given of his plans was from a tweet posted by a Bloomberg reporter who happened to be dining at the same restaurant. NBC News was able to post a reporter at the restaurant after making a reservation to get in, and saw the Trump family, heavily guarded by Secret Service, finish their meal before Trump departed with a promise to the restaurant to lower their taxes. The president's movements are a matter of both national interest and national security, and since the creation of the White House press pool he typically has a member of the press with him at all times, even if they're held slightly apart from his activities, in case anything newsworthy happens to him. The White House Correspondents Association, the group that organizes the White House press pool, issued a statement from President Jeff Mason declaring it \"unacceptable for the next president of the United States to travel without a regular pool to record his movements and inform the public about his whereabouts.\" In the statement, Mason said they were \"pleased to hear reassurances by the Trump transition team that it will respect long-held traditions of press access at the White House and support a pool structure.\" \"But the time to act on that promise is now. Pool reporters are in place in New York to cover the president-elect as he assembles his new administration. It is critical that they be allowed to do their jobs,\" he said. Play ",

Osorio / Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a City Council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a City Council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday said he doesn't think Republican President-elect Donald Trump will cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities, the latest salvo in the mayor's post-election defense of immigrants here without permission against possible deportation by the incoming White House . \"I don't believe they'll do it, because that would mean every major city in the United States would be targeted, and that's not what an administration will do,\" Emanuel said after a City Council meeting. \"When you're in the White House, it is incoming,\" said Emanuel, who worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"When they look at all the things they want to get done and all the battles that will be coming \u2014 whether the battles they initiate and the ones that come to them \u2014 they will make a choice that this is not the battle they want to take on because they have bigger fish to fry, mark my words.\" Trump has pledged to deport millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. The Justice Department released a memo in May saying Chicago could stand to lose nearly $29 million in annual justice grants if found to be in violation of federal laws on detaining people to be turned over for possible deportation. On Wednesday, the mayor declined to say what he would do if Trump takes away that money, calling it a hypothetical that wouldn't happen.

(John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) See more videos Emanuel also joined aldermen in a one-sided City Council debate in favor of a resolution reaffirming the city's status as a welcoming city for immigrants and calling on Gov. Bruce Rauner to do the same for Illinois. The mayor has taken several opportunities since Trump's Nov. 8 election to reiterate his support for Chicago's large immigrant community, and he did so again Wednesday, hanging around in council chambers after his budget passed to make comments about the symbolic resolution. During the 40-minute council debate on the resolution \u2014 a discussion that lasted much longer than the brief consideration of Emanuel's $8.2 billion 2017 budget package \u2014 the mayor choked up as he recalled the display in his childhood home of his grandmother's passport from when she immigrated to America alongside photos of relatives who didn't make it. John Kass Rahm Emanuel is running for re-election as mayor of Chicago and he's doing it nimbly, with stunts and tricks. He's scrambling to outpace his critics on the angry left by cleaving to Latinos and picking a fight with President-elect Donald Trump over \"sanctuary cities.\" And there was that oh-so-syrupy... Rahm Emanuel is running for re-election as mayor of Chicago and he's doing it nimbly, with stunts and tricks. He's scrambling to outpace his critics on the angry left by cleaving to Latinos and picking a fight with President-elect Donald Trump over \"sanctuary cities.\" And there was that oh-so-syrupy... (John Kass) \"And it was to remind (my brothers and me) why we were here, why we were fortunate, and why we could not waste our time in this great city and this great country,\" he said. \"And that we needed to do something to honor those eyes that looked upon us, to honor my grandmother and my grandfather who came here.\" And the mayor said Chicago is standing up for immigrants to stop hate speech and anti-immigrant positions, such as those espoused by some Trump supporters, from becoming acceptable. \"We are normalizing a language and a view, that's why this resolution is important,\" Emanuel said. \"Yes, to reaffirm to the children and their families and their parents 'You're safe.' But to stand up for a set of values that does not normalize a sense of identification that 'You are that ... (you are) other.'\" In other City Council business Wednesday, aldermen passed an ordinance prohibiting child sex offenders from spending time in parts of city libraries used for programs for teens or children, unless accompanied by their own children. Violators face expulsion from libraries or arrest, and fines between $500 and $1,000. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com Twitter @_johnbyrne Immigrants' rights advocates speak at a news conference to discuss expanding mental health services for those fearful that Donald\u00a0Trump will deport them or their families when he is sworn in as president.

    "text": "Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's transition, walks by reporters while exiting Trump Tower on Tuesday. Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's transition, walks by reporters while exiting Trump Tower on Tuesday. Spencer Platt/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump's first week after pulling off an upset victory has had plenty of missteps. That rocky start to his transition planning that one source described to CNN as a \"knife fight\" has done little to assure his critics and skeptical Republicans that he'll have a smooth ascension to the Oval Office surrounded by qualified advisers. Trump denies that the transition is rocky. From the outset, his former transition chief throughout the campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, had to be replaced with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Just days before the election, Christie's top aides had been convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, and a pall of scandal hung over one of Trump's most loyal backers who likely would have had a top job in the new administration. From Lobbyists To Loyalists, See Who's On Donald Trump's Transition Team But with Pence now at the helm, the Indiana governor has apparently done little to steady the ship or stop leaks to the press. Trump's closing refrain of his campaign was that he would \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, but his initial transition team was flush with lobbyists . In one of his first moves, Pence ordered the removal of all lobbyists, according to the Wall Street Journal . Several very experienced members of the transition team \u2014 whose presence gave wary lawmakers comfort \u2014 have departed too. Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stepped down though several reports say he was let go. He had been seen as a possible candidate to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, but NBC News reported he was ousted in what two sources close to the former congressman described as a \"Stalinesque purge\" of Christie loyalists. Article continues after sponsorship \"I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,\" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Shaping Trumponomics: These Names Are Being Floated For Cabinet Posts CNN also reported that the overhaul of Christie's picks was spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. There's no love lost between Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, and Christie, who prosecuted Kushner's father for tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004 as a U.S. attorney. President-Elect Trump Names Pence To Lead Transition Team But his reported instigation of removing experienced hands like Rogers was described to CNN by sources as a \"knife fight\" that was \"mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues.\" Former State Department official Eliot Cohen, who served under President George W. Bush, had been a Trump critic but said he was open to advising him after the real estate magnate's upset victory. But on Tuesday, he had done a complete turnaround, painting the transition as chaotic and motivated by revenge. After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming \"you LOST!\" Will be ugly. \u2014 Eliot A Cohen (@EliotACohen) November 15, 2016 Cohen later told the New York Times in an interview that \"Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered some names of people who might serve in the new administration, but only if they felt departments were led by credible people.\" \"They think of these jobs as lollipops,\" Cohen told the Times. President-elect Trump's outreach to and from foreign leaders has been confusing and disorderly too, per the Times: Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through \u2014 a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain. On Monday Trump touted his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 who he repeatedly praised throughout the campaign even as U.S. intelligence found the Russian government had hacked into the Democratic National Committee to try and influence the American elections. That drew a sharp rebuke from Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who said that Putin's promises of improved U.S.-Russia relations should be taken with \"as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.\" Trump's rumored choices for America's top diplomat have also been met with controversy. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's most passionate surrogates during the campaign, is said to be atop the list. But Politico reported Tuesday that consulting work he did for foreign governments and companies, and the money he accepted from places like Qatar, Venezuela and from Iranian exiles, could prove problematic \u2014 not to say that Trump repeatedly criticized the Clinton Foundation for taking similar gifts from foreign governments. Another name that's surfaced to lead the State Department has been former UN Ambassador John Bolton. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who was among the challengers to Trump during the GOP primaries, said on CNN Tuesday that the former Bush appointee was \"totally unfit\" for the job, and also dismissed Giuliani as a choice. In a closely divided Senate, where the GOP is expected to have a 52-48 advantage, Republican defections will matter. Ex-Breitbart Executive Brings Alt-Right Ties To The White House All of the skirmishes over his transition team and possible cabinet picks may pale in comparison to furor over his controversial appointment of former Brietbart News Head and his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be his senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has ties to the alt-right movement, that's associated with white nationalism. Trump has also denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. NBC News reported Tuesday night Trump had requested a security clearance for Kushner, his son-in-law, so that he could join him for his daily security briefings. Trump tweeted Tuesday denying that the transition was in turmoil. But he added a bit of bombast and suspense typical of his background as a reality TV host: Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 And, in typical Trump fashion, he also took shots at the press, in particular the New York Times calling its reporting \"inaccurate\": The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. ",
