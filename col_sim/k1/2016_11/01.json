    "text": "NFC North So much for all that rust on Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. So much for the idea that a ferocious Vikings defense would terrorize a short-handed Bears offensive line. So much for the forecasts that the Bears would stagger into their open date at 1-7. Turning in a complete performance Monday night at Soldier Field, the Bears upset the NFC North-leading Vikings 20-10. Cutler\u2019s 11-yard touchdown toss to Alshon Jeffery in the third quarter provided a 20-3 lead, the Bears\u2019 biggest lead of the entire season. And against a shaky Vikings\u2019 offense, that advantage provided a sense of comfort and confidence that had yet to be felt this season. The Bears jumped all over the Vikings in the first half, building a 13-0 lead midway through the second quarter. Jordan Howard scored the game\u2019s first touchdown on a 2-yard run, continuing an impressive first half. Howard compiled 145 total yards before halftime, including a 69-yard run to spark the Bears\u2019 first scoring drive. The defense also stood strong, forcing the Vikings into four consecutive three-and-outs at one point of the first half. The Bears also held the Vikings to a field goal after facing a first-and-goal situation from the 3-yard line. First-half sacks from Cornelius Washington, Leonard Floyd and Akiem Hicks set a tone as the Bears defense held the Vikings to 98 total yards in the first half, an average of 3.0 per play and 16.3 per possession. -- Dan Wiederer ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A Democratic operative who bragged about getting orders from Hillary Clinton to execute a bizarre stunt aimed at Donald Trump and was linked to a covert operation to incite the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s supporters was \u201cclose\u201d to Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, according to an email released Sunday by WikiLeaks \u2013 despite the campaign\u2019s denial of any \u201crelationship\u201d with the consultant. \u00a0\u00a0 Democracy Partners co-founder Mike Lux made the eyebrow-raising assertion in a Dec. 17, 2015 email to Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden. The message , found in a trove hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account and posted by WikiLeaks, refers to an alleged connection between Democracy Partners head Robert Creamer and Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook. \u201cJust wanted to pass along this note I sent to Bob Creamer, who as you may know is consulting for the DNC and is close to Robby Mook,\u201d Lux wrote in a note about outreach to grassroots progressives. DEM OPERATIVES LOSE JOBS AFTER UNDERCOVER VIDEO COMMENTS Mook previously denied any ties between the Clinton campaign and Creamer after undercover video surfaced appearing to tie Creamer to schemes to incite brawls at Trump rallies and illegally bus voters to polling stations. \u201cThese individuals no longer have any relationship with the DNC. They\u2019ve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign,\u201d Mook said on CNN on Oct. 23. \u201cAnd my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened in February of last year, they did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again, a video that was leaked out for the purpose of damaging the campaign.\u201d Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 But Lux\u2019s email would appear to call most of that statement into question. Mook stated Democracy Partners didn\u2019t \u201chave a contract with the DNC until June [2016],\u201d though Lux clearly asserts Creamer is \u201cconsulting for the DNC\u201d as of December 2015. Lux\u2019s characterization of Mook and Creamer as \u201cclose,\u201d and Creamer\u2019s own boast in one video of getting a directive from Clinton, also raise questions about Mook\u2019s response. Asked about any relationship between Creamer and Mook, Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin told FoxNews.com in an email that the Clinton camp was not authenticating individual emails from the Podesta hack. Instead, Caplin blasted Trump for not standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose government many intelligence analysts blame for the email theft. Creamer earlier this month said he was \u201cstepping back\u201d from efforts to elect Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee following the release of the undercover, edited Project Veritas video in which a Democracy Partners subcontractor appeared to describe a push to incite Trump supporters to violence. Another video emerged last week that showed Creamer twice bragging that Clinton personally approved plans to place Donald Duck-suited activists at Trump rallies. Amid separate reports finding Creamer made hundreds of White House visits, the email released Sunday provided yet another link between the highest levels of the Democratic Party and the operative. The GOP quickly posted to its website the text of the email alongside Mook\u2019s recent denial. Trump has referenced the Project Veritas videos on the campaign trail and during the third presidential debate. \u201cI was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence,\u201d Trump said during the Oct. 19 debate. \u201c[Clinton\u2019s] the one, and [President] Obama, that caused the violence. They hired people, they paid them $1,500, and they\u2019re on tape saying, be violent, cause fights, do bad things.\u201d The DNC and Clinton campaign have steadfastly disavowed the actions discussed in the videos, produced by controversial conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe. \u201cWhile Project Veritas has been known to offer misleading video out of context, some of the language and tactics referenced in the video are troubling even as a theory or proposal never executed,\u201d Clinton campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said earlier this month.

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is reviewing campaign donations made to politicians by people directly or indirectly connected to developer Samuel Leung. An aerial view of the Sea Breeze apartment complex under construction in Harbor Gateway. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is reviewing campaign donations made to politicians by people directly or indirectly connected to developer Samuel Leung. (Travis Geske) David Zahniser and James Queally Contact Reporters The Los Angeles district attorney\u2019s office said Monday that it would review a series of campaign contributions made by donors with ties to a developer who secured approval for a controversial $72-million apartment complex. On Sunday,\u00a0 a Times investigation\u00a0showed that more than 100 donors who were directly or indirectly connected to developer Samuel Leung had made donations totaling more than $600,000 to L.A.-area politicians while his 352-unit Sea Breeze project was being reviewed. Of those who donated, 11 denied making contributions or said they didn\u2019t remember doing so, and one told The Times she had been reimbursed for at least one donation. The responses raise questions about whether someone else was the source of the money\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a practice that is\u00a0not permitted under campaign finance laws. Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey, said prosecutors were \u201caware of the allegations\u201d surrounding the Sea Breeze project, located in L.A.\u2019s Harbor Gateway neighborhood, and would review them. (David Zahniser and Emily Alpert Reyes) A review by the district attorney\u2019s office is the first step in the process of determining whether an investigation is warranted.\u00a0 It remains unclear if the city Ethics Commission plans to launch a separate probe. An official there said his agency is not allowed, under city law, to confirm or deny whether any investigation is taking place. The commission is charged with looking into alleged violations of campaign contribution laws in city campaigns only. A spokesman with the Fair Political Practices Commission, which investigates campaign finance law violations at the state and local levels, would not comment on whether his agency is looking at the donations linked to the Sea Breeze developer. \"All I can say is that we are aware of it,\" said FPPC spokesman Jay Wierenga, referring to The Times\u2019 story on the donations. Several members of the Los Angeles City Council received donations as they were considering the Sea Breeze complex. U.S. Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Los Angeles), who represented Harbor Gateway during her days on the council, received at least $203,500 in contributions and wrote a letter favorable to the project. Campaign finance experts said the statements to The Times from donors, some of them low-income workers with ties to Leung\u2019s business interests,\u00a0suggest donations may have been made by someone else in an effort to bypass campaign contribution limits. Leung said he did not reimburse any donor and has declined repeated requests for further comment from The Times.\u00a0Emails and phone calls made to a representative for Leung on Monday were not returned. Sea Breeze was initially opposed by staffers in the Department of City Planning and rejected by the Planning Commission. But both Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council reversed the commission\u2019s decision. In 2013, a campaign committee that supported Garcetti's mayoral bid, but was not controlled by him, received $60,000 from companies and individuals with direct or indirect ties to Leung. (Steve Lopez) Politicians and neighborhood activists have called for a wide range of investigations since The Times\u2019 story was published. Councilman Joe Buscaino , a backer of Sea Breeze who received $94,700 in contributions from donors connected to Leung, said the city\u2019s Ethics Commission should check to see if any donors were reimbursed. Buscaino has also promised to return any campaign funds found to be improper by investigators. Councilman Gil Cedillo , who accepted at least $9,000 from donors tied to Leung, also voiced support for an outside review. He serves on the council committee that vetted the Sea Breeze project \u2014\u00a0and overturned the Planning Commission\u2019s decision. \u201cI am just as concerned as my colleagues and welcome an Ethics Commission investigation,\u201d\u00a0he said in a statement. \"If after an investigation the funds are in fact found to be questionable, I will return all donations immediately.\u201d Former Manhattan Beach Mayor Steve Napolitano, who is running against Hahn in the Nov. 8 election for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, has also called for local and federal prosecutors to investigate the donations. On Monday, Napolitano also asked for the county to form its own ethics commission to review similar situations. Bob Stern, the former president of the California Center for Governmental Studies and a coauthor of the state\u00a0Political Reform Act, said any criminal investigation would likely focus on anyone suspected of reimbursing donors, rather than the politicians who received contributions.\u00a0 If the donations were found to have come from someone other than the listed donors, prosecutors could bring charges of campaign money laundering as well as violations of campaign contribution limits. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the politicians will be charged unless they were involved in the actual scheme, but they probably will have to turn over the money to the city or the state\u00a0if it was found that the money was illegally received,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the time the politicians don\u2019t know where the money is coming from, unless they are told.\u201d The pattern of donations struck Stern as odd. \u201cMany of these people don\u2019t sound like they could afford to make these contributions,\u201d he said.

    "text": "Hillary Clinton is slamming FBI director James Comey's decision to release a letter about the probe into the Democratic nominee's emails. Ed O'Ke... Investigators have already seen the subject, date, and time of the emails, but the software will isolate messages that may be relevant to the Clinton server investigation. Agents will cast out emails they\u2019ve already seen and search for those that came from Clinton or that may contain classified information. Then agents will manually go through those emails. \u201cI think this will be an extended process, given the sheer volume of emails ... and then any follow-up investigation, additional warrants, interviews, re-interviews,\u201d said Janice Fedarcyk, a former assistant director of the FBI. FBI agents in New York discovered the new emails earlier in October while investigating Weiner for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to a minor .\u00a0 Still unanswered is why FBI Director James Comey was not informed about the new emails until late last week. Also unclear is how Huma Abedin\u2019s emails ended up on her husband\u2019s laptop, and whether they will change the outcome of the investigation, in which Comey recommended that Clinton not be prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Sources said that Comey felt bound to inform Congress of the new development, but the timing of the revelation put him at odds with the attorney general. \u201cI do not honestly think that they will rush an investigation of this, this nature and this sensitivity,\u201d said Fedarcyk.\u00a0 Part of the delay was in securing a warrant to look at the emails.\u00a0 CBS News learned Monday that there was friction between Comey and the DOJ.\u00a0 Attorney General Loretta Lynch felt that getting a search warrant in this case -- so close to an election -- violated department policy. Comey got one anyway. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

USA TODAY, Collin Brennan Kati Averitt, with her son Jack Averitt, 1, is facing highter health care premiums after the insurer she and her family found through the ACA marketplace, has announced it's leaving her area, Zionsville, Indiana, Monday, Oct. 31, 2016. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) As open enrollment starts Tuesday on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, consumers in some parts of the country are bracing for huge rate hikes, while many others are preparing to change insurers and likely doctors. The crazy quilt of 2017 changes is creating angst among both supporters of the law and consumers under 65 who don't get their insurance through work.\u00a0And it comes as enrollment needs a\u00a0big boost, especially of younger, healthier people to help offset insurers' costs of covering the sicker people who have signed up so far. \"The way people are experiencing Obamacare varies tremendously across the country,\" says Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u00a0\"In some states, the market is stable and in other places, it\u2019s a bit of a mess.\" For example, the second lowest cost silver plan \u2014\u00a0which federal subsidies are based upon \u2014\u00a0was up 116% in Arizona and down 3% in Indiana. In Indiana, four insurers left the exchange and four remain, while consumers in all but one Arizona county only have one insurer to buy from. Much of Southwest Florida, a region with uninsured rates above the national average, will have a single insurer from which they can select plans: Florida Blue. Nearly 93,000 residents of the Gulf Coast counties enrolled in exchange plans during the last enrollment period, according to government figures. About 80,000 of them live in counties with a single provider this time around. Obamacare: There's at least some agreement on what's best, worst \"This year, the vast majority of consumers will qualify for tax credits that help keep coverage affordable, and it\u2019s easier than ever to shop around and compare options,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said\u00a0in a statement. A key point of pride among Obamacare supporters is that about 20 million more people were insured early this year than in 2010 before the law took effect. Federal data out Monday also show, however, that there was no statistically significant difference between the number insured in the first six months of this year\u00a0compared to the same period last year. Decisions by insurers including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield to leave many states prompted insurance regulators to allow insurers to refile their rate requests, often more than once. That led eight states to approve\u00a0rates that were often far higher than those originally proposed by insurers. It's critical to attract more people into the exchanges to make them \"attractive for more insurers,\" says\u00a0Ashish Jha, a physician who is a professor of both health policy and medicine at Harvard. \"We have to fix it one way or another,\" says Jha. Ashish Jha is a practicing general internist who is also a professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a member of the Institute of Medicine. \u00a0(Photo: Harvard Office of External Relations) Jha favors more generous subsidies to help people afford insurance instead of increasing the tax penalties for not buying it. \"Prices go up and young healthy people opt out,\" Jha says, which causes rates to rise, creating a \"vicious cycle.\" A \"virtuous cycle\" is possible too, he says, when prices go down, more people buy health insurance and more insurers come in. Andy Nebel, who has a Chicago-area video production company, was used to the downsides of health insurance as someone with several preexisting health conditions before the ACA. One plan he bought had a $7,500 deductible per claim. But now he's worried insurance companies are taking advantage of people like him with individual insurance. He's shopping for a new plan because his Aetna plan was eliminated. However, the closest hospital for his only\u00a0Blue Cross Blue Shield option is nearly two hours away. \"I understand that poor people who get some federal relief will be able to get affordable health insurance, but middle class individuals who want to buy health insurance are being shut out,\" says Nebel, who is 53.\u00a0\"What kind of a country is it where\u00a0I can\u2019t leave and start my own company and and get good health insurance?\" The law shouldn't allow health plans to \"dump sick people on other health plans,\" says economist John Goodman, a critic of Obamacare who helped draft an alternative pending in the SenateBut that's what the narrow networks of hospitals and doctors allow\u00a0by making their plans \"unattractive to people who would have very high health care costs.\" Young healthy people shouldn't have to bear the burden either, says Goodman. \u00a0The ACA also decreased the number of levels of underwriting it allows, which forces young people to pay more than many believe they should. \"The federal government created this problem.,\" says Goodman, who was the longtime head of the free market National Center for Policy Analysis. \"Taxpayers should generally be called upon to solve it, not just a small number of young people in the individual market. \" How 2017 is different: \u2022 Shopping around more important than ever. \u00a0The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will match\u00a0people whose insurers are leaving the exchanges\u00a0to another plan, but consumers will only be officially enrolled if and when they pay their first month's premium. \u00a0For those whose insurer is still on the exchange, most who\u00a0don\u2019t return to Healthcare.gov\u00a0by December 15 \u2014 the deadline for coverage that takes effect on January 1 \u2014 will be re-enrolled in their current plan. But shopping around saves money. CMS says if every returning consumer picked the cheapest plan in the same metal level as last year, their average premiums would drop by\u00a020% a month over 2016. \u2022 Rates are often way up. The tax credits more than 80% of people get\u00a0to pay their premiums will generally keep up with the rate increases, shielding people below 400% of the federal poverty limit \u2014 about $97,000 a year for a family of four \u2014\u00a0from most of the pain. But the\u00a0people who aren't eligible for tax credits will be especially hard hit. \u2022 Tax penalties will be at their maximum. \u00a0Those who weren't insured in 2016 will have the highest penalties at tax time in April: $695 per adult or a maximum of $2,085 per\u00a0family or 2.5% of adjusted gross income, whatever's higher.\u00a0Some experts recommend that the penalty for remaining uninsured should be higher as it is often cheaper to remain uninsured than to pay the penalty. Hitting home In Indiana, more than 68,000 people find themselves starting anew on the marketplace after the departure of their insurers for this year. Four plans, including United Healthcare and IU Health, opted not to offer plans for 2017, leaving only four insurers on the exchange. Kati Averitt and her family are among those bracing for what the market may bring. Until last year, Averitt, a teacher, and her husband, who works for a small business, had insurance through her employer. Then their infant son arrived and Averitt decided to quit her job and stay at home. Through an insurance agent, the Zionsville, Ind., family found a plan they liked for a monthly premium of just under $900. Kati Averitt, with her son Jack Averitt, 1, is facing highter health care premiums after the insurer she and her family found through the ACA marketplace, has announced it's leaving her area, Zionsville, Indiana, Monday, Oct. 31, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Then came the letter from United Healthcare. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of back to the drawing board for us because we don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d Averitt said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m worried about how much it will be.\u201d Across the board, Indiana marketplace consumers can expert premiums to increase between 15 to 30%,\u00a0said Matt Kleymeyer, Indiana market leader for Bernard Health. \u00a0He cautions his clients not to choose plans based on price alone, if at all possible. Many of the cheaper plans available offer fewer choices when it comes to providers. Whatever happens with the ACA, Jha says he hopes it doesn't lead to an abandonment of the Obama administration's commitment to those who couldn't afford insurance before the law. \"We're too wealthy of a country to not cover the poor,\" he says.

Got it The Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky explains why FBI Director James B. Comey has found himself at the center of the presidential campaign in recent days. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Sari Horwitz , Tom Hamburger and Ellen Nakashima October 31 at 7:51 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @thamburger Follow @nakashimae The Justice Department moved Monday to quell the outrage and frenetic speculation surrounding FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s disclosure last week that the bureau has resumed its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server after discovering a new trove of emails. The department signaled that it now wants the politically charged investigation to follow standard procedures, including a strict limit on official comments about the probe and the provision of updates to Congress through routine channels. But after Comey\u2019s highly unusual disclosure last week rocked the final days of the presidential campaign, it may prove impossible for Justice to lower the temperature and regain control over how the investigation is conducted and depicted to the public. On Monday, criticism of Comey continued to mount, notably from prominent former law enforcement officials. Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill amplified their demands that Comey and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch provide a more detailed account of the investigation into the emails, which were found on a computer belonging to former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) earlier this fall. Justice is a staid and secretive department, and on Monday officials tried to restore that traditional bearing, trying to tamp down the highly public disclosures about a confidential investigation. The Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky breaks down the unknowns following the FBI\u2019s announcement on Oct. 28 that it will renew its Hillary Clinton email probe. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Justice officials said there will be no further statements or news conferences about the Clinton investigation until it is completed. The FBI has software capable of sifting through thousands of emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer, identifying ones that investigators have already reviewed as well as searching for key words that might indicate that the emails may have contained classified information. The department also sent a three-paragraph letter to six lawmakers saying it would move quickly in pursuing the renewed investigation into emails potentially tied to Clinton\u2019s server. The letter was sent by the department\u2019s head of legislative affairs \u2014 not Comey or Lynch \u2014 in a return to standard practice. \u201cThe Department of Justice appreciates the concerns raised in your letter,\u201d wrote Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter J. Kadzik, addressing lawmakers who had asked Comey and Lynch for more details. In particular, the lawmakers had pressed for details about the investigative steps being taken by the FBI, the number of emails involved and the steps being taken to determine how many of the emails duplicate those already reviewed by the FBI. [ Read the letter the Justice Department sent to lawmakers ] \u201cWe assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Kadzik wrote, adding no new details about the investigation. \u201cWe hope this information is helpful.\u201d It was not, according to several lawmakers and their staffs. \u201cWe are not satisfied with the FBI response,\u201d said a staffer for Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who was one of the congressmen who received the letter, along with Democratic Sens. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.). 1 of 15 Who is FBI Director James B. Comey? View Photos Scenes from the career of the bureau\u2019s head. Caption Scenes from the career of the bureau\u2019s head. June 7, 2016\u00a0 FBI Director James B. Comey speaks during a news conference in Minneapolis. Jeff Wheeler/Star Tribune via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Comey Monday saying that the disclosure provided to Congress last week \u201cdid not go far enough\u201d and was unfair to Congress, the American people and Clinton. \u201cIn the absence of additional, authoritative information from the FBI in the wake of your vague disclosure, Congress and the American people are left to sift through anonymous leaks from Justice Department officials to the press of varying levels of detail, reliability, and consistency,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cThe American people deserve better than that.\u201d The senator asked Comey to answer by Nov. 4 a series of questions about the discovery of the emails and what the FBI has learned about their contents. Grassley\u2019s request adds to the increasing pressure on Comey to release more details and clarify his letter to Congress. A bipartisan group of about 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Justice Department officials have also called on Comey to release more information. \u201cWe do not question Director Comey\u2019s motives,\u201d wrote the group, which included President Obama\u2019s former attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., and former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson, who served under President George W. Bush. \u201cHowever, the fact remains that the Director\u2019s disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cFor this reason, we believe the American people deserve all the facts, and fairness dictates releasing information that provides a full and complete picture regarding the material at issue.\u201d Comey set off a firestorm Friday by telling the chairmen of eight congressional committees that the FBI would take \u201cappropriate investigative steps\u201d to determine whether newly discovered emails found in an unrelated investigation contain classified information and to assess whether they are relevant to the investigation involving Clinton\u2019s private email server. The unrelated case was an investigation of Weiner, who is accused of having explicit exchanges with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. [ Abedin says she doesn\u2019t know how her emails wound up on her husband\u2019s computer ] Justice officials have said that before Comey notified Congress, they warned him that doing so would go against long-standing practices of the department not to comment on ongoing investigations and not to take steps that could be viewed as influencing an election. However, officials familiar with Comey\u2019s decision said that he felt a sense of obligation to lawmakers to \u201csupplement\u201d his testimony under oath in July that the Clinton investigation was complete and there would be no charges. Comey was also concerned that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup, the officials said. Comey\u2019s disclosure about the Clinton probe is particularly striking, some U.S. officials said, because he had advised against the administration publicly accusing Russia of trying to meddle in the 2016 election because it would seem too political too close to Election Day. Comey eventually supported the administration\u2019s Oct. 7 denunciation, which alluded to hacks of Democratic Party organizations, as long as it did not have the FBI\u2019s name on it, officials said. His desire to keep the FBI out of the announcement stemmed from several concerns, including a wish not to appear biased as the bureau conducted a probe into Russian hacking, they said. Comey\u2019s position was first reported by CNBC. White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised Comey on Monday as \u201ca man of principle . . . integrity and talent\u201d and said that Obama, who nominated Comey three years ago to serve a 10-year term, does not believe that he is trying to influence the presidential election. Earnest said that the president believes it is important for the \u201cnorms, traditions and guidelines\u201d surrounding FBI investigations to be followed. But Earnest said repeatedly that he would \u201cneither defend nor criticize\u201d Comey\u2019s decision, saying he lacked the independent knowledge to weigh in. [ The Clinton email probe: Questions and answers ] One official said the total number of emails recovered in the investigation into Weiner is close to 650,000, although that reflects many emails that are not related to the Clinton investigation. But officials familiar with the case said that the messages include a significant amount of correspondence associated with Clinton and Abedin. It should not take long for the FBI to determine if there are emails that are duplicates of ones already collected in the probe, bureau experts said. But if the bureau finds emails that contain potentially classified information, getting those analyzed could take weeks because the agencies whose information was being discussed would need to review them, officials said.

They are more likely than whites to be raising grandchildren or supporting needy relatives. In tough times, they have less to fall back on. All of this is playing out here in East Mount Airy, once a heavily white and Jewish neighborhood in northwestern Philadelphia, just across the border from suburban Montgomery County. Sandwiched between Chestnut Hill, with its upscale boutiques, and less affluent Germantown, where Ms. Solomon lives, it has long stood for upward black mobility. \u201cI often say this was the place where working-class black folks would come when they wanted some R and R,\u201d Cherelle Parker , a member of the Philadelphia City Council and former state legislator, said. \u201cBut R and R has translated from rest and relaxation to reverse mortgages and retirement insecurity.\u201d Marlene Trice, who founded the Kitchen of Love, bears witness to these changes.

Yes, there is violence in their community; Ms. Solomon, in her quiet grief, knows this. Yes, many people here lost their jobs, even under an African-American president, but some of Ms. Solomon\u2019s friends from the factory are now employed.

Their feelings about Mrs. Clinton are mixed, but those who are voting for president will vote for her. They hold Republicans in disdain. But their reaction to Mr. Trump is especially deep and visceral. \u201cBack to slavery days,\u201d Ms. Solomon said gravely. \u201cDo as master say.\u201d But if Mr. Trump has brought racial animus to the fore, some see that as a blessing. \u201cIt kind of pulled a blindfold off of America,\u201d Inez Muhammad, 54, a disabled federal worker, said. Like many here and across the nation, Ms. Solomon is looking past Election Day: She fears that Washington \u201cwill be a mess,\u201d with Mr. Trump kicking up a fuss if he loses. She has been working on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and intends to re-enroll in college, to prove to her grandchildren that \u201cif Nana can get a degree, you can too.\u201d In the meantime, she has volunteered to help Democrats register voters and pushing everyone she knows to go to the polls, especially her grandson, who is 18. \u201cI told him, that\u2019s not a given right for black people,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many people died for you to give up that right.\u201d Correction: November 2, 2016 Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Monday with an article about the concerns of voters in Philadelphia misstated the given name of a woman who volunteered at the Kitchen of Love food pantry in the Mount Airy neighborhood. She is Natalie Solomon, not Deborah. And also because of editing errors, a second picture caption misstated the surname of a founder of the food pantry and a third caption referred incorrectly to Raymond and Eric Melton, who were shown playing ball in the neighborhood. The founder of the pantry is Marlene Trice, not Price. And while the brothers live near the Kitchen of Love, they are not fed by the pantry. Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter @SherylNYT .

Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 8:30 p.m. ET In a letter to several Democratic senators Monday, the Justice Department said it \"will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible\" regarding the review of thousands of newly discovered emails that may be relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server. Did FBI Director James Comey's Email Announcement Break The Law? The letter, signed by Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, came in response to four Senate Democrats who sent the Justice Department a strongly worded letter of their own, pressing for more details about precisely why FBI Director James Comey revived the inquiry into Clinton's emails. That letter was signed by Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee; Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee; Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee; and Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. The letter did not discuss whether the department officials were on board with Comey's decision to disclose the revived investigation last Friday. Leahy, Feinstein, Carper and Cardin called Comey's disclosure to Congress about the renewed probe \"vaguely worded\" and left \"so many questions unanswered.\" In particular, they wrote, \"it is not clear whether the emails identified by the FBI are even in the custody of the FBI, whether any of the emails have already been reviewed, whether Secretary Clinton sent or received them, or whether they even have any significance to the FBI's previous investigation.\" Article continues after sponsorship The senators had set a deadline of Monday for answers. The DOJ letter did not include any more information about the investigation. Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a fierce Clinton critic, sent a letter to Comey Monday, castigating him for not providing \"additional context\" to his disclosure. \"Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton,\" Grassley wrote. Grassley acknowledged DOJ faced a difficult decision about whether to disclose the new development, but said he was disappointed in Comey's cryptic approach. \"While I disagree with those who suggest you should have kept the FBI's discovery secret until after the election, I agree that your disclosure did not go far enough,\" Grassley wrote. \"Unfortunately, your letter failed to give Congress and the American people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development.\" Grassley then laid out 10 questions for the FBI to answer, including whether the FBI had read the new emails, whether any of the emails are duplicates of those the bureau already investigated and exactly how the FBI learned of the existence of the new emails. Grassley demanded answers to his questions by Nov. 4. Also on Monday, the White House carefully tried to steer clear of the political fight over Comey's controversial decision to publicize a new round of scrutiny related to Clinton's private email server. \"I'll neither defend nor criticize what Director Comey has decided to communicate to the public about this investigation,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. Comey has become a lightning rod since he notified Congress last Friday that agents had discovered additional emails that could be relevant to the server probe. Although Comey said he couldn't be sure of the emails' significance, the announcement \u2014 just a week and a half before the presidential election \u2014 sent shock waves through the political world. Republicans, including Donald Trump, cheered the renewed scrutiny, while Democrats cried foul. The partisan sniping was the opposite of what it had been in July, when Comey concluded a lengthy investigation of Clinton's private server with a finding that no reasonable prosecutor would bring criminal charges. The new emails were discovered during an unrelated investigation of former Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and others have criticized Comey for publicizing the renewed scrutiny at such a preliminary stage, before agents are even aware whether the emails contain additional information. In an op-ed for the Washington Post , Holder pointed to long-standing Justice Department policies against taking actions near an election that could influence the outcome. Earnest said he doesn't think that was Comey's intent. \"The president doesn't believe that Director Comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election,\" Earnest said. \"The president believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity. He's a man of principle. And he's a man of good character.\" Obama appointed Comey to lead the FBI. He earlier held high-ranking positions in the George W. Bush administration. Earnest added that even if there were not an election just over a week away, Justice Department guidelines typically limit what officials are allowed to say about investigations. He suggested that's an important safeguard to protect innocent targets of a probe, given the government's broad powers to gather information. Officials at the Department of Justice urged Comey not to deliver his notice to Congress but did not order the FBI director to hold off. Doing so might have looked like the department was running interference on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidate. The White House has also been careful about that, going to what Earnest called \"great lengths\" to insulate the FBI's probe \"from even the appearance of political interference.\" As NPR's Carrie Johnson reports, the FBI is currently sifting through the newly discovered emails to figure out whether they are duplicates of what agents already read during the investigation of Clinton that ended in no criminal charges in July. Longtime friends tell Carrie that Comey felt boxed in by the situation \u2014 he had testified twice that the server investigation was over. But then he was faced with the new email findings, which he worried could leak. Clinton has urged the FBI to put out more information, saying over the weekend that \"it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.\" ",

    "text": "What's Next for the FBI's Renewed Investigation Into Clinton's Email Server By Pierre Thomas Oct 31, 2016, 6:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Hillary Clinton's Email Saga Explained 0 Shares Email The FBI says it's moving ahead with urgency as it begins the examination of newly discovered emails that prompted a review of the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server. Investigators have taken the hard drive out of former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner \u2019s laptop and made a mirror image of it to immediately begin pulling data. Weiner\u2019s laptop contained hundreds of thousands of emails, but the FBI team is only focusing on the thousands that appear to be associated with Huma Abedin , Weiner's now-estranged wife and Clinton insider, said sources familiar with the investigation. Obama Doesn't Believe FBI Director Trying to Influence Election With Clinton Email Investigation Investigators are targeting work-related emails and any emails that may have gone to the private Clinton server. The FBI will use computers to eliminate any emails that they\u2019ve already seen. Agents will also look at the time frame when Clinton was in office, but may include some of the time after she left office, according to sources. The investigators working on the latest cache of emails is the same FBI team that conducted the Clinton private email server probe. It\u2019s a collection of cyber and forensic experts, and counterintelligence agents, which number in the dozens. The goal was to have people most familiar with this case step back into it, said sources familiar with the investigation. The FBI hasn't yet determined if the newly discovered emails are truly \"new\" or whether any of the emails contained any type of sensitive information. The emails were found as part of a separate criminal investigation as FBI agents in New York were analyzing a laptop used by Weiner, who had been accused of sending sexually explicit messages to an underage girl. Since the Clinton-related emails were found while investigating another case, the FBI needed a separate warrant to examine the news emails. Federal agents discovered the emails weeks ago, but presented the findings to FBI Director James Comey last Thursday. On Friday, Comey sent a letter to key members of Congress informing them of the update. That sparked a frenzy within the Clinton campaign and immediate backlash against Comey, as lawmakers and former officials on both sides of the aisle demanded for a more complete understanding of the new information. It is also long-standing DOJ tradition to steer clear of potentially influential investigative actions so close to an election. On Sunday, the FBI obtained the appropriate warrant and began reviewing thousands of emails. Comey is receiving regular updates on the investigation and if something definitive is developed quickly, he might consider whether to release additional information. On Monday, the Department of Justice said it was moving as \"expeditiously as possible\" in response to Democrats and Republicans in Congress who had asked for additional information related to the FBI's investigation. \"We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible, wrote Assistant Attorney General Peter Kazik in the letter. Officials in the Justice Department weren't trying to block the FBI from trying to review these emails, according to sources familiar with the discussions. However, there was tension over whether the FBI should notify Congress about it with the knowledge that it would be immediately leaked\u2014and potentially affect an election that is effectively already underway, said those sources.
