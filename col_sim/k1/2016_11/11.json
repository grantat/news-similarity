    "text": "WATCH SPECIAL REPORT: Trump, Obama Meet at White House 0 Shares Email The swamp placed a red carpet over itself to welcome Donald Trump . And the president-elect played it the way you would expect from pretty much any other president-elect. The scenes out of Washington today were striking to anyone who has watched Trump and the wild campaign he just concluded. There was Trump seated next to President Obama in the Oval Office, being wished well by the man whom he will replace. The president whose very legitimacy Trump questioned was praised by Trump as a \u201cvery good man,\u201d and for the \u201creally great things that have been achieved\u201d during his time in office. Just an hour later, there was Trump on Capitol Hill, sitting between his wife and House Speaker Paul Ryan . The man Trump labeled a \u201cweak and ineffective leader\u201d less than a month ago uttered Trump\u2019s signature phrase: \u201cMake America great again.\u201d Paul Ryan Meets With Donald Trump to Build Relationship, Plan Agenda It\u2019s not a question of whether this era of jovial banter and mutual praise will last -- it won\u2019t. But the scenes that played out in official Washington today serve as a vivid reminder of the key choices ahead for the biggest outsider ever elevated to this ultimate insider post. Not many details about the coming Trump era can be derived from the largely ceremonial motions of the two days since Hillary Clinton conceded the race to the White House. Today, the president-elect briefly mentioned jobs, immigration, and controlling health care costs as among his top priorities, though with scant details. As leaders in Washington size him up, it\u2019s worth remembering that Trump\u2019s rise came at the expense of the establishment of both political parties. He didn\u2019t just not have their support -- he plowed right through their collective strength. Trump rode a populist, angry wave based on a promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d and sported a biography where a lack of government experience was a plus. He took on the Obama legacy, the Republicans\u2019 hierarchy and ideology, the congressional leadership in both parties, and even the nation\u2019s military leaders -- and, yes, exploited racial and ethnic tensions and suspicions. Trump has never shown an accommodating side as a politician. It seems folly to expect he will adjust his agenda to fit those of other leaders in a city where he\u2019s pledged to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d But he comes to Washington largely liberated of the traditional special interests that have long held sway over the agenda. He will have a window to operate and make deals, buffeted by congressional majorities that remember, for now, that Trump helped them stay in power this election. His first trip to D.C. as president-elect also suggests he might benefit from an overall political weariness. Obama showed Trump a path, with his gracious recognition of his election, and what that means from here. \u201cI believe that it is important for all regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together,\u201d Obama said. The fights, and maybe even the tweets, will come later. But a political system that fought Trump every step of the way may not be in a fighting mood when he takes office. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump meets with Obama at White House in symbolic start to transition of power President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump took a triumphant tour of the nation's capital Thursday, holding a cordial White House meeting with President Barack Obama, sketching out priorities with Republican congressional leaders and taking in the majestic view from where he'll be sworn in to office. Trump's meeting with Obama spanned 90 minutes, longer than originally scheduled. Obama said he was \"encouraged\" by Trump's willingness to work with his team during the transition of power, and the Republican called the president a \"very good man.\" \"I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including his counsel,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. He'll begin occupying the office on Jan. 20. While Trump noted that he and Obama had never met before, their political histories will forever be linked. Trump spent years perpetrating the lie that Obama was born outside the United States. The president campaigned aggressively against Trump during the 2016 campaign, warning that his election would put the republic at risk. Click and drag within the image to explore a 360-degree view of President Barack Obama meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 10, 2016. (Jim Watson / AFP) But at least publicly, the two men appeared to put aside their animosity. As the meeting concluded and journalists scrambled out of the Oval Office, Obama smiled at his successor and explained the unfolding scene. \"We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed the country succeeds,\" Obama said. From the White House, Trump headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to discuss the GOP legislative agenda. Ryan, who holds the most powerful post in Congress, was a sometime critic of Trump and never campaigned with the nominee. Emerging from the meetings, Trump sketched out priorities for his presidency. \"We're going to move very strongly on immigration,\" he said. \"We will move very strongly on health care. And we're looking at jobs. Big league jobs.\" (Tribune news services) Ryan took Trump on a tour of the Speaker's Balcony overlooking the National Mall, the scene of Trump's upcoming inauguration. The view, Trump said, was \"really, really beautiful.\" Trump was also beginning the process of putting together his White House team. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who worked his way into Trump's inner circle during the election, and top campaign official Kellyanne Conway were emerging as possible picks for White House chief of staff, according to two people familiar with the transition planning. A third person said conservative media executive Steve Bannon was also in the mix, though others insisted Bannon would not have a White House role. Those involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days. First lady Michelle Obama met privately in the White House residence with Trump's wife, Melania, while Vice President Joe Biden saw Vice President-elect Mike Pence late Thursday. Trump's team was said to be sketching a robust role for Pence, an experienced Washington hand, that would include both domestic and foreign policy responsibilities. President Barack Obama met with President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 10, 2016, at the White House. Obama and Trump met alone, with no staff present, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters following the discussion. \"The two men did not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office,\" Earnest said. \"We're on to the next phase.\" Trump traveled to Washington from New York on his private jet, breaking with protocol by not bringing journalists in his motorcade or on his plane to document his historic visit to the White House. Trump was harshly critical of the media during his campaign and for a time banned news organizations whose coverage he disliked from his events. At the White House, Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough was seen walking along the South Lawn driveway with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. A handful of Trump aides trailed them. 2009: Oval Office of the White House J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press President George W.

Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) The show of civility at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue contrasted with postelection scenes of protests across a politically divided country. Demonstrators from New England to the heartland and the West Coast vented against the election winner on Wednesday, chanting \"Not my president,\" burning a papier-mache Trump head, beating a Trump pinata and carrying signs that said \"Impeach Trump.\" More than 100 protesters held a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House. The mostly student protesters held signs saying \"Love Trumps Hate,\" a phrase Democrat Hillary Clinton often used during the campaign. Trump's advisers, many of whom were stunned by his unexpected victory, plunged into the huge task of staffing government agencies. A transition website, GreatAgain.gov, referenced 4,000 political appointee openings. Officials at the Pentagon and State Department said they had not yet been contacted. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency stood ready \"to work with the incoming team once that team is designated and arrives here. But we don't have any firm word as to when that will be.\" As president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same daily intelligence briefing as Obama \u2014 including information on U.S. covert operations, information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by America's 17 intelligence agencies. The White House said it would organize two exercises involving multiple agencies to help Trump's team learn how to respond to major domestic incidents. Associated Press ",

Time Graffiti of swastika on a softball field dugout in Wellsville, N.Y., Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: Brian Quinn, Wellsville Daily Reporter) 1083 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 176 COMMENTEMAILMORE In Wellsville, N.Y., a massive swastika is scrawled on a park wall: \"Make America White Again.\" In Maple Grove, Minn.,\u00a0messages in a high school bathroom include \"#gobacktoafrica,\"\u00a0\"#whitesonly\" and \"#whiteamerica\" \u2014\u00a0along with \"Trump Train.\" At the University of Vermont, students\u00a0found a Donald Trump campaign sign painted with a swastika three doors down from the campus Hillel. Experts and educators say an alarming succession of racist behavior, graffiti and crime since Election Day can be linked to\u00a0Trump's victory. And they say the Republican president-elect could play a crucial role in curbing the disquieting\u00a0conduct. Obama says he and Trump had 'excellent conversation' Carlos Wiley, director of the Paul Robeson Cultural Center at Penn State University, said he believes the attacks represent a backlash from people who suppressed racial hatred for years during the Obama presidency. Now they feel it is safe to openly display their contempt. \"People looked at the way protesters were manhandled at Trump rallies, and they think 'oh, if someone disagrees with us, we can do those things\u00a0as well,' \" Wiley said. Enid Logan, who teaches sociology and African-American studies at the University of Minnesota, says Trump's victory legitimized white supremacists' point of view. \"There was nothing subtle with Trump \u2014 extreme vetting and ideological testing of Muslims, deporting all undocumented people, Mexicans are rapists and murders,\" she said. \"And he won. White people supported him. So this kind of thinking isn't as marginal as we thought.\" In San Marcos, Texas, Texas State University police\u00a0are trying to determine who is responsible for a series of ominous, threatening fliers posted around campus. Not even 24 hours yet. My friend's sister, who is Muslim, had a knife pulled on her by a Trump supporter while on the bus by UIUC campus. \u2014 Sarah A. Harvard (@amyharvard_) November 9, 2016 \"Now that our man Trump is elected and Republicans own both the Senate and the House\u00a0\u2014\u00a0time to organize tar & feather VIGILANTE SQUADS and go arrest and torture those deviant university leaders spouting off all this diversity garbage,\" one of the fliers read. The fliers were found in bathrooms around the campus about 30 miles south of Austin, and images of them quickly spread on social media.\u00a0They featured a photo of several men clad in camouflage and holding rifles and claimed diversity was a code word for \"white genocide.\" University President Denise Trauth issued a statement calling for \"constructive dialogue\" in the wake of the contentious election. \"Discourse is fundamental to the academic enterprise, and this university strives to protect it,\" the statement said. \"Our aim should be to better understand that which causes divisions among us and to work toward strengthening our bond as a university community.\" Wiley agrees with Trauth\u00a0and said Trump could lead the discourse. \"He doesn't need to say anything about specific incidents, but he should say they are occurring and they should stop,\" Wiley said. \"That they aren't part of the America he wants to lead.\" Logan has her doubts. \"All that red meat he threw out to his base during the campaign, I'm not sure he believes it,\" she said. \"But it was incredibly powerful and it worked. Why would he pivot now?\" In Minnesota,\u00a0officials at Maple Grove Senior High launched an investigation into the racist graffiti, which has been widely shared on Twitter. \"The tweet you may have seen of a racist message scrawled in a school bathroom is real,\u00a0and we are horrified by it,\" said Barbara Olson,\u00a0Osseo area schools community relations director. She said such racist messages endanger students and staff\u00a0and create a climate that is not conducive to learning. \"This incident is additional evidence of the pressing need in our schools, our community and our nation to find ways to talk about race constructively and respectfully,\" Olson said.

Trump 2016\" pic.twitter.com/jyBjUSS2TI \u2014 Shaun King (@ShaunKing) November 10, 2016 Matt Vogel, executive director of the University of Vermont's campus\u00a0Jewish group,\u00a0said it was unclear who had marked the Trump sign\u00a0with the swastika or why. \"For many Jewish students, no matter how they voted, seeing that symbol of hate is a very painful thing for them,\" Vogel said. In California, San Jose State University said a woman lost her balance and choked\u00a0when a man attempted to rip her\u00a0headscarf away. In Louisiana, a report of another racial incident was later debunked.\u00a0\u200bA Louisiana college student, 18,\u00a0acknowledged she fabricated a report that she was assaulted and robbed of her wallet and Muslim headscarf by two men, one of whom she described as wearing a white \u201cTrump\u201d hat, police said Thursday. The Lafayette Police Department said in a statement that it is no longer investigating the\u00a0claims, which were made within hours of\u00a0Trump\u2019s presidential victory. The presidents of both schools issued statements\u00a0referencing the \"contentious\" election and urging their communities to respect diversity as the nation moves forward. It may take awhile. Social media is full of examples of hate.\u00a0And Trump foes have joined the chaos online and on the streets, where shouts of\u00a0\"Not my president\" and\u00a0profanity are\u00a0appearing on signs and buildings. Thousands across the USA protest Trump victory Wiley said he was encouraged by Trump's conciliatory remarks during his acceptance speech. But he fears that if Trump fails to quickly make good on promises such as building a wall that Mexico will pay for, his backers will grow angry. And, he said, take it out on \"populations\" they don't like. \"We need to allow people to mourn a little bit, to contemplate what their future looks like with\u00a0a Donald Trump presidency,\" Wiley\u00a0said. \"Then we need to have serious conversations about humanity, about civility.

    "text": "Starting Tuesday night, as Donald Trump 's victory in the presidential election started coming into focus, anguished questions flooded social media: Could Trump overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide? Could he abolish same-sex marriages? Could he increase deportations? How about global warming? Could Trump pull out of U.S. agreements on climate change? What about Obamacare? The chief executive has a lot of authority over the government, as President Obama has demonstrated. But as Obama has found, he also faces tremendous constraints from Congress , the courts and existing laws. Here are some areas in which President Trump could act quickly and where he could not. Could Trump overturn Roe v. Wade? Not on his own. The Supreme Court decision in 1973 struck down state laws around the country that banned abortions. Ever since, antiabortion groups have called for reversing the ruling. The decision could be overturned two ways \u2014\u00a0by a new Supreme Court decision or by a constitutional amendment. The high court has reaffirmed the Roe decision repeatedly, most recently by a 5-3 vote in June that struck down a Texas law that limited abortions . After Trump's win, even some in Silicon Valley wonder: Has Facebook grown too influential? \u00bb In theory, if\u00a0enough vacancies arise on the court, Trump could appoint a sufficient number of\u00a0justices who would overturn Roe . In practice, the Supreme Court has had a majority of Republican-appointed justices since Roe was handed down, except for the past few months of a 4-4 tie, and that\u2019s never happened. As for a constitutional amendment, the president has no role in that process. Amendments have to pass both houses of Congress by a two-thirds vote and be ratified by three-quarters of the states \u2014\u00a0a high bar. What could Trump do about immigration? A lot. The law gives the president broad authority over immigration policy. Trump could speed up deportations, revoke Obama\u2019s program that shielded so-called Dreamers \u2014\u00a0people who came to the U.S. illegally as children \u2014\u00a0and curb certain categories of visas for legal immigrants. But as Obama found, there are limits. Courts struck down his effort to expand the deportation shield to cover millions of adults. Trump also could not build a wall along the Mexican border without money from Congress, although he might be able to get started on construction by shifting funds already in the federal budget. Could Trump ban Muslims from coming to the U.S.? Legal experts have said he probably could : Noncitizens seeking to enter the country generally aren\u2019t protected by the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Here is how America feels about Trump's shocking win \u00bb As of Thursday morning, mention of the Muslim ban had disappeared from Trump\u2019s campaign website. Later in the day, the proposal reappeared on the website . Trump aides insisted the earlier removal had been a technical glitch.\u00a0 Trump could limit the entry of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other war-torn Middle Eastern countries. He probably would face pressure from U.S. allies not to do so, but he could disregard that. Are same-sex marriages at risk? No. Just as with abortion, the president can\u2019t overturn a Supreme Court decision by himself, although he could appoint more conservative justices. Even then, the chance that the high court would reverse itself is very small. Unlike abortion, same-sex marriage has steadily gained in public approval. Trump could try to reverse some Obama administration rulings that favored same-sex couples on issues such as federal benefits. He hasn\u2019t suggested that he would. And if he did, his decisions could be challenged in court. Could Trump reverse current policies on climate change? He could and quite probably will . Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from an international agreement made in Paris last year that called on countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. And he has said he would scrap Obama administration rules that aim to shift electricity generation away from coal and oil toward cleaner sources. Since those policies were adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the Clean Air Act, they could be reversed by the EPA. But environmental groups could \u2014\u00a0and almost certainly would \u2014\u00a0go to court to try to block any such reversal. At minimum, the groups could tie up the Trump administration for a long time. What happens if Trump tries to repeal Obamacare? Trump has promised to ask Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something else. The repeal part is easy since the Republicans control both houses of Congress. The replace part is a lot harder, as my colleague Noam N. Levey explained. Fear of a Trump-triggered recession gives way to hope for short-term economic boost \u00bb Republicans have never been able to agree on a plan to replace the current law, and they would be under tremendous pressure not to simply repeal the law without a backup plan. Doing so would cause some 20 million people to lose healthcare coverage. So carrying out Trump\u2019s pledge may take quite a while, and, in the end, the GOP may have to settle for less dramatic change than the rhetoric might imply. Could Trump end federal funds for Planned Parenthood? Congress would have to act to accomplish that goal, which many conservatives have sought because of the group\u2019s role in providing abortion services. Whether a ban would pass both houses, especially the Senate, remains uncertain. The federal money that goes to support Planned Parenthood\u2019s healthcare activities does not involve abortion but rather funds the group\u2019s other services, including\u00a0mammograms and other preventive care for women. Several\u00a0Republican senators have\u00a0supported Planned Parenthood in the past because those services are popular in their states. During the campaign, Trump threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. Could he? The president, acting through the attorney general,\u00a0has broad authority to appoint prosecutors. But appointing a prosecutor to go after a defeated campaign rival would be unprecedented, and Trump\u2019s aides already have started stepping away from that idea. Could Trump order police to adopt \u2018stop-and-frisk\u2019\u00a0policies? No. During the campaign, Trump defended the use of so-called stop-and-frisk policing\u00a0tactics. But police departments don\u2019t work for the federal government, they work for state and local governments. In some cities, stop-and-frisk has been limited by court decisions. In other places, it has been dropped by police chiefs who decided it was not reducing crime enough to justify the tension it created \u00a0in minority communities. Trump talked about making libel law less protective of the press.\u00a0Could he? No. There is no federal libel law. Each state has its own law. A\u00a0Supreme Court decision handed down more than 40 years ago \u2014\u00a0New York Times v. Sullivan \u2014 provides broad protection for the press in covering public figures.

By David Nakamura and Juliet Eilperin November 10 at 2:38 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @eilperin Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was \"very encouraged\" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump and President Obama met for the first time Thursday and pledged to work together, starting the whirlwind transition that will unfold over the next 10 weeks until Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump later met with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) at the Capitol and said they also would work together \u2014\u00a0but on Republican goals that are opposed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. \"We're going to lower taxes,\" Trump told reporters, with Ryan seated by his side. \"We're going to fix health care and make it affordable and better.\" He appeared to be referring to a plan to lower taxes that heavily benefits top earners and to the GOP's aim of repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Following his meeting with Ryan, Trump conferred with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) in the Kentucky senator's Capitol office. An hour and a half after Trump entered the White House through the South Lawn entrance \u2014 avoiding news cameras and the president's staff \u2014 a group of reporters was ushered into the Oval Office, where the president and president-elect were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room. In a sign of how tensions between the two politicians have not disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the election, the White House did not arrange for the traditional photo-op between the current first couple and the incoming one, a custom that George W. Bush and his wife Laura observed when the Obamas visited the White House in 2008. Melania Trump met\u00a0separately with Michelle Obama. [ Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington ] Still, Trump told reporters Thursday that he expects to work closely with Obama now and in the future to\u00a0seek his advice in guiding the country. He noted that a session that was supposed to last 10 to 15 minutes went on for an hour and a half. \u201cAs far as I'm concerned, it could have lasted a lot longer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.\u201d \u201cSo Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future,\u201d he added, calling Obama \u201ca very good man.\u201d 1 of 22 What President-elect Donald Trump is doing on his trip to Washington View Photos Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Obama, for his part, said, he was\u00a0encouraged by \"the interest in President-elect Trump's wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces. And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face.\u201d The president said that the men's two wives had enjoyed spending time together\u00a0Thursday morning. \u201cWe want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMost of all, I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed \u2014\u00a0because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s victory exposes Obama\u2019s inability to connect with white working class ] Later, Trump and his wife, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, met with Ryan at the Capitol, where Trump pledged to work closely with Republican congressional leaders. Ryan ushered Trump out onto the Speaker's Balcony and gestured toward the Washington skyline and the monuments west of the Capitol. He pointed to an inaugural platform being built on the Capitol grounds, appearing to show Trump where he would be taking the oath of office as president. McConnell joined Trump and his entourage on a walking tour through part of the building. At the White House, first lady Michelle Obama and Melania Trump met for tea in the private residence and took a tour that included stepping onto Truman Balcony, as well as a tour of the State Floor with the White House curator. They talked about raising children in the White House, and then they visited the Oval Office to meet the president and president-elect. As\u00a0the two leaders met, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough gave a tour to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and other aides, notably Dan Scavino, across the edge of the Rose Garden. Afterward McDonough led\u00a0Kushner on a walk down the South Lawn for nearly 20 minutes, at which point the two men rejoined Trump's senior staff\u00a0and reentered the White House. During Obama and Trump's press availability, Kushner snapped photos with his iPhone. A slew of journalists, including international reporters, milled about on the driveway leading to the West Wing ahead of Trump's arrival. Some did live updates to their networks. Across West Executive Drive, dozens of White House staffers gathered on a steps in hopes of a glimpse of the president-elect. This is the scene on the West Wing driveway right now. pic.twitter.com/KoLxqek8qo \u2014 David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 10, 2016 Obama has pledged his administration's full cooperation with Trump's transition team, citing the close working relationship he enjoyed with President George W. Bush during their transfer of power eight years ago. The White House said\u00a0that Pence met with Vice President Biden in the afternoon. \u201cI have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect,\u201d Obama said in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. The president said he called to congratulate Trump early Wednesday morning after news networks had formally announced Trump as the winner over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after the meeting that the two men did not try to resolve all of their differences, but he said it was \"a little less awkward\" than reporters might have anticipated. Obama and Trump met privately without any other staff in the room. A large part of the Oval Office session was devoted to talking about how to staff and organize the White House. \"That's complicated business,\" Earnest said, noting that presidents have to deal with multiple challenges and crises at the same time. It is \"something President Obama has thought about extensively over the past eight years.\" Obama had denounced Trump as \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d for the White House during a long and brutal campaign. But he said that \u201cwe are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\u201d Trump, and Clinton, already had been receiving national-security briefings as the nominees of the two major political parties. The White House said Thursday that Obama has convened a coordinating council to facilitate a smooth transition, including providing briefings from federal agencies to Trump's transition team, headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). Officials from the Trump transition team are starting to set up shop in agencies across the federal government, where they can consult with top Obama officials as they assemble their staffs. The current White House has already begun to transfer a massive amount of information to the National Archives and Records Administration: so far it has sent 283 million files, comprising 122,000 gigabytes of data. In an interview Wednesday, White House communications director Jennifer Psaki said the president has talked privately with his staff, as well as publicly, about\u00a0putting institutional interests ahead of political ones. Referring to the speeches Obama delivered upon winning the presidency and at his first inaugural, she said: \u201cHe reflects a lot about the cog in the wheel that you are as president. He was taking the baton, he\u2019s handing it off. But I think it\u2019s a recognition that it\u2019s bigger than individual aspirations and it\u2019s bigger than yourself, and bigger than anything that you\u2019ve accomplished. Because we as a country need to be stable, need to have continuity.\u201d In the wake of protests over Trump's win, Earnest said that while the president believes the protesters have a right to express their opinions, his\u00a0message to them is that \"we're Americans and patriots first\" and that an orderly transfer of power ranks as a top White House priority. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who ran unsuccessfully in the GOP presidential primary and harshly criticized Trump, was at the White House on Thursday to attend Obama's ceremony for the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Kasich said he saw people protesting Trump's election as he entered the White House gates, and he called for unity. \u201cI just want to remind everyone in our country that the office of the presidency needs to be respected,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cToday, I said my prayers on the plane for the success of Donald Trump. And I think as Americans, we all need to come together.\u201d There is long-standing bad blood between Trump and Obama, after the New York businessman led a public campaign to try to force the president to disclose his long-form birth certificate in 2011 over unfounded questions from some conservatives who thought the president was not born in the United States. As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) During the White House Correspondents' Association dinner that year, Obama lit into Trump, mocking him before a ballroom of 2,000 guests and on live television. During the campaign, Trump promised to repeal the president's signature health-care law and overturn many of his executive actions. Obama said Trump was not to be trusted with the nation's nuclear codes and represented an existential threat to democracy. Obama sought to play down their differences and said Trump's victory speech was magnanimous and set the right tone to help try to heal the nation's political divisions that were exposed and inflamed over the past 15 months. \u201cThey do not have an extensive personal relationship,\u201d Earnest said Wednesday, drawing laughs from reporters. \u201cThis is not a situation where they\u2019ve had many conversations or played golf together or any of that business. So I guess that will be among the many, many, many reasons that tomorrow\u2019s meeting will be rather interesting.\u201d After his meeting with Trump, Obama will welcome another high-profile visitor with his own large media contingent when LeBron James and the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers arrive for a South Lawn ceremony with the president. 1 of 51 ",

And as the the party of government, Democrats feel compelled to make it work for their constituents as much as possible. Dysfunctional government will generally benefit the anti-government party, which is the GOP. \"My number one priority in the next two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful,\" President Barack Obama said Thursday after meeting with Trump.

Bernie Sanders said in a statement. \"To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,\" Sanders added.

    "text": "OBAMA, TRUMP DISCUSS TRANSITION OF POWER The differences are even more stark when it comes to advertising.\u00a0 The Clinton campaign and its allies accounted for about 75 percent of all TV ads aired during the general election in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to data from the Center for Public Integrity provided to Time . Yet Trump won all four of those swing states, beating Clinton by a combined 820,518 votes. Romney unleashed $156.8 million in advertisements against President Obama's $241.5 million in ads last cycle, Politico reported. Clinton spent $211.4 million on ads in the 2016 general election. But Trump needed to spend just $74 million in ad dollars to capture the 279 electoral votes that assured his victory on Tuesday, with three states yet to be called. Not only did Clinton\u2019s monetary advantage fail to win her an Electoral College victory, it also didn\u2019t help turn out Democratic voters in the same numbers as the two previous presidential elections. With less money spent, Trump captured about the same number of total votes as Romney in 2012 \u2013 just fewer than 60 million (though 2016\u2019s tally hasn\u2019t been completely counted). Clinton was leading Trump in the popular vote total by about 200,000 votes as of Thursday morning. But that total badly trails the numbers put up by President Obama in 2008 (69.4 million) and 2012 (65.9 million), despite a comparable amount raised and spent on ads. In the final analysis, the man who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d ended up with a great one. Trump spent about $13.29 per individual vote and $2.8 million per Electoral College vote. Clinton spent about $21.63 per individual vote and $5.7 million per Electoral College vote. Advertisement ",

President Obama said they had an \"excellent\" and \"wide-ranging\" conversation. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS on Publish Date November 10, 2016. Photo by Stephen Crowley/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and Donald J. Trump made a public show on Thursday of putting their bitter differences aside after a stunning election upset. The Oval Office meeting brought together a president who has darkly warned that Mr. Trump could not be trusted with the nuclear codes and a successor who rose to political prominence questioning Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace and legitimacy. \u201cI want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Mr. Obama told Mr. Trump as the two sat side-by-side after the roughly 90-minute meeting. The president called the session \u201cexcellent\u201d and wide-ranging. Mr. Trump, who said he had never met Mr. Obama before and expected the meeting to last only 10 or 15 minutes, said it had been a \u201cgreat honor\u201d to sit with the president. \u201cWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Mr. Trump said. It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites \u2014 Mr. Trump a brash real estate executive and reality television star whose campaign was defined in opposition to the sitting president, and Mr. Obama, a cool-tempered intellectual who has pressed a progressive agenda in office. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump, whose election on Tuesday stunned the president and rocked the political establishment in Washington, arrived in the White House driveway on Thursday out of sight of the crowds of reporters and news media cameras assembled there. His staff had refused to arrange for journalists to document his movements, as is customary both for the president and the president-elect, and Mr. Obama\u2019s team did not arrange for the traditional photograph of the sitting president and his wife greeting their successors in front of the White House. Mr. Obama said his wife, Michelle, who emerged this fall as an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, met with Melania Trump while their husbands spoke in the Oval Office. \u201cWe want to make sure that they feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Trumps. The meetings unfolded as Mr. Obama\u2019s staff was starting the daunting business of handing over the vast bureaucracy of the United States government to Mr. Trump\u2019s staff, including vital national security information and resources he would need in the event of a catastrophic attack. Ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington on Thursday morning, top advisers to Mr. Obama had spent months preparing for a transition, a highly complex venture condensed into the 72-day period between now and the Jan. 20 inauguration. It is up to them and the Trump team to set it in motion, pairing Obama administration staff members with representatives of the president-elect for crash courses in the inner workings of the White House and federal agencies. Two war-gaming exercises are planned to help ready the new team for a terrorist strike or other national security crisis. Mr. Obama said Wednesday that he had instructed his staff to follow the example set by President George W. Bush in 2008 and provide a professional and smooth transition for Mr. Trump\u2019s team, despite the vast policy differences that separate the president and his successor. For all the public drama and division of the presidential campaign, in private, Mr. Obama\u2019s aides have since July been quietly working with advisers to both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump to plan for the passing of power.

Ryan doesn\u2019t, and deflected a question about it Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do a press conference here,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But they do agree on dismantling Obamacare right away.\u00a0 Cordial, but awkward: Trump and Obama meet \u201cThey can start as soon as January, they can start as soon as spring,\u201d said former GOP Senate aide Christopher Condeluci, who said Republicans will move to repeal the law first. Then debate how to replace it. \u201cCongressional Republicans and the Trump administration will pursue some kind of transition period. Is it one year? Is it two years? That remains to be seen. But immediately people are not going to lose their insurance,\u201d Condeluci said.\u00a0 Democrats picked up a few seats in the House and Senate, but still won\u2019t wield much power in the new Washington. Senator Elizabeth Warren told a union group she is gearing up for a new reality. \u201cWe will stand up to bigotry. No compromises ever on this one,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this. Not now. Not ever.\u201d Her colleague Bernie Sanders argued Democrats need to do some self-reflection as well. He tweeted this evening that the party needs to be more focused on grassroots America than, as he put it, wealthy people attending cocktail parties.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
