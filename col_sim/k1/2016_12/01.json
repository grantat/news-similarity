    "text": "Beware: Searching for these popular celebs on the internet could leave you vulnerable to hackers This specific malware, nicknamed Gooligan, has been steadily infecting older versions of Android devices since August of this year; Check Point estimates that 13,000 new devices continue to be breached daily.\u00a0 Once it lives on a user\u2019s Android device, Gooligan exploits known vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to install other apps and malicious software without users\u2019 permission. Using that foothold, attackers can steal users\u2019 email addresses and authentication tokens in order to dive deeper into their extensive personal data stored across Google: Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, etc., Check Point said. \u201cIf you download an infected app ... it gets in under the operating system and gives it access to your Google account, which is tied into your Android phone because Android is from Google, and your Google account is from Google, so you\u2019ve kind of handed them [hackers] the keys to the store,\u201d CNET editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News. Ackerman said only about 20 percent of Android devices are running the latest software updates, so many users are vulnerable when flaws emerge in older versions. Check Point set up a website where individuals can enter the emails associated with their Android devices to check if their Google accounts were breached. If that\u2019s the case, Check Point recommends users immediately install a new operating system and change their Google passwords. Check Point reached out to Google\u2019s security team after uncovering the malware and has been working with Google to investigate the massive breach.\u00a0 \u201cAs always, we take these investigations very seriously and we wanted to share details about our findings and the actions we\u2019ve taken so far,\u201d Adrian Ludwig, Google\u2019s director of Android security, said in a statement \u00a0confirming Check Point\u2019s findings.\u00a0 Check Point Software Technologies Ludwig outlined the steps Google has taken against this latest threat, which include strengthening security to block Android users from installing unverified apps from outside Google Play; deleting apps associated with the malware from affected devices and from Google Play; and working with internet service providers to take down the infrastructure that supports the malware.\u00a0 Google has contacted all the users known so far to be affected, the company said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Governor Bruce Rauner speaks to the media in Alsip, Ill., on Oct.\u00a05, 2016. (Gary Middendorf / Daily Southtown) Privacy Policy As lawmakers prepare to wrap up the fall session, Exelon and ComEd on Wednesday announced an agreement with Gov. Bruce Rauner to raise rates on consumers to help two struggling nuclear power plants. The last-minute attempt to resolve the long-festering electricity issue came on a day the Republican governor and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan continued to try to position the other guy to take the blame over the lack of a state budget. All of which sets up the prospect of lawmakers going home for the year on Thursday after voting to bail out the power companies but failing to approve a state budget. A temporary spending plan to keep universities and social service programs afloat is set to expire come January. While Exelon and subsidiary ComEd issued a news release that profusely thanked Rauner for his office's \"input\" on the \"historic energy bill,\" no floor votes were taken Wednesday. Democrats want assurances that Republicans will put up some votes to pass the bill, which would raise rates to prevent the closure of plants in Downstate Clinton and the Quad Cities. As often happens at the Capitol, lawmakers likely will be asked to approve a complex, lengthy regulatory bill without much time to digest the fine print. A final version wasn't expected to surface until Thursday. Illinois legislature , the power companies say they are paring the bill even further. The most recent changes would trim below 25 cents the average monthly increase... A week after ComEd and Exelon dropped some of the most contentious provisions of a controversial energy bill making its way through the Illinois legislature , the power companies say they are paring the bill even further. The most recent changes would trim below 25 cents the average monthly increase... (Ally Marotti) Exelon says the agreement would limit rate increases to 25 cents a month for ComEd residential customers. It also would limit increases on commercial customers to a 1.3 percent increase over 2015 rates, though officials noted actual bills will fluctuate from month to month. Opponents said the rate caps weren't strong enough. A coalition of businesses and government groups against the bill questioned the utility's math, estimating the average consumer bill will spike by more than $4 a month. Dave Lundy, spokesman for Better Energy Solutions for Tomorrow, said the utility was using a complex formula to get to the 25-cent average by assuming customers will see future savings after it puts in place various energy efficiency programs, which consumers will be required to foot the bill for up front. Attorney General Lisa Madigan 's office said late Wednesday that it needed more time to review the bill before taking a position, noting the fast pace at which the legislation was evolving. \"While we are encouraged that there are rate caps, we also know from hard experience that the devil is in the details,\" said Susan Satter, assistant attorney general in the Public Utilities Bureau. \"This is a wildly complicated effort and we just simply have not had the time to understand how it will work or even if it is workable in it's current form.\" Rauner's office would not comment publicly late Wednesday, but aides indicated on background that the governor will sign the bill if it passes. Bruce Rauner 's administration criticized aspects of a controversial and potentially costly energy bill, the power companies pushing the legislation on Tuesday dropped some of its most problematic provisions. ComEd gave up on its attempt to use the measure \u2014 whose primary... Hours after Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's administration criticized aspects of a controversial and potentially costly energy bill, the power companies pushing the legislation on Tuesday dropped some of its most problematic provisions. ComEd gave up on its attempt to use the measure \u2014 whose primary... (Kim Geiger) The quick movement speaks to the big influence of the power companies in the Capitol. Exelon and ComEd gave more than $1.2 million to state campaigns since the beginning of 2015, and an army of lobbyists were hired to fight for, or against, the proposal. What has emerged is a stripped-down version of a sweeping measure that at one time also included subsidies for Downstate coal plants. That was abandoned, along with a controversial provision that would have changed how customers are charged for their monthly energy use. That plan would have allowed billing based on an average of a customer's top 30 minutes of usage on weekdays. Under the still-developing legislation, the utilities would collect about $235 million annually from customers for the nuclear power plant subsidy, instead of the $285 million called for in the previous versions of the legislation. The adjustment would allow ComEd to spend about $400 million annually on energy efficiency, down from the original $500 million. The company says it currently spends about $240 million a year. The energy legislation appeared to be the one area ripe for agreement between Rauner-led Republicans and Democrats who control the General Assembly . Rauner doesn't want to be blamed for the loss of jobs associated with the plants closing, while Democrats want to appease unions who support the legislation. Meanwhile, both sides continued to dig in on a state budget. Another meeting between Rauner and legislative leaders failed to produce any progress toward a resolution. (Kim Geiger) Madigan emerged from the hour-and-a-half-long session to repeat his stance that a budget deal could be reached only if Rauner followed the \"framework\" for other emergency spending measures. That's Madigan's way of saying he won't consider the economic agenda items Rauner has made a condition of a larger budget deal. Instead, Democrats pushed for a re-examination of the state's financial footing given recent changes that have made fixing the state's money problems more difficult, including a decision by the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System to lower assumed stock market returns. That leaves the state on the hook for an additional $400 million to $500 million a year, while a recent change to the Illinois Constitution approved by voters would prevent the state from being able to dip into money earmarked for transportation to fill budget holes. While both sides have long said a combination of tax increases and budget cuts will be needed to help balance the books, Madigan tried to flip the script Wednesday. The long-serving speaker suggested the first-term governor's push for a deal in the coming weeks is an effort to muscle though a tax increase during the lame-duck session \u2014 the couple of weeks in January when lawmakers who did not win re-election could take tough votes on their way out the door. Madigan twice referred to the \"Rauner lame-duck tax increase\" before allowing a House vote on a symbolic resolution that declares the chamber is opposed to any lame-duck tax increase that might pop up. The measure was sponsored by Rep. David McSweeney, a Republican from Barrington Hills who has staunchly opposed tax increases. Similar legislation that would overhaul the Illinois Constitution to permanently bar such lame-duck tax increases could come up for a House vote Thursday. Madigan voted against the anti-tax resolution, but calling the measure for a vote allowed him to provide some political cover for Democrats who already are being targeted by Republicans in 2018. Among them was Rep. Jerry Costello , of Smithton, near St. Louis, who voted in favor. Republicans were quick to note that it was Democrats who pushed through a 67 percent increase in the income tax rate in 2011. Portions of that increase expired in 2015, a rollback Rauner supported during his bid for office. \"What is going on in the House today is more political theater, it's not substantive,\" House Republican leader Jim Durkin said. Rauner has said he is open to raising taxes, but only if Democrats approve his economic wish list as part of a comprehensive budget agreement. But facing continued resistance from Democrats, Rauner raised the possibility that he could agree to another stopgap bill but only if Democrats agree to term limits and a property tax freeze. Madigan, who was first elected in 1970, argues term limits already exist in the form of elections. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com ",

UCLA student Yesenia Capellino lends her voice during a rally for the Dream Act on the lawn of Marco Antonio Firebaugh High School in Lynwood on July 28, 2011. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Teresa Watanabe The University of California announced sweeping actions Wednesday to protect its students who came into the country illegally, saying it would refuse to assist federal immigration agents, turn over confidential records without court orders or supply information for any national registry based on race, national origin or religion. \u00a0\u201cWhile we still do not know what policies and practices the incoming federal administration may adopt, given the many public pronouncements made during the presidential campaign and its aftermath, we felt it necessary to reaffirm that UC will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our community have the right to work, study, and live safely and without fear at all UC locations,\u201d UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement. Napolitano\u00a0said the university\u00a0would \u201cvigorously protect the privacy and civil rights of the undocumented members of the UC community.\u201d The policies, described as a statement of principles, mark the first unified approach toward federal immigration issues for\u00a0the system\u2019s 10 campuses, according to UC spokeswoman Dianne Klein. Napolitano formed a task force to examine possible actions shortly after\u00a0the presidential election of Donald Trump stirred widespread unease and uncertainty on campuses.\u00a0UC does not track students\u2019 immigration status but says about 3,700 have obtained in-state tuition benefits under AB 540, a 2001 law designed to help those in the country illegally.\u00a0 The UC president announced the new policies a day after\u00a0she and the heads of the California State University and California Community Colleges sent a joint letter to President-elect Trump urging him to allow students without legal status to continue their educations. Trump, during his campaign, had said he would reverse an Obama administration\u00a0program Napolitano created as Homeland Security secretary\u00a0that deferred deportation proceedings against certain young people who stayed in school and out of trouble. That program has\u00a0helped nearly 720,000 young people nationally and 214,000 in California apply for work permits and continue their studies without fear of deportation. The new policies heartened students such as\u00a0Benyamin bin Mohd Yusof, who was brought illegally to the country from Brunei when he was 2 years old and is now a senior at UC Berkeley studying molecular cellular biology and South and Southeast Asian studies. He said he has felt unsafe since Trump\u2019s election, which he said showed that millions of Americans supported \u201cviolent and dehumanizing rhetoric about undocumented immigrants like myself.\u201d \u00a0 While the UC protections will help him, he said, he worried about those not able to benefit from them. \u201cWhere will that protection be for my mother and brother?\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe have to do more for undocumented students and others everywhere.\u201d Among the new UC principles:\u00a0 Campus police will not assist local, state or federal agents to investigate, detain or arrest\u00a0students for violations of federal immigration law. Police\u00a0also will be told not to contact, detain, question or arrest individuals solely on suspicion of immigration violations.\u00a0 No confidential student records will be released without a judicial warrant, subpoena or court order unless authorized by the student or required by law. UC will continue to admit all eligible students without regard to immigration status and take the same stance in treatment of\u00a0patients at its medical centers. \u00a0 University police should use\u00a0their limited resources to build\u00a0community trust and a \u201csafe and secure environment\u201d on campus rather than to\u00a0assist in immigration cases, which is a federal responsibility, the statement said. Campus police also will decline requests by federal immigration agents to detain any individuals unless their assistance is required by law or the individuals are wanted for serious or violent felonies. The California attorney general has concluded that compliance with such requests is voluntary. In addition, UC will not cooperate with any effort to\u00a0compile a federal registry\u00a0of selected groups of people \u2014 such as one for Muslims, suggested by Trump during his campaign. \u201cA federal effort to create a registry based on any protected characteristics \u2026 would be antithetical to the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, federal and state laws, and principles of nondiscrimination that guide our university,\u201d the statement said. Earlier this month, Cal State\u00a0 affirmed that it\u00a0would not help local, state or federal authorities enforce federal immigration law. \u00a0 ",

Here is what we know about the 53-year-old. USA TODAY NETWORK Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, shown in a Trump Tower interview in Nov. 2016. (Photo: ALBIN LOHR-JONES / POOL, EPA) Americans should expect\u00a0the \"largest tax change since Reagan,\" with federal tax cuts for average income earners as well as U.S.businesses, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary said Wednesday. \"There will be a tax cut for the middle class,\" banker, movie producer\u00a0and former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin told CNBC's Squawk Box in his first public comments on the incoming administration's economic priorities. \"Any tax cuts that we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions to pay for it.\" Tax deductions for charitable contributions would still be allowed, he said. There would be a cap on mortgage interest payments, though \u00a0\"some deductibility\" would continue, said Mnuchin. The proposed changes also include\u00a0cutting\u00a0the nation's 35% top business tax rate to 15%, along with an effort to encourage\u00a0repatriation of the estimated $1 trillion that large U.S. corporations hold in foreign\u00a0subsidiaries to avoid the domestic tax bite. Trump has proposed a special 10% rate on overseas funds\u00a0the companies shift back to the U.S. \"We think by cutting corporate taxes we'll create huge economic growth and we'll have huge\u00a0personal income, so the revenues will be offset on the other side,\" Mnuchin said in the interview. The changes should help increase sustained U.S. economic growth, he predicted. \"I think we can absolutely get to sustained 3% to 4% GDP. And that is absolutely critical to the country,\" Mnuchin said. \"To get there, our No. 1 priority is tax reform. This will be the largest tax change since Reagan.\" The proposals echo some proposals\u00a0Trump outlined during his campaign. However, the claim that any tax cuts for the wealthy would be offset with fewer reductions appeared\u00a0to conflict\u00a0with the formal tax plan of the New York City businessman. Although Trump said his economic team projected\u00a03.5% GDP growth over the next decade during a September speech at the Economic Club of New York, he also told the gathering, \"I think we can do better than that.\" Bank tied to Trump adviser accused of discrimination Some tax experts voiced cautious optimism about the proposals, even as they cautioned about a potential repeat of the federal deficit increases that followed the Reagan tax system overhaul in 1981. Slashing the corporate tax rate and allowing businesses to expense capital investments in the year they're made could make 3% to 4% GDP growth \"a reasonable goal,\" said Robert Goulder, senior tax policy counsel for Tax Analysts, a non-partisan\u00a0publisher focused on tax policy and administration. However, capping mortgage tax deductions and other cost-saving proposals, such as reducing or eliminating deductions for state and local taxes, could prove politically difficult, said Goulder. Others have tried such plans and failed, he said,\u00a0citing the federal tax reforms proposed in 2014 by then-congressman David Camp, R-Mich. \"Where are the spending cuts? Where are the federal entitlement reforms?\" asked Goulder. \"Can we run up a larger deficit without having negative effects that outweigh the positives of pro-growth tax plans?\" Cutting the corporate\u00a0tax rate will generate more investments, factory growth and jobs, said\u00a0Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at\u00a0the Cato Institute, a public policy group focused on limited government and free markets. However, referring to personal income taxes, Edwards\u00a0predicted it would be \"difficult to ensure that everyone gets a break.\" Follow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc 721 CONNECT TWEET 12 LINKEDIN 280 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gKO81G ",

By Drew Harwell November 30 at 4:45 PM Follow @drewharwell Donald Trump delivers a policy speech during a campaign stop on June 28 in Monessen, Pa. (Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) President-elect Donald J. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he would soon leave his \u201cgreat business in total\u201d to focus on the presidency, a response to growing worries over the businessman-in-chief\u2019s\u00a0conflicts of interest\u00a0around the globe. Shortly after, the official Twitter account of the Office of Government Ethics, the traditionally staid federal agency that often works closely with presidential transition teams, issued a rapid-fire series of tweets celebrating that Trump had committed to fully divesting his company stake \u2014 though Trump has publicly said no such thing. The back-to-back tweetstorms raised more questions than they answered: whether Trump\u2019s move would focus on severing his\u00a0ownership ties, or simply his management responsibilities; and whether the OGE was releasing new information or simply the victim of a hacker, prankster or official gone rogue. The OGE\u2019s messages were deeply out of character for a federal ethics agency that is\u00a0famously quiet and unadventurous. Among the nine tweets: \u201c@realDonaldTrump Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!\u201d The tweets were first posted Wednesday morning, then deleted within an hour. They then reappeared at 1 p.m.,\u00a0for unknown reasons. In a 1:30 p.m. statement from the OGE\u2019s email account, attributed to OGE spokesman Seth Jaffe, the agency said, \u201cLike everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect\u2019s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don\u2019t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.\u201d A second statement at 3:30 p.m. added, \u201cThe tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE\u2019s tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect\u2019s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\u201d Phone messages left with a dozen agency executives and representatives seeking verification or more details were not returned. OGE lawyers have\u00a0been influential in past presidents\u2019\u00a0decision making, but their advice\u00a0has almost always been kept confidential. If nothing else, the OGE\u2019s tweets have publicly revealed federal-ethics officials\u2019 preference for the president-elect to completely divest \u2014 a form of lobbying that is potentially unprecedented for the agency. The messages surprised many who had worked with the agency in the past: Brett Kappel, a Washington campaign-finance lawyer who has worked with OGE, said the agency \u201cnever tweets about an individual federal official\u2019s ethics issues unless they are announcing the conclusion of an enforcement action.\u201d . @realDonaldTrump this divestiture does what handing over control could never have done. \u2014 U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016 The tweets followed\u00a0Trump\u2019s morning announcement, which appeared to echo his long insistence that he would cede the company\u2019s management to his children, a way of putting distance\u00a0between\u00a0his private interests and public power. But\u00a0it remained unclear whether the new arrangement would include a full sale of Trump\u2019s stake in the company. Ethics advisers said a management hand-off to his children would not resolve worries that the business could still influence his\u00a0decisions in the Oval Office. \u201cI will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my\u00a0great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Trump tweeted . \u201cWhile I am not mandated to\u00a0do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.\u00a0Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus on Nov. 20 addressed Trump's potential conflicts of interest. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [ A scramble to assess the dangers of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s global business empire ] Presidents are not bound by the strict conflict-of-interest laws\u00a0governing most U.S. elected officials. But most modern presidents have agreed to sell or sequester their assets in a blind trust, led by an independent manager with supreme control,\u00a0in order to keep past business deals, investments and relationships from influencing their White House term. Giving company management to his adult children \u2014 Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka \u2014 would still leave open the potential for Trump to make presidential decisions for their benefit. The children have already played a key part in Trump\u2019s governing preparations, serving on the\u00a0transition team now selecting key appointees and sitting in on meetings with foreign heads of state. Trump spokespeople did not immediately return requests for more details on the move.\u00a0But Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said the move\u00a0did not appear to offer enough of a division to keep entanglement worries at bay. \u201cThat\u2019s business operations, not ownership. The problem is, we need to resolve the conflicts of interest that arise from his ownership. And we\u2019re hearing nothing about how that\u2019s getting resolved,\u201d Painter said. \u201cEven if he does not operate the businesses, you\u2019re going to have lots of people working for the business running around the world trying to cut deals,\u201d Painter added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s critical that none of those people discuss U.S. business in a way that could be interpreted, or misinterpreted, of offering quid pro quo \u2026 or soliciting a bribe on the part of the president.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s presidency, overseas business deals and relations with foreign governments could all become intertwined ] If Trump\u2019s family does take over management of the business, Norman Eisen, the chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama from 2009 to 2011, said an \u201cethics firewall\u201d would need to be put in place to combat the\u00a0\u201crisk of improper preferential relationships and\u00a0treatment for the Trump Organization with the United States government and foreign ones.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman\u00a0Reince Priebus\u00a0said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he was not \u201cready to reveal\u201d whether the move would\u00a0include Trump truly severing ties to his business or whether he would simply leave the day-to-day operations to his kids. \u201cIt\u2019s not the easiest thing to work out,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWhat you see in those tweets is the person at the top that understands and is willing and showing the American people that he\u2019s working hard on it and he\u2019s taking it seriously.\u201d Others in the president-elect\u2019s orbit have shared little more on his plan. Asked Wednesday if he would take over the business, Eric Trump said, while walking through Trump Tower, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear it soon enough.\u201d Asked how the new arrangement would be set up, Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition team\u2019s executive committee, said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to steal Mr. Trump\u2019s or the children\u2019s thunder on that, so let\u2019s wait for Dec. 15.\u201d He added, \u201cAt age 70, after having this phenomenal life and building this phenomenal business in this great tower, he\u2019s going to be a hundred percent focused on working for the American people and for the United States.\u201d The weeks since Trump\u2019s electoral victory have been marked by a series of entanglements between his private ventures and public ambitions. Trump welcomed a group of Indian business executives to meet with him and his family at Trump Tower, where talk turned to the potential for new real-estate deals. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, who will likely play a key part in running the company, met with\u00a0Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u00a0during Trump\u2019s first meeting as president-elect with a foreign government leader. His\u00a0company, the Trump Organization, has over the years sealed lucrative real-estate and branding deals for business in at least 18 countries and territories\u00a0across the world, including in places\u00a0where the U.S. has sensitive diplomatic ties, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and India. Trump\u2019s company is also pitching foreign diplomats on his new luxury hotel in Washington as a place to book rooms and hold meetings. But such entreaties eventually could run afoul of an \u201cemoluments\u201d clause in the U.S. Constitution that bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign leaders \u2014 even if he is not actively running the company. Eric Trump also traveled to Turkey this week to hunt wild deer at the invitation of a Turkish businessman, according to\u00a0Turkish newspaper Hurriyet.\u00a0Trump\u2019s company has made millions off\u00a0licensing the name to Trump Towers Istanbul,\u00a0a luxury project in a country under close scrutiny by U.S. diplomats. Buffeted by entanglement worries,\u00a0Trump has largely dug in, arguing \u201cthe law\u2019s totally on my side, meaning, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest\u201d last week in an interview with the New York Times. \u201cIn theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don\u2019t care about my business.\u201d [ A running list of how Donald Trump\u2019s new position may be helping his business interests ] Peter Schweizer, a conservative author\u00a0who raised alarms in the book \u201cClinton Cash\u201d about Hillary Clinton\u2019s possible conflicts of interest because of\u00a0donations to her family\u2019s foundation, said Trump will face an equally skeptical public, not just about his entanglements but those of his children as well. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on the president of the United States, particularly one who is seemingly committed to \u2018draining the swamp,\u2019 to remove any questions about financial transactions involving him or his family,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Schweizer, who is also close to Trump senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who served as chairman of the Government Accountability Institute, where Schweizer is president. \u201cForeign entities look at family members as a route to gaining influence and getting special favors. It\u2019s not a question of if it\u2019s going to happen \u2014 it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0The best thing he could do is set up mechanisms now to avoid those pitfalls that invariably\u00a0surround presidential families.\u201d He suggested both\u00a0Trump and his adult children\u00a0voluntarily submit to quarterly in-depth disclosures about their financial holdings and major Trump Organization financial transactions, even though the law does not require it. He also proposed that Trump\u2019s charitable foundation cease accepting donations from non-family members and that Trump\u2019s children agree they will not accept paid speaking engagements for fees larger than those they were paid before their father was elected president. Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s domestic policy chief and helped guide his transition to the White House, called Trump\u2019s announcement today \u201can important first step showing that he recognizes the concerns of the press and the public.\u201d Eizenstat recalled that Jimmy Carter put his interest in a peanut warehouse in a blind trust before inauguration day and that Carter agreed to recuse himself from discussion of Agriculture Department policy towards peanuts and limit his involvement in sugar \u2014 the latter playing a critical role in the fortunes of Coca-Cola, a leading home state industry. Trump presents a unique challenge from an ethics perspective because of his wide ranging business interests and because his name is used so widely in pursuit of those interests around the globe. \u201cWe are navigating in uncharted waters,\u201d Eizenstat said. Eizenstat, who also held several major positions in the Clinton administration,\u00a0 said the blind trust approach might be unworkable for Trump given those wide-ranging interests, his name brand on his companies and the active involvement of his children in the business. He spoke approvingly of the idea of an independent monitor as a possible way to reassure the public. But he said that a monitor can be cumbersome and expensive. Given those hurdles, the best way to deal with the public policy challenges of Trump\u2019s vast business portfolio may be to simply encourage \u201ca free and unfettered press\u201d to investigate Trump\u2019s holdings and potential conflicts \u2014 along with his disclosure statements. \u201cThe power of a free press is what separates our country from non-Democratic countries and the vibrancy of the press would be the best instrument\u201d to deal with Trump\u2019s international holdings and the constitutional prohibition against his receiving favors from foreign leaders.\u00a0 In addition, Eizenstat said that Trump\u2019s honesty and credibility in discussing his holdings is critical. \u201cIn the end, he is going to want to be sure that he is seen by the public as a president animated by the national interest,\u201d Eizenstat said. \u201cI am hopeful he will meet that standard.\u201d Michael Toner, who served as general counsel to the Bush-Cheney transition in 2000, recalled the 10-week post-election period as a time for setting broad ethical policy \u2014 and considering specific safeguards for the incoming president \u2014 that would set the tone for the incoming administration. At the time of the Kennedy-Johnson transition, Lyndon Johnson separated himself from the Texas radio stations he operated, drawing up new ownership documents putting his wife, Lady Bird, in charge and removing himself, at least officially, from the company\u2019s operations. After his election in 1976, Jimmy Carter set up elaborate arrangements to remove himself from the family peanut business, its management and knowledge of day to day decisions. For decades incoming presidents and vice presidents have used the inaugural period to meet with federal ethics officials to take steps, such as setting up blind trusts, to remove themselves from their previous business activities and investments. The idea, Toner and others said, is to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. One of Trump\u2019s most visible potential entanglements, even under a potentially new business arrangement, would be\u00a0Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., the new luxury hotel he opened in the White House\u2019s backyard. Charging his children with running the Trump Organization also does not necessarily protect against potential contractual or constitutional violations his presidency may trigger in regards to his D.C. hotel, legal experts say.\u00a0Trump remains the majority owner of the project, which the company leases from the federal government. Trump opened the hotel this fall after spending $42 million of his own money and borrowing another $170 million to foot the cost of construction. There is a provision in the lease allowing Trump to sell or transfer his stake in the hotel to \u201cany Trump Family Member.\u201d Selling it to an outside entity would likely require approval by the General Services Administration. If Trump chooses not to sell, his ownership stake could create two problems once he steps into office. A boilerplate 88-word lease measure may require that the government terminate the deal because it bars \u201can elected official of the Government of the United States\u201d from having \u201cany share or part of this Lease.\u201d [ For foreign diplomats, Trump hotel is place to be ] Procurement experts Steven L. Schooner and Daniel I. Gordon have argued the GSA ought to terminate its deal with Trump because of that clause, writing in The Post a week after the election that \u201chaving the president\u2019s adult children negotiate with the staff of the president\u2019s appointee at GSA presents what any reasonable person would view as the appearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d Schooner, a George Washington University law professor, said in an email Monday that he worried GSA officials wouldn\u2019t terminate the lease out of risk of financial penalties or \u201cintimidation\u201d from the incoming president. But Steven J. Kelman, a former administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the Office of Management and Budget,\u00a0said the passage may apply only to elected officials at the time of lease negotiations. Even if it\u2019s not a violation of the lease, putting his children in charge would leave them to negotiate with Trump administration officials over the deal going forward.\u00a0The official who oversaw the selection of Trump for the project, Robert A. Peck, said recently that he couldn\u2019t imagine the average federal employee feeling much empowered to negotiate with one of Trump\u2019s children while they also advised their father in the White House, if he holds on to the property. \u201cIt would be one thing if his kids ran the business, if his kids didn\u2019t also want to be White House advisers,\u201d Peck said. \u201cBut even then, the specter of some \u2026 contracting officers sitting across the table from Eric Trump. How does that feel?\u201d Rosalind S. Helderman, Jonathan O\u2019Connell and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. business ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times Every president in the past four decades, Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter noted, has taken personal holdings he had before being elected and put them into a blind trust in which the assets were controlled by an independent party. If Mr. Trump were willing to sell his assets, one option would be to seek a certificate of divestiture from the Office of Government Ethics, which would allow him to sell his real estate holdings and other businesses with an enormous tax advantage. This system was set up to allow wealthy Americans to take jobs in the government and avoid conflicts of interest without a large financial impact. It allows incoming government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on any earnings on the investment. This could generate an enormous windfall for Mr. Trump, given his vast real estate holdings. After Henry Paulson was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as Treasury secretary, he left a job at Goldman Sachs and took advantage of this provision , avoiding conflicts of interest by selling an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock. Money generated from the liquidation of Mr. Trump\u2019s assets would have to be invested in \u201cpermitted property,\u201d which is limited to Treasury bonds or diversified mutual funds, ending the real estate ventures that are so tied to the Trump family\u2019s identity. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, that is what the Office of Government Ethics has said he should do. The office is normally a staid, low-profile agency that rarely talks to reporters on the record, but Wednesday\u2019s Twitter posts were strangely enthusiastic. The series of nine posts suggested that officials were celebrating what they thought was a decision by Mr. Trump to accept their legal advice. In their posts, officials at the ethics agency referred to a 1983 legal opinion in which the office urged presidents to \u201cconduct themselves as if they were\u201d bound by conflict of interest laws, even though such laws do not apply to occupants of the Oval Office. . @realDonaldTrump this aligns with OGE opinion that POTUS should act as if 18 USC 208 applies. https://t.co/T6nNUPxFwp \u2014         U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) Nov. 30, 2016 In a statement, Seth Jaffe, an agency spokesman, said that officials there were \u201cexcited\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s announcements on conflicts of interest and that the messages were not based on any information about the president-elect\u2019s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. Asked later about the disclosure of the advice that the Office of Government Ethics had given to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, Mr. Jaffe said he could not provide additional comment. But the agency has left the posts on its official government account. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest List. Officials for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment about the disclosures from the agency. And Reince Priebus, who will be the White House chief of staff, said on the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he was not ready to provide any more information about the legal discussions. \u201cYou should know that he\u2019s got the best people in the world working on it,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. In fact, the president-elect\u2019s plan to deal with conflicts remains unclear. Simply removing Mr. Trump from day-to-day control of business decisions could still allow him to benefit financially from payments made to his companies by foreign governments, which may be prohibited by the so-called Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, Mr. Eisen said. And Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts said nothing about whether his children, who serve as advisers on his presidential transition committee, would continue to have roles in his administration. If Mr. Trump\u2019s business is run by his children, they must be entirely separated from government operations, Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter said. That means they could not participate in meetings with world leaders, like the prime minister of Japan, as Ivanka Trump did this month . Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWithout an ethics firewall that is set up at once and continues into the administration, scandal is sure to follow,\u201d Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter said in their statement. Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately questioned on Wednesday whether Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts indicated a significant change in his plans, and called for a formal investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. A letter sent by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and signed by 15 other Democrats on the committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s posts raised \u201ca number of questions,\u201d including whether Mr. Trump intends to transfer ownership of his assets. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump emphasized the appearances he would need to maintain as president, saying he believed it was \u201cvisually important\u201d to avoid conflicts between his role as the head of government and his businesses.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 30, 2016 Mr. Trump insisted, as he has before, that he is not legally required to take any steps to divest himself of his financial ties. In an interview with The Times last week, he said, \u201cThe law is totally on my side, meaning the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest.\u201d He also said in the interview, \u201cI would like to try and formalize something, because I don\u2019t care about my business.\u201d Divesting could be costly and complicated. \u201cThat\u2019s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cSelling real estate isn\u2019t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different.

Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters confirmed three new deaths at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. No identities were released because the victims' families hadn't been notified. \"We certainly want to pray for those families, the folks involved in the fatalities,\" Waters said. \"We continue to try to identity them. We haven't been able to yet.\" A firefighter suffered minor injuries, and 53 people have been treated at LaConte Medical Center, Waters said. He didn't know the conditions of the patients, but he said \"many of those have been released.\" The remains of a home smolder Wednesday in the wake of a wildfire in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Brian Blanco / Getty Images Incident commanders said the blazes started with the human-caused Chimney 2 Fire, which was reported in the park a week ago. By Monday, the region's prolonged drought and extreme winds were causing the fire to spit out embers that quickly ignited numerous new fires, they said. Fire commanders said Wednesday night that more than 15,500 acres have been burned in the area, with much of the charred landscape on national parklands. More than 700 structures in Sevier County have been damaged or destroyed, about 300 of them in Gatlinburg, and as many as 14,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes, authorities said. The main fire remained only 10 percent contained, fire commanders said. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime event,\" Waters said. \"This was a perfect storm.\" ",

    "text": "U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR The federal ethics watchdog isn't the kind of agency that typically airs its positions on Twitter \u2014 let alone in a snarky tone, with exclamation points. But it's been an all-around weird day at the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. It started Wednesday morning, when President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to address concerns about his ability to lead the U.S. government while also holding massive business interests around the world. Trump Says He Will Pull Back From Businesses But Offers No Details Yet \"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" Trump tweeted, adding that \"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations\" and that he will be leaving his \"great business in total.\" What exactly that means remains unclear. But the verified Twitter account of the typically decorous federal ethics office chimed in with statements that appeared to goad Trump about divesting his businesses \u2014 something he hasn't specifically promised to do. \"Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!\" the agency tweeted, mimicking Trump's own tweeting style. And: \"OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!\" And then things kept getting weirder. All of the tweets disappeared. Twitter erupted in confusion. Observers were suggesting this was a hack or the work of a rogue employee, as The Washington Post posited : \"Maybe the OGE has inadvertently leaked that Trump intends to sell off his assets, a dramatic move that the president-elect may have intended to save for his 'major news conference' Dec. 15. Maybe the tweets are a hacker's social-media joke. Or maybe an OGE official went rogue with the agency's social-media accounts, as a way to sarcastically poke at Trump or, having misread the news, cheer him on.\" Article continues after sponsorship But then, some hours later, the tweets returned \u2014 re-posted all over again, sending a new wave of confusion. U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR An OGE spokesman, Seth Jaffe, who is the chief of the agency's ethics law and policy branch, emailed a statement to NPR: \"Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect's twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don't know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.\" The statement suggested that the tweets have been deliberate all along. And, in fact, the OGE later confirmed to NPR that this was not a hack. A few things remained a mystery, among them: Did the OGE know something about Trump's plans that he hasn't made public? As NPR's Scott Detrow has reported : \"Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to turn the Trump Organization over to three of his children. But Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump all remain close political advisers and members of his transition team, so it's hard to see how the Trump Organization and the Trump administration would remain separate, if that remains the case.\" Almost two hours after the first statement, the OGE issued another one: \"The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE's tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect's plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\" The agency's officials still haven't answered why the tweets \u2014 if they were deliberate \u2014 initially were deleted. And more fundamentally, why did the usually straitlaced OGE decide to break character and publicly vocalize its opinion? Perhaps it's part of a new, Trump-inspired era of governing and social media. Big league! ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The Associated Press \u00a0(Italian comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo is part of a rising tide of populist leaders on the continent. ) Italians vote Sunday on a series of sweeping reforms, the outcome of which could determine the future of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s rule - but also serve as a gauge for the rising populist movement throughout Europe. If Italians reject the reforms \u2013 which are basically an unofficial plebiscite on the prime minister \u2013 Renzi has vowed to step down, setting up a caretaker government and the chance for the populist comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement to take power in the next election. Italy\u2019s situation is a microcosm of what is happening across Europe, where the political establishment is being challenged by a slew of populist \u2013 and mostly far-right \u2013 politicians who are riding the same anti-establishment anger that earlier this year saw the United Kingdom vote to leave the European Union and the United States elect Donald Trump as president. Mainland Europe\u2019s populist leaders are up in the polls in large part because of their promises to restore flagging economies, reverse the continuing trend of unemployment, stem the flow of migrants from the Middle East and Africa and, in some cases, even leave the EU. \u201cMany of these countries are looking at a series of complex questions, but they want an easy answer,\u201d Michael Geary, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, told FoxNews.com. \u201cPeople are looking for answers and these politicians can take advantage of this because of the political unrest.\u201d Here are some European nations that are experiencing populist uprisings: Italy Expand / Contract Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi could step down from power following a referendum vote. (The Associated Press) Despite Renzi and his center-left government enjoying widespread approval when he came into office in 2014, Italians quickly soured to him as the country continued to struggle economically and unemployment rates remained high. Adding to the fiscal woes, Italy has also been one of the main landing points for migrants from North Africa and many Italians are upset with Renzi\u2019s handling of the crisis, which some see as an open door policy. Mirroring both the campaigns of Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders in the U.S., Grillo and his Five Star Movement have gained a large number of followers by harnessing Italian anger at political elites and frustration over slow economic growth.\u00a0Unlike his fellow populists throughout Europe, however, the ideologically-elusive Grillo has not played into national identity politics the way that more right-wing leaders in places such as France, the Netherlands and Austria have. \u201cGrillo and his movement is a bit more of a response to the economic crisis hitting Italy,\u201d Kimberly Morgan, a political science professor at George Washington University, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s much more of an economic issue and less to do with identity.\u201d With Italians voting on Sunday, most experts predict that Renzi\u2019s reforms will not pass, but it is difficult to tell as before a blackout was imposed ahead of the vote, about a quarter of Italians were still undecided. France Expand / Contract French politician Francois Fillon is a follower of late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. (The Associated Press) Francois Fillon, a socially conservative former prime minister and an adherent of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s economics, looks poised to face the leader of the far-right National Front party, Marine Le Pen, in a run-off election next year. While the two share similar ideologies when it comes to Europe\u2019s migrant crisis \u2013 Fillon has shifted farther right by promising to crack down on immigration and to destroy what he has called \u201ctotalitarian\u201d Islamists \u2013 they differ on how to solve France\u2019s unemployment and economic issues. Unlike Le Pen, Fillon has given no indication that he would push for France to leave the EU and has instead been an ardent advocate of free market capitalism. \u201cFillon picked up a lot of Le Pen\u2019s line on immigration, but he is much more neoliberal when it comes to his economic policies,\u201d Morgan said. With the memory of the Paris and Nice terror attacks still fresh in the minds of many in France, Fillon has also promised to reduce immigration and invest 12 billion euros in security, defense and justice. He has also called for closer ties with Russia in the fight against terrorism and recently penned a book, entitled \u201cBeating Islamic Totalitarianism.\" Germany Expand / Contract German Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for her fourth term in office. (The Associated Press) As Chancellor Angela Merkel runs for a fourth term, the popular leader may face her toughest test yet from a resurgent right-wing led by populist politician Frauke Petry of the Alternative for Germany party. Merkel, who has been described by many as the last defender of the liberal West, has come under fire from opponents who disagree with her insistence on accepting large numbers of Syrian refugees and on Germany\u2019s continued financial support for its faltering southern European neighbors. \u201cPetry has really mobilized a lot Germans with her stance on asylum for refugees,\u201d Morgan said. She added that since World War II, the country has maintained a very open policy toward refugees \u201cas a sort of atonement for their past,\u201d but those attitudes appear to be shifting. Despite the popularity of Petry and the Alternative for Germany\u00a0party, experts say that Merkel still looks poised to maintain her chancellorship. \u201cGermany\u2019s economy is in very good shape under Merkel and that bodes well for her chances of winning reelection,\u201d Morgan said.

Authorities said they are still working on identifying the deceased. The blaze -- which has devastated the cities of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and surrounding areas -- has also injured 53 people, scorched more than 700 homes and forced thousands to evacuate, officials said. SLIDESHOW: SLIDESHOW: Wildfires Devastate Eastern Tennessee Town Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam said that the wildfire is the state's biggest in 100 years. Gov. Haslam spoke with President Obama Wednesday, according to the White House. \"The President expressed his deepest condolences for the lives lost in the fire as well as his sympathies for the affected residents who may have lost their homes or businesses,\" read a statement from the White House. \"The President asked the Governor for an update on the ongoing response, and committed to providing the assistance necessary to combat this fire.\" \"I've never seen anything like this in the county, and we'll never see anything like it again,\" said Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters. The fire was exacerbated on Tuesday by what authorities have described as \"hurricane-force\" winds of up to 87 mph. The heavy winds have presented a challenge to firefighters, who said that fallen trees have limited access to certain areas, according to Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller. Brian Blanco/Getty Images The remains of a van and home smolder in the wake of a wildfire, Nov. 30, 2016 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Though heavy rain helped suppress the fire today, it also presented new challenges, Miller said. Firefighters are now experiencing some rock and mudslides, he said. The fire chief added that unless the rain penetrates deep into the brush fire, there is still a threat. Brian Blanco/Getty Images Smoke fills the air and surrounds businesses and resorts in the wake of a wildfire, Nov. 30, 2016, in downtown Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Over 200 firefighters remained on the ground this morning, according to Miller. Gatlinburg mayor Mike Werner said at a news conference on Tuesday that it was a \"devastating time\" for the city but that its people were \"strong and resilient.\" There are still areas that authorities are trying to reach, Werner said, noting that \"nobody had a clue\" the fire would spread \"that fast.\" Brian Blanco/Getty Images The remains of a business are pictured in the wake of a wildfire, Nov. 30, 2016, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The blaze was \"a scary sight to see,\" he said, adding that \"people were basically running for their lives.\" Officials from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency have said that it is likely that 14,000 residents and visitors have been evacuated from the city of Gatlinburg alone. Numerous roads remain closed and blocked by fallen trees and power lines as a result of the fires, officials said. 0 Shares ",
