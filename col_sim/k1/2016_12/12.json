    "text": "Source: IHS Conflict Monitor (control areas from Dec. 5-Dec. 8) DEC. 10, 2016 By The New York Times Later, Umm Faisal said, she, her husband and two children took a taxi to the rebel-held town of Marea, near the Turkish border. Along the twisting route, they bribed guards at checkpoints and talked their way out of detention by Kurdish militias. Before she left the refugee center, Umm Faisal refused to appear on state television, she said, because \u201cI couldn\u2019t lie on TV.\u201d Others, though, have been filmed thanking Mr. Assad, receiving aid bags marked \u201cHelp from Russia\u201d and saying rebels had earlier prevented them from leaving. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One aid worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said it was unclear how freely civilians in government territory were speaking. But the worker said one man had told her in compelling detail that the rebels refused to let him leave for medical treatment for his young daughter, who was rail thin from a stomach ailment. Separately, a nurse in eastern Aleppo, who spoke on the condition that she not be named, told us that rebels had stopped her parents and others from leaving the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. First, the fighters warned their group that government troops would shoot them, the nurse said. Then they threatened the travelers, asking why they wanted to \u201cgo to those who are bombing you.\u201d \u201cWe are dead either way,\u201d one civilian had replied, the nurse said. Aid workers say the reclaimed areas of east Aleppo are largely destroyed and empty: Very few people stayed as troops moved in. The army took several hundred people back to one district, Hanano, telling them to move into abandoned apartments. But with no electricity, heat or water and many homes looted, some have asked to return to shelters despite the cold, uncomfortable conditions there as aid agencies scramble to catch up. Those who have decided to stay inside eastern Aleppo face continued airstrikes and shelling as people crowd into shrinking areas without medical care. Modar Shekho, a nurse, and his family ran from their house under fire, several of his friends said. As they searched for shelter, a shell killed his brother. As they looked for a place to bury him, the friends said, another explosion killed his father, a teacher who had helped arrange for students to take their state exams despite the siege. It was the second time that Mr. Shekho had lost two members of his family in a single day, according to friends; a brother and sister, a doctor and nurse, died in a hospital bombing in 2013. Given such suffering, rebel groups are arguing. A hard-line minority, including the Qaeda-linked Levant Conquest Front, wants to continue the fight, and the rest, including United States-backed groups, want to make a deal to get civilians out. Some question whether they have already waited too long. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Zohair al-Shimali, a longtime activist, said he and others who had led street protests and later supported rebels had failed to deliver. \u201cPeople started to hate their lives because of us,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is for nothing, we lost everything.\u201d He said that while some rebels were counseling \u201cpatience,\u201d he was ready for any deal, either for rebels to leave in exchange for ending the bombing or to bus civilians out. \u201cPeople have the right to take their children wherever they want, we can\u2019t take them as hostages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t meet the promises we made them.\u201d Infighting and mistrust among rebels have hastened their collapse. During the week, Qaeda-linked fighters attacked United States-backed groups and took their supplies. Dr. Farida, a gynecologist who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, checked off the people around her who planned to leave. \u201cMy only neighbor, my only aunt and uncle, my secretary, my maid, and even my right hand at work are going to the regime areas,\u201d she wrote in a text message. \u201cThey are neutral and just want to live and eat and drink, they don\u2019t care about the revolution and religion. \u201cI feel like I lost a piece of me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Maher Samaan from Paris.

    "text": "Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Is Now Over 2 Million, But Don't Expect Big Changes A statement from his transition team on Friday in response to reports of the CIA assessment said, \"The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history.\" Trump also said in his Fox interview, \"I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country.\" The Short Answer Trump contends that the size of his victory was historic, which is not borne out by the results. Trump won 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232. That comfortably puts him above the required 270 electoral votes. But it's hard to argue this represents a landslide of historic proportions, given that out of 58 presidential elections, the winner has received more electoral votes in 37 contests. The Long Answer Trump's win is historic, but mainly because it was so unexpected. He was outpaced by Hillary Clinton on nearly every conventional metric applied to how a successful campaign is run. Trump was counted out by nearly every political professional, and most of the media. Even his own campaign allies were expecting a loss. So the voters delivered a truly historic upset on Election Day. By that measure, Trump's statement about \"one of the greatest defeats\" holds up. Comparing Trump's 306 electoral votes to recent history, he falls between the 2000 and 2004 razor-thin margins of George W. Bush, and Barack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012. 2000 \u2014 Bush 271, Gore 266 2004 \u2014 Bush 286, Kerry 251 2008 \u2014 Obama 365, McCain 173 2012 \u2014 Obama 332, Romney 206 2016 \u2014 Trump 306, Clinton 232 Article continues after sponsorship So on the historic score, Trump's margin is pretty average for recent elections, and way down the list if you go all the way back to the beginning of the nation. Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, recently calculated the electoral college margins in all 58 U.S. presidential elections, and showed Trump coming in 46th. Separately, there's the question of whether Trump's victory is a \"landslide.\" President Obama is sometimes said to have achieved \"electoral landslides,\" but that is even stretching historical standards. Clear landslides came most recently in the 1980s. Ronald Reagan won 489 electoral votes to Jimmy Carter's 49 in the 1980 election. Four years later, Reagan won 49 states, delivering him a 525 to 13 victory of Walter Mondale. In 1988, George H.W. Bush succeeded Reagan with a total of 426 electoral votes to Michael Dukakis's 111. Each of those Reagan and Bush victories came with an 8 to 9 percent margin in the popular vote, as icing on the cake. Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton by about 2.8 million votes. There have been five presidents who lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College. Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections hide caption toggle caption Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections To be certain, Trump's win the Electoral College is what matters. But his loss in the popular vote to Hillary Clinton is itself historic. At 2.8 million votes, Trump's deficit is by far the largest for any candidate who won the Electoral College and lost the popular vote. ",

    "text": "Lesley Stahl: Saudi Arabia? Benjamin Netanyahu: No comment. Lesley Stahl: I have to ask you, because it\u2019s the most fascinating of all: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are you actually developing an anti-Iran alliance in the Middle East? Benjamin Netanyahu: Doesn\u2019t have to be developed. It\u2019s there anyway. Israel is developing a whole skein of new alliances, in some cases with countries that have been challenging the U.S. around the world like Russia which has placed its troops in Syria, Israel\u2019s next door neighbor. Lesley Stahl: How would you describe your relationship with Russia right now? Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s amicable. But the minute Mr. Putin decided to put his military forces in Syria, I went to see him.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLook, here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \u00a0I\u2019m not intervening in Syria. But at the same time, if Syria tries to intervene with us, if Iran tries to use Syria to attack us, we\u2019ll stop it. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re telling Mr. Putin that you will attack if you\u2019re attacked? Benjamin Netanyahu: I said, \u201cWe should avoid this.\u201d\u00a0 And he said \u201cI agree.\u201d\u00a0 So we coordinated between our militaries because no one wants an inadvertent Israeli-Russian clash. Lesley Stahl: You have a friendship with Mr. Putin, and a friendship with China. You seem to be inching toward an anti-American bloc. Benjamin Netanyahu: God, no.\u00a0 Let me tell you something\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Well, talk about that \u2018cause I think there\u2019s an impression of that. Benjamin Netanyahu: That\u2019s a false impression.\u00a0 First of all, there is, there is an irreplaceable ally.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the United States of America. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but here you are making friends with our adversaries\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: So no. You have relations with Russia and you have relations with China. We can have relations, economic relations, trade relations with other countries as you do.\u00a0 Why not? He has used economic and trade relations to improve Israel\u2019s standing in the world by selling and in some cases giving away its high-tech inventions. Israel boasts of more start-ups per capita than anywhere in the world, many based in Be\u2019er Sheva, and nations have lined up to buy drones, as India has, and cutting-edge agricultural technology, as China has. There\u2019s excitement about a new innovation that extracts drinking water out of air.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So this is Israeli diplomacy through technology? Benjamin Netanyahu: Exactly right. Lesley Stahl: Countries that used to vote against you regularly at the U.N., are now your clients. I mean African nations - . Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s a revolution there.\u00a0 We can\u2019t keep up. What\u2019s surprising is that he\u2019s making progress with all these countries without making any progress with the Palestinians, who\u2019ve lived under Israeli occupation in the West Bank for half a century. Lesley Stahl: What about the quality of Palestinians\u2019 lives. You know, it\u2019s 50 years since what people call \u201cthe occupation.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s 50 years. You still have checkpoints.\u00a0 People have to be cleared. Soldiers everywhere in their lives.\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Actually, I\u2019ve lifted checkpoints quite a bit and we\u2019re trying to create bridges and thoroughfares and so on so we can have freer movement. Palestinians know-- they look at Aleppo in Syria, and they look at Yemen, and they look at Libya, and they look at other places, and they know that our intention is coexistence. Lesley Stahl: You told us that Israel is less isolated today than it has been in many years in the past. And yet, at the same time, you\u2019re losing support in-- in Western Europe. Benjamin Netanyahu: Isolated?? All these countries are coming to Israel and it\u2019s a fantastic change. Lesley Stahl: But not Western Europe.\u00a0 Not you, your natural allies, or your older allies yet. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, they\u2019re coming\u2014 Lesley Stahl: They call you colonials. Benjamin Netanyahu: They\u2019re coming around too. Lesley Stahl: But they call you occupiers. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well they call us a lot of things but I think they\u2019re coming around too, I have to tell you. But criticism has spread, on U.S. campuses too. Lesley Stahl: There\u2019s a movement called BDS, to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel and its products, because of the Palestinian issue, the unresolved Palestinian issue. And this is the playbook that they used, you know, against Apartheid in South Africa\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s not about this or that issue. It\u2019s against the very existence of the State of Israel. Lesley Stahl: You know what they want? I know what they want.\u00a0 They want you to stop expanding and building settlements. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yea, well, we did. We stopped. We stopped in Gaza. We tore out the settlements and gave the Palestinians Gaza.\u00a0 And what happened?\u00a0 Did we get peace?\u00a0 We got 20,000 rockets on our heads and terror tunnels. Still, his critics argue that\u2019s not a justification. For the steady expansion of the settlements in the West Bank. Those settlements are smothering Palestinians\u2019 hope for their own separate state. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think the obsession, the focus on settlements as though this were the issue and this is the obstacle to peace, I disagree with that. Lesley Stahl: But it is an obstacle. I mean\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it\u2019s not an obstacle. Lesley Stahl:\u00a0 Well, you say that, but they don\u2019t say that. \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, but I\u2019ll say something else. The real reason we haven\u2019t had peace is because of a persistent refusal of the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state in any border. \u201cYou ask us to recognize you, I\u2019m willing to do that. I ask you to recognize us. Recognize the Jewish state, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d And if they do, this thing will begin to correct itself very quickly.\u00a0 It\u2019s a condition he doesn\u2019t put on his new friends.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Have any of the Arab states said they accept Israel as a Jewish state? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah they say a lot of things in various forms. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: And never actually said they accept you. Benjamin Netanyahu: Do they say it publicly at this point?\u00a0 Not yet.\u00a0 He acknowledges that the Arab states want to see movement on the Palestinian issue. \u00a0 But despite Washington\u2019s call for a halt, settlement expansion has continued, even after the U.S. gave Israel a $38 billion military aid package. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas recently greeted each other at the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres. But the two have not held open, direct negotiations in over six years, for which they blame each other.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: What kind of a state is it going to be if you just, you know, don\u2019t do anything? Benjamin Netanyahu: I\u2019m not going to just not do anything. I\u2019m going to do something. Lesley Stahl: Well, if you don\u2019t negotiate with the Palestinians\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019m willing to negotiate with them at any moment. Lesley Stahl: And if it doesn\u2019t happen? Benjamin Netanyahu: I haven\u2019t reversed my position.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said, \u201cLook, we will solve this because we want two nation states at peace and with the proper security arrangements. Lesley Stahl: You would be pushing for a two-state solution if that\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Two states for two peoples. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m focused.\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019d like to have President Trump, when he gets into the White House, help me work on that.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see if the Arab states can help me achieve that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new reality.\u00a0 A new possibility.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Elise Viebeck and Karoun Demirjian December 11 at 1:57 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Follow @karoun Republicans Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) have been highly critical of Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Russia. On Sunday, they joined Democrats in demanding a wide-ranging probe of Russia\u2019s election influence. (Michael Reynolds/EPA) Two Senate Republicans joined\u00a0demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia\u2019s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald J. Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-elect\u2019s expected\u00a0decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee\u00a0\u2014 joined calls by incoming\u00a0Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.) \u00a0for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIA\u2019s private conclusion that Russia\u2019s activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA's assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyber-attacks.\u201d [ Trump, CIA on collision course over Russia\u2019s role in the election ] \u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security,\u201d they added. But McCain and Graham \u2014 who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election \u2014\u00a0 have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). One GOP senator \u2014 Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee \u2014 agreed with McCain and Graham\u2019s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections. \u201cCybersecurity investigation of Russian interference can\u2019t be partisan,\u201d Lankford tweeted Sunday. Republicans may be loathe to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into Russia\u2019s election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as \u201cridiculous.\u201d They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he praised during the campaign. \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it . . . No, I don\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d Trump said of the CIA charges on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d CIA officials told senators it is now \"quite clear\" that electing Donald Trump was Russia's goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) [ Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election ] McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets \u2014 although some of them suggested Congress\u2019s review of Russian actions should broaden. \u201cAll this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news,\u201d Cornyn tweeted Saturday. The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: \u201cCyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia \u2013 not just election influence.\u201d \u2014 JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 10, 2016 Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he \u201crejects any politicization of intelligence matters,\u201d calling foreign intervention \u201cunacceptable.\u201d For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether \u00a0Putin\u2019s government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trump\u2019s likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO, as secretary of state due to his \u00a0ties to\u00a0Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State,\u201d Rubio tweeted Sunday. Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Bob Menendez (N.J.) and Chris Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate. Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state \u201calarming and absurd,\u201d concluding that \u201cthe Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President\u2019s Cabinet guiding our nation\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d Yet\u00a0the committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) \u2014 who was considered a possible pick for Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 has said Tillerson would be a good choice. \u201cIf it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual,\u201d Corker tweeted. Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence could cast the tie-breaking vote. Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man much at all, but let\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then we\u2019re gonna have some talkin\u2019,\u201d Graham said early Saturday morning. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some questions. I don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d Mike DeBonis contributed to this report. powerpost ",

Post to Facebook Boeing's $16B aircraft deal with Iran Air faces challenges Boeing has gotten U.S. government approval to sell $16 billion in airliners to Iran Air.

Boeing shares moved lower yesterday after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that the government should cancel its order of a new Air Force One 747 jetliner, which he says could cost $4 billion. He also said the costs are \"out of control.\" Video provided by TheStreet Newslook In this June 2003 file photo, a Boeing 747 of Iran's national airline is seen at Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran. Iran said Sunday it has finalized a $16.8 billion deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes, a deal made possible by last year's landmark nuclear agreement. (Photo: Hasan Sarbakhshian, AP) Boeing has government approval to fill Iran Air's $16 billion aircraft order, but it may still be grounded by Congress. And President-elect Trump, who has criticized the Iran nuclear accord that allowed the deal to take off, could eventually have a say, too. The Chicago-headquartered Boeing said Sunday that it will sell 80 jetliners worth $16.6 billion to Iran Air. Boeing got approval to sell planes in Iran in September\u00a0but had to wait for a license for the Iran Air deal from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. This would be the largest business deal that a U.S. company had done with Iran since President Obama signed an executive order lifting sanctions against the country. That\u00a0order came after Iran agreed to end its pursuit of nuclear weapons under an accord reached in July 2015 with\u00a0the United Nations Security Council members \u2014\u00a0the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014\u00a0and Germany. Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One But Boeing's deal could face opposition in Congress and the White House. \u201cWe will aggressively fight this deal in next Congress, though we probably won't even need new legislation to do it,\u201d said David Pasch, communications director for Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill.\u00a0\u201cThe incoming appointees at Treasury and State will no longer report to a White House willing to bend over backward\u00a0and ignore national security concerns (in order) to keep Iran from walking away from the nuclear deal.\u201d In May, Roskam, along with fellow\u00a0Illinois Republican\u00a0Reps. Robert Dold and Randy Hultgren, sent a letter to Boeing asking the company not to do\u00a0business with Iran until it renounces support for terror groups.\u00a0Last month, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would prevent the\u00a0Treasury Department from giving U.S. banks the licenses to help Boeing complete the transactions. Since\u00a0Obama would likely veto the bill, it hasn't moved in the Senate. \"Congress will have a lot to say, particularly working in concert with an administration that has a fairly low view of this deal,\" Roskam told USA TODAY. He also said the\u00a0deal depends on financing.\u00a0Any bank that would get involved \u201chas to ask itself is it worth the reputational risk to be complicit with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism?\u201d Congressional opposition to the Iran nuclear accord has gained momentum with the victory of Trump, who has called\u00a0the accord \"the stupidest deal of all time.\" He and\u00a0Vice President-Elect Mike Pence have suggested they will consider renegotiating the deal when they take office. Trump's transition staff did not respond to requests for comment. Joe Lieberman, the former Independent senator from Connecticut who's now chairman of United Against\u00a0Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group, said the Iran deal faces a hostile\u00a0future in Washington. While it's not clear Congress or the new Trump administration will try to overturn it, \"there will at least be demands for stricter enforcement of the nuclear deal,\u00a0an expansion of non-nuclear sanctions on Iran,\u00a0and for companies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like Boeing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to cease efforts that reward the regime with lucrative business opportunities when it continues to be the leading state-sponsor of terrorism worldwide,\" Lieberman said. Boeing itself\u00a0has also\u00a0been in the news recently with Trump's call for the cancellation of the manufacturer's deal to build the next Air Force One planes because of\u00a0cost overruns on the project.\u00a0\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted last week. Boeing, which also said the Iran deal will help support nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs, expects to begin filling Iran Air's shopping list, which includes 50 737s, in 2018. The planes will be delivered over a 10-year period, Farhad Parvaresh, the managing director of the Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Iran's official news agency IRNA\u00a0 on Sunday. Boeing signs deal to sell aircraft to Iran Boeing isn't the only company looking to cash in in Iran. Competitor Airbus is also breaking into the market, and last week Royal Dutch Shell, the world's second-largest energy company, said it would begin developing oil and gas in Iran. At United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that advocates against the normalization of business dealings with Iran, retired Capt. Michael Pregent\u00a0advised against Boeing's sale due to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps'\u00a0use of \"civilian airliners to support terrorism.\" A founding member of UANI's veterans advisory council, Pregent said, \"It is inexcusable for Boeing to enter into business dealings with the regime when they are fully aware it is responsible for deaths and maiming of our men and women in uniform.\" Before last year's nuclear accord to curtail Iran's nuclear program, the U.S. had not had diplomatic ties with the country since 1980. The year before a revolution overthrew the U.S.-backed shah of Iran and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days. The State Department had considered Iran as a\u00a0\u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\" for funding U.S.-targeted\u00a0militant groups around the world, including Palestinian terror groups.

    "text": "Trump vows no \u2018wrecking ball\u2019 to Obama legacy \u2013 but signals big changes Published               December 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump left the door open Sunday on how exactly he plans to overhaul the regulation-heavy agenda pursued by the Obama administration, suggesting he wouldn\u2019t dismantle all that his predecessor has done \u2013 while making clear the government needs to be more business-friendly. Asked in an exclusive interview with \u201c Fox News Sunday \u201d whether he\u2019d take a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d to President Obama\u2019s legacy, the construction magnate responded: \u201cNo.\u00a0I don't want to do that at all.\u00a0I just want what's right.\u201d The answer may have surprised those watching Trump\u2019s recent Cabinet selections, which have included: a prominent ObamaCare critic to lead the Health and Human Services Department; a foe of Obama\u2019s overtime pay expansion to lead the Labor Department; and a state attorney general currently suing the Environmental Protection Agency to lead that very agency. Trump, at the same time, has sent mixed signals about his plans, meeting in recent days with prominent climate change activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about the implications of those meetings as well as his Cabinet selections, Trump indicated his interest is in making the government more efficient and responsive to business.\u00a0 TRUMP RIPS CLAIMS OF RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IN 2016 RACE At the EPA, he said, \u201cYou can't get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay?\u00a0That's why people don't want to invest in this country.\u201d\u00a0 Trump said: \u201cSo we're going to clean it up.\u00a0We're going to speed it up and, by the way, if somebody is not doing the right thing we're not going to approve. \u2026 We can't let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.\u201d Trump steered clear of committing to specific actions regarding projects that have pitted environmental interests against the energy industry, while suggesting economic considerations are paramount to him. On the long-disputed Keystone pipeline that was halted by the Obama administration, Trump said \u201cyou\u2019re going to have a decision fairly quickly.\u201d Asked about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which the Army Corps of Engineers wants to re-route following protests, Trump said he did not want to answer right now. \u201cBut I will tell you, when I get to office, if it's not solved, I'll have it solved very quickly,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cSomething will happen.\u00a0It'll be quick.\u00a0I think it's very unfair.\u00a0So, it\u2019ll start, one way or the other.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, said he is still studying the Paris climate agreement \u2013 a pact, backed by the U.S. and dozens of other nations, committing countries to curb the global rise in temperatures \u2013 but, \u201cI don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries.\u201d When asked where he stood on the environment and climate change, Trump would not be pinned down. \u201cI'm very open-minded.\u00a0I'm still open-minded.\u00a0Nobody really knows,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cLook, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows.\u00a0It's not something that's so hard and fast. I do know this:\u00a0other countries are eating our lunch.\u201d Taken together, Trump\u2019s comments, meetings and appointments speak to an incoming president still weighing his options on how drastically he wants to reverse or halt the Obama regulatory agenda. In an indication that the incoming administration may be preparing for big changes with regard to energy sector programs and rules, his transition team reportedly has sent around a questionnaire asking the Energy Department for a list of appointees and senior executives \u2013 and details on who has spearheaded the agency\u2019s clean energy initiatives. One unnamed department official described the questionnaire as a hit list, according to an Associated Press report. The memo sparked alarm among some Democrats, as did Trump\u2019s decision last week to name Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. Pruitt has been involved in lawsuits against the Obama EPA, including over the controversial Clean Power Plan and waterway regulations. He also has suggested the debate over global warming \u2013 and the impact of human activity on global temperatures \u2013 is unsettled. \u00a0 Former Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested Sunday that the Pruitt pick suggests the meetings with Gore and others are not informing policy decisions. \u201cI\u2019m glad they reached out to Gore, but apparently they are not hearing what Gore has to say,\u201d he told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Sanders said it\u2019s troubling Trump would appoint a climate change \u201cdenier\u201d to lead the EPA. Trump\u2019s first order of Obama legacy business may be the Affordable Care Act, with congressional Republicans eager to send a repeal bill to his desk next year. Trump has said he plans to nominate Georgia Rep. Tom Price to lead HHS, which would put an outspoken ObamaCare critic at the helm of the agency that implemented the law. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that the Obama administration \u201cpushed investment out\u201d with its raft of rules and predicted a shift toward what he called \u201ccommon-sense regulation,\u201d including with health care. \u00a0 \u201cOur No. 1 focus is jobs [in the House],\u201d he said. \u201c[ObamaCare] is going to collapse on itself. We have to look at health care in a new form and have a new health care system.\u201d Advertisement ",

As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some of Trump's selections that they view as unacceptable and outside of the political mainstream. Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to publicly shame them \u2014 all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they need to kill a nominee or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick. Related: ExxonMobil CEO Expected as Secretary of State Pick Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in active duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate. But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs. Betsy DeVos Carolyn Kaster / AP There's Trump's reported secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing that agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots. There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hardliner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments. Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks pouring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird, both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.

    "text": "Two holding penalties on the Bears\u2019 final drive left them short Sunday at Ford Field, as the Detroit Lions held on to a 20-17 win and preserved their first-place cushion in the NFC North. \u00a0 Matthew Stafford\u2019s 7-yard scramble for a touchdown was the decisive blow with 3 minutes, 17 seconds to go. Against a four-man rush, Stafford scanned the field, then took off when pressured. He side-stepped linebacker John Timu at about the 4-yard line. \u00a0 The Bears (3-10) forced the Lions to come from behind by intercepting Stafford twice in the fourth quarter. In the process, they ended their streak of 18 quarters without an interception or fumble recovery. \u00a0 On the second interception, rookie Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc was physical against veteran Anquan Boldin, then undercut an out route. Le\u2019Blanc raced 24 yards to the end zone, holding the ball above his head and high-stepping the last 10 yards. It gave the Bears a 17-13 lead with 7:07 to play. \u00a0 The Bears tried to drive from their 25 into field goal range. Holding penalties against Charles Leno, then Ted Larsen, negated back-to-back completion of 27 and 23 yards into Lions territory. That set up a climactic fourth-and-11 from the Lions\u2019 44. Barkley through deep down the middle. The ball got into Josh Bellamy\u2019s body, but with Darius Slay on his hip, Bellamy couldn\u2019t catch it.\u00a0 \u2014Rich Campbell ",

    "text": "Trump faces first significant post-election pushback from Republicans over CIA report on Russia Donald Trump Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas in 2015. Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas in 2015. (John Locher / Associated Press) Sarah D. Wire Contact Reporter As President-elect Donald Trump \u00a0dismissed\u00a0intelligence\u00a0reports about Russian interference in the presidential\u00a0election as \u201cridiculous,\" calls for a government investigation  from lawmakers, including some in his own party, grew louder Sunday. It marked the first\u00a0significant post-election pushback Trump has encountered\u00a0from a Republican Party that only belatedly and reluctantly embraced the unconventional nominee, whose\u00a0views often clash with traditional GOP ideology. In a rare joint statement Sunday, four high-profile Republican and Democratic senators called for a government investigation\u00a0into the matter and\u00a0urged colleagues not to allow the issue\u00a0to become partisan. \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d read a\u00a0statement from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), committee member Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.); incoming Senate Minority Leader leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.). \u201c Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.\u201d The statement came in the aftermath of a Washington Post report late Friday that a secret CIA analysis found that the Russian government\u2019s hacking of Democratic Party emails this year was a deliberate effort to damage Democratic nominee\u00a0 Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances. The Trump transition team responded by mockingly comparing the CIA assessment to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgment\u00a0on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump called the assessment \u201cridiculous,\u201d and suggested it was an excuse Democrats put forward to rationalize\u00a0their loss. \"I don\u2019t believe it,\u2019\u2019\u00a0Trump told host Chris Wallace. \u201cI think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country .\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Trump also defended his decision to skip some of his daily intelligence briefings, saying he gets them \u201cwhen I need it\u201d and complaining\u00a0they are repetitive. \u201cI'm, like, a smart person. I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\u201d Trump said. The Trump\u00a0transition team\u2019s resistance to\u00a0calls for an investigation into Russia's actions and refusal to accept\u00a0the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies appears rooted in a fear that it may undercut the legitimacy of his victory. \u201cThe Russians didn\u2019t tell Hillary Clinton to ignore Wisconsin and Michigan, OK?\u201d said\u00a0Reince\u00a0Priebus, who is to become Trump's chief of staff, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\u00a0\u201cShe lost the election because her ideas were bad.\u201d Trump tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of the\u00a0CIA analysis\u00a0on \u201cFox New Sunday.\u201d \u201cThey have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place,\u201d Trump said. But in October, the\u00a0U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security said publicly that\u00a0they were \u201cconfident that the Russian government\u201d was behind the\u00a0hacking of U.S. political groups and individuals in an attempt \u201cto interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d \u00a0At the time, they did not say whether the efforts were aimed at helping one candidate or the other. During the final weeks of the campaign, thousands\u00a0of embarrassing emails, many stolen from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta , were released by WikiLeaks on nearly a daily basis. On Friday, the White House said President Obama had\u00a0ordered the CIA and other intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of foreign-based digital attacks aimed at influencing the election.\u00a0Obama ordered the review completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Since the election, Republicans have worked hard to move beyond the divisions caused by Trump\u2019s candidacy and unite behind the new head of their party. Several high-profile GOP leaders continued to voice support for Trump over the weekend. The No. 2 Senate Republican, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) downplayed the news on Twitter, saying \"All this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news.\u201d House Speaker Paul D.\u00a0Ryan (R-Wis.) stopped short of calling for a congressional investigation Sunday in a statement to Politico. \"Speaker Ryan has said for months that foreign intervention in our elections is unacceptable,\u201d spokeswoman\u00a0AshLee Strong\u00a0said. \u201cThe speaker cannot comment on or characterize the content of classified briefings but he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters.\" But Trump\u2019s attempt\u00a0to undercut public trust in the\u00a0the CIA assessment, his willingness to break with the\u00a0intelligence community\u00a0and his conciliatory approach toward\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared\u00a0to be too\u00a0much for some Republicans. McCain told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Trump should acknowledge Russia may have influenced the election. ",

    "text": "Rand Paul Gives Glimpse of Trouble Trump May Face With His Party Over Government Spending By Nicki Rossoll Dec 11, 2016, 11:56 AM ET 0 Shares Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images WATCH Sen. Rand Paul: I'm an 'Automatic No' on John Bolton 0 Shares Email Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money. The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' \"This Week\" that he \"won't vote for a budget that never balances\" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him. \"The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment , and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?\" Paul said. Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare. Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible. \"All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,\" Paul said. \"I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,\" he said. Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is \"going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.\" But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state. \"I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,\" Paul said. \"He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War . He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran . He wants to do regime change in Iran.\" \"John Bolton doesn't get it,\" Paul said. ",
