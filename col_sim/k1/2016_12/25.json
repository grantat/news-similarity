Mr. Trump issued the decision in a press release, which said the Donald J. Trump Foundation has contributed millions of dollars to groups that support veterans, law enforcement officers and children. \u201cHowever, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,\u201d he said in the statement. Putin sends Trump Christmas letter after exchange over nuclear arms race The announcement said the president-elect has directed his counsel to take the necessary steps to dissolve the foundation. The foundation, however, cannot formally shut down until after the New York state attorney general\u2019s office completes its investigation of the foundation. \u201cThe Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d the office\u2019s spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, told The Washington Post in an email Saturday. \u201cI am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need, and I am also very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity, but because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don\u2019t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,\u201d he added. This comes after Mr. Trump said that he would not be subject to conflict of interest laws as president and after he said that his children would be taking over his businesses. \u201cThe law\u2019s totally on my side, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d Mr. Trump told The New York Times in a meeting last month. \u201cIn theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There\u2019s never been a case like this.\u201d Earlier this month, he postponed a planned announcement regarding how he would separate from his business empire . Soon after, he tweeted that he would be leaving his businesses before his inauguration next month, that his two sons would manage them while he serves in the White House and that there will be \u201cno new deals\u201d during that time. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in a statement on Saturday. Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete. . @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman , cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete \u2014 Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) December 24, 2016 Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue . In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law. In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying: \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest . The Times reports that Trump and his family \"are rushing to resolve potential controversies \u2014 like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals \u2014 even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.\" Article continues after sponsorship An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, \"The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000.\" Reporting from the Washington Post shows Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008 . The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. ",

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. \u2014 More than 1,000 volunteers are tracking Santa's Christmas Eve flight around the world and relaying his status to kids excited for a visit from\u00a0St. Nick. Top U.S. military agency NORAD stages the tracking effort annually on behalf of kids across the Earth, taking calls from children who want to know if they're on the Naughty or Nice list (only Santa knows that), whether he got their last-minute present request (he gets regular updates) and whether the weather will stop him from coming. (Nope, because Rudolph.) Phones ring constantly in the command center as volunteers remind kids to be thankful, stay asleep tonight no matter what they hear\u00a0and do their best to stay on the Nice list all year. Oh, and don't forget to\u00a0go to bed early to ensure Santa has time to get his work done. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I thought it would be,\u201d said grinning first-time volunteer Maj. Brian Tuzzolino of the U.S. Air Force. \u201cI\u2019m 42, but I feel like I\u2019m 12.\u201d NORAD Tracks Santa volunteer Camille Bazin gives an update on St. Nick's location to a caller on Christmas Eve. \u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) The Santa tracking tradition began in 1955 after a Colorado Springs-based Sears, Roebuck & Co. advertisement misprinted the telephone number for children to call Santa. Instead of Santa, children reached the commander in chief's hotline at CONAD, the U.S.\u00a0Continental Air Defense Command. Col. Harry Shoup, the director of operations back then, instructed his staff to check the radar for signs of Santa traveling south from the North Pole and give the children updates. The practice continued and was taken over in 1958 by NORAD, the binational air defense command for North America, run by the governments of Canada and the United States. The\u00a0 website \u00a0is available in eight languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Chinese. On-site volunteers were averaging 4,000 calls every half-hour Saturday. NORAD operates the Santa tracker with help from corporate partners, including\u00a0Microsoft and\u00a0Verizon.\u00a0 Google also offers a Santa tracker. The NORAD Tracks Santa line is a lighthearted way to showcase the capabilities of the men and women -- and technology -- that protect North America every moment, including during the holidays. \u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Beyond its Santa tracking duties,\u00a0NORAD monitors the skies above North America for attacks and UFOs. It uses a combination of land- and sea-based radar, infrared-sensitive satellites and aircraft to monitor the skies. \u201cIt\u2019s a way we can showcase to the world the capabilities we have at NORAD,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Reynold Hoover, the deputy commander of NORTHCOM, who is also vice commander at\u00a0NORAD. 251 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2irB9D0 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla. (Associated Press) Tracy Wilkinson Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday announced he was dissolving his controversial foundation, which claimed to raise\u00a0money\u00a0for\u00a0charitable\u00a0causes but\u00a0has been accused of improperly using funds. Trump said he was shutting the foundation \u201cto avoid even the appearance of any conflict\u201d with his role as president. \u201cI have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,\u201d\u00a0Trump said in a statement released Saturday evening from his Florida home. The Donald J. Trump Foundation had been an important issue during the campaign, generating\u00a0questions about how it raised and distributed money. However, since Trump unexpectedly won the race,\u00a0his business holdings have created more\u00a0potential conflicts of interest and other controversies. Trump has still not explained to the public how he will disentangle his myriad business interests\u00a0from his duties as head of the U.S. government. Already, questions have arisen about his investments in Russia, India, the Middle East and Latin America, and his apparent willingness to discuss deals with foreign officials at the same time he is\u00a0preparing to take office. The charitable foundation, meanwhile, is under \u00a0investigation by the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which in October ordered the charity to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from fundraising because it was in violation of state law. The Washington Post reported this year that some of the funds raised by the charity were used to defend Trump\u2019s for-profit businesses against lawsuits. In\u00a0tax filings, Trump admitted he violated rules against \u201cself-dealing,\u201d using charitable contributions to benefit those controlling the charity. Trump reported to the IRS that he had given no money to his charity between 2009 and 2014 but that one of the biggest donors was\u00a0wrestling mogul\u00a0Linda McMahon, the Post reported. She has since been named by Trump to head the Small Business Administration. During the campaign, Trump said he had donated huge amounts to veteran groups but never cut a check until reporters inquired about the money. In his statement Saturday, Trump said his foundation raised \u201cmillions\u201d of dollars for worthy causes. \"I am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the presidency and solving\u00a0the many problems facing our country and the world,\u00a0I don\u2019t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption Mothers who lose a second child to violence \"You wash the pain.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 On the second day of 2016, Otto Warmbier was minutes away from boarding a plane back to America when armed security officers reportedly dragged him\u00a0out of Pyongyang airport and into a yearlong nightmare that has left his loved ones and even the U.S. government powerless to save him. Like most news out of North Korea, a lot about what occurred in the airport on Jan. 2, 2016 remains a mystery. One witness remembered a commotion as an armed official yelled at the 21-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate student from Ohio and had him hauled out of the terminal. Hours later, the rogue dictatorship issued a vague update: A tourist had been \u201ccaught committing a hostile act against the state.\u201d The legal proceedings that followed were just as vague. Prosecutors charged that Warmbier was caught stealing a political sign and committed \u201ccrimes against the state.\u201d He was given a one-hour trial in March at which the government presented fingerprints, CCTV footage and pictures of a political banner to make its case against the American. \u201cI beg that you see how I am only human,\u201d Warmbier begged at trial. \u201cAnd how I have made the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d Despite his pleas, Warmbier\u00a0was convicted , and sentenced to 15 years' hard labor. In a post-trial video released to the world, Warmbier, under obvious duress,\u00a0praised his captors for his treatment and for handling of the case \u201cfair and square.\" Little is known about Warmbier's fate over the last year, and critics say the Obama administration has not done enough to bring the American home. In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been held on trumped-up charges for varying periods of time by the current regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as that of his father, Kim Jong Il. Their release has typically been won by pledges of aid or diplomatic gestures from American dignitaries. Former President Bill Clinton journeyed to the Hermit Kingdom in 2009 in a successful bid to convince the late Kim Jong Il to release of Current TV journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling , who had been captured after straying across the border from China and held prisoner for five months. The younger Kim is less predictable, and the U.S. has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. Kim Jung Un, the third generation of his family to lead the impoverished and belligerent nation, routinely issues threats against the U.S., \u00a0launches missiles to provoke South Korea and Japan, e xecutes top military officials and, occasionally, seizes Western prisoners. Although they are subjected to what passes for judicial procedures, they are for all intents and purposes, hostages. In addition to Warmbier, it is believed that Pyongyang is holding Kim Dong-chul, 62, a naturalized U.S. citizen and a Canadian. Like Warmbier, he was charged with spying. Gordon Chang, an expert on Asia and author of \u201cThe Coming Collapse of China,\u201d said autocratic regimes, like the one in Pyongyang, are famous for their insecurities and treat any slight against its government as an especially serious offense. An Irish national who visited the country told The Independent that he was told \u201cconstantly that the smallest thing was considered a hostile attack. \"I bought lots of magazines and books there, and we were told not to fold them in a way that creased Kim Jong-un\u2019s face,\u201d he recalled. Chang believes the North Koreans are taking reasonably good care of Warmbier, but the student likely feels forgotten. \u201cI assume he feels isolated,\u201d Chang said. \u201cHe\u2019s likely only reading propaganda and feels abandoned by the outside world.\u201d Warmbier's family, including his father, Fred, did not respond to requests for comment, perhaps out of concern that publicity could anger Warmbier's captors or upset back-channel efforts by the State Department or private parties to win his release.\u00a0The U.S. will often tell these families to avoid talking to the media so it can better control the situation, Chang said. \u201cI agree with that,\u201d he said. Yet, media attention in the past seemed to work favorably in some cases. Ling and Lee faced 12 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts, yet were freed after five months when a visit from Clinton seemed to provide the rogue regime with the diplomatic legitimacy it craved, at least under the elder Kim, who died in 2011. Kenneth Bae, a 47-year-old missionary who spent 19 months in prison for evangelizing, was released in 2014 after former NBA star and self-professed pal of Kim Jong-un Dennis Rodman took up his cause.\u00a0Bae, who worked on a soybean farm and lost 30 pounds during the ordeal, told The New York Times that his interrogators would tell him that nobody in the U.S. cared about him and there were no negotiations.

Bae told FoxNews.com\u00a0that he prays daily for American prisoners\u2019 release from North Korea.\u00a0 Former U.S. ambassador to the UN and ex-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, founder of the nonprofit Richardson Center for Global Engagement , told Fox News that the progress in getting Warmbier back has been slow but said North Koreans accepted a delegation from his foundation in September. He said the White House has been supportive of his group's efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this on a humanitarian basis,\u201d Richardson told Fox News, \u201cnot a government-to-government basis.\u201d Communicating with North Korea has long been more challenging under the younger Kim. \u201cThere\u2019s just silence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing coming back.\u201d Julia Mason, a State Department spokeswoman, told FoxNews.com a statement that the administration is aware of the situation, and \u201cnow that Mr. Warmbier has gone through this criminal process, we urge the DPRK to pardon him and grant him special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds.\u201d In November, the Associated Press reported that a North Korean Foreign Ministry official met with the Swedish ambassador to talk about access to Canadian Christian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim, who was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor, according to Pyongyang\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency. The Swedish ambassador used the meeting to also talk about the Americans and was reportedly told Pyongyang treats them as war prisoners, possibly in light of U.S. sanctions on the country. John Bolton, a Fox News contributor and the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson that North Korea keeps a close eye on U.S. relationships around the world. It likely made note of the Obama administrations clandestine payments to Iran earlier this year which coincided with the release of four Americans held by Tehran on bogus charges. \u201cWhen Obama pays $1.7 billion in ransom for four people being held hostage in Iran, obviously the North Koreans see this as a bargaining chip as well,\u201d he said.

The plan may quickly run into a snag, however. \"The Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\" New York Attorney General spokesperson Amy Spitalnick said in a statement released Saturday. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office ordered the Donald J. Trump Foundation to \"immediately cease soliciting contributions\" in October , after a report that the charity lacked the proper authorization to seek public donations. Trump has not donated to the foundation since 2008 but it has received tens of millions of dollars over the past 10 years. \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" Trump said in a statement. \"However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" The statement did not clarify the means in which he planned to continue his charitable interests. Trump's foundation came under scrutiny during the election over how its funds were used, with money going toward settling legal disputes among Trump's business empire. Some charity experts consider this act unethical and it could violate federal tax law . A Trump campaign spokesman has called the New York investigation \"partisan.\" Schneiderman is a Democrat and endorsed Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Related: What We Know About the Trump Foundation Controversies Trump appeared to dispute any conflicts or misuse of funds in his statement Saturday. \"I am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need, and I am also very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity, but because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don't want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,\" Trump said. However, documents first reported by the Washington Post and later reviewed by NBC News showed that Trump had used $258,000 to settle two separate lawsuits . One such lawsuit was with the town of Palm Beach over the height of Trump's Mar-a-Lago flagpole. The Post also reported that the foundation had purchased a $20,000 six-foot portrait of Trump, which may also violate federal tax law. The foundation became embroiled in an additional controversy and was fined by the IRS for donating $25,000 to a political organization connected to Florida's attorney general, Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general is now a member of Trump's transition, but at the time her office was considering investigating Trump University for fraud, which raised another instance for the president-elect about a potential conflict of interest. Bondi's office did not open an investigation. A Bondi spokeswoman has said due diligence was done in the case and similar litigation in New York would provide relief to consumers nationwide. Trump has denied that the donation had anything to do with Bondi's office mulling an investigation, and a spokesperson called it a \"minor issue.\" The IRS fine was levied after an ethics group complained that the donation had not been disclosed to tax officials. Since their father won the election, his children have tried to raise money for their own foundation by putting their name and access up for sale. Play ",

Fahrenthold December 24 at 5:12 PM Follow @markberman Follow @Fahrenthold President-elect Donald Trump plans to shut down his charitable foundation, which has been under intense scrutiny for months. (Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump said he plans to shut down his charitable foundation, a decision that comes after repeated controversies over how it collected and disbursed funds . In a statement Saturday, Trump offered no timeline for when his\u00a0foundation would close down, but said he had directed his attorney to take the steps needed to close the charity. It was also not immediately clear when the foundation\u00a0would be able to\u00a0dissolve, given an ongoing investigation in New York. \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" Trump said in the statement. \"However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" 1 of 76 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. \u00a0Dec. 23, 2016 A motorcade carrying President-elect Donald Trump arrives at Trump International Golf Club, in West Palm Beach, Fla. Andrew Harnik/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. [ Trump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words. ] New York's attorney general has been investigating the charity after some of these reports, and a spokeswoman for that office said the foundation\u00a0could not officially\u00a0shut down until\u00a0that probe is over. \u201cThe Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d\u00a0Amy Spitalnick, the\u00a0spokeswoman, said in an email Saturday. The foundation is unusual in that it largely collects and donates money from other people . In fact, from 2009 to 2014, Trump told the Internal Revenue Service that he'd given his namesake foundation no money at all. The biggest donors in recent years were Vince and Linda McMahon, the pro-wrestling moguls, who gave the Trump Foundation $5 million between 2007 and 2009. Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. Trump said Saturday that he was \"very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity.\" The Trump Foundation has no paid employees and a board of five, consisting of Trump, three of his children and a longtime\u00a0Trump Organization employee. They all work a half-hour per week, according to\u00a0an IRS filing. The president-elect\u00a0added that \"because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don\u2019t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest.\" The foundation told the IRS it had $1.16 million in total assets by the end of 2015, the most recent tax filing available. A spokeswoman for Trump said she had no additional information Saturday regarding where any remaining money might be sent. Trump's foundation\u00a0has\u00a0 admitted in IRS\u00a0tax filings for 2015 that it violated a prohibition against \u201cself-dealing\u201d that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charity's funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. In these tax filings,\u00a0the charity\u00a0checked \u201cyes\u201d in response to a question asking whether it had transferred any income or assets to \u201ca disqualified person\u201d \u2014 a description that could have meant Trump, a relative or a Trump-owned business. Trump has not said what exactly he did to violate the rule, or what he has paid the IRS in penalty taxes as a result. The IRS has not commented when asked whether it was investigating the Trump Foundation. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters this week at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.. (Andrew Harnik/AP) Trump's charity has been prohibited from fundraising by the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D), an action that\u00a0came after The Post reported that the foundation had failed to register with the state . This meant the foundation had dodged annual audits required in the state of New York. Schneiderman's office is also investigating the Trump Foundation after reports in The Post describing apparent cases of self-dealing that date back to 2007 . The Trump Foundation spent $30,000 to buy two large portraits of Trump himself, including one that was hung up in the sports bar at a Trump-owned resort. Trump also appears to use $258,000 of his foundation's money \u2014 legally earmarked for charitable purposes \u2014 to settle lawsuits involving two of his for-profit clubs. In addition, the Trump foundation gave a $25,000 gift to a campaign committee backing Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) even though nonprofits like the charity are not allowed to give political gifts. That gift was made\u00a0as Bondi's office was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. A consultant who worked on Bondi's reelection effort\u00a0has said that\u00a0Bondi was not aware of the complaints when she solicited the donation from Trump.\u00a0Ultimately, Bondi's office did not pursue those allegations. [ Trump Foundation admits to violating ban on \u2018self-dealing,\u2019 new filing to IRS shows ] The move to shut down Trump's foundation, first reported Saturday by the New York Times , comes as the president-elect and his family are facing intense questions regarding how they will avoid conflicts of interest while he is in the White House. \"The announcement that the Foundation will be shut down is a necessary first step for the incoming administration to avoid massive ethics problems, but it does not come close to ending the story,\"\u00a0said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington,\u00a0a\u00a0watchdog group aligned with allies of Hillary Clinton. The group's tips and research helped reveal some of the Trump foundation's apparent violations of the law. In a statement, Bookbinder said that the Trump charity's \"past instances of wrongdoing must be fully investigated\" and called on the president-elect to \"sell his businesses and take comprehensive steps to prevent conflicts of interest for him and his administration. Trump has said his two adult sons will run his company, but he has not provided details yet regarding how he will extricate himself from his complex network of businesses . He postponed a news conference this month meant to address the issue and has not rescheduled it. In another case of Trump apparently trying to wrap up lingering questions and legal issues before he takes office, he agreed to settle fraud claims against his defunct Trump University real estate seminars. A federal judge this week gave preliminary approval to a deal in which Trump would pay $25 million as part of the settlement. [ How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people\u2019s money ] Earlier this week, Trump's eldest son, Eric, said he was suspending his charitable foundation after facing questions about whether donors could receive special access. The Eric Trump Foundation, founded in 2007, raises more than $1.5 million a year through a golf tournament and other events, and it passes on the bulk of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , a pediatric-cancer center in Memphis. The president-elect was critical of the decision regarding his son's foundation, describing it as unfair in a pair of messages this week on Twitter . \"Isn't this a ridiculous shame?\u201d the elder Trump wrote. \u201cHe loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!\u201d This story, first published at 4:28 p.m., has been updated. Further reading: ",

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Hunched against the weather, the slight young woman makes two trips carrying the food into the drab gray house. After stocking the refrigerator and cabinet, she conducts a last-minute inspection. The fridge is cold. The tap has hot water. The burners on the gas stove ignite. Everything upstairs is fine as well, with even more homey touches added. New pajamas and towels. New clothes hangers. New picture frames, showing stock photos of cheerful families, on the shelves. And on one twin bed, a child\u2019s soccer ball, still in its box. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hugs and Handshakes The rain has stopped, a slice of moon risen. Ms. Garver is driving now to the home of a Syrian family that arrived seven months ago. The mother has cooked a hot meal for the refugee family that is about to land any minute in New York, a good three-hour drive away. Photo Light from a window beckoned the new occupants. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Inside, where five young children zip and waddle about, the prepared meal sits in expectation on the dining-room table: a large aluminum tray bountiful with chicken and rice and a huge bowl of salad. The oldest child, Mohamad, 14, helps Ms. Garver carry the food out to her vehicle, and she thanks him. He responds with the formality given to a new language being tried on for size. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the boy says, and smiles. Returning to the gray house, Ms. Garver fumbles in the dark to open the door while holding the tray of still-hot food. When she returns with the salad bowl, she stoops to collect a clump of junk mail, including a come-on addressed to \u201cOur Neighbor.\u201d Later tonight, Ms. Garver and Mr. Alfayadh will drive a Ford van to Lancaster Airport, where they will meet two representatives from the local Islamic Center. Soon after, another van will arrive from Kennedy International Airport. Hugs and handshakes will be exchanged in the December air. Luggage will be collected. And six Syrian refugees will be driven the 20 minutes to a warm home perfumed by warm food, in a city made radiant by the multicolored lights of the season.

    "text": "Turnovers, defensive ineptitude plague Bears in another lopsided loss Photos from the Bears-Redskins game at Soldier Field on Dec. 24, 2016. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd on Christmas Eve was a 41-21 loss, the team's 12th this year and the latest reminder of how flawed this Bears group remains. Bad news: Receivers Josh Bellamy, Alshon Jeffery and Cameron Meredith, running back Jordan Howard and left tackle Charles Leno all made tackles Saturday. That's never a good sign with the offense losing the ball over and over and over again. Quarterback Matt Barkley threw five interceptions as the Bears lost the turnover battle for the 10th time this season. But equally disappointing, the defense had few if any answers to slow the Redskins. A week after allowing 451 total yards to the Packers, the Bears were gashed for 478 more yards Saturday, allowing 7.5 yards per play. Within that debacle, the Redskins converted eight of their 13 third-down attempts. Four of those eight conversions came in situations in which the Redskins faced third-and-6 or longer. \"Third-and-long, we've got to be way better than that,\" inside linebacker Jerrell Freeman said. \"Come on, man. We've got to be. When you get them in third-and-long, you have to get the ball back. You have to understand situations, know the route combinations, know what they can give you and what they can hurt you with. And then go make a play.\" Bears could frame summing up 2016, fewer than 10,000 fans filled Soldier Field during the final minutes of Saturday's 41-21 loss to the Redskins in the last game of a lousy season on the lakefront. The McCaskeys should hang that picture in a board room at Halas... In the most fitting holiday photo the Bears could frame summing up 2016, fewer than 10,000 fans filled Soldier Field during the final minutes of Saturday's 41-21 loss to the Redskins in the last game of a lousy season on the lakefront. The McCaskeys should hang that picture in a board room at Halas... (David Haugh) The Redskins' first touchdown came on third-and-9, a 17-yard screen pass from Kirk Cousins to Chris Thompson to beat a Bears blitz. Still, Freeman said, it was more than just a well-timed play call against the extra pressure the Bears brought. \"At the same time, on those screens when you're blitzing, you have to feel that,\" he said. \"You have to know what can hurt you and what can be coming.\" Good news: The best news for Bears fans is that only one line remains on the schedule. But in the spirit of the holidays, it's important to acknowledge at least a couple of bright spots from Saturday's game. So here goes. Both Howard, the rookie running back, and Meredith, the second-year receiver, topped 100 yards against the Redskins. Howard turned his 18 rushes into 119 yards. It was his sixth 100-yard rushing game this season and pushed him to 1,178 yards for the season, just 60 short of Matt Forte's franchise rookie rushing record. Meredith's nine catches went for a career-best 135 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown grab late in the first half. Barkley has appreciated Meredith's development. \"The way he always wants to keep moving after the catch is impressive,\" Barkley said. \"He has grown in a lot of ways in regards to finding open windows and feeling the defense, not just running his route like it says on paper.\" Bears , be careful to differentiate between legitimate progress that offers hope for the future and more of the same, which has had the franchise in a downward spiral for much of the last decade. You cannot make a judgment at the end of this... When digging through the layers of issues affecting the Bears , be careful to differentiate between legitimate progress that offers hope for the future and more of the same, which has had the franchise in a downward spiral for much of the last decade. You cannot make a judgment at the end of this... (Brad Biggs) Extra point: The Bears announced 18,116 unused tickets for Saturday's game, the latest indication of fan apathy as the team pushes to the end of another last-place season. Over the Bears' final four home games, the team had a used-ticket average of 44,867. As a reminder, Soldier Field's capacity is 61,500. With fewer than 10,000 fans hanging around late into the fourth quarter Saturday, the sight of a mostly empty stadium proved jarring in the home finale. \"The fans expect more,\" Meredith said. \"We expect more of ourselves. So we can't blame them.\" Up next: The Bears will make their first visit to U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on New Year's Day, facing a Vikings team that is sputtering to the finish line. After starting the season 5-0, the Vikings are 7-8 and were eliminated from playoff contention with Saturday's 38-25 loss in Green Bay. For whatever it's worth, the Bears claimed the season's first meeting against the Vikings, winning 20-10 on Halloween night at Soldier Field. Final word: \"Obviously it's very disappointing. It's disappointing to everyone, ourselves included. I feel bad for our fans.\" \u2014 Bears coach John Fox.

    "text": "Trump Says' He'll Dissolve Foundation to Avoid 'Appearance' of Conflict By Paul Blake Dec 24, 2016, 6:28 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH What We Know About the Trump Foundation Under Investigation 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that he plans to dissolve his charitable foundation to avoid \"even the appearance\" of any conflict of interest. \u201cTo avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President, I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,\u201d Trump said in a statement emailed by his presidential transition team. Lawyers are now taking \u201cthe necessary steps to effectuate the dissolution,\u201d the statement said. What We Know About the Trump Foundation Under Investigation But that process might not be as straightforward as the president-elect would like it to be. In a statement shortly after Trump's announcement, New York State Attorney General Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick said that \"the Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete.\" In September, the office confirmed that it was investigating the foundation . The probe is said to concern \u2013 among other things \u2013 a 2013 donation made from the foundation to the fundraising campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. That contribution has drawn concerns of impropriety after Bondi\u2019s office decided not to take legal action against Trump over his now-closed school, Trump University . Both Trump and Bondi said the contribution had no link to her office's decision. ABC News\u2019 Aaron Katersky contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",
