In Britain, he was showered with awards, and in 2004, Britain\u2019s Radio Academy said he had been the most-played performer on British radio from 1984 to 2004. Photo Mr. Michael performing solo at Madison Square Garden in 1988. He later turned away from live shows. Credit Ebet Roberts In 1998, Mr. Michael came out as gay after being arrested on charges of lewd conduct in a men\u2019s room in Beverly Hills, Calif. He had long lent his name and music to support AIDS prevention and gay rights. During interviews in later years, he described himself as bisexual, and said that hiding his sexuality had made him feel \u201cfraudulent.\u201d He also described long struggles with depression. During the 2000s, Mr. Michael\u2019s output slowed; his last studio album of new songs was \u201cPatience\u201d in 2004. In later years he put out individual songs as free downloads, encouraging listeners to contribute to charity. But in 2006, 25 years into his career, he could still headline stadiums worldwide. George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in East Finchley, London, on June 25, 1963, the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur and an English dancer. In 1979, he and a schoolmate, Andrew Ridgeley, played together for the first time in a ska band called the Executive. That didn\u2019t last, but they continued to make music together \u2014 nearly all of it composed and sung by Mr. Michael \u2014 and began releasing singles as Wham!, cultivating the image of carefree teenage rebels in songs like \u201cYoung Guns (Go for It!).\u201d Their 1983 debut album, \u201cFantastic,\u201d reached No. 1 in Britain; in the United States, their 1984 single \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go\u201d became ubiquitous on MTV and reached No. 1. In 1985, the duo became the first major Western pop group to perform in China as part of its world tour, and Mr. Michael appeared at the Live Aid charity concert, telecast worldwide, joining Elton John to sing Mr. John\u2019s song \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me.\u201d Photo Mr. Michael became one of pop\u2019s reigning stars in the 1980s in Wham! Credit Ian Dickson/Redferns The worldwide 1984 hit \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d credited in Britain to George Michael solo and to Wham! featuring George Michael in the United States, signaled a turn away from perky teenage fare. Mr. Michael\u2019s status as a top British pop star was confirmed by his appearance on Band Aid\u2019s \u201cDo They Know It\u2019s Christmas?,\u201d the 1984 all-star benefit single for Ethiopian famine relief. In 1986, Wham! dissolved, with a farewell show at Wembley Stadium. Mr. Michael had a No. 1 hit with \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting (for Me)\u201d before releasing the album \u201cFaith\u201d in 1987. Its first single, \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d reached No. 2 in the United States, though it was seen as too risqu\u00e9 by some radio stations; Mr. Michael made an introduction to its video clip stating, \u201cThis song is not about casual sex.\u201d George Michael - I Want Your Sex (Stereo Version) Video by georgemichaelVEVO \u201cFaith,\u201d which hinted at both gospel and rockabilly, reached No. 1, and the album included three more No. 1 hits: \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cMonkey\u201d and \u201cOne More Try.\u201d It has sold more than 10 million copies in the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But for his next album, \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d released in 1990, Mr. Michael set out to jettison his pop persona. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure,\u201d he told an interviewer at the time. \u201cI think that\u2019s the ultimate tragedy of fame, people who are simply out of control, who are lost. I\u2019ve seen so many of them, and I don\u2019t want to be another clich\u00e9.\u201d Photo Aretha Franklin joined Mr. Michael in 1988 in Auburn Hills, Mich., on his tour for his Grammy-winning album \u201cFaith.\u201d Credit Robert Kozloff/Associated Press The autobiographical \u201cFreedom \u201990\u201d declared his independence from the pop machine; he wasn\u2019t in its video clip, which had supermodels lip-syncing the lyrics. The album also included a No. 1 single, the ballad \u201cPraying for Time,\u201d and has sold two million copies in the United States, but after the blockbuster of \u201cFaith\u201d it was considered a commercial letdown. George Michael - Freedom! '90 Video by georgemichaelVEVO Mr. Michael entered a protracted legal battle with Sony Music over his contract, and was unable to release another album until 1996. Its title, \u201cOlder,\u201d was an unmistakable signal that he was no longer directly courting the youth market; he was 32 years old. The album was an instant hit in England and Europe \u2014 it had six hit singles in England \u2014 though it was less popular in the United States. After his 1998 arrest, Mr. Michael released a greatest-hits album with two new songs; one, \u201cOutside,\u201d set its video clip in a men\u2019s restroom. He made a 1999 album of cover songs, \u201cSongs of the Last Century.\u201d In the early 2000s, Mr. Michael released songs protesting the invasion of Iraq, including the 2002 \u201cShoot the Dog.\u201d His last full studio album, \u201cPatience,\u201d was released in 2004, full of introspective ballads. Mr. Michael returned to performing; he joined Paul McCartney onstage during the 2005 Live 8 benefit concert. In 2006, he performed a world tour, paired with another collection of hits, \u201cTwenty Five,\u201d which included new duets with Mr. McCartney and Mary J. Blige. He continued to release individual songs sporadically, and in 2014, he released \u201cSymphonica,\u201d a collection of standards and his own songs recorded with an orchestra on a 2010-11 tour. During that tour, he collapsed with nearly fatal pneumonia and was hospitalized for five weeks; he wrote a single, \u201cWhite Light,\u201d about the experience. Mr. Michael had been planning an expanded reissue, due in 2017, of \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d paired with a documentary, \u201cFreedom,\u201d exploring his musical, personal and legal struggles. \u201cI never minded being thought of as a pop star,\u201d Mr. Michael told GQ in 2004. \u201cPeople have always thought I wanted to be seen as a serious musician, but I didn\u2019t, I just wanted people to know that I was absolutely serious about pop music.\u201d Correction: December 25, 2016 An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of Mr. Michael\u2019s Wham! bandmate. He is Andrew Ridgeley, not Ridgely. Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting.

By Philip Rucker and Robert Barnes December 25 at 7:06 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @scotusreporter Donald Trump is set to inherit an uncommon number of vacancies in the federal courts in addition to the open Supreme Court seat, giving the president-elect a monumental opportunity to reshape the judiciary after taking office. The estimated 103 judicial vacancies that President Obama is expected to hand over to Trump in the Jan. 20 transition of power is nearly double the 54 openings Obama found eight years ago following George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Confirmation of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees slowed to a crawl after Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015. Obama White House officials blame Senate Republicans for what they characterize as an unprecedented level of obstruction in blocking the Democratic president\u2019s court picks. The result is a multitude of openings throughout the federal circuit and district courts that will allow the new Republican president to quickly make a wide array of lifetime appointments. State gun control laws, abortion restrictions, voter laws, anti-discrimination measures and immigrant issues are all matters that are increasingly heard by federal judges and will be influenced by the new composition of the courts. Trump has vowed to choose ideologues in the mold of the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon \u2014 a prospect that has activists on the right giddy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), left, walks through the Capitol with Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Nov. 30. (Bill O\u2019Leary/Washington Post) \u201cI\u2019m optimistic he\u2019ll come at this right out of the gate,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that has opposed many of Obama\u2019s court choices. \u201cEvery president can expect to make a huge impact,\u201d Severino added. \u201c[Trump] is unique in having campaigned really hard on this issue \u2014 the significance of the courts, and of the Supreme Court in particular.\u201d The Supreme Court vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s death in February was a motivating issue for many conservative voters, especially evangelical Christians, to turn out for Trump. Senate Republicans refused to hold even a hearing on Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, for the Scalia seat. [ Trump\u2019s victory has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court ] Democrats accuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, of intentionally denying Obama\u2019s nominees a fair hearing and running out the clock in hopes that a Republican would succeed him, as Trump has. Twenty-five of Obama\u2019s court nominees were pending on the Senate floor, after having been approved out of the committee with bipartisan support, but did not get a vote before the Senate ended its two-year term before the holidays, according to White House spokesman Eric Schultz. \u201cRepublican tactics have been shameful and will forever leave a stain on the United States Senate,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cRepublican congressional dysfunction has now metastasized to the third branch of government, and that is not a legacy to be proud of.\u201d Merrick Garland, right, President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, meets with Sen. Patrick D. Leahy (D-Vt.) on Capitol Hill on March 17. (J. Lawler Duggan for The Washington Post) Trump spoke frequently about his intentions to put forward a more conservative Supreme Court nominee as a way to galvanize the right. \u201cThe replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies,\u201d Trump said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. \u201cVery important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.\u201d Although Trump spoke little on the campaign trail about the many vacancies on lower courts, remaking the federal judiciary overall has been a priority of his and of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, aides said. Trump\u2019s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry , is a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. First appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan, Barry was later elevated to the circuit court by President Bill Clinton and is known for her relative moderation. She has spoken out against women\u2019s claims of sexual harassment yet also struck down a New Jersey law banning late-term abortions as unconstitutional. Trump transition officials declined to comment on the process of selecting nominees, but incoming White House Counsel Don McGahn is expected to play a key role. Such groups as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation have been working with the Trump team to suggest possible candidates. The judiciary also is a top priority for McConnell, who stands ready to help the Trump White House identify candidates and grease the sometimes-laborious Senate confirmation process. The Trump administration and the Senate will be under pressure to quickly install judges in courts around the country where cases are severely backlogged because of long-vacant seats. There are 38 so-called judicial emergencies, according to the nonpartisan Judicial Conference, including in Texas, where seven seats have sat empty for more than one year. The Obama administration and the state\u2019s two conservative Republican senators could not come to an agreement on nominees for the many openings. \u201cThere is a real impact on real people,\u201d said W. Neil Eggleston, Obama\u2019s White House counsel. \u201cThere are people and companies who are not having their cases heard because there are no judges around.\u201d The politics surrounding judicial vacancies are more poisonous than at any time in recent memory, as the Garland episode has shown, with Democrats and Republicans at loggerheads for much of the two years since McConnell took leadership of the Senate. [ Supreme Court to begin new term short-handed as its ideological balance hinges on fall vote ] Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, issued a 4,200-word statement this month saying that by blocking Garland, Republicans had committed \u201cthe most outrageous act of obstruction and irresponsibility\u201d that he had seen in his 42 years in the Senate. Speaking more generally about circuit and district court vacancies, Leahy added: \u201cDespite the fact that there are dozens of qualified, consensus nominees pending on the Senate floor right now, we will finish this Congress having confirmed just 22 judicial nominees in two years. That is the lowest number since Harry Truman was president.\u201d As with many subjects, judicial nomination data can be subject to interpretation. Judicial vacancies ebb and flow somewhat randomly, considering judges serve lifetime appointments until they choose to retire or die. \u201cIt is a challenge to make apples-to-apples comparisons at the end of a term because vacancies don\u2019t happen in the same regular basis as they do in the Senate or the White House,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. \u201cTo make an apples-to-apples comparison on a snapshot in time doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Despite Obama\u2019s difficulty winning confirmation for his nominees, the Senate has confirmed more of his nominees during his eight years as president, 329, than it did Bush\u2019s during his eight years in office, 326. Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for Grassley, said, \u201cThe White House has very little to complain about because no matter how they spin it, the fact is that President Obama had more judicial nominees confirmed than President Bush.\u201d Obama has used his nominations to systematically diversify the federal courts to look more like the fast-changing country. He appointed far more female and minority judges than any other president in history, and he has paid particular attention to sexual orientation. When Obama took office, there was only one openly gay or lesbian judge, and he appointed 11 more. \u201cThe president, my predecessors and I spent a significant amount of time looking for all different kinds of diversity \u2014 racial, sexual orientation, gender and professional background,\u201d Eggleston said. [ Obama pushing to diversity federal judiciary amid GOP delays ] When Obama took office, only one of the 13 regional circuit courts had a majority of Democratic-nominated judges, and as he leaves, nine do. While the Supreme Court hears roughly 75 cases a year, tens of thousands are decided at the circuit court level, affecting all who live in the states within those circuits. Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominations at the Brookings Institution, said Trump has a great opportunity to change the partisan split in the federal courts. He predicted that by mid-2020, Republican appointees would hold about half of the 673 district judgeships, as opposed to the current 34 percent. And among the 179 circuit court judgeships, Democratic appointees now hold a slim majority, 51 percent, but that could fall to about 43 percent. But Wheeler warned that there are important limitations to Trump\u2019s power. For one thing, many of the judges most likely to leave their appointments in the coming years were appointed by Republican presidents, meaning there will be fewer opportunities to shift the partisan makeup. And perhaps more importantly, 28 of the 50 states will be represented by at least one Democratic senator, including large ones such as California, Florida and New York. Senate leaders have a tradition of considering nominees only if they are supported by both senators representing their state \u2014 and Democratic senators are expected to bargain hard with the Trump administration, just as Republican senators did with Obama\u2019s. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t always get exactly who he wants,\u201d Wheeler said. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Former Wham singer George Michael dead at 53 Published               December 25, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print George Michael performs during the Closing Ceremony at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 12, 2012, in London. (AP Photo/Kristy Wigglesworth) \u00a0(AP2012) Singer George Michael, who sold more than 100 million albums over a pop music career spanning almost four decades, has died at the age of 53, his publicist said Sunday.\u00a0 Michael died at his home in Goring, England. His publicist, Cindi Berger, said he had not been ill. Michael's manager, Michael Lippman, says the cause of death was heart failure. His family issued a statement through Thames Valley Police saying that he \"passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period. \"The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\" Before Lippmann's announcement, police issued a statement calling the death \"unexplained but not suspicious\" and that \"a post mortem will be undertaken in due course.\" The loss of Michael continues a year of grief in the music industry, with David Bowie, Prince and Glenn Frey among those dying before age 70. One of the giants of `80s and `90s music, and an early idol for the MTV generation, Michael\u00a0enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\" \"Young Guns (Go For It)\" and \"Freedom.\" As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range. He earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards, and recorded duets with legends like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John. Throughout his career, his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law, most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles. Yet, he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior, and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans. Michael, with startling good looks and an easy stage manner, formed the boy band WHAM! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s. Helped by MTV, which was an emerging music industry force at the time, the cheerful duo easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael, as lead singer, usually the focal point. He started his solo career shortly before WHAM! split, with the release of the megahit single \"Careless Whisper,\" making a seamless transition. Critics generally viewed his WHAM! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks. His first solo album, 1987's \"Faith,\" sold more 20 million copies, and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy \"I Want Your Sex,\" which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV. The song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature, but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening. Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write \"Explore Monogamy\" on the leg and back of a model in the video. At the time, Michael had not disclosed his homosexuality, and much of his chart success was based on his sex appeal to young women. His look was raw and provocative, with tight jeans, tight T-shirts, black leather jackets and designer stubble, and his videos pushed the accepted limits with many lingerie-clad models vying for Michael's attentions on screen. But Michael's situation changed abruptly in 1998 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer. The arrest received international media attention, and seemed for a brief time to jeopardize Michael's stature as a top recording artist. But instead of making excuses for his behavior, he went on to release a single and video, \"Outside,\" that made light of the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police who had arrested him. Like all of his efforts at the time, it sold in prodigious numbers, helping him put the incident behind him. The arrest also prompted him to speak openly about his sexual orientation. These years represented the height of Michael's commercial success, which at times was marred by a protracted legal dispute with his record company Sony. He remained a strong musical force throughout his career, releasing dozens of records and touring to adoring crowds despite a growing number of run-ins with police, many of them stemming from a series of driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs incidents, including several crashes. Michael was an admitted user of marijuana and prescription sedatives and several times was found slumped over his car's steering wheel after using both at the same time. His driver's license was finally revoked for five years in 2010 after Michael drove his Land Rover into the side of a Snappy Snap photo shop with so much force that his vehicle dented the wall. A passer-by remembering Michael's early career wrote the word WHAM on the spot his SUV had hit. He was also arrested a second time in public toilets -- this time in North London in 2008 for drug use, an incident that prompted him to apologize to his fans and promise to get his life in order. He also offered an apology to \"everybody else, just for boring them.\" A year earlier, he had told a television interviewer that his problems stemmed from a self-destructive streak and his attention-seeking nature. He said at a press conference in 2011 that he felt he had let young people down with his misbehavior and had made it easier for others to denigrate homosexuals. Despite these personal setbacks, Michael's musical performances remained strong even as his material moved farther from the teen tunes that first brought him to stardom. The Telegraph newspaper in 2011 described a London concert appearance as an impressive event, calling his voice, \"A rich, soulful instrument, it's capable of serious emotional heft, expertly matching the confessional tone of his own material.\" Michael, with strong Greek-Cypriot roots, was born Georgios Panayiotou in England. He and schoolmate Ridgeley formed a ska band called the Executive when they were just 16 before moving on to form WHAM! \"I wanted to be loved,\" said Michael of his start in the music field. \"It was an ego satisfaction thing.\" Michael was active in a number of charities and helped raise money to combat AIDS, help needy children, and support gay rights. He had a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss, but announced onstage in August 2011 that the two had broken up. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 25, 2016 10:28 PM EST George Michael, who rocketed to stardom with Wham! and went on to enjoy a long and celebrated solo career lined with controversies, has died, his publicist said Sunday. He was 53. His publicist confirmed the news to CBS News in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cIt is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\u201d\u00a0 Michael\u2019s manager told CBS News that he died of heart failure. \u00a0 In 2011, the singer had a life-threatening\u00a0 bout of pneumonia . At the time, he thanked the staff at Vienna General Hospital for keeping him alive in the intensive care unit. \u00a0\u00a0 Stars react to death of George Michael: \u201cHe was an absolute inspiration\u201d Michael enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\u201d \u2018\u2019Young Guns (Go For It)\u201c and \u201cFreedom.\u201d As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range. He sold well over 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards, and recorded duets with legends like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John.\u00a0 Throughout his career, his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law, most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles. Yet, he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior, and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans. In this file photo dated June 28, 1986, George Michael is on stage for Wham\u2019s last sell out concert at Wembley Stadium in London. \u00a0\u00a0 View Gallery In this file photo dated June 28, 1986, George Michael is on stage for Wham\u2019s last sell out concert at Wembley Stadium in London. \u00a0\u00a0 AP Michael, with startling good looks and an easy stage manner, formed the boy band Wham! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s. Helped by MTV, which was an emerging music industry force at the time, the cheerful duo easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael, as lead singer, usually the focal point. He started his solo career shortly before Wham! split, with the release of the megahit single \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d making a seamless transition. Critics generally viewed his Wham! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks. His first solo album, 1987\u2019s \u201cFaith,\u201d sold more 20 million copies, and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV. The song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature, but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening.  Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write \u201cExplore Monogamy\u201d on the leg and back of a model in the video.

Zarela Lopez carries her 1-year-old daughter, Liesel Shanell Lopez, through a room full of toys to pick up some to take home. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) Rosanna Xia Contact Reporter The line outside the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles began two days ago, as hundreds of men, women and their children waited patiently for a warm meal and a toy from Santa\u2019s Village\u00a0on Christmas morning. Volunteers arrived early Sunday to greet them, handing out beanies,\u00a0caps and jackets in the chilly hours before the mission\u2019s Santa\u2019s Village opened its doors at 8 a.m.\u00a0 Cecelia Rosales bounced Troy, her 1-year-old son, on her hip as he waved to everyone and said \u201chi\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d among\u00a0the first few words he has\u00a0learned. Rosales giggled with him as he welcomed the day\u2019s sunshine  and saw no difference between those who lived on the streets and those volunteers who came to skid row to spend the day with them.\u00a0 Troy is her sixth child, said Rosales, 33. She said she struggled with  drug addiction for years and her other  children were\u00a0taken away. Now sober for two years, she sees a bright future and another shot at motherhood with her baby boy.  Rosales has enrolled in a community program that will help her read and write, get a job and find secure housing. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the legwork and stop just wishing for what I want,\u201d\u00a0she said, looking at Troy with pride and determination. \u201cFor once in my life, I\u2019m going to have my own apartment. I\u2019m going to be a good mother.\u201d About 2,000 children were expected to  spend Christmas at the mission, which was\u00a0decorated with colorful wrapping paper and filled with donated toys and books. Dozens of volunteers greeted families, helped children select their toys\u00a0and served them a festive brunch.\u00a0 Entertainer Dick Van Dyke, a longtime Christmas volunteer  at the mission, donned a bright red sweater and sang carols with the Urban Voices Project , a choir of spirited singers who consider\u00a0skid row home. \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s always been a part of what we do here. It\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Joey Weinert, the mission\u2019s volunteer manager, said as he ushered in more families and directed enthusiastic volunteers to their positions in Santa\u2019s Village. \u201cIt\u2019s been super busy. It\u2019s going great.\u201d Luis and Zarela Lopez smiled at the carolers and huddled around their toddler, Liesel Shanell, who just turned 1 this week. The couple woke up early,  took a bus from their home in Koreatown to downtown Los Angeles\u00a0and waited quietly for almost two hours in hopes of providing their  daughter  with a birthday and Christmas celebration. The  couple work in a restaurant\u00a0kitchen, but they have been out of work for a month because the owner could not afford to keep all his employees full time.\u00a0 They said they expect to be back at work after the holidays, when business at the restaurant picks up again. Until then, they\u2019re finding ways to take care of their daughter and just being \u201chappy together,\u201d Zarela Lopez said in Spanish. Walking slowly around the room full of toys, she picked a plastic training\u00a0tricycle for toddlers\u00a0and an interactive book that teaches children about shapes and colors.\u00a0 She likes educational toys, Lopez said, as she wrapped her arms around her daughter.\u00a0 Across the\u00a0L.A. area, Christmas morning  brought numerous other communities together as well. At Union Station Homeless Services in Pasadena, hundreds of volunteers gathered to share a meal with those with no place to go during the holidays. \u00a0At  Hollywood United Methodist Church, in an annual event co-hosted with Temple Israel of Hollywood, children gathered to take photos with Santa, and volunteers expect to provide food, blankets and toiletries to more than 1,000 people. \u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose H. Gomez said\u00a0a 9 a.m. Christmas Mass for inmates gathered in the chapel at the Men\u2019s Central Jail. The archbishop  also said\u00a0a 12:30 p.m. Christmas Mass in Spanish\u00a0at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.\u00a0 For those flying on Christmas Day, Santa Claus  appeared at Los Angeles International Airport, where  he handed out stuffed animals, candy canes and ornaments. Airport police canines were  also  greeting children and weary passengers with tail wags and holiday cheer.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption Mothers who lose a second child to violence \"You wash the pain.

Wochit-All George Michael, pictured here in September 2010, died over the Christmas holiday, his publicist confirms. (Photo: Leon Neal, AFP/Getty Images) George Michael, the British singer, musician and founding member of Wham!, died over the\u00a0Christmas holiday, his publicist confirms to USA TODAY. \u00a0He was 53. \"It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully\u00a0at home over the Christmas period,\" read a statement sent to USA TODAY by Michael's London-based publicist,\u00a0Connie Filippello. \"The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\" The musician\u00a0died in Goring, England. The BBC was the first to report Michael's death. The cause of death was heart failure, according to Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter . The pop star's death stunned\u00a0the entertainment community.\u00a0His U.S. publicist, Cindi Berger, told the Associated Press he had not been ill. \"I am in deep shock,\" Elton John wrote on Instagram . \"I have lost a beloved friend \u2014 the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans.\" Michael\u00a0sold more than 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy Awards, and recorded duets with Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and John, among others. Stunned stars react to George Michael's death Few teen idols have made critics eat their words more handily than Michael did back in his late-\u201980s heyday, when the former Wham! frontman emerged as one of the most successful and admired singer/songwriters of that decade. But in the years that followed, Michael made news more frequently for his professional struggles and personal scandal, even as he continued to record and tour profitably and inspire\u00a0younger acts. Born Georgios Panayiotou in North London \u2014 his father was a Greek immigrant \u2014 Michael met another aspiring musician, Andrew Ridgeley, while both were attending secondary school in Hertfordshire. By 1982, they were recording together as the bubble-gum duo Wham!, and within two years they would be among the world\u2019s most popular acts, with bouncy hits such as Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go and Freedom becoming staples of the early MTV era. One song from Wham!\u2019s American breakthrough\u00a0album, Make It Big, was credited to Michael as a solo artist when it was released as a single: the lovelorn ballad Careless Whisper, which reached No. 1 in the U.K., the USA and various other countries. That feat, and subsequent well-received solo turns, including a duet with Aretha Franklin (1987\u2019s I Knew You Were Waiting for Me), led many to suspect that Wham!\u2019s frontman had abilities and ambitions beyond making little girls scream. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. George Michael went from the frontman of Wham! (he's pictured, right, with bandmate Andrew Ridgeley) to becoming a successful solo singer/songwriter.

You may also like these photo galleries: Replay Last Slide Next Slide Michael\u2019s first solo album, 1987\u2019s Faith, confirmed that. With six top-five singles \u2014 among them the title track, the then-controversial smash I Want Your Sex and the rhapsodic Father Figure \u2014 Faith dominated the charts for much of 1988, and has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide to date. But Michael\u2019s solo debut, which earned a Grammy Award in 1989 for album of the year, was more than a commercial milestone. Faith\u2019s artful blend of pop, funk and blue-eyed-soul textures made it the first album by a Caucasian artist to reach the top position on Billboard\u2019s R&B chart. Michael\u2019s intense creative involvement \u2014 he wrote all the songs, most independently, and also produced \u2014 helped reshape the template for pop acts. Even Michael Jackson hadn\u2019t been quite so autonomous, collaborating heavily with Quincy Jones and others on his \u201980s megahits. If Faith clearly demanded a new level of respect, some viewed Michael\u2019s behavior in its wake as self-defeating. He refused to actively promote his much-anticipated follow-up album, 1990\u2019s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1, and didn't\u00a0appear in its music videos; for the hit single Freedom! '90, he memorably tapped a bevy of supermodels, among them Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, to lip-sync the lyrics. Listen\u00a0yielded other hits, notably the chart-topping first single Praying for Time, but didn\u2019t approach the massive success of its predecessor. Michael wound up suing his label, Sony Music, for insufficiently supporting him, and a Vol. 2 was abandoned amid legal battles. He\u00a0continued to release albums \u2014 Michael's last studio effort, the aptly titled Patience, came out in 2004, and his\u00a0final album was 2014's live Symphonica\u00a0\u2014 but his music career would be overshadowed by\u00a0his tabloid exploits. Longstanding questions about Michael\u2019s sexual orientation came to the fore in 1998, when he was arrested for lewd behavior after revealing himself to another man, who turned out to be a police officer, in a public restroom in Beverly Hills. Michael would later make light of the incident, and became more open about his homosexuality. Having lost a partner, Brazilian designer Anselmo Feleppa, to a cerebral hemorrhage in 1993, Michael began a long-term relationship a few years later, with Texas-born businessman Kenny Goss; they split in 2009. The singer, whose charity work dates back to his participation in the 1984 Band Aid single Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, also raised money for AIDS research and terminally ill children. There would be other run-ins with the law for Michael, who between 2006 and 2010 was arrested several times in London for possession of drugs and driving under the influence.\u00a0Michael was hospitalized in November 2011 in Austria for pneumonia after postponing a series of concerts. In 2004, the Radio Academy declared that his music had been played on British radio more than that of any artist between 1984 and 2004. That year, Michael told USA TODAY that he \u201cwas kind of glad that my success level went down in America. I got more of a life, got to enjoy being in America, with less attention than I was used to in Europe. But now I\u2019m strong again. I feel ready to take on the world.\u201d Contributing: The Associated Press 29295 CONNECT TWEET 48 LINKEDIN 134 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iuBm8m NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

    "text": "Russia Examines All Possible Reasons for Black Sea Jet Crash By vladimir isachenkov and veronika silchenko, associated press SOCHI, Russia \u0097 Dec 25, 2016, 3:15 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this photo taken on Thursday, March 31, 2016, the Alexandrov Ensemble choir performs during a concert in Moscow, Russia. A Russian plane with 92 people aboard, including the well-known military band, crashed into the Black Sea on its way to Syria on Sunday, Dec. 25, minutes after takeoff from the resort city of Sochi, the Defense Ministry said. The Tu-154, which belonged to the ministry, was taking the Alexandrov Ensemble to a concert at the Russian air base in Syria. (AP Photo) 0 Shares Email Backed by ships, helicopters and drones, Russian rescue teams searched Sunday for victims after a Russian plane carrying 92 people to Syria crashed into the Black Sea shortly after takeoff. Investigators said they were looking into every possible cause for the crash, including a terror attack. All 84 passengers and eight crew members on the Russian military's Tu-154 plane are believed to have died when it crashed two minutes after taking off at 5:25 a.m. in good weather from the southern Russian city of Sochi. The passengers included dozens of singers in Russia's world-famous military choir. More than 3,000 rescue workers on 32 ships \u2014 including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia \u2014 were searching the crash site at sea and along the shore, the Defense Ministry said. Helicopters, drones and submersibles were being used to help spot bodies and debris. Powerful spotlights were brought in so the operation could continue all night. Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) from shore. By Sunday evening, rescue teams had recovered 11 bodies and Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said fragments of other bodies were also found. Asked if a terror attack was a possibility, Sokolov said investigators were looking into every possible reason for the crash. Several experts noted factors that suggested a terror attack, such as the crew's failure to report any malfunction and the fact that plane debris was scattered over a wide area. The plane was taking the Defense Ministry's choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble, to perform at a New Year's concert at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. Those on board also included nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor famous for her work in war zones. Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television to declare Monday a nationwide day of mourning. \"We will conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons and will do everything to support the victims' families,\" Putin said. The Black Sea search area \u2014 which covered over 10 square kilometers (about 4 square miles) \u2014 was made more difficult by underwater currents that carried debris and body fragments into the open sea. Sokolov said the plane's flight recorders did not have radio beacons, so locating them on the seabed was going to be challenging. The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively in Russia and worldwide. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 and this year, according to the Defense Ministry. Magomed Tolboyev, a decorated Russian test pilot, said it was clear that all on board had died in the crash. \"There is no chance to survive in such situation,\" he said, according to the Interfax news agency. Before Sokolov spoke to reporters in Sochi, senior Russian lawmakers had ruled out a terror attack, arguing that the military plane was under reliable protection. Security is particularly tight in Sochi, the Black Sea city that hosted the 2014 Winter Games and is regularly visited by Putin, who often receives foreign leaders at his residence there. But some experts said the crew's failure to report a malfunction pointed at a possible terror attack. \"Possible malfunctions ... certainly wouldn't have prevented the crew from reporting them,\" Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti. Vadim Lukashevich, an independent aviation expert, told Dozhd TV that the crew's failure to communicate an equipment failure and the large area over which the plane's fragments were scattered raises the possibility of an attack. Alexander Gusak, a former chief of a SWAT team at the main domestic security agency, the FSB, told Dozhd that Russian airports are still vulnerable to terror threats despite security cordons. \"It's possible to penetrate them. It's a matter of skills,\" he said. Russian planes have been brought down previously by terror attacks. In October 2015, a Russian plane carrying mostly Russian tourists back from vacation in Egypt was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane's luggage compartment. The local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up in the skies over Russia on the same day by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility. In the last year, the Russian military has repeatedly flown Russian singers and artists to perform at Hemeimeem, the main hub for the Russian air campaign in Syria. The passenger list released by the Defense Ministry included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, including its leader, Valery Khalilov. The ensemble is the official choir of the Russian military and also includes a band and a dance company. The choir sang \"Get Lucky\" at the opening of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, becoming an online sensation. The damage to the choir was reported to be devastating. Viktor Yeliseyev, head of the rival choir for the Russian National Guard, said \"most singers of the choir have died.\" Also on board was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work, which has included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said Glinka was accompanying a medical shipment for a hospital in Syria. \"We never feel sure that we will come back alive,\" she said when Putin presented her with an award earlier this month. \"But we are sure that kindness, compassion and charity are stronger than any weapon.\" Syrian President Bashar Assad was among numerous foreign leaders who sent their condolences to Putin, saying he received news of the crash \"with deep grief and sadness.\" In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and other Russian government agencies have continued to use them. While noisy and fuel-guzzling, the plane is popular with crews that appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \"It's an excellent plane, which has proven its reliability during decades of service,\" veteran pilot Oleg Smirnov said. Still, since 1994, there's been 17 major plane crashes involving the Tu-154 that have killed over 1,760 people in all. Most resulted from human error. In the latest previous deadly crash of a Tu-154, a plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others crashed in April 2010 while trying to land at a military airport in Smolensk in western Russia, killing everyone on board. Investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather, but Polish authorities have launched a new probe. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Isachenkov reported from Moscow. Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Abir Sultan/AP hide caption toggle caption Abir Sultan/AP Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu escalated his criticism of the U.S. on Sunday, summoning Ambassador Dan Shapiro to Israel. Abir Sultan/AP In remarks at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed \"anger and frustration\" over the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Israel summoned 10 ambassadors to Israel from countries that voted in favor of the resolution, as well as the U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro. Netanyahu escalated his criticism of the U.S. for abstaining, even accusing President Obama of orchestrating the resolution himself. \"From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. He added the following in English: \"Over decades, American administrations and Israeli governments had disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the Security Council was not the place to resolve this issue. We knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace further away. \"And, as I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don't take friends to the Security Council. I'm encouraged by the statements of our friends in the United States, Republicans and Democrats alike. They understand how reckless and destructive this U.N. resolution was, they understand that the Western Wall isn't occupied territory.\" Article continues after sponsorship Security Council Condemns Israeli Settlements As U.S. Abstains From Vote Netanyahu added that he looks forward to working with the new administration when it takes office next month. President-elect Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the U.S. abstention, tweeting Friday , \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" NPR's Bill Chappell reported on Friday: \"In explaining the U.S. abstention, Ambassador Samantha Power said the move doesn't signal diminished U.S. support for Israel; she later added that the continued construction of settlements 'seriously undermines Israel's security.' \"Power said, 'The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades.' \" Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to President Obama, told reporters on Friday that the administration \"tried everything.\" \"Prime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today,\" Rhodes said. \"Absent this acceleration of settlement activity, absent the type of rhetoric we've seen out of the current Israeli government, I think the United States likely would have taken a different view, because our preference is for there to be a credible peace process underway.\" A U.N. spokesperson said in a statement that the secretary-general welcomed the adoption of the resolution, adding that it was a \"significant step, demonstrating the Council's much needed leadership and the international community's collective efforts to reconfirm that the vision of two States is still achievable.\" ",
