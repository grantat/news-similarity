Shares of Lockheed Martin fell Monday, Dec. 12, 2016, as President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that making F-35 fighter planes is too costly and that he will cut \"billions\" in costs for military purchases. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump has taken to Twitter again to express his displeasure about the price tag of an aircraft. \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\" he tweeted Thursday. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump's tweet comes the day after he met with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin to discuss the F-35 fighter and the new Air Force One . In recent weeks Trump has tweeted about the high costs of the new Air Force One and the F-35 that is intended to become the main fighter aircraft for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps . On Wednesday Trump met separately with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida to discuss both programs. Those meetings were followed by a separate meeting with senior military officials involved with the development of both aircraft. The Pentagon is in the process of purchasing 2,443 F-35 fighters that will become the standard fighter aircraft for the military. The F-35 has stealth capability and is one of the most highly computerized aircraft to ever fly. Each F-35 costs about $112 million to produce, but Lockheed Martin estimates that costs will go down as more aircraft are produced so that by 2019 each F-35 will cost $85 million. The F/A-18 is a fighter aircraft that went into use in the 1980s by the Navy and Marine Corps as a carrier-based aircraft. It is not flown by the Air Force. The Navy and Marine Corps are in the process of modernizing their F/A-18 aircraft until they are all eventually replaced by the F-35. \"I had a productive meeting with President-elect Trump this afternoon,\" Marillyn Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed Martin, said in a statement following her meeting Wednesday with Trump. \"I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 program and the progress we've made in bringing costs down. The F-35 is a critical program to our national security , and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our U.S. military and our allies.\" Trump later met with Air Force generals and Navy admirals involved with both programs. He told reporters the meeting was focused on \"trying to get costs down cost primarily the F-35 trying to get the costs down cause it's a program that's very very expensive.\" \"We are going to get the costs down and get it done beautifully,\" he added. He described the senior military officials he met with as \"great people, amazing people, I'm very impressed with them and very good negotiators.\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg described his meeting with Trump about the new Air Force One as a \"very productive\" discussion. Muilenberg said that they could produce the new Air Force One \"affordably\" for less than the $4 billion price tag that Trump has described for the aircraft that will go into service in 2024. \"We will get it done for less than that,\" Muilenberg told reporters. The Air Force has projected that over the next five years the new Air Force One could cost $2.78 billion, but there is no full contract with Boeing yet. For now, the Air Force has spent almost $170 million on three small contracts with Boeing related to the project. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 8:37 PM EST CANBERRA, Australia - Police in Australia have detained five men suspected of planning a series of Christmas Day bomb attacks in the heart of the country\u2019s second-largest city, officials said Friday. The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne\u2019s Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Victoria state Police\u00a0 Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. A manhunt is underway for the person behind that attack, which prompted increases in security around the world. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne - a 26-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman - were released without being charged, police said. Five men between the ages 21 and 26 remained in custody and would be charged later Friday with preparing a terrorist attack. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives, knives and a gun, Ashton said. Police believed the threat had been neutralized through the raids on five Melbourne premises, he said. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cThis is one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years.\u201d \u201cIslamist terrorism is a global challenge that affects us all. But we must not be cowed by the terrorists,\u201d Turnbull told reporter. \u201cWe will continue to go about our lives as we always have. What these criminals seek to do is to kill. But they also seek to frighten us, to cow us into abandoning our Australian way of life. They want to frighten Australians. They want to divide Australians. They want us to turn on each other. We will not let them succeed,\u201d he added. Since Australia\u2019s terrorist threat level was elevated in September 2014, the government says there have been four extremist attacks and 12 plots foiled by police. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the plotters had moved very quickly from a plan to develop a capability to attack. \u201cIn terms of events that we have seen over the past few years in Australia, this certainly concerns me more than any other event that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cWe believe that we have removed the bulk of this particular cell, this group,\u201d he said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. About 400 police officers were involved in the raids. Ashton described those arrested as \u201cself-radicalized\u201d and inspired by Islamic State propaganda. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DEC. 22, 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December It was a year to be confounded, shocked, humbled. Donald J. Trump won the American presidency, defying polls, mockery and fear to defeat Hillary Clinton. Britons jolted their country and the world by voting to leave the European Union. Syria\u2019s agony played out before a largely indifferent world, its children staring into the camera with eyes wide in terror, blood flecking their clothing. The president of the Philippines unleashed a merciless war on drugs, boasting of killing drug dealers himself when he was a mayor, and many of his citizens cheered him on. Climate change created a new class of refugees, even as climate-change skeptics were nominated to key United States cabinet posts. And talk about shocking: The Chicago Cubs won the World Series after a drought of 108 years. It was a year so unexpected, so tumultuous, that the fight has just begun over which narrative might possibly explain it. For some, it was the comeuppance of the elites and the rebellion of the forgotten white working class. Or it was the triumph of resentment, rage and racism. Or payback for identity politics. Or perhaps it was a rallying cry for identity politics. One lesson was clear: Economic and cultural upheavals have consequences. Free trade and globalization, many economists argue, are inexorable forces. But in the United States as in Europe, the exodus of high-paying manufacturing jobs has taken a political as well as an economic toll. Chancellor Angela Merkel lifted many hearts and outraged others when she opened Germany\u2019s doors to desperate refugees. But as in Britain, France, and Italy, there was a backlash from those who conflate Muslim refugees with terrorism, and migrants with economic competition. After terrorist attacks from Paris to Nice, Berlin to Brussels, a frightened world is further barring its doors. Was there ever such an American election? The spectacle that was the Trump campaign riveted the world. The images are indelible: Mr. Trump in silhouette drawing thousands to ecstatic rallies where he pledged to bring back jobs, but also of crowds spewing hate. Hillary Clinton raced to make history as the first female president, allowing herself a brief moment of exultation, arms thrown wide. Then the surprise of her narrow defeat: Women pasted \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers on Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave, while soon after, President Obama welcomed President-elect Trump to the White House. Violence struck in Orlando, with gay revelers attacked at the Pulse nightclub, and in Dallas and Baton Rouge, where the targets were law enforcement officers. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were gunned down by the police. Rape, as ever a tool of war, was deployed by the Islamic State against Yazidi sex slaves. Mexican women, sexually assaulted by the police, broke their silence. Meanwhile, Zika continued to ravage its victims. Cholera was the latest of the scourges visited on Haiti. Empty shelves and emaciated mental patients showed the worsening toll of Venezuela\u2019s failing economy. It was a year in desperate need of grace notes. Simone Biles and American gymnastics team entranced the world at the Olympic Games in Brazil. Vienna waltzes soared at the New York City Ballet. And then there was Zarifeh Shalabi, elected prom queen in Fontana, Calif., with her crown atop her hijab. So much to absorb. Yet if 2016 was a world turned upside down, as the cast of the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton\u201d sings of the American Revolution, just wait until next year. \u2014 SUSAN CHIRA Speaking at the White House, President Obama condemned gun violence with tears in his eyes.

Since winning the election, Trump has said America's \"one-China\" policy regarding China and Taiwan is up for negotiation , tweeted that the US should refuse to accept an underwater drone seized and returned by China, criticized the intelligence community's findings on Russian hacking, and threatened to reverse ongoing overtures toward Cuba unless the Cuban government meets unspecified conditions.

Later in the day, Trump tweeted that the United States \"must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" Incoming leaders have typically abided by a \"one president at a time\" rule in order to avoid sending mixed messages and to give themselves time to consult intelligence and confer with their incoming cabinet and inherited civil service. \"It's confusing,\" Stephen Hess, a policy analyst at Brookings who has worked under presidents from both parties, said. \"The president-elect doesn't really have the power to do these things and, while suggesting them at this time, it may look very different to him after January 20.\" Related: Trump Stuns Nuclear Experts With Apparent Call to Expand Arsenal Trump shattered a variety of norms during the campaign and often complained about an atmosphere of \"political correctness\" that he said had prevented politicians from speaking plainly about challenges facing the country. Critics are concerned that his often unpredictable style could create problems for both his incoming administration and the current one. Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA) told NBC News he was so alarmed by Trump's behavior that he introduced the \"One President at a Time Act\" earlier this month, which would clarify that the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from conducting foreign policy, also applies to incoming presidents. \"In the past, president-elects have shown good judgement and restraint in understanding that our duly elected officials need to conduct foreign policy while they're in office,\" Huffman said. \"We've never had a president-elect with such impulse control problems.\" Modern presidents have used nearly identical language to skirt questions on foreign affairs during their transition. President Bill Clinton told the press after his 1992 victory that he would \"reaffirm the essential continuity of American foreign policy\" and recognized \"that America has only one president at a time.\" President George W. Bush declined questions on topics like North Korea and Israel until he took the oath of office in early 2001. \"We have one president, and we'll have one president, and the current president is President Clinton, and our nation must speak with one voice,\" Bush said at a press conference. Obama took a similar stance after his election in 2008, telling reporters that \"when it comes to foreign affairs, it is particularly important to emphasize that there is one president at a time\" after declining a question on Israeli operations in Gaza. He notably repeated the phrase last month after Trump's election, reminding the press that \"there is one president at a time\" before embarking to meet foreign leaders in Greece, Germany, and Peru.

By Karen DeYoung December 22 at 7:22 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Before lunchtime Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump said he would expand the U.S. nuclear arsenal , upending a reduction course set by presidents of both parties over the past four decades, and called for the United States to veto a pending U.N. resolution that criticized Israel\u2019s settlements policy. The policy prescriptions, communicated in morning tweets, followed calls since last month\u2019s election to reconsider the arms-length U.S. relationship with Taiwan and to let China keep an underwater U.S. vessel seized by its navy. Trump declared within hours of this week\u2019s Berlin terrorist attack that it was part of a global Islamic State campaign to \u201cslaughter Christians\u201d and later said it reaffirmed the wisdom of his plans to bar Muslim immigrants. Late Thursday, Trump suggested in another tweet that the U.S. military\u2019s years-in-the-making plans for a new stealth fighter, Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 , might be reconsidered, saying he had \u201casked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\u201d With weeks to go before he becomes president, Trump has not hesitated to voice his opinions on national security issues of the day and to publicly advise the current president on what to do about them. Ultimately, the nuclear statement was tempered by a Trump spokesman. And the likely fallout from a tentative decision by the Obama administration to break years of precedent and abstain on the Israel resolution was avoided when Egypt, its sponsor, abruptly postponed it just hours before a scheduled Security Council vote. But the president-elect\u2019s pronouncements have privately riled a White House that has repeatedly insisted in public that the transition has been smooth sailing. Asked last week whether he was trying to help Trump, a professed admirer of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, understand Russia\u2019s responsibility for the civil-war carnage in Aleppo , Syria, President Obama said he would \u201chelp President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he\u2019s sworn in, can make a decision.\u201d \u201cBetween now and then,\u201d Obama said firmly, it was up to him to decide what to do. \u201cThese are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations that I have with our military and the people who have been working this every day.\u201d Even as the White House has held its tongue, however, others have not. Trump provided no details in his tweet calling for the United States to \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.\u201d But \u201cif he means what he says,\u201d said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a Washington-based security foundation, \u201cthis could be the end of the arms-control process that reduced 80\u00a0percent of our Cold War arsenal.\u201d Former congressman John Tierney (D-Mass.), executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in a statement, \u201cIt is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet.\u201d Under New START, the treaty negotiated by Obama with Russia and ratified by the Senate in 2010, the United States and Russia by February 2018 must have no more than 1,550 strategic weapons deployed. While there is widespread agreement that the U.S. deterrent must be modernized, little enthusiasm has been expressed elsewhere for increasing the number of nuclear warheads. Trump spokesman Jason Miller later said that was not precisely what Trump meant. Rather than calling for more nuclear weapons, Miller told Yahoo News, he was referring to \u201cthe threat of nuclear proliferation\u201d and \u201cthe need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s U.N. tweet was more explicit and more immediate. \u201cThe resolution being considered . . . should be vetoed,\u201d he said in a pre-dawn tweet referring to the Egyptian measure. The resolution condemned \u201cthe construction and expansion of settlements\u201d in the West Bank and mostly Palestinian East Jerusalem, along with \u201cthe transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians.\u201d Saying the settlements have \u201cno legal validity,\u201d it demanded that Israel \u201cimmediately cease all settlement activities.\u201d Although consideration of such a measure has been circulated at the United Nations for weeks \u2014 and similar measures have for years brought a consistent U.S. veto \u2014 it was not until Wednesday night that word began to circulate that the United States might abstain and allow it to pass. While successive administrations have considered the settlements an impediment to an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Obama administration has grown increasingly irate over what it feels is Israel\u2019s flouting of its concerns. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A July announcement that 770 new homes were to be built in the East Jerusalem settlement of Gilo drew particularly sharp U.S. criticism. At the same time, right-wing voices in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are pushing for legislation that would legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. The \u201clegalization bill\u201d stems from a court-ordered demolition of the Amona settlement, which sits on land owned by a Palestinian farmer. Amona was meant to be demolished next week, but on Thursday it received an additional month of reprieve from the court. Residents brokered a deal with the government to move their homes to a nearby location, essentially creating a new settlement. During the campaign, Trump frequently criticized what he described as the administration\u2019s failure to fully support Israel. Last week, he named David Friedman \u2014 a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has given strong financial support and other backing to the Israeli settlement movement and has said Trump supports Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory \u2014 as his ambassador to Israel. During the campaign, Trump also charged that Obama had helped promote terrorism by supporting \u201cthe ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt\u201d \u2014 that of long-standing autocrat Hosni Mubarak \u2014 and more recently by failing to fully back the military government that overthrew Mubarak\u2019s elected replacement. In an interview last weekend with a Portuguese news agency, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi said that Trump \u201chas shown deep and great understanding of what is taking place in the region as a whole and Egypt in particular. I am looking forward and expecting more support and reinforcement of our bilateral relations.\u201d Once it became clear late Wednesday that the settlements vote was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, Trump officials said the transition gave the administration a \u201cheads-up\u201d that the president-elect was going to publicly call for a U.S. veto. At the end of the day Thursday, it was not entirely clear what led Egypt to withdraw the resolution. At the State Department, spokesman John Kirby said that Egypt had pulled it back in order to have \u201cdiscussions with its Arab League partners\u201d over the wording of the text. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who supported an abstention and was clearly expecting to deliver a pre-vote speech announcing it, along with an outline of future prospects for Middle East peace, canceled his plans. Elsewhere within the administration, officials said Israel had twisted Egypt\u2019s arm and threatened to work against its interests in Congress. Several Arab officials said they were convinced that the United States had pressured Egypt to postpone the vote. In Israel, where a late-night cabinet meeting was convened Wednesday to consider the possibility of a U.S. abstention, Netanyahu sent out a dead-of-night tweet calling for a U.S. veto. It was quickly followed by Trump\u2019s own, near-identical tweet. Deriding \u201cthe imposition of terms set by the United Nations,\u201d Trump said in a later statement that passage of the resolution would put Israel \u201cin a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201d Later in the day, a transition official told the Reuters news agency, Trump spoke by telephone with Sissi.

A \"significant\" Islamic State-inspired Christmas Day terror plot targeting central Melbourne has been foiled after a series of arrests in raids across the city, police said on December 23, 2016. (Photo: WILLIAM WEST, AFP/Getty Images) Australian authorities say they have broken up a\u00a0Christmas Day plot to set off bombs in Melbourne, the country's second-largest city. Dubbing their investigation \"Operation Kastelholm,\" Victoria police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization said Friday that five people are being held in connection with the plot. All of them are listed as having Australian addresses. \"It will be alleged four of the men arrested were involved in undertaking preparations for planning a terrorist act in Melbourne,\" Victoria police said in a statement, adding that \"the threat has been contained and there is no on-going threat.\" The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne \u2014 26-year-old man and 20-year-old woman \u2014 were released without being charged, a police statement said. Five men between ages 21 and 26 remained in custody. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship, police said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. Ashton said police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device,\" Ashton said. He added: \"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" About 400 police officers were involved in the raids.

Both sides were pointing fingers in the aftermath of the unproductive special session, called specifically to consider repeal legislation for the law known as House Bill 2. The law omits gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people from state anti-discrimination protections, bars local governments from passing broad non-discrimination ordinances covering them, and orders transgender people to use bathrooms and showers that align with their sex at birth. \"I'm disappointed that we have yet to remove the stain from the reputation of our great state that is around this country and around the world,\" Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper said. But Republicans put the blame squarely on Democrats, noting that all 16 Senate Democrats voted against the repeal legislation in the end. Republicans in the Senate fell on both sides of the issue, with some voting to repeal and some voting against. Senate leader Phil Berger, a Republican, blamed Cooper and his allies for sinking the effort. He issued a lengthy statement on Facebook and Twitter accusing Democrats of \u201chypocrisy\u201d and accusing them of using the controversy for political gain. See the HYPOCRISY for yourself. Every Democrat in the Senate voted AGAINST repealing HB 2: https://t.co/7SJwDEm5nb #NCGA #NCPOL pic.twitter.com/3LS3N4pa3j \u2014 Senator Phil Berger (@SenatorBerger) December 22, 2016 \u201cThis should tell you all you need to know about Cooper and Senate Democrats\u2019 motives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t interested in moving past this issue or protecting the privacy and safety of North Carolina families. They\u2019re brass-knuckled politicians who want to wage a nasty culture war with divisive issues, so they can keep filling their campaign coffers with cash from fringe liberal activists.\u201d GOP legislators who see themselves as business-friendly appeared shaken by a months-long backlash as major companies like BASF, IBM and Bank of America described HB2 as bad for business. The compromise touted by both Cooper and outgoing GOP Gov. Pat McCrory called for Charlotte to do away with its own expanded antidiscrimination ordinance. In exchange, lawmakers would undo the LGBT law. But some conservatives never wanted to repeal the law. And when the Senate bill went a step further and called for a months-long ban on cities passing similar ordinances, Democrats said Republicans were going back on their promise.\u00a0 Cooper reportedly said GOP leaders \u201cbroke the deal\u201d by adding the local ordinance moratorium.\u00a0 Berger, however, noted that the Senate ended up splitting the bill into two parts, allowing a straight vote on the repeal only. It still failed. \u201cAll 16 of them voted NO. Why? Politics. Hypocrisy. And Roy Cooper,\u201d he wrote. North Carolina GOP Chairman Robin Hayes accused Democrats of \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Social conservatives also opposed the repeal for their own reasons, defending the law's transgender bathroom requirement -- which has no enforcement or punishment provisions -- as necessary to prevent heterosexual predators from masquerading as transgender to molest women and girls when they are vulnerable. \"We continue to encourage our leaders to never sacrifice the privacy, safety, or freedom of young girls by forcing them to use the bathroom, shower, or change clothes with grown men just to satisfy the demands of greedy businesses, immoral sports organizations, or angry mobs,\" North Carolina Values Coalition Executive Director Tami Fitzgerald said in a statement. HB2 has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in conventions, jobs and sporting events such as the NBA All-Star Game shunning North Carolina. Corporate critics of the law included Deutsche Bank and Paypal, which both backed out of projects that would have brought hundreds of jobs to the state. \"The NCAA's decision to withhold championships from North Carolina remains unchanged,\" spokesman Bob Williams said. McCrory signed the law and became its national face. HB2, along with other right-leaning bills he signed, turned this fall's gubernatorial campaign into a referendum on the state's recent conservative slant. He lost by about 10,000 votes to Cooper. Meanwhile, fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. McCrory, the first sitting North Carolina governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election, echoed Republican accusations that \"the left sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes.\" Repealing the state law could also have ended protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access.

The emails show he used his personal email accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. Emails of Mayor Rahm Emanuel have been released under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits. The emails show he used his personal email accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Ally Marotti and Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel is just as bullish on Chicago business in private emails as he is in public. Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, the mayor on Wednesday turned over about 2,700 pages of emails from his personal accounts that his attorney determined were government-related. Though many of the emails are short, and the mayor's only involvement often was forwarding them to an aide, they show Emanuel using his personal accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. They also show that business leaders knew how to reach him outside of his government email address. The emails reveal Emanuel's desire to bring a PayPal operations center to the city, and his reluctance to \"bash\" one of the city's largest private-sector employers. There are also emails with big asks from companies like Airbnb and H.J. Heinz. United Airlines Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... In April 2014, investment banker Byron Trott sent an email to Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... (Rick Pearson, David Heinzmann and Jeff Coen) Jonathan Tisch, co-chairman of the board of Loews, chairman and CEO of its Loews Hotel subsidiary and chairman emeritus of the United States Travel Association, emailed Emanuel in May, seeking to rebut airlines' concerns about competition from Middle Eastern airlines allegedly receiving unfair subsidies. Emanuel responded that he was unlikely to square off against Chicago-based United Continental Holdings. \"I dont (sic) plan on being like some mayors and bash my largest private sector employer,\" Emanuel wrote in an email last May. \"That said please send someone to brief us.\" United's name popped up again in a July 1 exchange between Emanuel and Kirkland & Ellis attorney William Singer, who sent Emanuel a copy of a letter to Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans. Singer said the letter explained a United proposal that reflects \"short term, but significant growth for O'Hare\" and that United is \"fully committed to the city's long term growth and expansion plans.\" The email exchange doesn't offer details on the proposal, but Emanuel appeared frustrated by the pace of progress and lack of detailed plans. \"If you all expected yippie lets go you got the wrong mayor,\" he said. Still, he said he told the aviation commissioner to give the proposal \"her full attention,\" signing off with \"be bold.\" Kraft Heinz Before H.J. Heinz completed its purchase of Kraft Foods Group in July 2015, an executive emailed then-deputy mayor Steve Koch to push the state and city to spell out what tax breaks they would be willing to offer to put some of the combined company's jobs in Chicago. \"If the state and Chicago are not going to offer a significant tax incentive program that will weight heavenly (sic) in our decision on how many jobs remain in Illinois given how aggressive Pennsylvania is being,\" senior vice president of corporate and government affairs Michael Mullen wrote in a June 2015 email. The email was shared with Emanuel, whose reply to Koch was redacted. A few weeks after Kraft, then based in north suburban Northfield, and Pittsburgh-based Heinz combined to form the third-largest food and beverage company in the U.S., Kraft Heinz announced it would move the Northfield headquarters to downtown Chicago's Aon Center. Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, Mayor Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... (Bill Ruthhart, Hal Dardick and Jeff Coen) Kraft Heinz ended up not getting any tax incentives related to the move, Mullen said in an email to the Tribune Thursday. \"The Mayor and his staff were instrumental in our decision to move downtown and we appreciate their ongoing cooperation and partnership,\" he said. PayPal Emanuel reached out to PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready in October, to figure out why the San Jose, Calif.-based company passed over Chicago as a location for an operations center. Other cities offered better incentives, Ready explained in his lengthy response. He specifically mentioned Illinois' EDGE program, which provides tax breaks for companies that bring jobs to the state. Mayor Rahm Emanuel turned over about 2,700 pages of emails Wednesday as part of a settlement with the Better Government Association, which had sued for the mayor's communications about official business on his personal email accounts.

A Chicago Tribune suit on similar issues, filed before the BGA... (Chicago Tribune) \"We are unable to monetize a majority of the credits being offered to the company before they expire.\" The top contending city was offering cash grants and refundable tax credits, Ready wrote. That reasoning was news to Emanuel. \"Somewhere there is a breakdown of information,\" he replied. There is still time for Chicago, and the potential operations center is part of a bigger strategy, Ready said in an email Oct. 28. PayPal representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Airbnb The city's new shared-housing ordinance and how it would affect Airbnb hosts was a hot topic in the mayor's inbox. Investor Marc Andreessen emailed Emanuel in November 2015, asking him to meet with Chris Lehane, Airbnb's head of global policy, to discuss Chicago's regulatory plans. Emanuel's private emails released These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 See more videos Airbnb representatives said they thought Emanuel wasn't \"fully aware of what the bureaucrats have been working on,\" according to an email Andreessen forwarded to the mayor. Asking for the meeting seemed to be a drastic measure: In one of the emails, Andreessen's people call it an \"unusual ask\" by Airbnb. Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit said in a statement that the home-sharing company works with cities worldwide on clear and progressive home-sharing rules. \"Speaking with policymakers and community leaders is essential to crafting home-sharing rules that work for everyone,\" he said. The implementation of the ordinance has since been delayed and tweaked after being challenged by a couple of lawsuits. Talking up Chicago Occasionally, Emanuel sent emails to Chicago executives and other heavy hitters from his private account touting positive news about the city. On Sept. 1, he sent four dozen people, including United CEO Oscar Munoz, Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld and McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook the same email, with personalized salutations, highlighting improvements in Chicago Public Schools students' test scores and Fitch Ratings agency's decision to shift the city's credit outlook from \"negative\" to \"stable.\" ",

    "text": "Read more stories He greeted a handful of supporters who came and went throughout the trial, some with lapel pins in the shape of a sheriff\u2019s badge. On some days it was just his wife, Carol, by the aging lawman\u2019s side.\u00a0 He chose not to testify in his defense, unlike Tanaka, who took the stand in his own obstruction trial earlier this year and sought to lay the blame squarely at Baca\u2019s feet. Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before convicting Tanaka, who has since been sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the obstruction plot. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors struck a deal with Baca, in which the retired sheriff\u00a0pleaded guilty to a single charge of making false statements to federal investigators. In exchange, he was to receive\u00a0a sentence of no more than six months in prison. U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson\u00a0rejected the deal, calling it\u00a0too lenient, and Baca and his attorneys chose instead to withdraw his plea and put his fate in the hands of 12\u00a0fellow citizens. Although prosecutors told the six-man, six-woman jury at the outset of the trial that Baca was the \u201cheartbeat,\u201d the \u201cleader\u201d and the \u201cdriving force\u201d of the conspiracy, few of the government\u2019s witnesses testified to direct interactions with Baca during the time of the alleged interference with federal authorities. A former L.A. Times reporter testified that Baca said in an interview that he directed two sergeants to go to the home of FBI agent Leah Tanner, then known as Leah Marx. The sergeants confronted her and falsely informed her they were obtaining a warrant for her arrest. Prosecutors alleged\u00a0the move was an attempt to intimidate Tanner\u00a0and get the FBI to back off. A former U.S. attorney, now a federal judge, recalled phone calls and meetings with Baca in which the\u00a0then-sheriff seemed to be in the know about developments in the case.\u00a0 Jurors also heard a recorded conversation between an FBI supervisor and Sgt. Maricela Long, who has also been convicted in the obstruction case, in which the supervisor asked\u00a0whether Baca was aware his subordinates had threatened Tanner\u00a0with arrest.\u00a0 \u201cThe\u00a0sheriff knows this, sir,\u201d Long said on the recording. Two other deputies who have been convicted of playing a part in the conspiracy told jurors that while they had little to no contact with Baca, it was made clear to them the orders came all the way\u00a0from the top.\u00a0One said he watched a nervous supervisor walk into Baca\u2019s office to notify him that deputies had mistakenly allowed FBI agents to meet with the inmate who was working as a federal informant. The prosecution presented jurors with phone records, emails and meetings scheduled on calendars to show that Baca was in contact with Tanaka as the machinations played out. But Hochman countered that his client could have been discussing any number of issues he dealt with as the head of the department's sprawling operation. In more than 100 emails presented by prosecutors as evidence of the obstruction plot,\u00a0Baca\u00a0was directly involved in only two, Hochman said. And while Tanaka was exchanging dozens of calls with the subordinates charged in the case,\u00a0Baca\u00a0was on only one. \u201cThe sheriff never knew about this;\u00a0the sheriff was out of the loop,\u201d Hochman said. He asked jurors to instead look at the rest of Baca\u2019s\u00a0lengthy career to decide whether he would be the type of leader to evade federal scrutiny. He\u00a0pointed to steps Baca took to better conditions in the jails, and put on the stand Baca\u2019s high-powered friends \u2014\u00a0including two former district attorneys \u2014\u00a0who called him \u201claw-abiding\u201d with an \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cvery solid\u201d reputation. Prosecutors, Hochman argued, were \u201cthrowing some spaghetti against the wall to see if anything sticks against Sheriff\u00a0Baca.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Toy shopping \u00a0around Christmas, a 78-year-old climbs Mt.

Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images A woman is vaccinated at a health center in Conakry, Guinea, during the clinical trials of a vaccine against the Ebola virus. Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images When Ebola struck West Africa a few years ago, the world was defenseless. There was no cure. No vaccine. And the result was catastrophic: More than 11,000 people died. Nearly 30,000 were infected. Now it looks like such a large outbreak is unlikely to ever happen again. Ever. The world now has a potent weapon against Ebola: a vaccine that brings outbreaks to a screeching halt, scientists report Thursday in The Lancet. \"We were able to estimate the efficacy of the vaccine as being 100 percent in a trial with more than 5,000 people,\" says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who helped test the vaccine. \"It's very unusual to have a vaccine that protects people perfectly.\" Now, no vaccine \u2014 or drug for that matter \u2014 is perfect. And efficacy of the vaccine is clearly high but not \"100 percent.\" That value reflects the fact that they just haven't tested the vaccine on enough people yet. So it is likely to decrease as the vaccine is used over time. In the end, the efficacy is likely to sit somewhere between about 70 percent and 100 percent, Longini says. Article continues after sponsorship By comparison, the flu vaccine last year was about 50 percent effective. And the Ebola vaccine works lightning fast, within four or five days, he says. So it could even be given after a person is exposed to Ebola but hasn't yet developed the disease. Longini and his colleagues tested the vaccine on about 4,000 people in Guinea back in 2015, when Ebola was still spreading there. These people were at high risk of getting Ebola because they had had contact with someone who was infected. When they got the vaccine right away, they were completely protected. No one got sick. The vaccine \u2014 called rVSV-ZEBOV \u2014 hasn't been approved yet by either the World Health Organization or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That's predicted to happen sometime in 2018. And there are still a few open questions about the vaccine, says Dr. Anthony Fauci , at the National Institutes of Health. \"For example, we don't know how durable the vaccine is,\" he says. \"If you give health care workers the vaccine, for example, how long would they be protected? That's very important to learn.\" What is clear is that the vaccine offers short-term protection during outbreaks. And that's exactly what's needed to stop the virus from spreading and keep small outbreaks from getting out of control. For this reason, GAVI \u2014 the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \u2014 has already spent $5 million to stockpile the vaccine. \"So we have made 300,000 doses available, as of earlier this year, if there was to be sort of any resurgence or any kind of emergency,\" says Swati Gupta at Merck , which is manufacturing the shot. Vaccines typically take years, even a decade to test. But the field trials for this one took less than two years. \"It's been a pretty tremendous experience,\" Gupta says. \"There's been a lot of international partners that have come together in a real unprecedented effort.\" The magnitude of the outbreak in West Africa, she says, made companies, governments and academics push aside their own research agendas to come together and finish a vaccine.
