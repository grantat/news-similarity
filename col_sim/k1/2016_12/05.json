Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told NBC News that he was \"thankful that there were some leaders in the federal government that realized that something is not right even though it's legal.\" \"This is something that will go down in history, and I know that it's a blessing for all indigenous peoples,\" he said. The Army Corps released a statement saying it would not approve the easement that would have allowed the proposed pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe, a large reservoir on the Missouri River in North Dakota.

Federal officials had given activists, who include Native American tribe members and non-members alike, a deadline of Monday to vacate the camp because of worries about the plunging temperatures. The planned route for the 1,172-mile Dakota Access oil pipeline would have run within a half-mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, crossing beneath the Missouri River. Activists celebrate Sunday at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Jim Watson / AFP - Getty Images Opponents had said the pipeline would adversely affect drinking water and disturb sacred tribal sites. The Obama administration several times asked that Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the project, stop construction. But the installation of hyper-beam lights there last month showed that the request was rejected. Photos: Dakota Pipeline Protesters Defy Winter's Chill Energy Transfer Partners Chief Executive Kelcy Warren, who remained publicly silent on the pipeline for months as protests forced a halt in the pipeline's construction, told NBC News last month that he was \"100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration,\" regardless of what the Army Corps ultimately decides. The company did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Army Corps decision. Play ",

Mr. Vega said he had heard from a friend that his brother was at the party. \u201cGive me some gloves. I\u2019ve got work shoes. I\u2019m ready,\u201d Mr. Vega said. \u201cLet me find my brother, that\u2019s all I want.\u201d The structure had a permit to function as a warehouse, but not as a residence or for a party. Officials said they were investigating reports that the building had also been used as a living space. The building, known as the Ghost Ship, in the Fruitvale neighborhood, was the site of an event that was to feature a range of experimental and electronic music, performed by a synth musician drawing from the \u201cblack, queer diaspora\u201d and others, as well as a visual installation. On Saturday morning, the event\u2019s Facebook page said admission to the show was $10 for those who arrived before 11 p.m. and $15 after that. By the end of the day, the pricing had disappeared and the page had turned into an emergency message board, as dozens of friends and family members posted about missing loved ones. \u201cA lot of these people are young people,\u201d Sergeant Kelly said Saturday. \u201cThey are from all parts of our community.\u201d Some of the dead may be citizens of other countries, he said. Images from the building\u2019s website depict a wooden studio filled with antiques, sculptures and curios. Old lamps, musical instruments, suitcases and rugs decorated the ornate space. Photo Melinda Drayton, a battalion chief with the Oakland Fire Department, addressing the news media on Sunday. Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press Emergency workers said they arrived to find the building filled with heavy smoke and flames. Bodies were found on the second floor of the building, Chief Teresa Deloach Reed of the Oakland Fire Department said Saturday. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIn my career of 30 years, I haven\u2019t experienced something of this magnitude,\u201d she said. Even without a full accounting, the fire was one of the deadliest in the United States in many years. In 2003, 100 people were killed in a fire in a nightclub in Warwick, R.I. An explosion at a fertilizer plant in Texas in 2013 killed 15 people. \u2014         Oakland Firefighters (@OaklandFireLive) Dec. 3, 2016 Chief Deloach Reed said there were \u201cno reports of smoke alarms going off.\u201d At least two fire extinguishers were inside, she said. On the event\u2019s Facebook page, people distributed a spreadsheet that listed identifying information \u2014 age, height, weight, hair color, tattoos \u2014 and contact numbers for many of those who were unaccounted for. Oakland\u2019s music and art scene was already struggling with high rent prices. The city\u2019s underground bands and artists live a seminomadic existence in search of warehouses, homes and other spaces to show art, play music and dance into the early hours. Diego Aguilar-Canabal, 24, a blogger and freelance writer who lives in Berkeley and plays guitar in a band called the Noriegas, estimated he had been to three dozen house and warehouse parties over the past two years. \u201cThe basic idea is people want to do loud things late at night, and industrial space is really good for that because there aren\u2019t many neighbors to complain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety about income inequality and class warfare, and a lot of these artists are trying to do the best they can to have a community.\u201d Mr. Aguilar-Canabal has been to the Ghost Ship once, last summer, and remembered it as a dim and cluttered area with a \u201cmaze\u201d of furniture, canvas paintings on the walls and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hanging from the ceilings. \u201cThe reason we left was that it had only had one source of water, which was a sink, and the water tasted really gross,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe went to a corner store to get something to drink and were like, \u2018Let\u2019s just go home.\u2019\u201d Thomas Fuller and Conor Dougherty reported from Oakland, and Jonah Engel Bromwich from New York.

    "text": "An ugly first half morphed into a picturesque victory for the Bears. Jordan Howard ran for three touchdowns as the Bears overcame snowy conditions and the 49ers to record a 26-6 win and improve to 3-9 on the season before 46,622 at Soldier Field on Sunday. Neither team completed a pass in the first... (Chicago Tribune staff) Bryce Callahan fair-caught a punt at his 5. Seriously, dude? Like the offense doesn\u2019t stink enough, and now the punt returner can\u2019t let the ball perhaps bounce into the end zone for a touchback? That\u2019s something they teach in Pop Warner, but apparently not at Halas Hall. The Bears took a delay-of-game penalty on a punt because Ben Braunecker didn\u2019t know he was on that unit. Do they practice? And then Braunecker was beaten to the inside to allow the punt to be blocked. Do they practice? But wait. There\u2019s more. That play ended with the returner stepping out of bounds short of the goal line followed by former Bear Shaun Draughn drawing a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct for celebrating a TD that wasn\u2019t a TD. I\u2019m telling you, this game had to be challenging the NFL record for combined stupid. Good for Jordan Howard, but isn\u2019t that what a tough running back is expected to do against the worst rushing defense in the NFL? Even a running back from the second-worst scoring offense in the NFL? So, there you go: Josh Bellamy can\u2019t catch passes while wide open in good weather and bad. No, look, Bellamy caught a pass down the left sideline. It was a pass that highlighted Matt Barkley \u2019s lack of arm strength, but still, Bellamy caught a pass. And look at that: Loggains went back to the shovel pass at the goal line, only this time it worked. I guess there\u2019s at least something the Bears practice. Hold it. Bellamy dropped a potential 61-yard TD pass. Barkley should know better by now. John Timu got credit for a pass defended when the ball hit him in the helmet as he was beaten badly on a play that Kaepernick badly underthrew. It\u2019s insulting to the Patriots and Cowboys to call this football. Has it always taken Barkley a half to get into playing a game? The Bears defense was excellent in exposing Kaepernick. Either the defense or the snow. Or Chip Kelly's death-spiral leadership. The 49ers proved to be a joke, so before you think the Bears accomplished something, remember this: They leave the game with just two wins more than that joke. ",

By Brady Dennis and Steven Mufson December 4 at 7:50 PM Follow @brady_dennis Follow @StevenMufson Dan Nanamkin, of the Colville Nez Perce Native American tribe in Nespelem, Wash., right, drums after it was announced Sunday that the Army Corps won\u2019t grant an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline. (David Goldman/Associated Press) The Army said Sunday that it will not approve an easement necessary to permit the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, marking a monumental victory for the Native American tribes and thousands of others who have flocked in recent months to protest the oil pipeline. \u201cI\u2019m happy as heck,\u201d said Everett Iron Eyes, a retired director of natural resources for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and one of the organizers of a camp protesters set up near the pipeline site. \u201cAll our prayers have been answered.\u201d Officials in November had delayed the key decision, saying more discussion was necessary about the proposed crossing, given that it would pass very near the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose leaders have repeatedly expressed fears that a spill could threaten the water supplies of its people. \u201cAlthough we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s more work to do,\u201d Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army\u2019s assistant secretary for civil works, said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThe best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\u201d The decision averts a possible showdown on Monday, the date the Army Corps, which owns land on either side of the lake, had set for cutting off access to the protesters\u2019 camp. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, worried about violence, had sent mediators to the area over the weekend. The victory for the Standing Rock Sioux and its allies could be short-lived, though. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to support pipelines such as this one. And Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners, has been a major contributor to the Republican Party and Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump, who owned a $500,000 to $1 million stake in Energy Transfer Partners, has sold the shares, his spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. His most recent disclosure says he still owns a similar size stake in Phillips 66, which owns 25 percent of the Dakota Access line. Iron Eyes said that \u201cwe shall remain vigilant regardless. We have witnessed the power of being peaceful and prayerful.\u201d What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities and activists from around the country. It has involved heated confrontations \u2014 police have sometimes employed water cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets \u2014 and has carried on through the swelter of summer into the snowy cold of winter. Hundreds of veterans arrived in recent days. [ Why Hollywood, environmentalists and Native Americans have converged on North Dakota ] On Sunday, news of the Army\u2019s decision triggered a wave of celebration and relief among those who have fought to stop the 1,170-mile-long pipeline\u2019s progress. A procession of tribe members and activists marched along the main dirt road at the Oceti Sakowin encampment set up by protesters. A crowd numbering in the thousands gathered around the camp\u2019s sacred fire, the hub of activity here, as tribal elders sang prayer songs and beat drums. Activists acknowledged that it was only one step forward in a larger fight over Native American rights. Denise McKay, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux standing by the sacred fire Sunday afternoon, said she expects Energy Transfer Partners to push back on the decision. \u201cIt is a temporary victory,\u201d said McKay, 54. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay put and stay united.\u201d McKay\u2019s daughter, Chelsea Summers, 25, chimed in, saying \u201ceverybody is still here for the long haul.\u201d Nearby, Bruce Gali took drags from a cigarette and watched the festivities. He made his second trip to the camp last week and said he would keep returning from his home in northeastern California until authorities left the area and the pipeline was shut down. \u201cUntil all the razor wire comes down, until the helicopters stop flying overhead, the spotlights turn off, the drill pad is dismantled, this isn\u2019t the end,\u201d said Gali, a 67-year-old member of the Pitt River Tribe. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about this pipeline.\u201d We \u201ccommend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing,\u201d Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement. \u201cWith this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families.\u201d \u00a0 Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the outcome was a reminder of the power of individuals to \u201cdemand environmental justice.\u201d She said, \u201cToday, the voices of indigenous people were heard.\u201d In the Dakota language, the word \u201coahe\u201d signifies \u201ca place to stand on.\u201d The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the $3.8\u00a0billion Dakota Access Pipeline. The steel pipeline, developed and majority owned by Energy Transfer Partners, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal and pipeline terminus in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470,000 to 570,000 barrels of oil per day. The company says the project, which traverses four states, is 92 percent complete overall and 99 percent complete in North Dakota. Army officials said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Ordinarily, the Army Corps, which has jurisdiction over domestic petroleum pipelines, does not require a detailed environmental-impact statement but it does require environmental assessments of the impact on water crossings. \u00a0 [ Voices from Standing Rock: A glimpse into both sides of the standoff ] North Dakota elected officials criticized the Army Corps. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time that a decision is made on the easement going under Lake Oahe,\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D). \u201cThis administration\u2019s delay in taking action \u2014 after I\u2019ve pushed the White House, Army Corps and other federal agencies for months to make a decision \u2014 means that today\u2019s move doesn\u2019t actually bring finality to the project. The pipeline still remains in limbo.\u201d Rep. Kevin Cramer (R) said Sunday\u2019s decision \u201csends a very chilling signal to others who want to build infrastructure in this country,\u201d arguing that Obama had stymied a perfectly legal pipeline project. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged we will restore law and order next month when we get a President who will not thumb his nose at the rule of law,\u201d Cramer said in a statement. \u201cI feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus.\u201d Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) called Sunday\u2019s decision a \u201cserious mistake\u201d that \u201cdoes nothing to resolve the issue.\u201d He said it would prolong a dangerous situation by having protesters camping out on federal land during the brutally cold winter. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, however, praised the Army\u2019s decision. \u201cThe thoughtful approach established by the Army today ensures that there will be an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts,\u201d she said Sunday. \u201cThe Army\u2019s announcement underscores that tribal rights reserved in treaties and federal law, as well as Nation-to-Nation consultation with tribal leaders, are essential components of the analysis to be undertaken in the environmental impact statement going forward.\u201d Derek Hawkins contributed to this report from a camp near Cannonball, N.D. business Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

The Army Corps of Engineers notified the Standing Rock Sioux that the current route for the Dakota Access pipeline will be denied. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images The Army Corps of Engineers has decided to deny a permit for the construction of a key section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The decision essentially halts the construction on the 1,172-mile oil pipeline about half a mile south of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The decision is also a victory for the thousands of demonstrators across the country who flocked to North Dakota in protest. \"Our prayers have been answered,\" National Congress of American Indians President Brian Cladoosby said in a statement. \"This isn't over, but it is enormously good news. All tribal peoples have prayed from the beginning for a peaceful solution, and this puts us back on track.\" Jo-Ellen Darcy, the the Army's assistant secretary for civil works, said after talking with tribal officials and hearing their concerns that the pipeline could affect the drinking water, it became \"clear that there's more work to do.\" \"The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing,\" Darcy said in a statement.

Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples.\" ",

    "text": "LOCAL L.A. Now 24 bodies recovered in Oakland warehouse fire; 80% of building still to be searched At least nine people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. Paige St. John , Peter H. King and Soumya Karlamangla Contact Reporters The death toll from the fire that raced through an Oakland warehouse during a music concert rose to 24\u00a0as searchers continued to sift through the ruin of one of the deadliest fires in modern California history. The search for victims could take another two days, leaving friends and family members frantic to learn the fate of their loved ones. \u00a0About 80% of the building remains to be searched, officials say.\u00a0 At a morning news\u00a0conference, Alameda County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said the death toll rose from nine last night to 24; he emphasized that the number will probably rise as the search continues. Searchers painstakingly sifted through the rubble of the building through the night. They described it as a horrific scene of destruction, with many concertgoers unable to flee when the fire broke out. Kelly said the vast majority of the victims found have not been identified. (Tracey Lien, Paige St. John, Peter H. King and Joe Mozingo) The rising death toll makes the blaze\u00a0one of the worst in recent California history. It could eclipse the 1991 Oakland Hills fire, which killed 25 people. The fire\u2019s cause is not known.  Arson is not suspected, but Kelly said nothing had been ruled out. The\u00a0warehouse isn\u2019t currently considered a crime scene.\u00a0 City records cited allegations of at least three code violations at the building this year. In one complaint, city inspectors said there was complaint of an illegal building on the property as well as piles of trash. \u201cThis property is a storage [facility], but the owner turned it into a trash recycling\u00a0center. The yard became a trash collection site, and the main building was [remodeled] for residential,\u201d according to city records. City building and safety officials said Saturday afternoon that there was an open investigation into the warehouse and that inspectors had found evidence of blight. The building was permitted for use as a warehouse, not for housing. They said that a party or concert at the property would have required a permit, which had not been granted. They also said there was no evidence that the building had fire sprinklers or alarms. Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo, who represents the district where the fire broke out, said neighbors have regularly complained about the building \u2014\u00a0particularly the fact that it had piles of trash and debris outside. \u201cWe would complain to the manager that they had all that nonsense outside of his building, blocking sidewalks, blocking streets. And \u2026 \u00a0he always had an attitude,\u201d he said. Gallo said he did not know whether people were living inside the warehouse. Asked whether\u00a0the building had residential permits, he said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cThe reality is, there are many facilities being occupied without permits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re occurring on Oakland\u2019s streets, especially in neighborhoods like mine.\u201d The property is one of several owned by Chor N. Ng, according to her daughter, Eva Ng, 36.\u00a0She said\u00a0the warehouse was leased as studio space for an art collective and not used as a dwelling. \u201cNobody lived there,\u201d\u00a0she told The Times, adding,\u00a0\u201cIt was an art collective.\u201d She said she had asked her leaseholders about the issue and had been reassured that nobody lived in the building. \u201cThey confirmed multiple times. They said sometimes some people worked through the night, but that is all,\u201d\u00a0she said. It was a tinderbox. \u2014 Brooke Rollo The second floor had two exits, both wooden stairs, she said, adding that she believes the building also had smoke detectors.\u00a0She was not familiar with comments by fire officials that the makeshift stairs consisted of packing crates. Ng added that her mother felt terrible about the tragedy. Kevin Longton, who lives at the Vulcan Lofts, less than a mile from the site, \u00a0said the warehouse was well-known for holding rave-style dance parties. He went to one about a year ago, never saw any sprinklers and felt the place was an accident waiting to happen. Inside, he said, were two floors with a huge open space on the first floor with lots of nooks and crannies. People had cordoned off loft-style sections on the first floor and decorated them with fabric and curtains. More than two dozen old pianos were strewn about the floor.\u00a0 \u201cThere were people living there,\u201d Longton said. \u201cI\u2019m sure of that.\" People who previously lived there recalled\u00a0a building that lacked fire sprinklers and had a staircase partly made of wooden pallets. Partygoers recalled a rabbit warren of rooms crammed with belongings \u2014\u00a0pianos, organs, antique furniture, doors\u00a0and half-finished sculptures. \u201cIt was a tinderbox,\u201d said Brooke Rollo, 30, who lives less than a mile from the scene and had gone to parties there. Photos on the warehouse\u2019s Tumblr page show a maze of rooms, with walls and dividers made from\u00a0pianos, boxes, salvaged doors and other materials. Wooden rafters were adorned with\u00a0hanging lanterns, holiday lights, bicycles, stereo equipment and exposed wiring. Ben Brandrett, a\u00a0mental health researcher living in San Francisco, attended a performance at the warehouse and noticed that a staircase\u00a0didn\u2019t have a banister.\u00a0\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This seems sketchy.\u2019\u201d Firefighters who responded to Friday\u2019s\u00a0three-alarm blaze described the interior as a labyrinth. Officials said organizers of the warehouse concert\u00a0never obtained a permit for the event, so\u00a0 city workers did not inspect exits, fire extinguishers and other vital safety features. The concert\u00a0Friday night was the\u00a0 Golden Donna 100% Silk 2016 West Coast Tour , according to a concert Facebook page. Organizers of the concert\u00a0posted a statement describing the fire as an \u201cunbelievable tragedy, a nightmare scenario. ...\u00a0We are a very tight community of artists and we are all praying, sending love and condolences to everyone involved and their families.\u201d Read the story Witnesses said the warehouse, known locally as the Oakland Ghost Ship,\u00a0was a collective where artists lived and worked. Through the early-morning hours, people used the Facebook page to seek information about friends and loved ones who attended the concert. Some frantically listed the names of missing people and posted their photos, hoping to learn their fates. Al Garcia, who owns a store next to the warehouse, said he talked to two people\u00a0who said they were 17 and 18 years old who got out of the building. \u201cThey said that black, billowing smoke was coming down the stairs,\u201d said Garcia, 62. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see anything in front of them, anything behind them. The only reason they got out was they heard voices outside. The voices directed them to where they were going.\u201d The teens said they paid $10 to get into the warehouse party, which they found online, Garcia said. Seung Lee arrived to the warehouse about 11 p.m. to catch the concert with two friends. They walked through the building\u2019s maze-like first floor before heading upstairs where as many as 30 concertgoers were listening to live music, Lee said. One suggested they get some alcohol, so they headed to a nearby liquor store at about 11:15 p.m. Less than 10 minutes later, they returned to find thick, black smoke pouring out of the first floor windows of the warehouse and flames shooting out of the back of the building, he said. \u201cI froze in disbelief,\u201d said Lee, who immediately called 911. \u201cThe hardest thing I\u2019m having trouble processing are the people on the second floor. I saw them dancing and having a fun time, and 10 minutes later they are trapped in this inferno.\u201d Lee, a freelance journalist, said the only way up to the second floor was by climbing a wooden staircase. He said he didn\u2019t notice any other exits on the second floor. There were about 60 to 70 people in the warehouse, Lee said. Anyone with information about the missing \u00a0is urged to call the coroner\u2019s office at (510) 382-3000.

    "text": "33 Bodies Recovered in Oakland Warehouse Fire; Search Continues By Michael Edison Hayden Dec 4, 2016, 6:54 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Authorities Search for Victims, Cause of Oakland Warehouse Fire 0 Shares Email Searchers have recovered 33 bodies -- some of them teens 17 years old or possibly younger -- from a fire-ravaged warehouse in Oakland, California, that housed artist studios and was hosting a dance party when the deadly blaze broke out, officials said today. Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office warned that he anticipates that \"the number of victims will rise\" from a fire officials say may be the deadliest ever in Oakland. The search effort is expected to last for days, he said. Kelly called the number of deaths \"astronomical.\" Among the victims was the son of an Alameda County sheriff's deputy, officials said. Authorities are also asking families with missing loved ones to preserve DNA samples as a way of confirming the identities of those who died in the horrific blaze. The District Attorney's Office has criminal investigation teams actively looking at the fire with the other law enforcement agencies involved in investigating the fire, according to a statement from the City of Oakland. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf told ABC News that she has ordered an investigation into the building's troubled history, including a complete review of all records of complaints. Libby also told ABC that she ordered an independent analysis into the city\u2019s handling of this building and others like it. The Oakland Fire Department responded to reports of a structure fire at the warehouse known as the \"Ghost Ship\" on 31st Avenue at around 11:32 p.m. on Friday night. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said Ghost Ship appeared to function as a residential building that hosted a makeshift artists' studio, as well as parties like the one that took place on Friday night. It's unclear if the building was equipped with smoke alarms, the fire chief added. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Firefighters work on the scene following an overnight fire that claimed the lives of at least nine people at a warehouse in the Fruitvale neighborhood, Dec. 3, 2016 in Oakland, California. Fire Department Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton told ABC News that firefighters have been impacted emotionally by bodies found. She described the precarious scene firefighters have encountered inside of what is left of the warehouse, where the second floor is hanging just above the heads of search crews, with pianos, appliances and other materials dangling from above. Preliminary indications suggest the blaze was not caused by arson, but rather an electrical fire. The power went out inside the building when the fire began and the flames blocked the building's only exit, making it difficult for people inside to escape, an official briefed on the ongoing investigation told ABC News. According to The Associated Press, Oakland officials said they had opened an investigation into the warehouse last month, after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building, which was zoned as a warehouse. Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department, told the AP the city opened an investigation Nov. 13 and an investigator went to the premises on Nov. 17 but could not get inside. ABC Bay Area affiliate KGO-TV reported that Derick Ion, founded the Ghost Ship Artist Collective and ran it at the warehouse. ABC News reached out to Ion but did not immediately receive a response. Ion appeared to address the fire in a Facebook post early on Saturday morning by saying that \"everything I worked for is gone.\" \"Confirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound... it's as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope.... to be standing now in poverty of self worth,\" he wrote. Oakland's warehouses have become hubs for artists and musicians in recent years. The Oakland-based weekly newspaper Eastbay Express has attributed gentrification and rising rents in the Bay Area as putting the Northern California region's counter-cultural arts scene in a crisis of space and money. The Oakland Fire Department confirmed to the press that they are currently working with a variety of agencies in the aftermath of the tragedy, including the Alameda County Sheriff's Department, the Oakland Police Department, the Alameda County Search and Rescue, and the American Red Cross , among others. Kelly asked the public to be patient as authorities look into the cause of the blaze, and continue to search for the missing and the dead. \"We will be here for days and days to come,\" Kelly said. The Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Trump, a prolific tweeter with about 15 million followers, needed six posts, each limited to 140 characters, to get out his message. \u201cThe U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBut any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! \u201cThere will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ... Please be forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.\u201d The string of tweets follow Trump\u2019s announcement last week that he had reached a deal with the Carrier furnace and air-conditioning manufacturer to keep the jobs in Indiana, instead of moving them to Mexico where labor costs are significantly less expensive. Trump made vowing to keep Carrier in the country and returning other good-paying manufacturing jobs to the economically challenged Midwest a major part of his successful presidential campaign. But the Carrier deal -- which purportedly includes $6 million in tax incentives and $1 million in job-training grants over 10 years -- has been criticized by liberals and conservatives alike. Among them are self-described socialist and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who suggest the deal was an example of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who remains governor of Indiana until next month, defended Trump\u2019s effort on Carrier on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\" \u201cWe were heartbroken when we heard Carrier was pulling up stakes,\u201d said Pence, who acknowledges he couldn\u2019t broker the deal. \u201cThe only reason Carrier is staying in the United States is because Donald Trump was elected president.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Paul Ryan: We want to make sure that we have a good transition period, so that people can get better coverage at a better price. Scott Pelley: So what are we talking about? Months? Years? Paul Ryan: I can\u2019t give you an answer to that. We\u2019re still working on that. Scott Pelley: But people talked about three years in terms of a transition. Paul Ryan: Yeah, I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now. What we know is we have to make good on this promise. We have to bring relief as fast as possible to people who are struggling under Obamacare. Scott Pelley: What do Republicans intend to put in its place? Paul Ryan: Patient-centered healthcare that gets everybody access to affordable healthcare coverage. So they can buy what they what they want to buy. Scott Pelley: So people will still get coverage regardless of their preexisting condition? Paul Ryan: Yeah. We think preexisting conditions is a very important feature of any healthcare system. Scott Pelley: Children will stay on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26? Paul Ryan: Yeah, that\u2019s something that we actually have always had in our plan, as well. Scott Pelley: And women will pay the same as men? That didn\u2019t used to be the case. The six priorities on Ryan's agenda Paul Ryan: It depends on the age of a person. So we believe that we should have support based on age. The sicker and the older you get, the more support you ought to get. If you\u2019re a person that has low income, you probably should have more assistance than a person with high income, for example. Scott Pelley: Is your plan going to cover everyone in America? Paul Ryan: We will give everyone access to affordable healthcare coverage. Scott Pelley: In the first year, what else do you expect to get through the Congress? Paul Ryan: We really want to focus on economic growth and growing the economy. There are a lot of regulations that are really just crushing jobs. Look at the coal miners in the Rust Belt that are getting out of work. Look at the-- look at the loggers and the timber workers and the paper mills in the West Coast. Look at the ranchers or farmers in the Midwest with regulations. Scott Pelley: Are you talking about rolling back environmental regulations, safety regulations-- Paul Ryan: We\u2019re talking about smarter regulations that actually help us grow jobs in this country. We want to have good stewardship and conversation of the environment and economic growth. We have a real economic growth problem in America. We are limping along. Wages are flat.\u00a0 And jobs aren\u2019t being created near to the extent that they could and should be.\u00a0 So we think regulatory relief is very, very important.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to work on day one. Ryan told us that he can now support Trump\u2019s changed positions on immigration from deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants to focusing on only those who\u2019ve committed crimes and from building a 2,000-mile wall to something less. Paul Ryan: No, we\u2019re not working on a deportation force. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws. He talked about criminal aliens. That\u2019s just enforcing laws for people who came here illegally, who came and committed violent crimes. We should enforce those laws. But really, what we\u2019re focused on is securing our border. Scott Pelley: Well, Trump said he was going to build a wall. Paul Ryan: Yeah, I think conditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area. Some areas, you might need a wall. Some areas, you might need double fencing. I-- my own view on this is, whatever kind of device or barrier or policy to secure the border, that\u2019s necessary to secure the border, then do it. Scott Pelley: How big will the tax cut be for the middle class? Paul Ryan: Well, again, we haven\u2019t written this bill. But if you want to get a sense of what we\u2019re looking at it\u2019s virtually identical with the one that Donald Trump rolled out in the campaign. It means everyone gets lower tax rates. But we plug loopholes to pay for it. Scott Pelley: But give me a number. What is the tax cut for the average middle-class family. Paul Ryan: When I have a bill, I\u2019ll tell you the number. Let\u2019s do this again. Scott Pelley: You\u2019ve thought this through. You\u2019ve been thinking it through for years. What would you like to see? Avoiding the Boehner problem Paul Ryan: Yeah, so the tax rates that we talked about for individuals, we would have a 15 percent bracket, I think a 25 percent bracket, and a 33 percent bracket. We have seven brackets. We consolidate down to three. The other thing that\u2019s really important in tax reform is making sure that we don\u2019t tax American businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors tax theirs. It is costing us jobs. It\u2019s one of the reasons all these American companies are moving overseas. Scott Pelley: What should the corporate tax rate be? Paul Ryan: Well, our plan says 20 percent. And Donald Trump\u2019s plan says 15 percent. It\u2019s now 35 percent. Scott Pelley: Do you think the rich will benefit the most from your tax reform plan? Paul Ryan: Here\u2019s the point of our tax plan. Grow jobs. Get this economy growing. Raise wages. Simplify the tax system, so it\u2019s easy to comply with. Scott Pelley: You-- you\u2019re a little shy, when I ask you about the rich receiving the greatest part of the-- Paul Ryan: Well, here\u2019s the problem when you-- Scott Pelley: --of the tax cuts. Paul Ryan: --when you ask these things. Most of that income is small-business income. You have to remember, eight out of 10 businesses in America, they file their business as individuals, as people. And so we think of that as the rich. But it\u2019s that business in the-- in the business park outta Jamesville, Wisconsin, that has 50 employees. And do I want to lower their tax rates? You bet I do. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 Mr. Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure program.\u00a0 What are you going to build, and how are you going to pay for it? Paul Ryan:\u00a0 Well, I think, that should be decided by the marketplace. That should be decided by the needs in the particular states and communities as to what is built or rebuilt. And it\u2019s going to be one of our high priorities that we\u2019re we are going to be addressing this year. Scott Pelley: One of your high priorities that we heard almost nothing about during the campaign is poverty. Paul Ryan: Actually, I\u2019ve talked to him a lot about that. We feel very strongly about making work pay, about getting people transitioned from welfare to work. Get people skills they need, help they need, so they can get on the ladder of life.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ryan told us he has no plans to change Social Security but government health insurance, including Medicare, is a fire he says burning in the budget. Paul Ryan: If you want to think of the fire that\u2019s burning-- it is the fact that-- the Baby Boom generation, no offense, and there\u2019s a lot of you. Scott Pelley: I qualify. Paul Ryan: Yeah, you qualify. And we\u2019re just not ready for the retirement of the Baby Boomers. And we\u2019d better prepare for that. Scott Pelley: What changes do you plan for Medicare? Paul Ryan: Here\u2019s the problem. Medicare goes bankrupt in about 10 years. The trust fund runs out of money. So we have to make sure that we shore this program up. And the reforms that we\u2019ve been talking about don\u2019t change the benefit for anybody who is in or near retirement. My mom\u2019s now enjoying Medicare. She\u2019s already retired. She earned it. But for those of us, you know, the X-Generation on down, it won\u2019t be there for us on its current path. So we have to bring reform to this program for the younger generation, so that it\u2019s there for us when we retire, and so that we can keep cash flowing to current generations\u2019 commitments. And the more we kick the can down the road, the more we delay, the worse it gets. Scott Pelley: But you are going to kick the can down the road for the next year or two. This is not your top priority. Paul Ryan: It\u2019s not our t-- I haven\u2019t even discussed this with Donald Trump yet. But it is an issue that we have to tackle. Close CBS News From his balcony the speaker is watching the rise of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration platform. But, for Ryan, the best view in Washington isn\u2019t a pretty sight. Scott Pelley: You know, one thing I noticed during our interview inside was that every time you talked about the evils of Washington, you glanced out the window. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 I do, \u2018cause that\u2019s where all the bureaucracy\u2019s are. Yea. Yea. Yea. That\u2019s right. Scott Pelley: You think of this town as part of the problem not part of the solution. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 Absolutely I do. If you look down, I can see HHS, Education, EPA.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: The two most prominent things on the skyline from this vantage point are the Washington Monument and the new Trump Hotel. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I knew you were going to say.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: The new Trump Hotel. Paul Ryan: That\u2019s the new Trump Hotel.\u00a0 Yeah he notic\u2014he actually noted that when I took him up here. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 I bet he did, he probably told you what a great place it was. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 He said something like that. Scott Pelley: Is that a reminder of who\u2019s boss? Paul Ryan:\u00a0 The Washington Monument\u2019s the tallest one.\u00a0 And by the way, the dome, it\u2019s a little higher. Beneath the dome, Ryan will have a front row seat to Trump\u2019s swearing in. Scott Pelley: Did you believe he could be nominated? Really? Paul Ryan: Yeah, no, I-- I didn\u2019t see this one coming. He knows that. I don\u2019t think most people in the country saw. If you would\u2019ve put last year into a movie script and taken it to Hollywood two years ago, they would\u2019ve laughed you outta the room. Because it wouldn\u2019t have been believable. Scott Pelley: Did you see Election Night coming? Paul Ryan: No, not really. I think-- Scott Pelley: You expected Hillary Clinton to win? Paul Ryan: I thought the odds were clearly in her favor. So I was a little surprised, pleasantly so. Scott Pelley: Do you trust him? Paul Ryan: Yeah.\u00a0 Scott Pelley:\u00a0 Here\u2019s something many people wonder. Does he say the same bizarre things to you in private that he says in public?\u00a0 And it\u2019s an important distinction\u2014 Paul Ryan:\u00a0 You know, I think there is a bit of a difference between the private person and the public person. In the private person, there\u2019s a conversation like this. And it\u2019s all about how to get things done. So every conversation I have almost always revolves around, you know, personnel and policy focused on producing results.\u00a0 ",

(Dec. 4) AP People gather as tribal and religious leaders speak during an interfaith prayer circle in the Oceti Sakowin Camp near the Standing Rock Reservation on Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016 near Cannon Ball. (Photo: Brian Powers/The Register) \u00a0 OCETI SAKOWIN CAMP, N.D. \u2014 U.S. Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning has informed tribal leaders that the Army Corps of Engineers will\u00a0halt construction on the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said here Sunday. Dave Archambault II said the Army has denied the permit to bore under Lake Oahe, the reservoir behind the Missouri River in North Dakota. Native Americans and environmentalists have camped out near the lake for weeks protesting the 1,172-mile pipeline, which is intended to\u00a0carry crude oil from the Bakken oil region in North Dakota to a distribution hub in Patoka, Ill. \"I wanted you to hear it from me,\" the chairman said as people banged drums, danced and cheered in glee at the snowy camp. The Missouri River portion of the pipeline was the only remaining contested portion. A federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C. is still pending. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
