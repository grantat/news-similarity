    "text": "Email Extreme cold is moving across more of the country this week, bringing with it the potential for record lows and dangerous conditions for children, pets and anyone else without adequate protection \u2014 all thanks to a weather phenomenon known as the polar vortex . What is the polar vortex? This phrase is once again in the headlines, and worth re-defining. The \u201cpolar vortex\u201d technically refers to a large area of low pressure and cold air that surrounds both of the Earth\u2019s poles, according to the National Weather Service. It\u2019s always existed at the poles, but the polar vortex strengthens in particular during the winter and can send cold air southward.\u00a0 Temperatures dip to dangerous lows when the polar vortex expands, sending thermometers plummeting. There have been a number of notable cold snaps caused by the polar vortex, including in 1977, 1982, 1985, 1989 and 2014, according to the weather service. For now, the Midwest is getting hit the hardest Arctic air from the polar vortex has already brought bitterly cold temperatures to the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest this week, Jamie Yuccas reported for \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Tuesday.\u00a0 Temperatures felt like 20 degrees below zero in Bismark, North Dakota, and minus-18 degrees in Minneapolis on Tuesday. Cold temperatures at this level can cause skin to freeze in less than ten minutes, Yuccas reported, raising serious risks of frostbite and hypothermia . There is little relief in sight. The Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will remain frigid through the end of this week, the National Weather Service said. On Wednesday, the expected highs range from 20 to 30 degrees below average for much of the region. Beyond the Midwest: Severe cold warnings Extreme cold will freeze other regions this week, too. The National Weather Service is warning of frigid temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast and potentially heavy snow in the Great Lakes region Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0 New England in particular should brace for intense cold and wind on Thursday, with the potential for record low temperatures, Eric Fisher, meteorologist at CBS Boston station WBZ reported. Chills originating in the Arctic will bring snow showers and temperatures in the teens and low 20s.\u00a0 That\u2019s about 15 to 20 degrees lower than usual averages for this time of year, Fisher said. Snow is also expected to accumulate across portions of the Great Basin and the Pacific Northwest this week. Severe rain is possible across much of central and northern California.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Steven Mufson December 13 at 7:16 PM Follow @StevenMufson When ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson showed up in June at the annual St. Petersburg international economic forum that is dubbed Russia\u2019s Davos, he was asked about the impact international sanctions on Russia were having on his company, which had abandoned ambitious drilling plans there. \u201cIt\u2019s a question for the government \u2014 if you find anyone from the U.S. government who\u2019s willing to answer this question,\u201d he replied to laughter from the audience of Western executives, who had been lavishing praise on their Russian hosts. It was the first time in three years that Tillerson or most other chief executives had attended the confab, for the moment laying aside friction over Russia\u2019s abrupt annexation of Crimea and its backing of violent separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Back in Washington, the State Department was not amused. State Department spokesman John F. Kirby commented that \u201cmost American companies understand\u201d that taking part in the forum \u201csends the wrong message about the acceptability of Russia\u2019s actions.\u201d Six months later, Tillerson\u2019s relationships with autocrats remain a source of friction after his surprise appointment by \u00adPresident-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of state. The ExxonMobil chief\u2019s ties to Russia have alarmed hawks in Congress, who vow to scrutinize Tillerson\u2019s good working relationship with President Vladi\u00admir Putin and the latter\u2019s longtime confidant Igor Sechin, the chairman of the Russian petroleum giant Rosneft. With his nomination, the 64-year-old Tillerson has been thrust into the long-standing U.S. \u00adforeign policy divide separating those who value pragmatism and dealmaking from those who attach greater importance to principles, human rights and democracy. This is a divide that cuts across both parties. The Washington Post's Paul Kane and Steven Mufson explain why Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, might face a few hurdles in his confirmation. (The Washington Post) Should he be confirmed, Tillerson will no longer answer to the more than 93,000 shareholders of ExxonMobil but primarily to a single shareholder named Trump. And he will draw on views refined in industry, not diplomacy. To fans of Tillerson, his relationship with Putin is a sign of his pragmatism, seeking advantage for his company with a blunt, straightforward style that has won respect abroad. Speaking to students from the Texas Tech business school last year, Tillerson said the reason \u201cwhy I\u2019ve been able to gain Vladimir Putin\u2019s trust\u201d is \u201cbecause throughout my career I\u2019ve wanted people to view me as an honest person.\u201d To his critics, however, Tillerson and ExxonMobil come across as arrogant and indifferent to Russia\u2019s record in Ukraine or Putin\u2019s harsh suppression of domestic opposition. The oil giant\u2019s vast enterprise spanning six continents and more than 50 nations has embraced a varied cast of national leaders, including the Saudi oil ministers, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s corrupt Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the autocratic government of Kazakhstan and the emir of Qatar. These contrary views are in some ways connected. Edward S. Verona, who worked for ExxonMobil for two years and spent several more working in Moscow, said one reason Tillerson was respected in Moscow was because of the way the company dealt with Venezuela\u2019s then-president, the voluble Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In 2007, Ch\u00e1vez had wanted to rewrite contract terms for companies operating in the country\u2019s vast, oil-rich Orinoco belt. Exxon said no, abandoning 2 percent of its worldwide reserves and winning arbitration court orders to freeze Venezuelan assets. In the same way, Exxon exited Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta after insurgents disputed operations there. \u201cYou have to be willing to say, \ufffd?No, we aren\u2019t going to do it that way, we are going to do it this way; if we can\u2019t do it this way, we won\u2019t be here,\u2019 \u201d Tillerson said about the company\u2019s strategy of keeping its Ni\u00adger\u00adian exploration to offshore areas, where it was safer. \u201cRex Tillerson gained the respect of Russians, particularly Sechin and Putin, because he was prepared to stand up and push back when he felt his company was being treated unfairly,\u201d said Verona, now a senior adviser to McLarty Associates. The fight coincided with efforts by Russia\u2019s Gazprom, a state-owned company, to horn its way into a Sakhalin Island project off eastern Russia that Tillerson had helped negotiate years earlier. ExxonMobil was able to navigate the dispute with help from Putin and Sechin. The project, built in extremely harsh conditions, remains one of the company\u2019s most lucrative, Tillerson has said. Some of Exxon\u2019s perceived arrogance is rooted in the company\u2019s history as the largest of the corporations split off from the Standard Oil Trust, the enterprise built by John D. Rockefeller. Lifelong Scout Tillerson was born in Wichita Falls, Tex., the son of a Boy Scout administrator. He still lists the rank of Eagle Scout on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and has remained active in the organization. In 2012, he was instrumental in pushing the Boy Scouts board to admit openly gay youths. His experience as a Scout fit well into the company, which insisted on rules that were more detailed than most other oil companies. In 1997, Exxon sent Tillerson, then a promising executive who had been in Yemen, to Moscow to \u201cpick up the relationship and repair it,\u201d Tillerson later recalled . His predecessor had been kicked out of the country. Tillerson met six different prime ministers over the course of 14 months. The last of those was Putin. Nearly 15 years later in Sochi, Putin provided the blessing for what could become Exxon\u2019s largest Russian deal, a joint exploration agreement with Rosneft covering almost 190 million acres, almost halfway across the Arctic shoreline and covering nine time zones. Speaking later at Texas Tech, Tillerson cited the Boy Scout motto and urged students to have honor and integrity. \u201cThose words mean a lot to me,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cAnd I can tell you they mean a lot in any culture.\u201d He added that \u201cintegrity is recognized by every government, every leader. It\u2019s the most valuable asset you have, your personal integrity.\u201d But while Tillerson preaches the value of honesty and integrity, ExxonMobil has not shied away from doing what is good for its bottom line, which has made environmental groups and others suspicious of its aims. While Tillerson has acknowledged human involvement in the warming of the globe and backed a carbon tax to deal with it, the oil giant has continued to fund groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, whose leading members have cast doubt on climate change or its urgency. The relationship contrasted with that of Shell, which also acknowledges climate change but dropped its membership in ALEC last year, citing differences over the issue. The company is also in the midst of a bitter fight with the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts and with more than a dozen nongovernmental organizations that are looking at whether the oil giant failed to disclose what it knew 40 years ago about the damage fossil fuels were doing to the Earth\u2019s climate. The attorneys general issued broad subpoenas for internal Exxon documents, and the NGOs have encouraged them to consider bringing a fraud case similar to the one that extracted billions of dollars from tobacco companies years ago. ExxonMobil has fought back, going to a Texas federal court near its headquarters and winning the judge\u2019s highly unusual backing for discovery on the attorneys general, including with regard to internal emails, to determine whether they were acting \u201cin good faith.\u201d The company also is scrutinizing individuals and organizations. The day after the presidential election, for example, the company hand-delivered a subpoena to Carroll Muffett, the head of the Center for International Environmental Law, a nonprofit organization focused on environmental and human rights issues. \u201cThe subpoena is in fact a fishing expedition that goes far beyond any issue arguably before the Texas court,\u201d Muffett said in an email. \u201cIt is clear that Exxon is trying to leverage this case, outrageous as it is, to intimidate and silence its critics.\u201d Engineering quotient Another important piece of Tillerson\u2019s background is his engineering background. ExxonMobil has been widely seen as a place with a higher \u201cEQ,\u201d for engineering quotient, than IQ, or intelligence quotient. Even the EQ has failed from time to time. The Exxon Valdez oil-tanker accident spilled crude off the pristine coast of Alaska in 1989, and more recently company pipelines leaked in Montana\u2019s Yellowstone River and in Mayflower, Ark. The company has taken tough legal strategies in those instances, too, and it litigated the Valdez spill for 20 years. Still, Tillerson draws on that engineering construct and has applied it to the problem of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s an engineering problem, and it has engineering solutions,\u201d he said at an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2012. As he looked back on his career during the Texas Tech event, Tillerson said that he views the company\u2019s oil and gas operation on Sakhalin Island \u2014 an area beset by poverty, seismic instability, long icebound winters and 100-foot waves in the summer \u2014 as one of his crowning achievements. It might look easy compared to being secretary of state. business ",

    "text": "Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson speaks to reporters after the annual Exxon Mobil shareholders meeting in 2014. LM Otero/AP hide caption toggle caption LM Otero/AP Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson speaks to reporters after the annual Exxon Mobil shareholders meeting in 2014. LM Otero/AP Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Trump's nominee for secretary of state, will have his Senate confirmation hearing in January. Before then, experts say, he'll have to think hard about how to divest from a company where he has spent his entire career. Tillerson reportedly owns 2.6 million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, which would be worth about $240 million, as of the Wall Street close on Tuesday. When John Kerry became secretary of state nearly four years ago, he and his wife, Teresa Heinz, divested from a long list of companies to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. For the same reason, George Shultz \u2014 an executive at Bechtel before serving as Ronald Reagan's top diplomat \u2014 set up a blind trust, says Davis Robinson, the State Department's legal adviser at the time. But, Robinson says, \"his was not as complicated as Mr. Tillerson, because Mr. Tillerson owns so much of Exxon Mobil stock.\" Blind trusts and divestment are two of the most common options to meet the requirements of federal ethics laws. And tax breaks allow wealthy appointees to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell off assets so they can serve in government. Article continues after sponsorship Paul Light , the Paulette Goddard Professor of Public Service at New York University, says divestment is the most effective cure to conflict of interest concerns. \"If you are to reassure the public that your negotiations with foreign governments have no tie to your financial interests, you divest,\" he says. For Tillerson, that may not be enough. Even if he divests from Exxon Mobil stock, he will face tough questions on Capitol Hill about his past dealings, especially in Russia. Tillerson opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea, that slowed a joint project between Exxon Mobil and Russian energy giant Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. \"It troubles me greatly that Mr. Tillerson would have reason to advocate for the rolling back of sanctions because that would be the best interests of his company,\" says Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"And it is my hope that he's enough of a patriot to separate his decades-long affiliation with this major oil company and the genuine interest of the American people.\" Russia isn't the only place of concern, Coons says. \"I suspect we will be having discussions about a number of different countries where he negotiated relationships or deals with dictators or authoritarian regimes that worked for Exxon Mobil, but will not work for America's interests,\" he says. Edward Verona, a former Exxon Mobil colleague of Tillerson's in Russia, now with McLarty Associates in Washington, D.C., believes the oil executive will be able to make the switch to the State Department. \"I don't believe that he would, certainly not consciously, do anything that would contravene the interests of the United States for the potential benefit of his former company. That's just my sense of him,\" he says. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, says he will chair a confirmation hearing for Tillerson in early January. But before the nominee meets with any senators, he'll need to answer the committee's questionnaire about whether and how he will sever his business relationships with Exxon Mobil. ",

Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, for secretary of the interior, a top transition source told NBC News on Tuesday. Zinke, 55, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee who's described as an avid hunter and fisherman, was an early and consistent supporter of Trump's presidential campaign and was re-elected to a second term last month as Montana's sole representative in the House. If Trump carries through with the appointment, Zinke's nomination would have to be confirmed by the Senate. The Interior Department oversees federal management of about three-quarters of federal land and natural resources, along with programs relating to American Indian and territorial affairs. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, spoke with a supporter in Billings as he campaigned for re-election in October. AP Zinke is a strong supporter of coal, oil, and gas exploration and development with a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters , an environmental advocacy group. But he is also described as an enthusiastic outdoorsman, and he has backed increased funding to preserve open spaces. Zinke is a strong supporter of coal, oil, and gas exploration and development with a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters , an environmental advocacy group. Zinke met with Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York. Trump's communications director, Jason Miller, called Zinke \"a strong advocate for American energy independence,\" saying he \"supports an all-encompassing energy policy that includes renewables, fossil fuels and alternative energy.\" At a congressional campaign debate in 2014 , Zinke hedged when he was asked whether he believed climate change was real. He said that it wasn't a hoax but that it also wasn't \"proven science.\" In a statement Tuesday, the environmental group Greenpeace called Zinke a \"climate change denier\" whose \"real constituency is the fossil industry and coal companies.\" But he is also an enthusiastic outdoorsman, and he has bucked some general Republican policies by backing increased funding to preserve open spaces and opposing the transfer of public land to the states. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, who also had been believed to be up for interior secretary, at Trump Tower in New York on Monday after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Richard Drew / AP Another lawmaker widely believed to have been up for the position, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, ran into fierce opposition from environmental advocates who were angered by her introduction of legislation to sell off public lands. McMorris Rodgers also met Monday with Trump. She didn't address reports that she was under consideration, telling reporters only that \"we talked about a lot of things\" and that \"it was great to spend time with him. Zinke, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, is a highly decorated retired Navy SEAL who served as acting commander of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force in the Arabian Peninsula, leading Special Operations personnel in Iraq. In an interview Monday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Zinke talked at length about his support for Trump's nomination of retired Gen. James Mattis to be defense secretary, calling him the right man for the job. As late as Tuesday afternoon, Zinke was still hiring staffers for his congressional offices. I'm excited to announce @AaronFlint will serve as the new state director for the Congressional office. He's a veteran and a true Montanan. \u2014 Ryan Zinke (@RepRyanZinke) December 13, 2016 Kristen Welker ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Jill Stein's rowdy recount push ended with a whimper overnight, giving Donald Trump even more votes than he started with after final certification -- but it wasn't a total wash for the Green Party candidate, who brought in millions and put herself in a position to redistribute the leftover cash. Stein raised about $7.3 million in three weeks to fund recount efforts, more than\u00a0double what she raised for her failed presidential campaign. The money poured in from 161,300 donors across the country. Another 10,000 volunteers signed up to help the drive. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much remains -- millions went to recount costs and legal fees -- but she announced Tuesday she plans to donate leftover funds to election-reform and voting-rights groups. \u201cIt was an amazing affirmation of the power of the American people to have a voice in their voting system and demand elections with integrity,\u201d Stein said in a statement Tuesday. On the surface, the recounts accomplished little. Her attempts to get fresh tallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania were blocked in court. Stein had suggested \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that voting machines in those states and Wisconsin could have been hacked in the November election. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schutte, a Republican, argued in the lawsuit that a hand recount would cost taxpayers around $2 million. Other esimates put it as high as $12 million. Though unsuccessful in Michigan, Stein was able to request and pay for the Wisconsin recount which started on Dec. 1. But that effort resulted in Trump picking up 131 net votes, as his victory was certified in all three states. Trump boasted on Twitter: \u201cThe final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!\u201d The fizzling finish came after Stein faced accusations of wasting time and draining grassroots resources. Stein\u2019s own running mate initially was against the recount, as was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. But Stein insisted all along her goal wasn\u2019t to overturn the results of the presidential election but instead to instill confidence in the election results and voting systems. At the least, the effort has allowed her to stay in the spotlight, and with her announcement Tuesday puts her in charge of distributing the leftover funds she raised. It also connected her with more donors.\u00a0 Jordan Brueckner, a spokeswoman for Stein\u2019s recount drive, told FoxNews.com that all 161,000-plus donors will have a say in where the extra money is donated \u2013 a task perhaps easier said than done. The campaign has pledged to divvy up the funds to a set of non-partisan organizations. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a name for the organizations but we\u2019ll give the donors an option [of where the money will go],\u201d she said during a telephone interview. The amount of cash given to the groups will be based on a ranked-choice vote which will be made public on Stein\u2019s website in the coming weeks, Brueckner said. Democratic strategist Joe Trippi told The Hill he thought recount efforts were a way for Stein \u201cto stay relevant, raise some money and take the stink off of them.\u201d \u201cInstead of everybody screaming, \u2018You made Trump happen,\u2019 she is counting the votes to change that whole narrative.\u2019\u201d Advertisement ",

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama signed a $6.3 billion bill to fund drug treatment, a precision medicine initiative\u00a0and Vice President Biden's signature effort to \"end cancer as we know it.\" In an emotional bill signing ceremony \u2014 likely the last one of this presidency \u2014 Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act in\u00a0a White House auditorium.\u00a0The signing brought full circle Obama's State of the Union challenge to Congress to \"surprise the cynics\" by tackling some of the biggest health priorities facing the country. \"We are bringing to reality the possibility of new breakthroughs to some of the biggest health challenges of our time,\" Obama said. \"We're tackling cancer, brain disease, substance abuse disorders and more, and none of this would have been possible without bipartisan cooperation from both houses of Congress,\" he said, thanking a delegation from Capitol Hill.\u00a0The bill passed the House of Representatives 392 to 26 and the Senate 94 to 5. For Obama, fewer bill-signing ceremonies reflect years of gridlock The bill was a personal project for Biden. The section of the bill allocating $1.8 billion in cancer research funding was named for his son, Beau, whose death from brain cancer in 2015 inspired what the White House called its\u00a0\"Cancer Moonshot.\" \"This bill will literally save lives,\" said a somber Biden. \"Just its mere signing, Mr. President, as you know better than I, gives millions of Americans hope.\" In addition to the added funding, Biden said that the bill would \"fundamentally change the culture of our fight against cancer\" by adding a sense of urgency to the effort. Joe Biden delivers cancer 'moonshot' recommendations The bill also authorized seven years of funding for other health-related initiatives: $1.5 billion for a brain research initiative, $1.4 billion for precision medicine, and $1 billion for substance abuse treatment targeting heroin and opioid addiction. Obama was introduced by David Grubb, a former West Virginia state senator who told first\u00a0met the president in Charleston last year, telling him the story of his daughter Jessie's battle with heroin addiction. She was in recovery then,\u00a0and Grubb was optimistic. But Jessie died this March after being given painkillers following a surgery. \"When I first met them in Charleston, their story was unfortunately more common than we would have liked,\" Obama said. \"I\u00a0think it reflects the power of this issue and how deeply it affects every family in America.\" \"This is an epidemic that can touch anybody \u2014 blue collar, white collar, college students, retirees, kids,\u00a0moms, dads,\" Obama said.

    "text": "Trump invites Senate clash with Tillerson State nomination Trump chooses oil tycoon and Russia friend Rex Tillerson to head State Department In a statement, Donald Trump praised Rex Tillerson, 64, as \u201camong the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world.\u201d In a statement, Donald Trump praised Rex Tillerson, 64, as \u201camong the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world.\u201d Tribune news services Contact Reporter Donald Trump is inviting a clash in a narrowly divided Senate by selecting Rex Tillerson for secretary of State despite well-publicized concerns from several GOP senators over his ties to Russia. The likely confirmation fight could be an early test of Trump's sway over Congress, and demonstrate how much appetite there is among Republicans to stand up to their president. For now, three Republican senators have publicly voiced concerns about the Tillerson nomination: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida. All have cited the Exxon Mobil executive's history of making deals in Russia and his close ties with Vladimir Putin , which include opposing sanctions sought by the U.S. and Europe against Russia after it invaded Crimea. However, none of the three has said thus far that he will oppose Tillerson. And only Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing in early January to consider the nomination. \"While Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination. The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America's interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America's foreign policy goals,\" Rubio said. \"I will do my part to ensure he receives a full and fair but also thorough hearing.\" Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. The committee currently has 10 Republican and 9 Democratic members, meaning Tillerson needs support from every Republican to get a successful committee vote, presuming Democrats all oppose him. Yet even if the panel rejects him, there is precedent for the full Senate to take up his nomination. The Senate will be divided 52-48 next year in favor of the Republicans, meaning Tillerson could lose only two Republicans if all Democrats voted \"No.\" That scenario would produce a 50-50 split and require a tie-breaking vote from Mike Pence, who by then will be the new vice president. It's also possible, though, that Tillerson could garner support from one or more of the moderate Democrats. The last time the Senate rejected a presidential Cabinet pick was in 1989 when it voted down John Tower as George H.W. Bush's defense secretary after he had already been rejected by the Armed Services committee. More frequently, nominees have withdrawn from consideration when opposition built, as happened in 2009 with Tom Daschle , President Barack Obama's first pick for Health and Human Services secretary. It was unclear Tuesday whether the fight over Tillerson would turn into a major brawl in the Senate or just a minor skirmish. One question is how hard Democrats, who've made clear they want to focus on economic issues, will fight. Several issued statements Tuesday angrily denouncing the nomination, but the Democrats' incoming leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, was more measured, pointing to Tillerson's Russia ties and calling for a thorough and lengthy confirmation hearing \"given these serious concerns.\" Donald Trump 's choice to lead the State Department , has close ties to Russia through years of deal-making that will serve as valuable experience \u2014 but also raise concerns. Tillerson has claimed to have a \"very close relationship\" with Russian President...

(Tribune news services) Tillerson immediately picked up support from the top two Senate Republicans, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. McConnell praised Tillerson's \"decades of experience\" and concluded: \"I look forward to supporting his nomination.\" The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, who was himself passed over for the job at State, also issued a favorable statement, though without saying how he planned to vote. Several other GOP committee members issued statements praising Tillerson or sounding open to his nomination. Still others were taking a wait-and-see approach, including Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who said: \"Congress has the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent and we will rigorously exercise it.\" For congressional Republicans and Trump, a major question hanging over their emerging relationship is what steps Trump may take to keep party members in line, and how Republicans will respond in turn. Few GOP lawmakers, especially those up for re-election, want to be on the receiving end of a critical tweet from Trump. The Tillerson confirmation may offer clues to how that dynamic will play out throughout Trump's administration, including when Trump takes policy stances contrary to GOP dogma, such as pushing for stiff tariffs on imports or a massive infrastructure bill. Electoral considerations may already be playing into lawmakers' posture toward Trump. GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, was one of the most outspoken Republicans against Trump ahead of the election, including challenging him to his face during a Capitol Hill visit in July. But Flake is up for re-election in 2018 in a state Trump won, and has already drawn a conservative primary opponent. On Tuesday, Flake issued a statement sounding open to Tillerson's nomination, citing his support from former secretaries of State and Defense marshaled by Trump's team. Backing from former Secretaries of State James Baker and Condoleezza Rice , and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates carry \"considerable weight,\" Flake said. \"I look forward to the hearings.\" Caption Trump chooses oil tycoon and Russia friend Rex Tillerson to head State Department In a statement, Donald Trump praised Rex Tillerson, 64, as \u201camong the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world.\u201d In a statement, Donald Trump praised Rex Tillerson, 64, as \u201camong the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world.\u201d Caption Trump chooses oil tycoon and Russia friend Rex Tillerson to head State Department In a statement, Donald Trump praised Rex Tillerson, 64, as \u201camong the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world.\u201d In a statement, Donald Trump praised Rex Tillerson, 64, as \u201camong the most accomplished business leaders and international dealmakers in the world.\u201d Caption Who is Gen.

    "text": "How a Single Senate Republican Could Tank Rex Tillerson's Nomination By ALI ROGIN Dec 13, 2016, 12:51 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Faces Criticism for Secretary of State Pick 0 Shares Email Marco Rubio is not the only Republican senator to express concerns about President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , over his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin . But Rubio is the only skeptical Republican, so far, who has the power to derail Tillerson\u2019s nomination before it reaches the Senate floor. The Florida senator sits on the upper chamber\u2019s 19-member Foreign Relations Committee , before which Tillerson\u2019s nomination hearing will take place. If all nine Democrats on the panel vote against Tillerson, they would need only one of the committee\u2019s 10 Republicans to join them to prevent the ExxonMobil CEO\u2019s nomination from moving to the full Senate for a vote. In a statement released this morning, Rubio said he had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Tillerson but was committed to giving him a fair hearing. \u201cThe next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America's interests and will be a forceful advocate for America's foreign policy goals,\u201d Rubio said. He was referring to the deals Tillerson\u2019s multinational oil and gas corporation has made with the Russian government, which helped him earn Russia\u2019s 2013 Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors a foreigner can receive there. As Tillerson\u2019s selection seemed increasingly likely this weekend, Rubio tweeted a more pointed reaction: Being a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState - MR \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 11, 2016 Rubio is not the only Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee whose concerns about Tillerson\u2019s Russia connections might push him to vote no. Members like Jeff Flake of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky could also oppose him, which, in procedural terms, would mean the committee would decline to recommend Tillerson to the full Senate. But Rubio is the only one so far to voice his concerns. A source close to Paul said he was undecided on Tillerson and wants to hear more from him. Paul had publicly said he would adamantly oppose former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton, who is now the likely pick for deputy secretary of state in Trump's administration, sources told ABC News. That former Secretaries of State James Baker and Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates endorsed Tillerson \u201ccarries considerable weight\u201d Flake said. Baker\u2019s law firm, Baker Botts, represents ExxonMobil, and Rice\u2019s and Gates\u2019 consulting firm, RiceHadleyGates, counts the oil company as a client. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Rex Tillerson's four decades at Exxon Mobil could hamper his role as America's top diplomat Trump chooses oil tycoon and Russia friend Rex Tillerson to head State Department Several Republican leaders have expressed concern over the Exxon Mobil chief executive\u2019s close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin . \u00a0 Several Republican leaders have expressed concern over the Exxon Mobil chief executive\u2019s close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin . \u00a0 Tracy Wilkinson and Ivan Penn Contact Reporters As chief executive officer\u00a0of Exxon Mobil Corp., Rex Tillerson has led a vast energy juggernaut, roaming the globe in search of multibillion-dollar deals, working with despots as well as democrats. The brash Texas oilman has helped forge or supervise exploration, production and refinery projects in 50 countries on\u00a0six continents, from Africa to the Arctic. The company was widely seen as a quasi-state, with more influence in some parts of the world than the U.S. government. If Tillerson is confirmed as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of State, however, he may find that his 41-year career at the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil and gas company could hamper his ability to freely conduct foreign policy as America\u2019s top diplomat. A Senate confirmation fight already is brewing over Tillerson\u2019s personal and business ties to Vladimir Putin , now Russia\u2019s autocratic president. Few in Congress feel warmly about Putin, and many are outraged that CIA reports show that Russia used hackers to try to influence the U.S. presidential race. After several days of leaks from his transition team, Trump confirmed Tuesday that he will nominate Tillerson , saying the 64-year-old oil mogul\u2019s career \u201cis the embodiment of the American dream.\u201d Donald Trump , a candidate whose social media savvy belied what they saw as a staggering\u00a0disregard for the innovation economy and the\u00a0tech culture that has fostered it. Now comes the reckoning. Some... Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurs made little effort over the last year to conceal their distaste\u00a0for Donald Trump , a candidate whose social media savvy belied what they saw as a staggering\u00a0disregard for the innovation economy and the\u00a0tech culture that has fostered it. Now comes the reckoning. Some... (Evan Halper and David Pierson) \"His tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for secretary of State,\u201d the president-elect said in a statement. To avoid direct conflicts of interest, Tillerson would be required to sell his $240 million in Exxon Mobil stock and other holdings. But he might also have to recuse himself from specific issues before the State Department, experts say. \u201cUnless he severs all financial ties to Exxon Mobil, he will be required by law to recuse himself from everything relating not just to that business, but from all industries in which it operates \u2014 something that would make it very hard for him to do his job,\u201d Norman Eisen\u00a0and Richard Painter, who\u00a0head Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics watchdog group, said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cIt may be that the appearance of conflict and the need for repeated recusals is so profound that the Senate concludes he cannot do the job,\u201d said Eisen, who served in\u00a0the Obama administration, and Painter, who worked for President George W. Bush. Tillerson\u2019s Senate confirmation is far from assured. Democratic opposition appeared strong and some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about his work in Russia, although none have yet said they will vote against him. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he would\u00a0ask Tillerson if he ever voiced criticism to Putin for his egregious human rights record at home and abroad, including\u00a0recent Russian\u00a0air attacks that killed civilians in Syria. \u201cI\u00a0have concerns about what kind of business we do with a butcher, a murderer and a thug, which is exactly what Vladimir Putin is,\u201d McCain\u00a0said. As Exxon Mobil\u2019s CEO, Tillerson opposed the 2014 decision by the Obama administration and its European allies to impose sanctions on Russia for its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine, a\u00a0dispute that sent U.S.-Russian relations into free fall. The sanctions cost Exxon Mobil about $1 billion, according to company reports, because projects had to be scrapped. In 2011, Exxon Mobil had signed a deal with Russia\u2019s largest state-owned oil company, Rosneft, for joint exploration and production in hard-to-reach territory north of the Arctic Circle, where more than 90 billion barrels is believed to be in reserve. Today, that project looks foolhardy, said Pavel Molchanov, an oil industry analyst with Raymond James & Associates. \u201cAt today\u2019s oil prices, there\u2019s absolutely no rationale for Arctic oil drilling,\u201d Molchanov said. \u201cIt\u2019s in a remote location, difficult climate. It\u2019s pretty marginal, economically speaking. There obviously are places to drill with today\u2019s prices. The Arctic is not one of them.\u201d Rosneft was built on the ruins of Yukos, an oil company that belonged to Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was sent to prison for alleged fraud in what many saw as a case of Putin\u2019s revenge for the businessman\u2019s support of anti-Kremlin forces.\u00a0 Rosneft and its CEO, Igor\u00a0Sechin, who is considered Putin\u2019s right-hand man and someone with whom Tillerson worked closely, were specifically blacklisted\u00a0by the Western sanctions. In 2012, two years\u00a0before the Ukraine invasion,\u00a0Putin bestowed Russia's Order of Friendship on Tillerson, a rare prize for a U.S. citizen and one that on occasion has been given to communist spies. The Tillerson \u201cappointment is very beneficial for Putin,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, Russia\u2019s former deputy energy minister and an opposition leader. \u201cIt will mean the end of values of the American foreign policy vector and a transfer to purely pragmatic deals on certain matters.\" On Tuesday, Russia was the first country to praise Tillerson, saying he exhibited a \u201cpragmatism\u201d that would permit \u201ca mutually beneficial relationship\u201d between Moscow and Washington. Other plaudits came from parts of the Middle East, where Tillerson is well known among Persian Gulf royalty. Some Sunni Arab leaders felt neglected by an Obama administration that focused on forging a nuclear pact with Shiite Iran, archrival of Saudi Arabia, and called for a strategic pivot to Asia. In Saudi Arabia, Exxon Mobil\u00a0has multibillion-dollar investments in refineries and chemical companies with Aramco, the Saudi oil conglomerate founded by Exxon and considered the world\u2019s most valuable company, worth an estimated $10 trillion. In Qatar, Exxon Mobil is part owner of 12 of 14 liquefied natural gas plants, and in the United Arab Emirates, Exxon owns nearly a third of the largest oil concession there, according to the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington. \u201cArab leaders in the Gulf might look favorably on the appointment of a familiar oil executive as secretary of State,\u201d said Jean-Francois Seznec, a scholar at the institute. \u201cHowever, they also know he is quite a strategist who knows the regional games and how to play them.\u201d ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story I cheered for Greg Baxtrom, a product of several famous tasting-menu kitchens, when he brought a similar level of creativity to Olmsted, an affordable neighborhood spot in Brooklyn. And I smiled every time I spotted a bottle of wine for under $55 at Le Coucou, a reformed and refined homage to the fancy old-school French restaurants that have mostly vanished from New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Month after month, I was surprised by the good, resourceful kitchens I found squirreled away in spaces that barely qualified as restaurants: wine bars and bar bars and a nostalgic lunch counter called Mr. Donahue\u2019s, where $20 buys a full dinner of American food my grandmother would have recognized. The cost of running a restaurant is notoriously punishing. Often the pain is passed on to us, but sometimes it inspires chefs to think a little harder. This year, those are the restaurants I want to tell you about. They are presented here roughly in the order of the intensity of my desire to go back again, which diverges here and there from the number of stars that flew above their reviews. 1. Le Coucou The genius of this project from the chef Daniel Rose and the restaurateur Stephen Starr is that it gives us almost everything we loved about New York\u2019s old-line French restaurants without the things we didn\u2019t. The dining room isn\u2019t stuffy, the service isn\u2019t snooty, and people don\u2019t get seated in Siberia if their pronunciation of boeuf bourguignon doesn\u2019t have the right backhand spin. (As far as I can tell, Le Coucou doesn\u2019t have a Siberia.) The wine list covers the historic old appellations of France, but it also embraces emerging ones and exciting regions from other countries while pricing bottles in a range that\u2019s unusually democratic. Meanwhile, Mr. Rose knocks the dust off some archetypal premodern French dishes. Sole V\u00e9ronique gets its peeled grapes and its butter-girded sauce along with a sense of conviction that\u2019s can\u2019t be faked. The fleecy quenelles of pike, half-submerged in a lava flow of sauce Am\u00e9ricaine, have a finer flavor than the ones at La Grenouille , which some people still think of as the city\u2019s standard-bearer. Mr. Rose isn\u2019t simply hauling out museum pieces, though. He\u2019s making them fresh again, and relevant. \u2605\u2605\u2605; 138 Lafayette Street; SoHo 212-271-4252; lecoucou.com . 2. Lilia Look around the concrete-floor dining room, glance at the one-page menu, and you could be at any number of casual Italian restaurants. Start eating, though, and you realize Lilia has something else going on. That something is Missy Robbins, the chef and owner. She\u2019s a sleight-of-hand cook. You don\u2019t see her tricks coming, but you taste them and wonder how she did it. Like Jonathan Waxman at Barbuto , she relaxes the tight grip of Italian cuisine without changing it in ways that are cheap or tortured. It would be easy enough for her to tidy up her seafood appetizers, her main courses of fish and meat grilled on an open fire, and her pastas, which I can never eat without smiling, and serve them in a dressier dining room. It would be hard, though, to make them taste better. \u2605\u2605\u2605; 567 Union Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-576-3095; lilianewyork.com .

Mr. Donahue\u2019s This tiny retro lunch counter has the attentiveness to atmosphere of a period movie. The lighting has a diffuse, analog softness. The music sounds like a Jonathan Schwartz radio broadcast with the soliloquies about Sinatra edited out. The most remarkable bid for nostalgia is the food proffer: an old-fashioned main course like roast beef or a nearly filler-free meatloaf of dry-aged beef, with a good sauce and a choice of two carefully considered sides for $19.99. The counter stools and handful of table seats aren\u2019t as hard to come by as you\u2019d expect, possibly because Mr. Donahue\u2019s isn\u2019t particularly celebratory. It has a contemplative, almost wistful mood. If that happens to be your mood, too, I can\u2019t think of a more congenial place to eat well downtown. \u2605\u2605; 203 Mott Street, NoLIta; 646-850-9480; mrdonahues.com . 4. Le Coq Rico The Alsatian chef Antoine Westermann has built a poultry-focused bistro that\u2019s more compelling and carnally satisfying than any modern steakhouse. His star dish is rotisserie chicken, and his secret is buying old breeds raised by farmers who let them feed and mature longer than usual. The meat has a depth of flavor you rarely encounter. Other birds, like duck and squab, play minor but memorable roles on the menu. The dedication to poultry continues with eggs and livers; the foie gras is very fine, as you\u2019d expect, but a more telling sign of how much care goes into the ingredients is the plate of gorgeous, creamy chicken livers. The prices can make your eyes pop, but so can the portions. And while Mr. Westermann spends half his time in France, he hasn\u2019t hit autopilot on Le Coq Rico. He was in the house one recent night, and new breeds of chicken have strutted onto the menu since my review. \u2605\u2605; 30 East 20th Street, Flatiron district; 212-267-7426; lecoqriconyc.com . 5. Agern The ambitious Nordic invasion of Grand Central Terminal by the Danish entrepreneur Claus Meyer has many facets, including a food hall and a Danish hot dog stall , but Agern is the one that has food worth missing a train for. The chef of this comfortably formal restaurant is Gunnar Gislason, importing the philosophy of cooking with underappreciated ingredients from nearby that he follows at Dill in Reykjavik, Iceland. The beet baked in ashes and salt that is carved at tableside , like a steamship round, may not be as exciting as its ceremony, but like much of the cooking, its flavors are honest and appealing. You can order \u00e0 la carte or amble through the \u201cfield and forest\u201d tasting menu ($140) or a nonvegetarian excursion ($165). Both prices include service and a round and tangy loaf of house-made sourdough with a memorably crackling crust. \u2605\u2605\u2605; Grand Central Terminal, 89 East 42nd Street, Midtown East; 646-568-4018; agernrestaurant.com . 6. Aska \u201cOh, not a New Nordic tasting menu,\u201d I hear you say. \u201cWe had a New Nordic tasting menu last night!\u201d Well, this one has reindeer lichen and the cinders of burned lambs\u2019 hearts \u2014 you didn\u2019t have that last night, did you? It also has a chef, Fredrik Berselius, who has become very adept at broadening and intensifying the flavors of his ingredients. Some of these are imported, like wild wood pigeon from Scotland. Others are grown or foraged nearby. Mr. Berselius is not dogmatic. He does have his share of strange ideas, but even the odd stuff pays off when you eat it. Upstairs in the selectively lighted dining room, the Unabridged Berselius is a 19-course tasting menu for $215, and the abridged, 10-course version is $145. (All prices include service.) Down in the basement is a casual lounge with small plates, none costing more than $16, although you won\u2019t find any blackened hearts down there. \u2605\u2605\u2605; 47 South Fifth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 929-337-6792; askanyc.com .

Tea is never mentioned by the servers (though it should be, because it\u2019s good), and noodles may not always be the best thing on the table. It doesn\u2019t matter. There is skillful, contemporary Chinese food all over the menu, and color photographs to let you now what you\u2019re in for. Most of the dishes are drawn from either Beijing, Shanghai or Chongqing. Peppers are not quite everywhere, but they are strongly represented in many dishes. So many fresh green chiles lurk in Madam Zhu\u2019s Spicy Fish Stew that eating it is a contact sport. There is some shading to the cooking, too. I counted three distinct frying styles, and clearly need to return to finish the survey. \u2605\u2605; 401 Avenue of the Americas, West Village; 212-633-8900; madamzhu.com . 8. G\u00fcnter Seeger NY Two of my meals were stunningly good and pure. A third had a few too many ordinary moments, which kept me from writing a full-blown rave for a restaurant where the only option at the time was a 10-course dinner for $148. Since then, a four-course, $98 menu has been added. If you can swallow either price, then I say: Go. Mr. Seeger, who earned national praise when he was in Atlanta, has a formidable command of classical European techniques, but he keeps his skills in the service of simplicity. Changing the menu every day, he almost seems to undress his ingredients, revealing the beauty of what\u2019s under the surface. It\u2019s high-risk cooking, and watching him pull it off can be thrilling. \u2605\u2605; 641 Hudson Street, West Village; 646-657-0045; gunterseegerny.com . 9. Olmsted One problem with the rise of expensive tasting menus is that a lot of culinary intelligence and imagination is locked up inside restaurants that are hard for most people to afford more than once a year, if that. Olmsted\u2019s chef, Greg Baxtrom, worked at some of those places, but he makes his own smart, inventive food inside a Brooklyn spot where I could imagine eating once a week. The carrot crepe with littleneck clams, an immediate Instagram star, is both a novelty and a fine way to start dinner. Prices are kept in line in part through affordable ingredients like guinea hen, roasted and confitted in a memorable main course. There\u2019s an inviting garden where you can have drinks and elevated bar snacks while inspecting the backyard agriculture. Homegrown kale greens up Olmsted\u2019s take on crab Rangoon, while eggs are supplied, one at a time, by a resident pair of quail. As of Sunday, they\u2019ve weathered their first winter snow. \u2605\u2605; 659 Vanderbilt Avenue, Prospect Heights 718-552-2610; olmstednyc.com . 10. Llama Inn As far as I\u2019m concerned, there ought to be two Peruvian restaurants in every New York neighborhood. One would serve rotisserie chicken, and the other would present more adventurous pieces of that country\u2019s kaleidoscopic cuisine, as Erik Ramirez does at Llama Inn. Mr. Ramirez makes an excellent ceviche and a tiradito whose marinade looks on the plate like lightly reduced Tang and tastes spicy, fruity and quietly thrilling. He also makes the only quinoa salad I\u2019ve ever looked at without feeling pity, either for the salad or for myself. \u2605\u2605; 50 Withers Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-387-3434; llamainnnyc.com .
