    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Hillary Clinton\u2019s election defeat had many pundits declaring the Clinton era finally over. But a series of meetings with key Democratic donors and leaders \u2013 combined with still-fawning press coverage and even a quirky social media project driven by a longtime aide \u2013 are raising questions about what's next. A return to the speaking circuit? Advocacy work? Assuming the role of elder stateswoman? Or even, a 2020 presidential run?\u00a0 \u201cI think if she wants to run again, and my guess is she probably does, because they always do, then yes I think she\u2019s doing a good job laying the groundwork,\u201d Brad Bannon, Democratic strategist and CEO of Bannon Communications Research, told FoxNews.com.\u00a0 A third presidential run -- after two grueling campaigns that both ended in defeat to a rival political sensation who captured the imagination of voters -- could be a stretch for the former secretary of state, senator and first lady.\u00a0 But after a brief period of reclusion, Clinton is slowly but surely appearing more in public, and in ways that indicate a political and public future of some sort.\u00a0 One clue that her team wants to keep its cachet with millennials is the viral sensation surrounding pictures of her spotted by her Chappaqua home -- in the woods, at the grocery store and elsewhere. The Twitter account @HRCInTheWild \u00a0was created to track those appearances; the account was set up by longtime Clinton aide Adam Parkhomenko. Parkhomenko is no random staffer \u2013 he created the Ready for Hillary PAC to draft her to run and was director of grassroots engagement for the 2016 campaign. His Twitter account is littered with personal letters from Clinton and photos with the candidate. Parkhomenko is such a significant player in ClintonWorld that in January The Washington Post published a lengthy profile of him. \"When you're knocked down, get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't go on.\" -Hillary pic.twitter.com/53JRNck89B \u2014 HRC In The Wild \uf332 (@HRCintheWild) December 5, 2016 Parkhomenko told FoxNews.com the Twitter account has nothing to do with the campaign, which he says wound down in November. He says instead it was a request from supporters and he happily obliged. \u201cThese photos have put a huge smile on her supporters' face and I think it has really pushed them to get back up and keep going after a devastating presidential loss. It has been incredible to watch the account grow,\u201d he said. If, as Parkhomenko says, it is a response to supporters, then it has been wildly successful. The account, which had only been up for a few weeks, has over 27,000 followers on Twitter as well as countless likes and retweets, as well as corresponding accounts on Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0 Saturday Night Live even did a light sketch on the \u201cin the wild\u201d phenomenon. Meanwhile, days after Vanity Fair described Clinton\u2019s appearances a move \u201cfrom Presidential Candidate to Wandering Folk Hero,\u201d the New York Times used similar language Sunday, calling her \u201ca new folk hero in a familiar face\u201d for some Americans. \u201cAfter the knock-down, drag-out battle of the campaign, the images suggest she has, unexpectedly, found peace,\u201d the piece reads.\u00a0 Clinton indeed continues to enjoy favorable press coverage despite her upset defeat. Even as Time magazine declared Donald Trump its person of the year this week, the write-up on Clinton in the same edition compared her to \u201can American Moses.\u201d Clinton's team also has not exited the limelight quietly.\u00a0 Campaign manager Robby Mook last week blamed the loss in part on FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to re-open the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Meanwhile, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s director of communication, accused Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway of having given a platform to white supremacists, and followed it up with a barbed op-ed in The Washington Post , calling on the Trump campaign to \u201cown up\u201d to how it won. (Conway told \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday that \"a little self-awareness would do for a team that is blaming everybody but themselves.\") Clinton herself drew attention Wednesday to what she called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of so-called \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 which some pundits and supporters have claimed contributed to her defeat. It also was blamed for a gunman visiting a D.C. pizza restaurant over the weekend looking for answers on a Clinton-related conspiracy theory.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences,\" Clinton said in a speech at the Capitol. CLINTON DECRIES FAKE NEWS IN CAPITOL SPEECH Clinton was in D.C. to pay tribute to retiring Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. While Reid is stepping down from his role, he is likely to remain as an elder statesman whose 2020 endorsement would hold value. Additionally, The New York Post reported Wednesday that Clinton is set to throw a party next week to thank her millionaire donors.\u00a0 Some strategists believe the actions may point to at least a consideration of a run in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s the Potomac Fever -- if you get close to being president, you can\u2019t get the smell off, and you\u2019re always going to want to do it again,\u201d Bannon said.\u00a0 Parkhomenko said whatever Clinton chooses to do, \u201cher supporters will be there to support her and help amplify her message. As we can see, she never sits still and I can't imagine she will not remain active in whatever she way she thinks she can continue to have the most impact for good.\u201d\u00a0 Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote, which supporters have been touting, gives her camp an argument that Clinton at least wasn\u2019t rejected by voters in a McGovern-like defeat, and if Trump\u2019s presidency stumbles, a do-over of 2016 may appeal to some. However, Bannon warned such a call could turn off many Democratic Party activists. \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure Clinton is thinking that way, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cWith both [Vice President Joe] Biden and Clinton, they\u2019re going to be pretty old by then, and what I\u2019m hearing in conversations I\u2019ve had with people in the Democratic Party is everyone really wants a new face.\u201d Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Trump said Giuliani removed his name from consideration on Nov. 29 for a position in the administration. Giuliani has advocated to become the top U.S. diplomat , adding to the drama surrounding Trump's deliberations over the secretary of state position. Trump had a well-publicized dinner with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Nov. 29 as well. \"This is not about me; it is about what is best for the country and the new administration,\" Giuliani said in a statement. Giuliani had been a committed member of Trump's campaign and served as his attack dog against opponents. He was vocal in calls to bring Hillary Clinton up on charges for her use of a private email server \u2014 which the FBI deemed was not a criminal action. Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far Giuliani will remain a vice chairman of the presidential transition team, and then is expected to return to his law firm and the private sector. \"I will always be appreciative of his 24/7 dedication to our campaign after I won the primaries and for his extremely wise counsel,\" Trump said. \"He is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date.\" When Giuliani's name was first floated as a secretary of state pick, there were some who raised concerns of his potential conflicts of interest including his work for foreign governments that made him millions of dollars. White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus, in the statement announcing the decision, sought to head off this charge as a reason that Giuliani removed his name from consideration. Preibus said the former mayor \"was vetted by our team for any possible conflicts of interest and passed with flying colors.\" Phil McCausland ",

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was part of a group of coal state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of health benefits for coal miners in the stopgap spending bill. Alex Brandon/AP Senate Democrats have dropped their objections to a short-term-funding bill that would keep the government running and avert a shutdown. Passage of that bill is expected Friday night. Timing is still unclear, and many Democrats are expected to oppose it, but the measure is on track to pass prior to a midnight deadline. That means Congress will adjourn for the year with a final, familiar act: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This measure's funding runs out in April. Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners. Retired Coal Miners At Risk Of Losing Promised Health Coverage And Pensions The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months. \"Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.\" With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday \u2014 and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations \u2014 Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown. Article continues after sponsorship The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs. The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year. Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013. Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process. The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew. Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children. Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic. The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010. ",

But why? By MONICA DAVEY DEC. 9, 2016 CHICAGO \u2014 For hours, the body lay where it had landed, just steps from the wooden sign someone had put up \u2014 a painted gun with a red slash through it. Inside a nearby house, Lee Baez had heard the gunshots in the darkness and got up to move his car so his fianc\u00e9e would not have to walk past the body as she left for work before dawn. Down the block, Sandra Harris rose later to care for her ailing 85-year-old mother and saw the body, by then draped with a sheet. After the authorities finally carried away Lee Martin, the 43-year-old man who was shot in his head and back and died here on Walnut Street in the middle of an August night, another neighbor emerged to scrub the red streaks off the sidewalk. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Living on Chicago\u2019s West Side, where the dazzling downtown skyline always seems to shimmer in view but out of reach, means mornings like these grow strangely normal. The blue lights, the yellow tape, the next day\u2019s quiet moving on \u2014 all of it. Photo Chicago police officers investigating a triple shooting in the 3300 block of West Walnut Street on May 28, the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times Over Memorial Day weekend, when The New York Times tracked every shooting in this city, the largest concentration of them happened here, in about six square miles that make up Chicago\u2019s 11th police district. Of 64 people shot that weekend, 16 were in this district. Three people were shot on this same stretch of Walnut Street. The Times returned to the blocks in the 11th District where the Memorial Day weekend shootings occurred to try to better understand Chicago\u2019s crisis of violence. Residents along Walnut Street and at other crime scenes told of a fractured community \u2014 isolated by this city\u2019s entrenched segregation, hollowed out by joblessness and poverty, and battered by resignation and indifference. Here, graystone homes and brick cottages line elegant boulevards with wide, grassy medians. Garfield Park, once known as Chicago\u2019s Central Park, sits in the 11th\u2019s middle. But on Walnut Street, one vacant lot has been there so long that walking paths are worn through it. Young men gather on this section of the street, and neighbors say they hear calls for \u201cPills!\u201d or \u201cFlats!\u201d\u2014 slang for drugs \u2014 in the middle of the day. In places like this, cycles reinforce themselves: Poverty and joblessness breed an underground economy that leads to jail and makes it harder to get jobs. Struggling, emptying schools result in the closings of the very institutions that hold communities together. Segregation throws up obstacles to economic investment. And people and programs with good intentions come and go, thwarting hopes, reinforcing frustrations while never quite addressing the underlying problems, anyway. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Into it all comes a lethal mix of readily available guns, a growing number of splintering gangs and groups, and a sense among some here that the punishment for carrying a weapon on these streets will never be larger than the risk of not carrying one. \u201cIt\u2019s about desperation, decadence, depression and rage,\u201d the Rev. Marshall E. Hatch Sr., who has given eulogies for at least 12 victims of violence this year, says of the district, home to his New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church . \u201cIt\u2019s the concentration of all of that, all in one place.\u201d Three days, 64 people shot, six of them dead: Memorial Day on the streets, and the violence that has engulfed families and neighborhoods. Homicides citywide are up about 56 percent compared to last year and shootings are up about 49 percent, but just five of Chicago\u2019s 22 police districts are driving the bulk of Chicago\u2019s rise. All are on the South or West Sides. In the 11th, shootings are up by 78 percent compared to a year ago, and homicides are up 89 percent. So far in 2016, 91 people have been killed in this district, where only about 74,000 people live. That is more homicides than in all of last year in entire cities, such as Seattle (population 684,000), Omaha (444,000) and Buffalo (258,000). Early on the morning of May 28, a gray car pulled up on Walnut Street, several teenage witnesses told a Times reporter, and men with big guns got out and started firing at other young men on a porch. Shell casings littered the street. The police say witnesses were uncooperative, and no one has been arrested. Within weeks, that shooting was a hazy memory. \u201cNow which one was that?\u201d asked a woman who lives directly across the street. Soon after, neighbors say the large homemade sign of a gun with a condemning slash through it appeared beside a vacant lot. People were unsure who put up the sign, and more have followed, one beneath the clattering \u201cL\u201d train track to downtown, another across from a children\u2019s playground. By November, someone had split the Walnut Street anti-violence sign in two, a curse word scrawled on part of the crumpled remains.

No arrests have been made. Weeks later, less than a block from that shooting on West Wilcox, a preacher led people holding hands in a circle, praying, singing and swaying. The group seemed not to notice as traffic rumbled down Pulaski Road, a crowded strip lined with storefronts promising tax preparation, hairbraiding, candy and liquor. Zaree Pendleton, a stranger to those in the circle, suddenly wandered up, agitated. He said he was recently out of prison and desperately needed help. He carefully set the Bud Light he had been drinking for breakfast on the sidewalk in the center of the swaying circle. Then he reached for the preacher\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching y\u2019all out here every morning, praying,\u201d Mr. Pendleton told the group, turning weepy. \u201cY\u2019all want to pray with me?\u201d Photo Pastor Jamie Thompson, center with his back to the camera, led a prayer outside the Reborn Community Church in the West Garfield Park neighborhood in August.

The need is greatest among the people who cluster along Pulaski\u2019s corners in the middle of the day, many out of work or only working some, the preacher said. In 2014, almost half of the families in the community areas that make up much of the 11th District \u2014 East Garfield Park , West Garfield Park and Humboldt Park \u2014 had incomes under $25,000, close to the family poverty threshold that year. Industry once flourished here. The original headquarters and distribution center of Sears, Roebuck & Co. provided thousands of jobs. But the area changed in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as whites moved away and blacks moved in. In 2014, almost a quarter of the housing units in the neighborhoods in the district were vacant, census data show.

For visitors, the park is a tourist attraction, a jewel of the city. Its lavish conservatory is jammed with hundreds of exotic plants and a dewy, tropical aroma even through Chicago\u2019s bleakest winter. Yet for many of the people who live here \u2014 some of whom say they rarely enter the conservatory \u2014 Garfield Park can be harrowing. Its nearby side streets, like Gladys, can feel menacing. On a bright afternoon not long ago, a man stepped out of an apartment onto a crowded sidewalk and a gust of wind blew his shirt up, revealing a gun. Residents say the park\u2019s perimeter can be a magnet for drug sales and violence. Seven of the 16 people shot over Memorial Day weekend were nearby.

Suburbanites use it to drive into the city for drugs. Rivalries between Chicago\u2019s increasingly splintered gangs and cliques over sales of heroin, Ecstasy, prescription drugs and marijuana have given way to gunfire \u2014 even among small-time sellers who see themselves as only peripherally involved.

Most of Ms. Marquez\u2019s ice cream customers are black, though there is a growing Hispanic population in this northern section of the district. Chicago is now made up of nearly equal thirds whites, blacks and Hispanics, but many of the city\u2019s stark lines of segregation still exist. New policies have actually hardened some lines. When Chicago\u2019s high-rise public housing projects were scheduled for demolition more than a decade ago, city leaders expected residents to spread across the city. But rental prices and other factors have concentrated many of those with government housing vouchers into neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, and kept many black public-housing residents out of richer, whiter areas. Ms. Marquez says her family coexists, if a bit awkwardly, with her customers. \u201cWe don\u2019t let them mess with us,\u201d Ms. Marquez said in Spanish. \u201cThey\u2019re not comfortable that we\u2019re here.\u201d Still, Ms. Marquez, who keeps her two youngest children in view as she stands at the truck window, said she had grown used to life on this block.

Since the public school opened decades ago at the corner of Maypole and Kolmar Avenues \u2014 several blocks from where the man was shot over Memorial Day weekend \u2014 best friends were made there, parents kept in touch during drop-offs, children were taught by teachers who had once taught their parents.

In 2013, though, facing a fiscal crisis, the city closed Marconi and about 50 other public schools. Chicago\u2019s education leaders cited poor student performances and low enrollments in what was then the largest simultaneous closing for any school district in the nation. Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration has defended the closings as needed, and a University of Chicago research group found that most of the displaced students wound up in higher-performing schools. Since 2012, the city has spent $178 million on capital improvements in the 11th District and added programs and services, city officials said. But six schools here were also shuttered, including Marconi. To get to their new school, Tilton Elementary, the children from Marconi had to cross different gang lines and new drug turfs, parents at Marconi complained. There were new teachers, new students and, in some cases, a longer walk. And the neighborhood itself was losing one more bit of precious ballast: the rare public institution that held them together. There is also this: Based on the city\u2019s own criteria, Tilton barely rated a \u201cgood standing\u201d designation, and so was only marginally better than Marconi. For many parents, the difference was hardly worth the effort. Tasha Walker, her husband and her oldest daughter had all once gone to Marconi, but she chose not to send her younger daughter on to Tilton. Instead, her children attend charter schools in a different neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m not letting my kids get lost,\u201d Ms. Walker said.

While a game's final result is not entirely predictable, a game is designed to pay a specific rate if all tickets... (Cecilia Reyes) Illinois became the first state in the nation to turn over day-to-day management of its lottery to a private firm. The firm, Northstar Lottery Group, took over the Illinois Lottery in July 2011. Since then, Northstar has been criticized for failing to deliver the profits to the state it projected when it won the Illinois bid. The state is now looking for a replacement. But there has been little talk of how private management affected players. International Game Technology, formerly known as GTECH, and Scientific Games, which formed Northstar, are multinational companies that have long done behind-the-scenes grunt work for state lotteries, including Illinois. The management company has been paid based on how much profit it brought the state. The firms have touted their work in Illinois as they pushed to expand their business and manage lotteries in other states. IGT, which controlled Northstar, and Scientific Games did not dispute the Tribune findings that many big prizes weren't awarded, nor that those games' payout rates were lower than designed. But they argued the findings were irrelevant or misleading, and whatever problems may have existed could be blamed on a host of reasons, from meddling state officials to players not fully appreciating the innovative games offered. And the firms also said that players' odds of winning were never affected, even if a grand prize was never awarded. \"Northstar consistently and unwaveringly made decisions for the benefit of the players and the Illinois Lottery and not its suppliers IGT or Scientific Games,\" IGT wrote in response to Tribune questions. One of the state's most powerful lawmakers, Senate President John Cullerton, said the Tribune's findings left him \"very concerned.\" He said the unawarded prizes and payout rates could cause lasting damage and cost every taxpayer \u2014 even those who have never bought a lottery ticket \u2014 in a cash-strapped state that's grown dependent on lottery profits to help make ends meet. \"If the players are not treated fairly, then they'll stop buying it, and then we'll lose money,\" said Cullerton, D-Chicago. A bold experiment State lawmakers were hopeful when they turned over management of the lottery to a private company in 2011. In their eyes, the lottery had become a moribund business. Private hands, state officials argued, could spur new and creative games that would generate badly needed revenue for the state. \"Government bureaucrats simply are not in the best position to overhaul and remarket the Illinois Lottery,\" Cullerton said at the time. Northstar's winning pitch was bold. While it would continue to grow traditional draw games \u2014 in which bouncing numbered balls are randomly selected, for example \u2014 the Northstar consortium would look to supercharge sales in the popular instant game category with never-before-seen prizes in Illinois to capture the public's imagination and dramatically increase profits to the state. The Tribune obtained thousands of pages of records and analyzed scores of data sets from Illinois and several other states to study instant tickets, the best-selling and fastest-growing revenue stream for state lotteries. With names such as Dazzling Dollar$ and Freezing Your Bucks Off, each instant game tries to attract potential players with a mix of quirky themes and lucrative prizes. Unlike Lotto -type jackpot games, instant games are each preplanned, self-contained products. Each game pays for its prizes from the money it raises in sales. And that leaves a critical question: How many tickets should they print? Lottery officials from other states say they try to print only as many tickets as they think they can sell for each game. They know sales tend to taper off for games over time, and they say the goal is to award the final grand prize before sales tank. While printing fewer tickets may limit how many and the size of the prizes they can advertise, those states say they would rather be conservative. In Illinois, Northstar pushed to dramatically increase the number of tickets printed for games. This allowed them to offer bigger and better prizes for games. Players \u2014 enticed by bigger potential wins \u2014 bought more instant tickets than ever, the Tribune analysis found. Players' increased appetite was lucrative for IGT and Scientific Games, who were paid a cut of sales, as well as the state, which received more profit. But the appetite was not nearly enough to gobble up the sea of tickets printed, records show. And as sales eventually dropped in many of the big-prize games, Northstar pushed to remove tickets from store shelves before all, or sometimes any, of the grand prizes were awarded. The Tribune reviewed the 138 instant games begun and ended by Northstar in the last five fiscal years, through June 2016. Reporters focused on the 17 games that offered the biggest grand prizes: games with a grand prize costing the state at least $1 million to fund. Those 17 big-prize games made up only one-eighth of the instant games, but they played an outsize role in Northstar's efforts to meet its ambitious sales targets, accounting for more than a third of the sales. And the first of those 17 to end was a highly touted game called Birthday Surprise. Jim Carter Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Jim Carter, 41, questioned why many of the large grand prizes for scratch-off games were not awarded during Northstar Lottery Group's management of the Illinois Lottery. \u201cThere has to be accountability for that,\u201d the veteran lottery player said.

(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Surprise ending The top of the ticket said Happy Birthday, with the letters positioned as if they were hanging from a string banner at a party. Below them: the scratch-off area, its coating superimposed with an image of a massive present tied in a bow. In between were the details of just what could be behind the box: \"Win $150,000 immediately and $150,000 on your birthday for the next 20 years!\" For $5, a player could scratch off the present to see if it was a winner. The game's design called for two grand prizes, and nearly 10 million tickets were printed. That's 3 1/2 times more tickets than the state, when it ran the lottery, had typically sold for a $5 game. Northstar, through its majority owner IGT, declined to tell the Tribune exactly how many tickets it expected to sell for this game or others, but it acknowledged, in general, it printed more tickets for big-prize games than it anticipated it would sell. One reason it did so, it said, was to make sure it had enough tickets in case players really liked a game. Other states told the Tribune another solution to such a welcome dilemma is to order more tickets and offer more prizes.\u00a0Northstar did it for one of the 17 games, but not Birthday Surprise. Scientific Games, the minority partner in Northstar, told the Tribune it objected at the time to the large number of tickets printed to support what it called the Birthday Surprise game's \"poorly designed prize structure.\" The firm declined to provide further details on exactly how it believed the game should have been designed. Birthday Surprise hit the shelves in late 2012. Northstar's business plan showed the game sold slightly better than traditional instant ticket games through early 2013, when it awarded its first grand prize in a made-for-TV moment. A struggling cable installer, on his birthday, stopped into Casey's General Store in downstate Auburn and scratched off the first grand prize winner. The state issued a news release on the win , touting the game as one of its most popular on the market. Within weeks, the lottery invited TV cameras to record officials handing the winner the ceremonial oversize check. A local TV reporter wrapped up her story by showing the face of a Birthday Surprise ticket and noting: \"There's actually another winning ticket just like it floating around out there.\" Yet that same month, Northstar drafted a plan to end the game \u2014 making it less likely the second prize would be awarded. Regular lottery player Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Chicagoan Lottie Sowinski, 56, who often plays scratch-offs, said she assumed an instant game was stopped only after all the tickets were sold. \u201cIt makes you feel, like, that we\u2019re a fool to put money into it if they\u2019re not going to give out the top prizes,\u201d she said in response to findings of a Tribune investigation.

(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) 'Player favorite' In written business plans Northstar provided to the Tribune, the company told the state that the game was a \"current player favorite and well performing,\" but still wasn't selling well enough. So the game would be \"reintroduced.\" Sure enough, Birthday Surprise was soon pulled from shelves without awarding the second grand prize. Nobody can say for sure whether someone bought the second grand prize-winning ticket and never claimed it. IGT and Scientific Games said, for security reasons, nobody knows exactly where a winning ticket sits among the millions of tickets printed. But the game sold just 64 percent of its tickets. The remaining tickets sat in a warehouse until the game ended and then were destroyed. No winner of the second grand prize came forward. The lottery offered players no explanation. Ten weeks later, a new Birthday Surprise entered store shelves nearly identical to the first: same number of tickets printed and same prize structure. Only the ticket design was slightly different, with balloons and smaller presents. Northstar released a commercial featuring the first version's only grand prize winner \u00a0\u2014 the cable installer \u2014 who pitched what Northstar called the \"newest edition\" of the game. He recounted his lucky win and ended with a variation of the lottery's catchphrase: \"Anything's possible.\" The second edition of Birthday Surprise was ended after less than 10 months and 49 percent of tickets sold. Neither of its grand prizes were awarded. Scratch-off tickets Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Bob Kirby, of Chicago, scratches off Wheel of Fortune instant game tickets. For the biggest-prize instant games, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2015, the Illinois Lottery did not award 23 grand prizes, or more than 40 percent of those designed into the games, the Tribune found in an investigation.

For the biggest-prize instant games, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2015, the Illinois Lottery did not award 23 grand prizes, or more than 40 percent of those designed into the games, the Tribune found in an investigation. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Lagging other states Both Birthday Surprises were among 17 instant games whose combined results awarded a smaller share of grand prizes than similar games run under state management, or in other states studied by the Tribune. For comparable big-prize games begun and ended in Illinois in the six years before Northstar was hired, the state awarded 87.5 percent of the grand prizes the games were designed to pay out. That's in line with how other states have run their big-prize games. The Tribune sought data from states with the highest sales of instant tickets. Six states provided enough data from recent years for comparison. For grand prizes that cost lotteries $1 million or more to fund, New York awarded nearly 80 percent of them. In Pennsylvania, it was 83 percent. In Texas, it was 88 percent. Florida, Massachusetts and Ohio each had a perfect record: 100 percent. In Illinois, under Northstar, the rate was 59.6 percent. Other states' lottery officials said they would be worried about how their players might react to such a statistic in their states. ",

More than 20 aircraft were used to destroy the tanker trucks, which were gathered near Palmyra, in central Syria. The oil in the trucks was worth about $2 million, according to a\u00a0statement. The airstrike, which was launched Thursday, is\u00a0part of an operation to reduce revenues from the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS or ISIL. The Islamic State gets 25% of its revenue from oil, the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, a private research group, estimates. It's not clear why the Islamic State massed so many vehicles in the open. ",

    "text": "Stephen Bannon found inspiration in ancient thinkers, Ronald Reagan and Nazi propaganda Steve Bannon Evan Vucci / Associated Press Steven K. Bannon, the Breitbart News chief who was chairman of Donald Trump's campaign, will be a top advisor in the Trump White House. Steven K. Bannon, the Breitbart News chief who was chairman of Donald Trump's campaign, will be a top advisor in the Trump White House. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Matt Pearce In the 1990s, long before\u00a0 Stephen K. Bannon became the chairman of Breitbart News and\u00a0one of Donald Trump \u2019s top advisors, he was just another guy\u00a0in Beverly Hills who liked Shakespeare and wanted to make movies. The Navy veteran and former Goldman Sachs investment banker was a feverish reader who kept books neatly stacked on the floor of his condo that couldn\u2019t fit on his shelves. Bannon had the tastes of\u00a0a liberal-arts major, sampling ideas from ancient civilizations all over the world. He liked Sun Tzu\u2019s\u00a0\u201cArt of War\u201d and the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book, according to his former longtime writing partner, Julia Jones.\u00a0 \u201cBefore 9/11, he was different,\u201d said Jones, a liberal who fondly remembered discussing philosophy\u00a0with Bannon. \u201cHe talked about Plato and\u00a0Socrates all the time.\u201d At one point the pair developed a proposal for a TV show to feature philosophers from a wide range of traditions, including non-European\u00a0mystics and shamans. But Bannon, who kept a photo of Ronald Reagan over his desk, started\u00a0down a more hard-line\u00a0path of conservative thought after the 2001 terrorist attacks, according to those who knew him during his time in Hollywood.\u00a0 \u201cHe went further into a world of absolutes \u2014 \u00a0black and white, good versus evil,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe was so open to such a world of great thinkers.\u00a0I don\u2019t know how that same person could have chosen such a narrow path.\u201d Today, Bannon represents a new ideological force inside the Republican party ,\u00a0an antiestablishment\u00a0activist and businessman propelled from the fringes of the GOP to its very center \u2014 seen by his critics as the proverbial\u00a0barbarian who has breached the gates. Bannon is\u00a0Trump\u2019s choice for chief\u00a0White House strategist, a self-professed nationalist with a vision of reshaping\u00a0America\u2019s policies on immigration, trade and the economy, but whose\u00a0agenda and influence on\u00a0the president-elect\u00a0are little understood by the public. A survey of Bannon\u2019s intellectual influences over the years reveals\u00a0a voracious reader willing to expose himself to a range of international thinkers, but who holds hard-line, us-versus-them\u00a0views on immigration and Islam; a Roman Catholic who thinks of the world in terms of epic battles between\u00a0good and evil, who has been driven toward action by the Sept. 11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis;\u00a0a veteran of the Cold War and of Wall Street who believes America\u2019s military should be strong\u00a0and its capitalism more tender; and a Harvard-educated\u00a0agitator comfortable in the back rooms of the elite,\u00a0who has studied\u00a0propaganda to achieve his goal\u00a0of swaying\u00a0the masses. He went further into a world of absolutes \u2013 black and white, good versus evil. \u2014 Bannon's former writing partner, Julia Jones \u00a0Many left-leaning\u00a0critics have protested his selection as senior White House advisor and have\u00a0accused\u00a0him\u00a0of being a closet white supremacist and anti-Semite . (Bannon, who did not respond to interview requests submitted to the Trump\u00a0transition team, has denied such\u00a0assertions.) Bannon has repeatedly stated his\u00a0long-term goal: shatter the political establishment, including the conservative one,\u00a0and create\u00a0an unorthodox \u201ccenter-right\u201d populist movement based on nationalism and a more humane form of capitalism.\u00a0He seems to have found his vehicle for those goals in Trump, whose campaign Bannon joined in August. Bannon\u00a0has cultivated an archvillain image, recently declaring, \u201c Darkness is good ,\u201d and praising Dick Cheney,\u00a0Darth Vader\u00a0and Satan as emblems of power. (One \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor played Bannon by wearing a Grim Reaper costume.)\u00a0Bannon\u2019s remarks succeeded in further enraging his liberal critics, who see him as the master enabler of a demagogue.

Allison Levine of Los Angeles joins protest marchers near the Breitbart News Network office on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills on Dec. 4. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) In the past,\u00a0Bannon has repeatedly expressed his affinity for the technique of\u00a0 Nazi propaganda filmmaker\u00a0Leni Riefenstahl , whose work in the 1930s glamorized the rise of Adolf Hitler. \u201cOne time we were in the office, and he said, \u2018I want to be the Leni Riefenstahl of George Bush,\u2019 and I was horrified,\u2019\u201d Jones said. (Jones said Bannon later amended his remark\u00a0to say he wanted to be the Riefenstahl of the GOP.) The filmmaker Tim Watkins, who approached Bannon around 2000 to create a documentary about Reagan, said Bannon introduced him to Riefenstahl\u2019s work, which many film students also study. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Watkins said of the content of Reifenstahl\u2019s work, \u201cbut you had to look at it as\u00a0the art it was and how it influenced the nation and the world.\u201d The ensuing documentary co-directed by Bannon and Watkins, \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d released in 2004, uses similar dramatic imagery, and\u00a0praises\u00a0Reagan as\u00a0\u201ca radical, with extreme views\u201d on government, while referring to America\u2019s fascist and communist adversaries simply as \u201cthe beast.\u201d\u00a0 The film also offers a clue as to\u00a0why Bannon seemed so at home in liberal Hollywood, where he would go on to create additional\u00a0conservative documentaries. A narrator praises\u00a0the Hollywood of the 1930s as \u201cthe most powerful crucible on Earth,\u201d\u00a0a \u201cbrutally efficient industrial process\u201d run by Jewish refugees with\u00a0\u201cruthlessness and uncompromising patriotism\u201d that\u00a0reinforced the values of Western civilization\u00a0with\u00a0stories of \u201corder versus chaos, good versus evil.\u201d Hollywood, in other words, was an ideological weapon. \u201cThat was mostly his writing and mostly him,\u201d said Jones, who was credited as a co-writer with Bannon on the film, and who said Bannon also admired the technique of liberal political filmmaker Michael Moore. (Both men share a fascination with populist messages and a disdain for business suits.) The Reagan documentary drew the attention of conservative provocateur Andrew Breitbart, who later\u00a0 called Bannon the Riefenstahl of the tea party movement. The pair fell into each other\u2019s\u00a0orbits.\u00a0 Bannon cited the 2008 financial crisis as another turning point that drove him deeper into conservative politics, like the Sept. 11 attacks and his military service during the Cold War. The 'alt-right' splinters as supporters and critics agree it was white supremacy all along \u00bb \u201cI come from a blue-collar, Irish Catholic, pro-Kennedy, pro-union family of Democrats,\u201d Bannon, who was born in Virginia,\u00a0 told Bloomberg Businessweek last year . \u201cI wasn\u2019t political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter [messed]\u00a0things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had [messed]\u00a0up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s death in 2012 led to Bannon\u2019s installation as chairman of Breitbart News, a rabble-rousing conservative news site. At Breitbart, an editor, Joel Pollak, recalled seeing a \u201cstaggering collection of books\u201d at Bannon's desk, mostly about history, including some first editions. \u201cWe shared an interest in \u2018The Private Life of Chairman Mao\u2019\u00a0by Dr. Li Zhisui,\u201d Pollak said in an email.\u00a0\u201cThe most recent book I discussed with him was [Timothy] Snyder's new history of the Holocaust , \u2018Black Earth,\u2019\u00a0which argues that the Soviet destruction of its Eastern European neighbors eventually facilitated Hitler's Final Solution by creating a stateless, amoral environment.\u201d Stephen K. Bannon talks with callers on his SiriusXM radio show in July. Kirk Irwin / Getty Images Stephen K. Bannon talks with callers on his SiriusXM radio show in July. Stephen K. Bannon talks with callers on his SiriusXM radio show in July. (Kirk Irwin / Getty Images) At Breitbart, Bannon dived into the populist realm\u00a0of right-wing radio and hosted a SiriusXM show, where\u00a0the Harvard Business School graduate occasionally\u00a0flashed\u00a0unorthodox reading habits. During one January program, he likened global migration to a \u201cCamp of the Saints,\u201d the title of a 1973 French novel about immigration that the Southern Poverty Law Center has called \u201ca racist fantasy about an invasion of France and the white Western world by a fleet of starving, dark-skinned refugees.\u201d The problem America faces, Bannon said in a 2014 speech at the Vatican , is \u201ca crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism,\u201d and\u00a0he outlined his belief that the West was in an existential struggle against \u201cjihadist Islamic fascism.\u201d In the same speech, Bannon criticized free-market capitalism as \u201ca capitalism that really looks to make people commodities\u201d and called for an \u201cenlightened capitalism\u201d that is \u201creally distributed among a middle class.\u201d\u00a0(In 2013, Pope Francis \u00a0 criticized capitalism for treating\u00a0people as\u00a0\u201cconsumer goods to be used and then discarded.\u201d Francis does not share Bannon\u2019s views on\u00a0Islam.) Bannon\u2019s moderator for the speech, Benjamin Harnwell of the Institute\u00a0for Human Dignity, a Christian think tank, said that Bannon\u2019s Catholicism had clearly influenced his views on capitalism. \u201cI think recognition of the imago Dei \u2014 that man is made in the image and likeness of God \u2014 runs all the way through Steve Bannon\u2019s thought in a sincere way,\u201d Harnwell said\u00a0in an email.\u00a0 Under Bannon's stewardship, Breitbart News has been criticized for running racist content \u00a0and\u00a0has attracted\u00a0a following among\u00a0white supremacists, some of whom see Bannon\u2019s nationalist views as a milder form of their own beliefs. But many of Bannon\u2019s associates have said they can\u2019t recall him saying anything explicitly\u00a0racist.\u00a0 \u201cIn all the years I knew him, he never talked about any eugenic or racial superiority,\u201d said Jones.\u00a0\u201cHe never even talked about a person\u2019s race or their religion.\u201d Since joining Trump\u2019s victorious campaign, Bannon has scarcely spoken at all publicly, and has moved out of the role of bashing the establishment to become one of its most powerful representatives. \u201cEight months ago, everybody could tell you Steve Bannon was one of the most opinionated people on Earth,\u201d said Watkins.\u00a0\u201cBut now you wouldn\u2019t know Steve\u2019s opinion about dinner.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 , Al Gore might have gotten played, \u00a0 South Korean lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, \u00a0and the American Dream is more elusive than ever, a study finds .

    "text": "WATCH Opioid Epidemic: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email A new poll released by the Pew Research Center today indicates that a majority of Americans oppose any loosening of environmental regulations or a repeal of the Affordable Care Act , two of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign pledges. The survey also suggests that a minority of Americans approve of Trump's picks for his Cabinet so far. On Wednesday, Trump named Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as his choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt is an outspoken critic of environmental regulations and believes the EPA has crippled the U.S. energy industry. But 59 percent of people surveyed by Pew say stronger environmental laws and regulations are worth any potential costs to the economy. And when it comes to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, 53 percent said they expect the ACA\u2019s major provisions to be eliminated while 39 percent expect them to continue. Thirty-nine percent of respondents want to repeal the law all together; 15 percent favor leaving it as is; and 39 percent want to expand it. The Pew poll highlights the significant challenges Trump faces once he takes office in January. Can Trump Repeal Obamacare in First 100 Days? Americans view Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices less favorably than previous president-elects. Only 40 percent approve of Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices and other high level appointments. That compares to 71 percent who approved of President Obama\u2019s Cabinet choices in December of 2008 and 58 percent who expressed positive views of George W. Bush\u2019s appointments in January of 2001. While the Trump transition team has moved quickly to pick Cabinet members, the process has had a flair for the dramatic, with candidates filing through the Trump Tower lobby and reports of infighting among Trump\u2019s confidantes, most recently over the choice of secretary of State. And there is criticism that Trump is not delivering on his campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of establishment figures and insiders in Washington, D.C. Currently, his Cabinet is stacked with wealthy GOP donors and Wall Street insiders. On Thursday night in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump pushed back on criticism of his Cabinet picks. \u201cOne newspaper criticized me, \u2018Why can't they have people of modest means?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause I want people that made a fortune because now they are negotiating with you. OK?\u201d Americans are also concerned about Trump\u2019s Twitter habit. Eighty-two percent of people surveyed say once Trump enters the White House he \u201cwill need to be more cautious about the kinds of things he says and tweets.\u201d And a majority -- 54 percent -- think Trump has not done enough to distance himself from the white nationalists who supported his campaign. Thirty-five percent of respondents think Trump will be a good or great president; 18 percent say he will be average and 38 percent say he will be poor or terrible. But when Trump was just a president candidate, 25 percent of those polled by Pew in October said he would make a good or great president, while 57 percent said he would be poor or terrible. Pew Research Center surveyed 1,502 adults from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. 0 Shares ",

By Adam Entous , Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller December 9 at 7:36 PM Follow @nakashimae Follow @gregpmiller The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton\u2019s chances. \u201cIt is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia\u2019s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,\u201d said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. \u201cThat\u2019s the consensus view.\u201d The Obama administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton\u2019s campaign. In September, during a secret briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to officials present. The Post's Ellen Nakashima goes over the events and discusses the hacker groups responsible. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russian hacking. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered\u201d in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, \u201ccould be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The CIA presentation to senators about Russia\u2019s intentions fell short of a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U.S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency\u2019s assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered. For example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin \u201cdirecting\u201d the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U.S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were \u201cone step\u201d removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the \u201cRussian government is not the source.\u201d The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election, among claims that Donald Trump's rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) On Friday, the White House said President Obama had ordered a \u201cfull review\u201d of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process. \u201cWe may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,\u201d Obama\u2019s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office Jan.\u00a020, Monaco said. During her remarks, Monaco didn\u2019t address the latest CIA assessment, which hasn\u2019t been previously disclosed. Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation. Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIA\u2019s presentation. This week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House also sent a letter to Obama, asking for briefings on Russian interference in the election. U.S. intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russia\u2019s motivations, reflecting the United States\u2019 long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on President Vladi\u00admir Putin and those closest to him. In previous assessments, the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscow\u2019s aim was to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect Trump. On Oct.\u00a07, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of \u201cpolitical organizations.\u201d Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the computers of the DNC and other Democratic groups and individuals. Some key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there\u2019s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence \u2014 even now,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that\u2019s it.\u201d [ U.S. investigating potential covert Russian plan to disrupt elections ] Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U.S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaign. Within the administration, top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond. White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia, with sophisticated cyber capabilities, might have less to lose than the United States, with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructure. The White House\u2019s reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more limited measures, including the \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d approach of publicly blaming Moscow. By mid-September, White House officials had decided it was time to take that step, but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposes. Instead, officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12 \u2014 a group that includes House and Senate leaders, as well as the ranking members of both chambers\u2019 committees on intelligence and homeland security. Obama dispatched Monaco, FBI Director James B. Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a \u201cshow of solidarity and bipartisan unity\u201d against Russian interference in the election, according to a senior administration official. Specifically, the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusions. Though U.S. intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way, the White House feared that Moscow would attempt to do so, sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow. In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U.S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia\u2019s role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals. And they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as \u201cthe threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process.\u201d The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests. According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics. Some of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election, a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscow\u2019s hands. McConnell\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. After the election, Trump chose McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, as his nominee for transportation secretary. Some Clinton supporters saw the White House\u2019s reluctance to act without bipartisan support as further evidence of an excessive caution in facing adversaries. \u201cThe lack of an administration response on the Russian hacking cannot be attributed to Congress,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who was at the September meeting. \u201cThe administration has all the tools it needs to respond. They have the ability to impose sanctions. They have the ability to take clandestine means. The administration has decided not to utilize them in a way that would deter the Russians, and I think that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Philip Rucker contributed to this report. Read more: ",
