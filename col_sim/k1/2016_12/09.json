(AP) Former astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his past missions and the future of the U.S. space program. (AP) Geraldine Baum and Valerie J. Nelson When his bell-shaped capsule splashed into the ocean after orbiting Earth again and again, John Glenn emerged an instant hero \u2014 the fighter-jock pilot of few words who in just five hours of circling the planet helped cement America\u2019s faith that it could lead the race into outer space. He walked across the deck of the aircraft carrier where Friendship 7 had been lowered as casually\u00a0as a guy who\u2019d just returned from running a crosstown errand, exuding a confidence and swagger later mythologized in Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d Decades later, at the age of 77, Glenn would return to space on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery after selling himself as a human guinea pig who would demonstrate the effects of space travel on the elderly. \u00a0 Glenn, who also served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Ohio, died Thursday at the age of 95 after being hospitalized Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cWhen John Glenn blasted off from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas rocket in 1962, he lifted the hopes of a nation. And when his Friendship 7 spacecraft splashed down a few hours later, the first American to orbit the Earth reminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there\u2019s no limit to the heights we can reach together,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. Glenn was the last surviving astronaut of the original Mercury 7 group, preceded in death by Alan B. Shepard Jr., Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton and Scott Carpenter. In his first historic flight, Glenn circled Earth for nearly five hours in a tiny spaceship on Feb. 20, 1962, the first American to orbit the planet. When he returned to space in 1998, his voyage did nearly as much to revive interest in America's space program as his first pioneering voyage had to ignite the country's fascination\u00a0in space exploration. Glenn first earned broad public attention in 1962 in the bell-shaped space capsule Friendship 7 \u2014 a flight that NASA 's mission control worried might burn up upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere. A war hero and test pilot who earned fame even before he was named to the Mercury team, Glenn seemed to have the right stuff and more. Not only did Glenn \u201chave courage and ambition, but he also had supreme confidence in himself and his own abilities,\u201d qualities that distinguished him from most mortals, said Frank Van Riper, who wrote the 1983 biography \u201cGlenn: The Astronaut Who Would Be President.\u201d \u201cThat type of confidence can let him sit atop a rocket and have his blood pressure not change at all.\u201d The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. Associated Press The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. (Associated Press) After his first space flight, Glenn, then 40, was elevated to celebrity status as much by his personal charm and heroics as he was by the pioneering era that he helped define. Before Glenn made his three loops around Earth in a four-hour, 56-minute flight, only Soviet astronauts, test dummies and dogs had made historic \u201cfirsts\u201d in space. Almost a year before Glenn defied gravity, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first man in space. Glenn was neither the first nor second American in space. Those distinctions belonged to Shepard, whose entire voyage lasted 15 minutes and who was followed months later by Grissom. Yet Glenn's flight raised the most passion and publicity in America. Glenn stayed aloft for hours, focusing Americans' rapt attention on his every orbit and ultimately restoring America's confidence in its technological prowess. President Kennedy was apparently so relieved that Glenn helped put America back in the space race, and so concerned about the astronaut's well-being, that he vetoed a return to space by Glenn. Rather, Kennedy marked Glenn as an American with a political future. After a few early political defeats, the astronaut was elected to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1974. Although Glenn remained a supporter of NASA, he tried to steer clear of being seen as the Senate \u201castronaut,\u201d preferring to make his mark in other areas. He was perhaps best known as the author of bills to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. He also helped pass legislation to clean up radioactive waste at the nation's nuclear weapons sites. Yet his drive to return to space never fully abated, and he relentlessly lobbied the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for another space flight. Glenn insisted that he was not driven to return to space for the thrill of the ride or as a passenger with a congressional free pass but as a scientist-explorer. What you're up there for is to accomplish something for the country that may break us into some new areas of research that may benefit an awful lot of people. \u2014 John Glenn \u201cWhat you're up there for,\u201d he said, \u201cis to accomplish something for the country that may break us into some new areas of research that may benefit an awful lot of people.\u201d After his late-in-life flight, dozens of tests done on his body showed that he handled the rigors of space as well as astronauts roughly half his age, NASA scientists said when results were released in 2000. In 2012, Glenn and Carpenter received a hero\u2019s welcome when they returned to the Cape Canaveral launchpad to mark the 50th anniversary of Glenn\u2019s orbital flight. The national attention after the 1962 flight was \u201calmost unbelievable,\u201d Glenn said at the event, and added that he and his colleagues learned to live with the acclaim \u201cor tried to anyway.\u201d John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio. His mother, Clara, a teacher, and father, John, soon moved to the tiny town of New Concord, where his father opened a plumbing business. At 3, he met Anna \u201cAnnie\u201d Castor, the 4-year-old daughter of the town dentist. The pair started dating in high school and married in 1944. In high school, Glenn was an honors student who excelled in sports and student politics \u2014 and played the lead in the senior class play. A religious young man, Glenn enrolled in Muskingum College, a small Presbyterian school in New Concord, where he sang in the church choir and played football. While there, Glenn learned to fly through a civilian program run by the Navy. When it came time to enlist, he joined the Marines, leaving college behind after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he rose to the rank of captain and decided to make a career in the military. By the end of the war, he had flown 59 missions with F-4U fighters, and was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and 10 Air Medals. The Korean War meant 90 more missions for the Marine aviator, and many more medals, including a third and fourth Distinguished Flying Cross. \u201cGlenn grew up with the archetypal Protestant work ethic and the idea that good things happen to people who work hard,\u201d Van Riper said. \u201cAdd to this sense of confidence and the idea in the military that you succeed if you work hard, and it explains why he pursued tougher and tougher assignments.\u201d As a test pilot, Glenn pushed his bosses to let him attempt a transcontinental flight in an F8U-1 Crusader fighter aircraft. On July 16, 1957, he set a speed record of 3 hours 23 minutes and 8.4 seconds flying from Los Angeles to New York, picking up a fifth Distinguished Flying Cross and a taste for fame. Two years later, Glenn volunteered for an elite corps of pilots who would become the country's first astronauts, riding rockets into space. NASA pared an original list of about 500 test pilots down to 110 and then to the Mercury Seven. Training was rigorous and tedious. In addition to studying astrophysics and biology, the new astronauts were exposed to high heat, strong forces of gravity and the sense of weightlessness. Glenn became a pacesetter in training and moral leadership. He would run extra miles in a morning workout and lecture the others against carousing. When Glenn took his pioneering turn in space, astronaut Carpenter spoke for all Americans when he radioed from launch control just before liftoff, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn.\u201d Carpenter later said he had tried to keep the mood light by playfully telling Glenn: \u201cRemember, John, this was built by the low bidder.\u201d NASA cut the flight short \u2014 Glenn was supposed to orbit Earth seven times \u2014 when mechanical failure created concern that Friendship 7's heat shield might fall off during re-entry and cause the capsule to burn up. Although he remained calm, Glenn later told Life magazine that he had been prepared to die. The heat shield held. After Glenn's safe return, he became a national hero. Bathed in the spotlight, Glenn was typically low key. \u201cIt's been a long day,\u201d he said after being fished out of the Atlantic Ocean by helicopter, \u201cbut it has been very interesting.\u201d Back on Earth, Glenn was greeted by Kennedy; 4 million New Yorkers showered him and his family with ticker tape; and the New York Times called him \u201cAmerica's first flesh-and-blood Buck Rogers.\u201d John Glenn parade Associated Press Astronaut John Glenn in car at left, the first American to orbit the Earth, got a massive ticker tape parade welcome along lower Broadway on March 1, 1962.

A partly constructed building at right served as a grandstand for a cheering crowd. Sitting beside the astronaut is Annie Glenn, his wife.\u00a0 (Associated Press) Reflecting on that moment decades later while sitting in his third-floor office at the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at Ohio State University , Glenn was at a loss to explain the adulation: \u201cIt\u2019s true we got more attention. It wasn\u2019t something we planned. Truth is, I just don\u2019t know why it happened.\u201d After his ambition to fly again was scratched, Glenn retired from the military in 1965 and entered private business, serving first as vice president of corporate planning and then as president of the Royal Crown Cola Co. He also made a fortune with business investments that included building Holiday Inns in Florida. But within a few years, he decided to try politics. After losing the 1970 Democratic primary in Ohio for a U.S. Senate seat to Howard Metzenbaum, Glenn ran against him again in 1974. During the campaign, Metzenbaum contrasted his business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials, saying his opponent had \u201cnever worked for a living.\u201d Glenn's reply came to be known as the \u201cGold Star Mothers\u201d speech. He challenged Metzenbaum to tell wounded veterans \u201cthey didn't hold a job\u201d and tell any Gold Star mother \u2014 women with a child who died while serving in the military \u2014 that \u201cher son did not hold a job.\u201d Glenn won the nomination and the general election. Jimmy Carter considered making Glenn his running mate in the 1976 presidential race but after Glenn gave an uninspired address to the Democratic National Convention, Carter chose Walter Mondale. A decade later, Glenn ran for president and racked up $3 million in debt but didn't make it out of the primaries. \u201cHe was never really a coalition builder,\u201d Van Riper said. And if he was considered a bit of a square by the other Mercury astronauts, that image intensified in the U.S. Senate, where he served until 1999. His relationships with others on Capitol Hill was always cordial if not distant. But in Glenn's post-Watergate class of 1974, he was always a respected colleague, considered a sincerely decent man. His Norman Rockwell character and reputation for unparalleled principle were\u00a0severely tested in 1989 during the so-called Keating Five scandal. He was one of five senators investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for using clout to keep federal regulators out of the way of savings-and-loan mogul Charles Keating Jr. The committee said Glenn used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting a $200,000 donation from Keating but cleared the senator of wrongdoing. Through all the years after his famous flight in space, Glenn continued flying. Almost every weekend he would escape Washington for Ohio in his Beechcraft Baron, with his wife as his co-pilot. When he sold his plane in early 2012, Glenn noted that he still held a valid pilot\u2019s license. In 1995, he had started campaigning to return to space. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aging, he had learned that the aging process on Earth, in many ways, is similar to the effects of weightlessness, and he decided he wanted to know why. Glenn approached NASA chief Dan Goldin and pressed to serve as a crew member on a Discovery flight as a test subject for geriatric experiments. Goldin gave the go-ahead after aging experts insisted that Glenn's mission might produce good science and NASA's own doctors found Glenn in good health. He had kept fit throughout the decades, running in his youth and power-walking in his later years around his Bethesda, Md., neighborhood. He lifted weights, ate well, took vitamins and kept trim. The day after returning to Earth on the space shuttle, Glenn admitted he had felt \u201ca little woozy\u201d upon landing but relayed a message aimed at other senior citizens. \u201cOld folks have ambitions and dreams too, like everyone else. ... Why don't they go for them? Don't sit on a couch someplace,\u201d he said. But age did catch up. Glenn sold off his airplanes and stopped flying in 2013 and then last year, he gave up driving\u00a0too. Though his eyesight was failing, Glenn was still consumed with tracking current events \u2014 Islamic State, the Iranian nuclear arms deal and the deep spending cuts to the nation\u2019s space program, which he believed to be a crucial\u00a0misstep. His return to space was, in a way, Glenn's attempt at writing his own epitaph. \u201cGoing back up there was a nice capstone to a career that was always centered on that 1962 flight,\u201d Van Riper said. \u201cHe's going to be remembered as the last American hero.\u201d Glenn, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, is survived by his wife, Annie; two children, David and Carolyn Ann;\u00a0and two grandchildren.

Time Astronaut John Glenn wears a Mercury pressure suit during training for his 1962 space flight. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) John Glenn's death has sparked remembrances of the\u00a0man whose varied life as an astronaut and U.S. senator made him an American icon. But he was more than a risk-taker and statesman. He was better than all of us. Here are some interesting facts about the American hero: He orbited\u00a0the globe more than 100 times Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, would do it more than 100 times. He first circled the globe in 1962, when he went around the world three times and then plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. In a later trip, he would circle the globe another 134 times. He's the oldest person to go into space In 1998, the\u00a077-year-old\u00a0climbed aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest\u00a0person ever to go into space.\u00a0NASA did a number of medical tests on Glenn in preparation for the flight and after the trip. He flew 149 military combat missions Glenn, who got his first taste of\u00a0flying\u00a0as an 8-year-old, flew 149 combat missions in World War II and the Korean War. His plane was hit by enemy fire 12 different times. Some thought his eyes would change shape Posted!

Andrew Harnik/AP hide caption toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks with members of the media after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, on Wednesday. Andrew Harnik/AP With Donald Trump's choices for secretaries of transportation and of Housing and Urban Development \u2014 Elaine Chao and Dr. Ben Carson, respectively \u2014 there may be hints about the urban agenda Trump's administration may be shaping. Some big-city mayors say they're worried about potential cuts in federal funding that candidate Trump warned about on the stump, and they are reaching out to the president-elect. They say they have plenty of ideas they want to share about the country's cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama, met Wednesday with Trump, at his invitation. It gave Emanuel a chance to hand-deliver a letter from mayors of some of the country's largest cities. Mayor Rahm Emanuel: 'Chicago Always Will Be A Sanctuary City' The letter asks Trump to continue the Obama administration policy that prevents the deportation of so-called DREAMers \u2014 young immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16 years old and so named for meeting the requirements under the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act proposal that would have created a pathway to citizenship for them. \"We are clear as mayors that these are DREAMers who are seeking the American dream, and we should embrace them rather than do a bait-and-switch,\" Emanuel says. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Vows To End 'Sanctuary Cities,' But No One Can Agree What That Label Means During his campaign, Trump said he would reverse protections, but recently said he would work to find a solution for DREAMers. He made another related promise, though, in a campaign speech on immigration last August that has many mayors concerned. \"Block funding for sanctuary cities,\" Trump told a cheering crowd in Phoenix. \"We block the funding, no more funding.\" L.A.

Lockheed Martin and Boeing are the two major companies involved in discussions to build fighter aircraft production plants in India as part of that country\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, which is essentially a mirror-image of President-elect Trump\u2019s aggressive desire to keep manufacturing jobs within the United States. Trump has made retaining blue-collar jobs a post-election priority, and he\u2019s already had a high-profile success in preventing the loss of several hundred jobs at Indiana\u2019s Carrier plant. \u201cThe U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequences, is WRONG!\u201d Trump said in a series of Sunday tweets. BUDGET CUTS LEAVE MARINE CORPS AIRCRAFT GROUNDED Trump earlier this week also showed a willingness to go after jet maker Boeing, in particular, when he publicly sparred with the company over the cost of a new Air Force One fleet. The \u201cMake in India\u201d program, which is the brainchild of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to eventually increase the country\u2019s manufacturing base to a quarter of the gross domestic product. So when the Indian government required new jets to replace its aging fleet, any corporation that wanted to be involved knew the planes \u2013 an F-16 by Lockheed or F/A-18 by Boeing \u2013 would have to be built in India. \u201cBut this is not oursourcing socks here, this is outsourcing military fighter jets,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice. expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 Sekulow\u2019s group has already started a \u201cPetition to Stop Giving Control of our Fighter Jets to Foreign Nations,\u201d and he plans to deliver the demand to Congress later this week. Sekulow told FoxNews.com his office has already received calls from Lockheed workers in Fort Worth who\u2019ve said they\u2019re being given notice, offered severance packages or told they can apply to work on the F-35 program \u2013 though, with no guarantee of being accepted. A Lockheed spokesperson, however, told FoxNews.com the Fort Worth plant was ramping down production anyway as the U.S. Air Force moved on from the antiquated F-16 and switched to the newer F-35 jet. \u201cSo if you look at the big picture here, thousands of jobs have already gone away as we close out the building of F-16s. That\u2019s a given at this point; there\u2019s nothing we can do to change this,\u201d said Randy Howard, the director of business development for Lockheed\u2019s integrated fighter group. \u201cSo what our offer does is seek to mediate that. To remedy that. To bring back those jobs as much as possible. It adds jobs in India, but it also brings back jobs in Fort Worth and across the U.S.\u201d Howard said opening up a plant in India would actually reinstate about 500 Lockheed staff positions that support F-16 production, \u201cpredominantly\u201d in the United States. He also guaranteed \u201call F-16 workers will have a job available to them on the F-35 production line.\u201d Boeing, too, told FoxNews.com that it\u2019s F/A-18 production line in St. Louis \u201ccontinues to have a solid future.\u201d \u201cOur proposal to meet the needs of the Indian Air Force\u2019s fighter requirements entails creating a separate new Super Hornet production facility in India where Boeing has had a presence for more than seven decades,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the opportunity to continue our work in St. Louis and add a new production line in India which would also create more opportunities for our entire Super Hornet supply chain.\u201d The \u201cMake in India\u201d program is supported by President Obama\u2019s outgoing administration, which is looking to strengthen ties with India. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Thursday visited India and an official statement said the two countries\u2019 continued cooperation \u201cwill strengthen India\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.\u201d A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment more specifically on the program. Sekulow, who said he was first alerted to the India news by former military officers who are a part of his group\u2019s national security team, said he was all for increasing trade and relations with India, but that military manufacturing was a step too far. \u201cPresident [Obama] is not very good with lines in the sand,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cBut here\u2019s one he should draw.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Two Chicago police officers have resigned in the face of firing over their off-duty beating of a restaurant patron on the Northwest Side more than a decade ago. Brian Murphy and Jason Orsa, both 12-year department veterans, stepped down effective Dec. 1, said police spokesman Frank Giancamilli. Their resignations came a little more than a week after the Illinois Supreme Court denied an appeal of their dismissals and before the Chicago Police Board could move to fire them as soon as its monthly meeting Thursday night. Even though the police board had originally dismissed the two officers in January 2011, both still remained on the force more than a decade after the incident because a Cook County judge had overturned their firings in 2012. They were reinstated on the force and given back pay. Murphy, Orsa and another officer, Daniel McNamara, had allegedly just been drinking at a nearby bar when they went to eat at the Taco Burrito King restaurant at Higgins and Harlem avenues during the early morning of March 24, 2006. The trio, along with a Marine friend who had just returned from Iraq, were sitting at a table when Obed \"OJ\" DeLeon walked inside the restaurant and complained about a car blocking the parking lot. Murphy jumped up from his seat, pointed his service pistol at DeLeon's head and shoved him against a wall, surveillance video shows. Orsa, McNamara and their friend also joined in. DeLeon was punched, knocked down twice, kicked, hit and held facedown on the floor of the crowded restaurant. His shirt was ripped off, revealing gang tattoos on his body. Five years later, the police board fired Murphy and Orsa after two eyewitnesses and video confirmed they had started the fight. Pantle reversed the board's decision, pointing to the delayed, four-year investigation by Chicago's police oversight agency, saying the officers were unable to track witnesses closer to the time of the attack. She also blasted DeLeon as a gang member. But in August, a three-judge panel of an Illinois appeals court upheld the dismissals, noting that Murphy could have been fired just for pulling out his service weapon \"unprovoked\" in the restaurant. The court held that Orsa had repeatedly and unjustifiably kicked DeLeon and that the two officers attempted to cover up what happened. The court also rejected their contention during the police board hearing that DeLeon started the conflict by yelling the gang slogans and boasting he was a cop killer. A front-page Tribune article about the appeals court reversal quoted two eyewitnesses who were also arrested as expressing surprise to learn from a reporter that both officers were still then on the force. The officers appealed to the state Supreme Court, but it was denied on Nov. 23, according to a spokesman for the court and Max Caproni, the police board's executive director. In its original ruling in 2011, the police board found insufficient evidence to prove McNamara took part in the beating but suspended him for 18 months for failing to tell supervisors of his and the other officers' involvement in the altercation. The board also gave one of two sergeants who responded to the restaurant, Louis Danielson, a six-month suspension for not going inside the restaurant or trying to find out who had a gun. But the city dropped Danielson's suspension after Murphy and Orsa won their jobs back, clearing his record and awarding him back pay. After the appellate court reversed the judge's decision, however, the city chose not to pursue Danielson's suspension, said Giancamilli, the police spokesman. A few days after the beating, DeLeon lodged a complaint against the police. But it wasn't until a year later that the officers were questioned by investigators for the Independent Police Review Authority , Chicago's much-maligned agency that investigates the most serious allegations of police misconduct. In those interviews, the officers alleged for the first time that DeLeon had threatened police and yelled gang slogans in the restaurant. Eighteen more months passed before IPRA tried to interview the sergeant who approved the criminal charges against DeLeon and two eyewitnesses, but he had retired by then, records show. Records also show the IPRA investigation limped along for years. One investigator asked supervisors for extensions on deadlines at least 23 times, according to the records. Finally, in 2010, four years after the incident, then-police Superintendent Jody Weis brought formal charges against the officers, seeking their dismissal, before the police board. ",

    "text": "By Jonnelle Marte December 8 at 5:16 PM Follow @jonnelle CKE Restaurants CEO Andrew Puzder, center, departs Trump Tower in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, as head of the Labor Department,\u00a0according to a Republican briefed on the decision.\u00a0 Puzder, who runs CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr., has been a harsh critic of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, arguing that it would increase costs for consumers and lead to fewer jobs. He also opposes the recently-delayed Labor Department rule that aimed to make millions more workers eligible for overtime pay. As the head of a fast-food company, Puzder is a supporter of the approach touted by Trump on the campaign trail that lowering taxes for corporations and the wealthy and loosening regulations for businesses can boost job creation. He is a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act , which he claims has hurt the restaurant industry because higher health premiums have left consumers with less money to spend. By bringing in Puzder, Trump is signaling that he may scale back some of regulations introduced by current Labor Secretary Tom Perez. If confirmed, he will have the potential to reverse some of the Obama administration\u2019s most notable efforts to bolster protections for workers, families and retirement savers. [ Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet ] His appointment could put\u00a0the future of the Labor Department\u2019s overtime rule into question. In a Forbes op-ed that ran after the Labor Department finalized the overtime rule in May, Puzder wrote that the rule would \u201cadd to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers,\u201d and that the rule would lead to fewer hours and reduced opportunities for workers. As Labor Secretary, Puzder could potentially decide not to defend the rule in court. He could also propose revisions to the rule, but any adjustments would likely require notice and\u00a0public comment. With the upcoming nomination of the fast-food executive, Trump would bring another top fundraiser into his cabinet. Puzder supported Trump\u2019s race to the White House financially and served as an economic adviser to his campaign. He and his wife, Deanna, contributed a total of $332,000 to helping Trump get elected, including money given to Trump\u2019s campaign, to joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. His anti-regulation stance is also viewed as a threat to another major rule finalized by the Labor Department earlier this year that would affect the investing advice given to retirement savers. The rule would require brokers and insurers to put their clients\u2019 interest ahead of their own. Financial firms opposed to the rule say it is \u201cburdensome\u201d and could limit their ability to work with small-time investors. While Puzder has not addressed the regulation specifically, his nomination increases the likelihood that implementation of that rule could be delayed,\u00a0according to an analyst report from the investment bank FBR & Co. The move could give lawmakers and the Trump administration more time to repeal or revise the rule. Puzder has said that government policies that increase labor costs, such as significantly raising the minimum wage , hurt small businesses and \u201c encourage automation .\u201d In March, he told Business Insider that he and other fast-food companies are investing in automation and considering machines that could tackle simple tasks such as taking customers\u2019 orders. \u201cIf you\u2019re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive \u2014 this is not rocket science,\u201d he said at the time, though he later added that he would never remove all front-line employees. Some business groups applauded Puzder\u2019s likely nomination Thursday saying that the fast-food executive understands the challenges faced by retailers and restaurants. \u201cAndrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,\u201d said David French, senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which also opposes the overtime rule. But some Democrats and consumer advocates are critical of Trump\u2019s expected pick, saying his approach may harm low-wage workers. \u201cThe Labor Secretary should be someone who wakes up every day thinking about how they can raise American wages and fight for American workers,\u201d Sen. Charles Schumer said in a statement. \u201cMr. Puzder\u2019s career has shown exactly the opposite.\u201d Puzder became the CEO of\u00a0CKE Restaurants in 2000. The company, which has more than 3,700 restaurant locations in 44 states and 39 countries, is in the process of relocating its headquarters from southern California to Nashville.\u00a0Prior to joining the fast-food business, he worked as a commercial trial lawyer in St. Louis, Mo.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story To the America of the 1960s, Mr. Glenn was a clean-cut, good-natured, well-grounded Midwesterner, raised in Presbyterian rectitude, nurtured in patriotism and tested in war, who stepped forward to risk the unknown and succeeded spectacularly, lifting his country\u2019s morale and restoring its self-confidence. It was an anxious nation that watched and listened that February morning, as Mr. Glenn, 40 years old, a Marine Corps test pilot and one of the seven original American astronauts, climbed into Friendship 7, the tiny Mercury capsule atop an Atlas rocket rising from the concrete flats of Cape Canaveral in Florida. The Cold War had long stoked fears of nuclear destruction, and the Russians seemed to be winning the contest with their unsettling ascent into outer space. Two Russians, Yuri A. Gagarin and Gherman S. Titov, had already orbited Earth the year before, overshadowing the feats of two Americans, Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom, who had been launched only to the fringes of space. What, people asked with rising urgency, had happened to the United States\u2019 vaunted technology and can-do spirit? Photo John Glenn with the Friendship 7 in 1962. He was hailed as a national hero and a symbol of the space age as the first American to orbit Earth. Credit NASA The answer came at 9:47 a.m. Eastern time, when after weeks of delays the rocket achieved liftoff. It was a short flight, just three orbits. But when Mr. Glenn was safely back, flashing the world a triumphant grin, doubts were replaced by a broad, new faith that the United States could indeed hold its own against the Soviet Union in the Cold War and might someday prevail. No flier since Lindbergh had received such a cheering welcome. Bands played. People cried with relief and joy. Mr. Glenn was invited to the White House by President John F. Kennedy and paraded up Broadway and across the land. A joint meeting of Congress stood and applauded vigorously as Mr. Glenn spoke at the Capitol . Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his political history of the space age, \u201c\u2026The Heavens and the Earth,\u201d the author Walter A. McDougall described Mr. Glenn\u2019s space mission as a \u201cnational catharsis unparalleled.\u201d \u201cIt seemed that he had given Americans back their self-respect,\u201d Mr. McDougall added, \u201cand more than that \u2014 it seemed Americans dared again to hope.\u201d Mr. Glenn was reluctant to talk about himself as a hero. \u201cI figure I\u2019m the same person who grew up in New Concord, Ohio, and went off through the years to participate in a lot of events of importance,\u201d he said in an interview years later. \u201cWhat got a lot of attention, I think, was the tenuous times we thought we were living in back in the Cold War. I don\u2019t think it was about me. All this would have happened to anyone who happened to be selected for that flight.\u201d Mr. Glenn did not return to space for a long time. Kennedy thought him too valuable as a hero to risk losing in an accident. So Mr. Glenn resigned from the astronaut corps in 1964, became an executive in private industry and entered politics, serving four full terms as a Democratic senator from Ohio and in 1984 running unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination. Finally, 36 years after his Mercury flight, in the last months of his final Senate term, he got his wish for a return to orbit. Despite some criticism that his presence on the mission was a political payoff, a waste of money and of doubtful scientific merit, the hero of yesteryear brought out the crowds again, cheering out of nostalgia and enduring respect as he was launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on Oct. 29, 1998. At 77, he became the oldest person to go into space. Photo After weeks of delays, Mr. Glenn climbed into Friendship 7 on Feb. 20, 1962, and at 9:47 a.m. Eastern time, the rocket achieved liftoff. Credit NASA In retirement from the Senate, Mr. Glenn lived with his wife of 73 years, Anna (he always called her Annie), in a suburb of Washington in addition to Columbus. Ohio State University is the repository of papers from his space and political careers. \u201cJohn always had the right stuff,\u201d President Obama said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cinspiring generations of scientists, engineers and astronauts who will take us to Mars and beyond \u2014 not just to visit, but to stay.\u201d The Making of a Hero John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the only son of a railroad conductor who also owned a plumbing business, and the former Clara Sproat. A few years later, the Glenns moved to New Concord, a small town in southeastern Ohio with a population of little more than 1,000. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt was small but had a lot of patriotic feeling and parades on all the national holidays,\u201d Mr. Glenn once said. \u201cWanting to do something for the country was just natural, growing up in a place like New Concord.\u201d Like most everyone else there, the Glenns lived through the hard times of the Depression, instilling in their son a rigid moral code based on their own God-fearing example and saw him through an apple-pie boyhood. He played trumpet, sang in the church choir, washed cars for pocket money and worked as a lifeguard. In high school (now named for him), he was an honor student and lettered in football, basketball and tennis. He still had time to court his high school sweetheart, Anna Margaret Castor, the doctor\u2019s daughter. It did not matter that she stammered; she was his girl, and he loved her. They married in April 1943, and he often called her \u201cthe real rock of the family.\u201d From the time they came to public attention, and throughout the turbulence of spaceflight and politics, John and Anna Glenn each seemed the other\u2019s center of gravity. Not until much later did she undergo intensive therapy that virtually cured her stammer, enabling her even to give speeches in public. Photo Mr. Glenn with President John F. Kennedy and General Leighton I. Davis during a parade in Cocoa Beach, Fla., after his spaceflight. No flier since Charles Lindbergh had received such a cheering welcome. Credit NASA Mr. Glenn is survived by his wife; two children, Carolyn Ann Glenn of St. Paul and John David Glenn of Berkeley, Calif.; and two grandsons, Daniel and Zach Glenn. Mr. Glenn began his journey to fame in World War II. In 1939, he enrolled at Muskingum College in his hometown to study chemistry, but he took flying lessons on the side. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he signed up for the Naval Aviation cadet program and after pilot training opted to join the Marines. As a fighter pilot, he flew 59 combat missions in the Pacific, earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and other decorations. Mr. Glenn saw more action in the Korean War, flying 90 combat missions and winning more medals. He put his life on the line again as a military test pilot in the early days of supersonic flight. In 1957, just months before the Soviet Union launched its first Sputnik satellite, he made the first transcontinental supersonic flight, piloting an F8U-1 Crusader from Los Angeles to New York in record time: 3 hours 23 minutes 8.4 seconds. Then, in 1959, newly promoted to lieutenant colonel, he heeded a call for test pilots to apply to be astronauts for the fledgling National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He and six other pilots were selected in April of that year. (The original Mercury 7 included Mr. Glenn, Mr. Shepard, Mr. Grissom, Walter Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton and Scott Carpenter. Mr. Glenn was the last surviving one.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story All seven men were eager, competitive and ambitious, but none more so than Mr. Glenn. Tom Miller, a retired Marine general and close friend since they were rookie pilots in World War II, recalled that Mr. Glenn was so determined to be an astronaut that he applied weight to his head to compress his height down to the 5-foot-11-inch maximum for the first astronauts. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to miss a trick,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019d be sitting down reading with a big bunch of books sitting on his head.\u201d But his determination did not win him the assignment to be the first American astronaut to fly. He had to wait out the suborbital flights by Mr. Shepard and Mr. Grissom in 1961 before his turn came. Patience, Then Liftoff In his 1999 memoir, written with Nick Taylor, he admitted he was sorely disappointed when Mr. Shepard was tapped for the first flight. As the oldest and most articulate of the astronauts, Mr. Glenn had attracted a big share of the publicity. He said that he had \u201cworked and studied hard dedicating myself to the program\u201d and that he thought he had a \u201cgood shot\u201d at being first. In a letter to a NASA official, Mr. Glenn wrote, \u201cI thought I might have been penalized for speaking out for what I thought was the good of the program.\u201d At this time, as Mr. Glenn often recalled, he never anticipated that his orbital flight would be the one that most excited the public, satisfying the nation\u2019s hunger for a hero. Tom Wolfe wrote of that time in the best-selling 1979 book \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d a phrase for coolness in the face of danger that has passed into the idiom. He described Mr. Glenn as excessively pious, scolding his fellow astronauts about their after-hours escapades while openly lobbying to be the first of them to fly. \u201cHe looked like a balding and slightly tougher version of the cutest-looking freckle-faced country boy you ever saw,\u201d Mr. Wolfe wrote. \u201cHe had a snub nose, light-hazel eyes, reddish-blond hair and a terrific smile.\u201d ",

    "text": "CBS News Dec 8, 2016 7:18 PM EST The remarkable thing is that in November, we had widespread record warm across nearly all North America. At the same time, major cold and snow descended on Siberia and Russia, reports CBS Boston chief meteorologist Eric Fisher. Now all that air that was cooking in the dark and the cold is moving across the Pole and heading right into the spots that were warmest last month. It\u2019s a complete 180 degree change in the pattern. How cold are we talking? Low temperatures, certainly subzero in the Plains, the 20s all the way down to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia Thursday night. By Saturday morning, we could be seeing 20s all the way down to North Florida and freeze warnings will likely be needed there.\u00a0 At the same time, another winter storm is moving to the Northwest, and this one isn\u2019t just bringing mountain snow, but lowland snow. We\u2019re getting snowfall into the cities of Seattle and Portland Thursday evening. As we look toward next week, there\u2019s another blast of cold and it might be even colder than what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u00a0 Freezing Arctic air heading for much of U.S. The dangerously cold weather that\u2019s been blowing across the country this week turned deadly on Thursday, CBS News\u2019 Omar Villafranca reports. Blinding snowstorms caused major pileups in the Midwest. A snow squall and slick roads are being blamed for the deadly pileup of mangled cars, trucks and eighteen-wheelers. Three people were killed and 11 people injured after dozens of vehicles careened off of Michigan\u2019s I-96 just north of Lansing . A pile-up caused by inclement weather on Dec. 7, 2016. Close CBS News Three hundred miles east in Lake County, Ohio, another pileup, with \u00a0as many as 50 vehicles occurred after a truck jack-knifed due to icy road conditions.\u00a0 Farther east in upstate New York, the moving system dropped nearly 17 inches of thick, sticky, lake-effect snow an hour north of Syracuse, New York. Roads quickly became treacherous, testing the skills of any driver who dared to get behind the wheel. Wintry weather moved across the country on Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016. Close CBS News North Dakota residents are still cleaning up after the one-two punch of snow and howling wind tore through the state. Icy roads were too slippery for even the toughest four-wheelers. Dan Boschee\u2019s truck slid into a ditch, but luckily his dad Reed showed up to pull him back on track. Tim Kunz of Ace 24-hour towing starting working earlier this week pulling dozens of cars and even Big Rig trucks off of the roads around Bismarck. \u201cThe ones that are empty, winds pushes the trailer off, and they get jack-knifed and stuck,\u201d Kunz said.\u00a0 Since Monday, tow trucks have pulled roughly 400 stranded or damaged vehicles into this yard alone. They expect to stay busy because there is more snow and sub-zero temperatures in the forecast. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",
