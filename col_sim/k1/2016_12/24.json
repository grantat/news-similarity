    "text": "Air Force facing dire personnel shortage By Lucas Tomlinson Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Earlier this year, top Air Force officials sounded the alarm about their thinning ranks -- saying they were 700 pilots and 4,000 mechanics short. Now they warn the problem is far worse. Under the latest estimates, the Air Force says it needs 30,000 airmen in the next five or six years. Today, the Air Force has 317,000 airmen.\u00a0 \"[T]he shortage of people has fundamentally changed the way we do business in terms of the operational risk day to day,\" Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein said in a statement. The former head of Air Force intelligence says it's not just the airmen needing a boost. \u201cWe've got a geriatric Air Force,\" said retired Lt. Gen. David Deptula. \u201cWe've got bombers and tankers that are over 50 years old. We have [training aircraft] that are over 40 years old, and we have [fighter jets] and helicopters that are over 30 years old. So this is a terrible place to be in when you have a world of ever-expanding threats.\u201d Air Force officials say they need\u00a0forces to bolster nuclear, intelligence, space and maintenance jobs. Earlier this year, Goldfein called the pilot shortage alone a crisis. \u201cAir superiority is not an American birthright. It's actually something you have to fight for and maintain,\u201d he told Pentagon reporters in August. On a visit to Shaw Air Force base, home of the 20th Fighter Wing, the former wing commander said the force has been at war for decades. \u201cYour Air Force has been at war since Desert Shield/Desert Storm. This wing has been at war since that time for 25 years. We went to the Middle East when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and we never left,\" said Col. Stephen Jost. At the start of the Gulf War, the Air Force had 134 fighter squadrons. Over the past few decades, that number has been cut to 55. Yet, the Air Force is conducting nearly 70 percent of the strike missions against ISIS and conducting 90 percent of midair refueling missions over Iraq and Syria since August 2014. The Air Force is not the only service that wants to grow. The United States Navy says it wants to increase its fleet by 30 percent as threats around the world intensify. Today, the Navy has 273 ships and submarines, and a new Navy study released by the secretary of the Navy last week says it needs 355 in the future. The focus is on attack submarines, necessary to keep tabs on the growing threat from China and what officials call the continued \u201cmilitarization\u201d of the South China Sea. The Army and Marine Corps have also expressed a desire to grow their personnel, and get badly needed spare parts for their equipment and aircraft. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

Mitch McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump have big plans for the new year with their party controlling both the White House and Congress. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images House Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump have big plans for the new year with their party controlling both the White House and Congress. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Just before House Republicans re-elected Paul Ryan as their speaker, the Wisconsin Republican made a bold proclamation. \"Welcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,\" Ryan told reporters one week after Election Day. \"This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people.\" Ryan continued: \"If we are going to put our country back on the right track, we have got to be bold, and we have to go big.\" FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's First 100 Days Action Plan That \"be bold, go big\" agenda is still in its early planning stages, but Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming President Donald Trump have outlined plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the federal tax code, slash federal regulations, invest in infrastructure projects and seal the U.S.-Mexico border. All told, it's a legislative program that would affect every single person and business in America. A lot can get done in the first two years Recent history is on the GOP's side. When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping \u2014 albeit politically polarizing \u2014 legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration \u2014 when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president \u2014 has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints. Article continues after sponsorship CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration President Obama's health care law and Wall Street overhaul both passed in 2010 under Democratic control and along party lines. President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind education law and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act into law and enacted a round of tax cuts, as well as legislation that created the Department of Homeland Security after the Sept. 11 attacks in his first two years in the Oval Office. (Senate control flipped back and forth in 2001 and 2002 due to the defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont from the GOP, but Republicans controlled Congress for the majority of Bush's first term in office.) President Bill Clinton signed the Family Medical Leave Act, gun-control legislation, including an assault weapons ban, and legislation to prevent and prosecute violence toward women before Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 wave election. \"Put up and show up\" McConnell has already outlined Republicans' plans to take aim at Obamacare and initiate an overhaul of the tax code in 2017. They also want to use the same budget rules that were used in the past to enact Bush's tax cuts and Obama's health care bill, because certain budget bills can't be filibustered in the Senate. \"The two biggest impediments to growth in our country are over-regulation and the tax structure,\" McConnell said. \"And the president-elect seems to be committed to addressing both of those, and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are as well.\" Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told conservative talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt that the first nine months of 2017 will be \"consumed\" by health care and tax legislative pushes. \"Now, it's time for being in the majority,\" Priebus said, \"and I can tell you President-elect Trump is going to lead the way to put up and show up.\" Democrats are skeptical Republicans will go through with it. Despite years of unanimous opposition to the law, the GOP has never found consensus on how to replace it. \"They don't know what to do,\" incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters before Congress adjourned for the year. \"They have nothing to put in its place and, believe me, just repealing Obamacare, even though they have nothing to put in its place and saying they'll do it sometime down the road, will cause huge calamity from one end of America to the other.\" Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid warned Republicans against dismantling the health care law. \"It will lead you into a quagmire that will cause pain for millions of Americans and bedevil you for the next four years,\" he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece. Is a Medicare overhaul coming? President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences Democrats like Reid and Schumer believe Republicans have misinterpreted the results of the 2016 election, with Trump claiming a mandate despite losing the popular vote and entering office with historically high negative ratings. Many Democrats say GOP efforts to dismantle Obamacare will hurt the party in the same way Bush's 2005 push to overhaul Social Security damaged the party and played a role in the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. \"We had a plan. We stuck with it. It was unified, strategic and unwavering,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., of the 2005 entitlement fight. Pelosi said Democrats won that legislative fight despite Bush enjoying high approval ratings at the time. That fight provides the blueprint Democrats are expected to follow next year to defend Obamacare and, potentially, GOP efforts to reshape Medicare. Ryan has long been a proponent of overhauling Medicare for future retirees from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support system in which seniors are given subsidies to purchase health insurance from the private market. Ryan will have a powerful ally next year: Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, shares Ryan's view on Medicare. But old rules and battle lines are unreliable future predictors for a Trump administration. At the risk of understatement, the incoming president has succeeded by defying political norms with a brand that appeals to the older, white voters that Democrats used to be able to rely on to scare Republicans away from touching entitlement programs. The \"Trump Wing\" has the upper hand among Republicans The Republican Party also remains philosophically divided between the traditional, interventionist, fiscal hawk \"Ryan Wing\" and the populist, isolationist \"Trump Wing\" of the party. Early signals point to the Trump Wing having the upper hand at the start. When Trump intervened with Indiana-based Carrier Corp. to pressure the company to remain in the U.S., Ryan, a staunch free-market conservative, applauded. \"Well, I'm pretty happy that we're keeping jobs in America, aren't you?\" Ryan said. Notably, one of the few voices of opposition to Trump was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin \u2014 an icon of the Tea Party movement \u2014 who called out the Carrier intervention as crony capitalism. It barely made a ripple. Another sign the Trump Wing of the party is ascendant: Ryan \u2014 long described as a rising star in the party \u2014 was booed at a Trump political rally in his home state of Wisconsin. Trump came to his defense. \"[Ryan] has been terrific and, you know, honestly, he is like a fine wine. Every day goes by I get to appreciate his genius more and more,\" Trump said, before adding a vaguely threatening disclaimer: \"Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that.\" It should be noted: Trump doesn't drink. \"I'm tired of divided government\" Ryan understands that 2017 is the best chance he will have in his political career so far to advance the causes he cares about. He recently discussed his discontent with divided government, which Washington has been operating under for the the past six years, a period that largely has been defined by polarization and obstruction, shutdown battles and ideological intransigence. \"I'm tired of divided government. It doesn't work very well,\" Ryan lamented a week prior to Election Day. \"We've gotten some good things done. But the big things \u2014 poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care \u2014 these things are stuck in divided government, and that's why we think a unified Republican government's the way to go.\" Up close, Congress has not been as unproductive as the public believes. Major legislation affecting health care, highways, public education and taxes has worked its way through the legislative process and made it to Obama's desk these past six years. One of the president's last acts was signing a sweeping $6.3 billion biomedical research bill that, among other ambitious goals, advances the cause of finding a cure for cancer. But the big, ideological battles over the size and scope of government have gone unsettled. Next year, Republicans will have their best chance in more than a decade to win the next chapter in that never-ending struggle and, maybe, redefine what it means to be a Republican in the Trump era.

By Carol Morello and Ruth Eglash December 23 at 2:27 PM Follow @CMorelloWP Follow @reglash The U.N. Security Council on Friday passed a resolution demanding that Israel cease Jewish settlement activity on Palestinian territory in a unanimous vote that passed when the United States abstained rather than using its veto as it has reliably done in the past. The resolution declares settlements constructed on land Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, including in East Jerusalem, to have \u201cno legal validity.\u201d It said settlements threaten the viability of the two-state solution, and it urged Israelis and Palestinians to return to negotiations that will lead to two independent nations. The United States\u2019 abstention Friday was a rare rebuke to Israel, and it reflected mounting frustration in the Obama administration over settlement growth that the United States considers an obstacle to peace. With President Obama\u2019s time in office due to end in barely a month, his decision not to veto was a last-minute symbolic statement of that displeasure and a sense of exasperation that the time has come for two states to be carved out of the contested land. The administration\u2019s move also defied Donald Trump\u2019s call on Thursday for the United States to veto the resolution. The incoming Trump administration has signaled that there will be a shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, a point the president-elect hammered home about an hour after Friday\u2019s vote when he tweeted, \u201cAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\u201d Trump has supported moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has appointed David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who believes Israelis should annex and settle the West Bank, as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel. (Reuters) [Trump picks a supporter of West Bank settlements for ambassador to Israel] It is unclear what, if any, impact this resolution will have. Resolutions reflect the opinion and will of the 15 members of the Security Council, but legal scholars differ about how binding they are. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not abide by the terms of the settlements resolution. About 400,000 Jews live in roughly 150 settlements in the West Bank on land that the Palestinians want for a future state east of the line formed after the 1967 war. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to become the capital of their future state. Many Israelis consider the settlements to be in the ancestral homeland of the Jews and refer to them by their biblical names, Judea and Samaria. Most nations consider the settlements illegal. U.S. diplomats characterize them as illegitimate and say they exacerbate tensions between Israelis and the Palestinians who live nearby, thereby undercutting efforts to advance peace. Twice, the Obama administration has made concerted attempts to broker peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. The most recent, involving nine months of intense diplomacy by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, collapsed in 2014, and nothing has been able to revive the talks. Throughout the year, the administration has been increasingly vocal in its exasperation. The State Department has issued several sharp criticisms of settlement construction, in July calling it \u201cprovocative and counterproductive.\u201d Since then, more than 2,600 housing units have been built in settlements. [Even Israel says this Jewish settlement is illegal. Now comes the showdown. ] Still, the United States agreed this year to provide Israel with $38\u00a0billion in military aid over 10 years, the largest such package ever. U.S. and Israeli officials both have said security and military cooperation between the two countries has remained excellent, even when Obama and Netanyahu have clashed. The international community has shown increasing impatience with the intractability of the \u00adIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. Proposals have been put forth in the last year by Egypt, France, and a group made up of the European Union, the United Nations, Russia and the United States. Israel has blamed the impasse on Palestinian refusal to recognize the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians blame Israel for occupying lands they consider rightfully theirs. The 14-to-0 vote, with only the United States abstaining, followed an intense campaign from Israel to derail it. It was to have been voted on Thursday, but Egypt withdrew its sponsorship after the country\u2019s president spoke by phone with Trump, who got involved at Israel\u2019s request. Friday\u2019s resolution was sponsored by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal. The resolution\u2019s passage brought a swift reaction, particularly in Israel and in Congress. Netanyahu said Friday that he welcomed Trump replacing Obama, whose administration, he said, had \u201ccolluded\u201d in a diplomatic assault on Israel. \u201cIsrael rejects this shameful \u00adanti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office. \u201cThe Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes.\u201d \u201cThis is absolutely shameful,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement, promising that next year \u201cour unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel.\u201d But Palestinian diplomats called the resolution a chance to salvage the possibility of two states and exulted in seeing the U.N. pass a resolution reflecting their views. \u201cAfter years of allowing the law to be trampled and the situation to spiral downward, today\u2019s resolution may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the two-state solution and revive the path for peace,\u201d Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said Friday. Kerry said he would speak more in the coming days about the U.N. vote and \u201cthe way ahead\u201d for Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cThat future is now in jeopardy, with terrorism, violence and incitement continuing and unprecedented steps to expand settlements being advanced by avowed opponents of the two-state solution,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThat is why we cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\u201d Friday\u2019s resolution also condemned Palestinian incitement to violence and all acts of terrorism. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States would not have allowed its passage without that proviso. She also criticized the United Nations itself, saying it had perpetuated a double standard by repeatedly condemning Israeli actions while remaining silent about Palestinian incitement. In the hours before the vote, Israeli media reported harsh criticism toward Obama and Kerry coming from an unnamed official in Netanyahu\u2019s office. The office accused them of having \u201cabandoned\u201d Israel by refusing the block the resolution with a veto. White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday that the administration's pursuit of a two-state solution is \u201cguided by our belief that it is the only way to preserve Israel\u2019s security in the long run.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama has done more for Israel and its security than any previous U.S. president,\u201d Rhodes told reporters. That argument did not assuage Israeli anger at the U.S. decision not to veto the resolution, a decision the Obama administration still had not shared with the Israeli government a few hours before the vote. According to an Israeli official who spoke on the condition on anonymity because the conversations were private, a White House official told an Israeli official Thursday that the United States is Israel\u2019s best friend. The Israeli replied, \u201cFriends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council.\u201d Eglash reported from Jerusalem.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump frequently pledged during the campaign that he would slash the size of the federal government and rein in spending, once proclaiming \u201cwe will cut so much, your head will spin.\u201d But the bombastic business titan is about to come face-to-face with Washington, that \u201cswamp\u201d he wants to drain. And both nonpartisan specialists and others who have tried before suggest the odds are not in his favor. Most every president in modern times has mounted an effort to streamline the federal bureaucracy and all have largely failed. President Obama in 2012 proposed merging parts of six agencies and cutting more than 1,000 federal jobs. Congress wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIt worse than died, it was assassinated on the Hill,\u201d said Donald Kettl, University of Maryland professor and author of Escaping Jurassic Government: Restoring America\u2019s Lost Commitment to Competence. Likewise, President George W. Bush put forth a \u201cManagement Agenda\u201d to overhaul the bureaucracy and Bill Clinton pushed a\u00a0\u201cReinventing Government\u201d plan. \u201cIn each case, executive branch efforts to reform management were viewed with skepticism (by Congress),\u201d John Kamensky, deputy director of Clinton\u2019s initiative, and Jonathan Breul, a budget management adviser during both administrations, wrote in a paper about lessons learned. \u201cAs a consequence, few pieces of significant legislation were enacted.\u201d The Grace Commission President Ronald Reagan convened a commission of private-sector executives and experts who came up with more than 2,000 recommendations to reduce waste, improve management and restructure the government in 1984. The so-called Grace Commission said the changes would save taxpayers $424 billion over three years. \u201cAbsolutely nothing came of it. Absolutely nothing,\u201d said Paul Light, New York University professor and author of 25 books, including Thickening Government: Federal Hierarchy and the Diffusion of Accountability. Light said that while every president has promised to make government work better, the last successful major overhaul of the federal government was in the 1950s. He said there are a mix of forces fighting to keep the status quo, not the least of which is Congress, whom he blamed for many inefficiencies in the federal government that waste taxpayer dollars. \u201cAll duplication and overlap flows downhill from Congress,\u201d Light said. \u201cCommittees create these different programs and they don\u2019t want to do anything about it.\u201d Kenneth Baer, who was associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget when Obama made his push, said there\u2019s no incentive for members of Congress to cut anything. \u201cFor all their talk about getting rid of this or that, the truth is that they don\u2019t want to get rid of any of it,\u201d he said. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has been issuing annual reports since 2011 on wasteful spending and has identified hundreds of fixes that could save taxpayers billions of dollars. The GAO said its report this year that the IRS could be collecting $385 billion more in taxes annually, and millions could be saved by reducing overlapping programs. Food safety, for instance is overseen by 12 different agencies. Eight agencies administer more than 100 programs supporting individuals suffering from mental illness. Orice Williams Brown , a GAO managing director who helped coordinate this year\u2019s report, said that because eliminating programs is so difficult, Congress often just layers new ones on top. For example, she said, the law passed after the financial crisis added to an existing patchwork of financial regulatory programs. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t an appetite to step back and say, \u2018Let\u2019s put aside what we currently have, and let\u2019s think about what we would do if we were starting over today,\u2019\u201d Williams Brown said. \u201cAnd that becomes really the heavy lift that is difficult to do. It\u2019s difficult politically.\u201d Of 544 fixes recommended by GAO in the past five years, only 244 have been completed. Some are optimistic about Trump\u2019s chances of getting more done than his predecessors to improve the bureaucracy, particularly given his Cabinet picks so far, which include chief executives from the private sector and members of Congress. His pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., is a deficit hawk. \u201cIn my view, they are better positioned than the members of prior administrations, high-ranking members of prior administrations, to come in and start getting to work right away,\u201d said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a\u00a0group founded by the leaders of Reagan\u2019s commission. \u201cI think people look at Donald Trump and said he\u2019s going to be a strong leader, he\u2019s going to get things done, and you have the secretaries of the various agencies pushing for some of those same things,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cI think it\u00a0puts pressure on Congress to do some of those things, to reduce on this duplication and overlap, the mismanagement.\u201d Read more: ",

The resolution was put forward at the 15-member council for a vote by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal a day after Egypt withdrew it under pressure from Israel and President-elect Donald Trump. The President-elect and the Israelis had called on the US to veto the measure. It was adopted with 14 votes in favor, to a round of applause. It is the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years. The lack of U.S. involvement in the vote represents a sharp break with tradition of protecting Israel from UN action. It was seen as a last-ditch attempt by the council to put the brakes on settlement building and get the Israelis and Palestinians talking again before Trump's inauguration. The President-elect has indicated he will not pressure Israel to participate in talks with the Palestinians. \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" Trump tweeted following the resolution's passage. As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ripped the resolution and said his country \"will not abide by its terms.\" \"At a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East,\" he said. Netanyahu, whose relationship with President Obama has long been strained, accused the White House of colluding with the UN \"behind the scenes.\" \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution,\" he said. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. \"acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution.\" \"That future is now in jeopardy, with terrorism, violence and incitement continuing and unprecedented steps to expand settlements being advanced by avowed opponents of the two state solution,\" he said. \"That is why we cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\" Kerry also reminded critics of the Obama Administration's \"unparalleled record of support for Israel's security, including the largest military assistance package in history.\" GOP lawmakers vehemently disagreed. Republican Sen. John McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the resolution \"ill-conceived.\" \"The abstention of the United States has made us complicit in this outrageous attack, and marks a troubling departure from our nation's long, bipartisan history of defending our ally Israel in the United Nations,\" he said in a statement. \"This resolution will serve as yet another roadblock to peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and embolden the enemies of Israel.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan called the move \"absolutely shameful.\" \"Today's vote is a blow to peace that sets a dangerous precedent for further diplomatic efforts to isolate and demonize Israel. Our unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel,\" he said. The bipartisan American Israel Public Affairs Committee said it too was \"deeply disturbed\" that the Obama Administration didn't veto the resolution. \"By adopting this resolution, the United Nations has once again served as an open forum to isolate and delegitimize Israel\u2014America's lone stable, democratic ally in the Middle East,\" the organization said. The Obama administration has been critical of Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. But U.S. officials said earlier this month that Obama wasn't expected to make any major overtures toward Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts before leaving office. Elizabeth Chuck ",

    "text": "Confusion Grows Over Trump\u2019s Nuclear Plan After Possible Hint of \u2018Arms Race\u2019 By Meghan Keneally Dec 23, 2016, 3:23 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Putin Responds to Trump's Nuclear Comments 0 Shares Email Donald Trump \u2019s newly announced press secretary tried to clarify his bosses\u2019 stance on nuclear proliferation after a surprising tweet and a reported conversation Trump had with a cable news host. Questions about President-elect Trump\u2019s stance on nuclear arms had been raised throughout the campaign and arose again Thursday when Trump tweeted that the U.S. \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump's meaning in the tweet was unclear, and his spokesman and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer addressed the issue in interviews. On MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Spicer defended Trump\u2019s speaking out on issues before becoming president, saying that he shouldn\u2019t necessarily follow the examples of some other recent presidents-elect who waited until inauguration to weigh in on foreign and domestic policy. Carlo Allegri/Reuters Sean Spicer arrives in the lobby of Republican president-elect Donald Trump's Trump Tower in New York, Nov. 14, 2016. But more confusion arose when MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski reportedly spoke to Trump by phone -- a conversation that was not broadcast -- after Spicer's interview on the show. Brzezinski and her co-host Joe Scarborough recounted her conversation with Trump on the air afterward. \u201cMika asked the president-elect while we had the opportunity what his position was on trying to clarify the tweet yesterday regarding the nuclear arsenal, and the president-elect told you what?\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough said. \u201cLet it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cAnd outlast them all,\u201d Scarborough said. Spicer gave more interviews this morning after that and when asked about the comment Trump allegedly made to Brzezinski, Spicer told CNN, \"That was a private conversation. I was not privy to that.\" \"But the bottom line is this, the president [elect] is going to put our nation's security and safety first. And he's not going to worry about how it's -- he's going to do it. That's what every American should understand, that he's not going to be a passive president. He's going to be active and make sure that our safety is number one,\u201d Spicer said. \"If another country expands theirs, the United States will act in kind,\u201d he said of nuclear arsenals. On NBC's \"The Today Show,\" Spicer said, \"There's not going to be [an arms race] ... because he is going to ensure other countries get the message that he is not going to sit back and allow that. And what's going to happen is they will come to their senses, and we will all be just fine.\" \"There [have] been several countries -- Russia among them -- that have talked about expanding their nuclear capability.\" ABC News' Alana Abramson contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

He introduces himself simply as Padre Jos\u00e9 to the children at a local Catholic school. He showers and shaves at the Community Healthplex gym like any other member, and calls his workout buddies his Band of Brothers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In short, he is just the kind of leader Pope Francis is elevating to realign the church in the United States with his priorities. As the pope has made clear over the past three years, fancy lifestyles, formality and regal titles like Prince of the Church are out of style for cardinals. So is an emphasis on the divisive issues of abortion and same-sex marriage , even though the church\u2019s underlying position on those issues has not changed. Instead, in the pope\u2019s view, the church should emphasize humility and service to the poor. It should be multicultural, welcoming different styles of worship. It should reach out to other faiths and stand up for immigrants, refugees and nuns. Photo Cardinal Tobin\u2019s post as archbishop of Indianapolis came with a driver, but he drives himself. Credit A J Mast for The New York Times And that, church experts and members of his flock say, is a close description of the priorities of Cardinal Tobin, who will be heading east just after Christmas to lead the approximately 1.5 million Catholics in the Archdiocese of Newark. He is replacing Archbishop John J. Myers, 75, who preferred to be addressed by the formal title Your Grace, and who achieved notoriety when the church spent some $500,000 to outfit the house he will retire to with an indoor exercise pool and an elevator. Cardinal Tobin\u2019s appointment in October as one of the nation\u2019s 18 cardinals came as a surprise to many, including the man himself. But perhaps it should not have. For what his unassuming bearing does not reveal is that he is no stranger to the corridors of power in the church. He is a friend of Pope Francis. And under Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, he had helped lead the Vatican office that oversees the roughly one million men and women in religious orders around the world. That position did not end so well. It was an open secret that Cardinal Tobin was sent to Indiana as a kind of exile most likely because he questioned an inquiry by his office into supposed doctrinal lapses among the roughly 50,000 nuns in the United States. As he got to know the faithful in the chancery of Indianapolis, he would joke with them about it. \u201cI was kicked out and I\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d the chancellor of the archdiocese, Annette Lentz, recalled his saying about how he turned up on her doorstep. And she would tell him, \u201cTheir loss is our gain.\u201d How Cardinal Tobin, 64, an amiable 6-foot-3 Irish-American who likes Bob Seger, plays piano and speaks five languages, went from being the oldest of 13 children living in Detroit to the pinnacle of the global church is a story that bears telling. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He grew up in a working-class neighborhood where the big houses were perfect for the large families of Irish, Polish and other Eastern European backgrounds that filled them. The local parish, Holy Redeemer , was run by an order of priests called the Redemptorists, and was unusually large, with 14 Masses each Sunday for up to 20,000 worshipers, he recalled in a Dec. 5 interview. His mother was a public-school teacher who quit her job to raise her brood; nine of her cousins and three of her aunts were nuns. Growing up in a deeply Catholic environment, Cardinal Tobin had two role models: the parish priests and his father, a cost analyst at General Motors who attended 6 a.m. Mass daily. Joe Tobin was a rough-and-tumble child, who once crashed through the back-porch window when he was being chased. But he also learned the deeper lessons taught by the nuns at the parish school. \u201cJoe came home in second grade and said to me, \u2018Mom, I need a pair of socks,\u2019\u201d his mother, Marie Tobin, 93, recalled before Cardinal Tobin\u2019s emotional farewell Mass in Indianapolis on Dec. 3. \u201cAnd I looked at his feet and saw his socks were fine. \u2018Mother,\u2019 he said, \u2018there\u2019s a boy in my class who has rags around his feet and a safety pin.\u2019\u201d Photo A photograph of Cardinal Tobin\u2019s family from the 1970s. Credit a J Mast for The New York Times In 1977, when the cardinal was in seminary in Esopus, N.Y., his father died of a heart attack. By that time, the family had moved across the border to Canada, and his father had been commuting to Michigan. \u201cI idolized my dad,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said. \u201cHe was everything I think a man should be. He was strong, he played in the Orange Bowl as a freshman in Boston College. He lost his leg in World War II , so he never played football again. He had a quiet, unpretentious faith. He was chivalrous with women. \u201cAnd I remember when he died,\u201d he added, \u201cand I was waiting at the seminary for someone to drive me to La Guardia, and one of my teachers came and said, \u2018If you can be a man like your father, when they call you Father you will be all right.\u2019 And I suppose I am still trying to do that.\u201d He remains close with his siblings. And in the Redemptorists, an order that requires a vow of poverty and emphasizes missionary outreach, he found a second family. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He dreamed of being sent to far-flung locales once he was ordained in 1978. Instead, because he spoke Spanish, he was sent right back to Holy Redeemer, which had a growing Hispanic population. There, he learned about serving the poor. An older priest modeled what was to become a signature of Cardinal Tobin\u2019s ministry: an intense focus on each person. \u201cWhen he is there and you are talking to him, it\u2019s as if you have known him all your life,\u201d said Bernice Guynn, 89, a parishioner at St. Rita in Indianapolis. From Detroit, he was moved during the AIDS epidemic to Chicago, where he ministered at the bedsides of the dying. The church\u2019s stance against homosexuality was not a barrier to him. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be there for people,\u201d he said. By 1991, the higher-ups of his order had taken notice and he was moved to Rome. For 12 years, he led the Redemptorist order, finally traveling the world to missions in more than 70 nations. Photo Cardinal Tobin with the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary after his farewell Mass in Indianapolis on Dec. 3 Credit A J Mast for The New York Times In that capacity, he made an impression on Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then the Vatican official responsible for enforcing Catholic doctrine. In 2010, five years after Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope Benedict, he offered Father Tobin the title of archbishop and the position of secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the Vatican. Cardinal Tobin recalled that he was painting his mother\u2019s porch in Ontario when he got the call from the Vatican secretary of state. \u201cI turned white and started stuttering,\u201d he said. He did not want the job, he said, but how does one refuse the pope? The office he had been tapped to administer was investigating American nuns for supposedly adopting a \u201csecular mentality\u201d and straying from Catholic orthodoxy. In other words, the nuns were accused of being too liberal, and Cardinal Tobin was to oversee the inquiry. But he had an \u201cextremely positive\u201d view of the nuns, he told T he National Catholic Reporter at the time, and he wanted to explain their good works.

But the problem, he came to believe, was structural: the investigation of 55,000 religious women by a tiny staff for the alleged errors of a few. \u201cIt made as much sense as an ophthalmologist trying to do cataract surgery standing in center field in Yankee Stadium and pointing his laser gun up at the bleachers,\u201d he said. Two years into his five-year term, his priest secretary surprised him with the news. \u201cWe are so sorry you are going,\u201d Cardinal Tobin recalled him saying. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Really, where am I going?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Indianapolis.\u2019\u201d The official news did not come for four months. \u201cIt was like death by 1,000 cuts,\u201d he said. When he arrived in Indiana in December 2012, most American Catholics had never heard of him. But to the nuns he was something of a hero. \u201cWe thought that he was a tremendous individual,\u201d said Mother Anne Brackmann, the prioress of the Carmelite Monastery in Terre Haute, Ind. \u201cAnd he was welcomed very, very warmly.\u201d Someone else took note of his dismissal: Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, who would become Pope Francis.

Credit A J Mast for The New York Times The two men met in 2005 during a synod of bishops in Rome, and they bonded over a shared view of the church. There were conservative bishops in their group who wanted, for example, to ban girls from being altar servers. \u201cI have eight sisters, and at the time, I had nieces who were serving at the altar, and I didn\u2019t see the justification for it,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said. \u201cBergoglio was on the same page. There are more important things to talk about.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story They had also laughed together: Cardinal Tobin recalled telling Cardinal Bergoglio that he had been his mother\u2019s choice for pope that year, because she had read how he picked up after himself and cooked his own food. Still, Cardinal Tobin was surprised to get a note from Cardinal Bergoglio in 2010 wishing him luck in his Vatican position. \u201cHe said: \u2018I remember our time together, I remember our conversations, and I remember your mother\u2019s good taste. I\u2019m praying for you.\u2019\u201d By the time Cardinal Tobin came to the Vatican in 2013 to receive his pallium \u2014 the cowl that would mark his status as the archbishop of Indianapolis \u2014 Pope Francis had been elected. He was not sure the new pope would remember him. But Francis again surprised him. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying intensely for you since I heard what happened,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said the pope had told him. What happened next was a kind of rehabilitation. Francis appointed him to the oversight committee of the same Vatican office he had been removed from. Then, in October, came the announcement: The pope was naming him a cardinal. He would be the youngest one in the United States. Cardinal Tobin was shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you are sleeping in class and all of a sudden the spotlight is on you,\u201d he said. At a news conference last month in Newark, he put it this way: \u201cSometimes I think Pope Francis sees a lot more in me than I see in myself.\u201d Photo Cardinal Tobin with Pope Francis at the Vatican last month. Credit Stefano Rellandini/Reuters Cardinal Tobin said he loved his time in Indianapolis, where he visited parishes in 39 counties, ministered to prisoners on death row and baptized about 1,000 new Catholics each Easter. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He was up by 4 many mornings to pray before arriving at the gym by 5:30. With the help of a trainer, Shane Moat, he learned how to deadlift 425 pounds. \u201cBig breath, explode, keep it close,\u201d Mr. Moat coached him earlier this month. Cardinal Tobin strained and hoisted the weight to his waist. \u201cYou the man!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said after dropping the weight with a bang. That morning, Mr. Yeary, the salesman, presented him with a goodbye gift: a framed photo of the cardinal with his seven workout buddies, whose ages range from 27 to over 70. \u201cOh, man, that\u2019s wonderful, thank you,\u201d the cardinal said. Then he reverted to his lighthearted tone: \u201cNone of those Sopranos are going to mess with me. This is my crew.\u201d Cardinal Tobin has had a hard time saying goodbye. He choked up at his farewell Mass and had only one request of the congregation that had packed the cathedral: Pray for him. But his admirers here and elsewhere are hoping that Cardinal Tobin will become a more public voice for Pope Francis and his priorities. He has already done that once, in a showdown with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican who is now the vice president-elect, over welcoming Syrian refugees. In November 2015, Mr. Pence announced that he would suspend Syrian refugee resettlement programs, citing security fears. Cardinal Tobin felt that was not only illegal, but also immoral. He met with Mr. Pence, discussed his objections and told him he would continue the Catholic Charities resettlement program. A federal court has since overturned the governor\u2019s directive. In an email, Mr. Pence said, \u201cCardinal Tobin is a personal friend, and I deeply respect his commitment to his faith and his ministry.\u201d While Cardinal Tobin did not tell anyone whom to vote for in the presidential election, he said he was disturbed by appeals to fear during the campaign of Donald J. Trump, particularly his views of refugees and immigrants. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cwas appealing to the dark side of the divisive forces, to the unredeemed part of us.\u201d And while the cardinal believes American democracy will ultimately resist such appeals, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too Pollyannish about things.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Cardinal Tobin at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark last month, when he was introduced as the new Roman Catholic archbishop of the city. Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times In Newark, he said, his first job after his installation on Jan. 6 will be to listen. Encompassing Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Union Counties in northern New Jersey, the archdiocese has pockets of great wealth and poverty, and an array of immigrants so diverse that Mass each Sunday is celebrated in 20 languages. About 30 percent of the parishioners are Hispanic. Advertisement It is also a community in need of healing . In July, citing the failure of the archdiocese to effectively remove priests accused of sexual abuse from contact with children , the editorial board of The Star-Ledger of Newark called the departure of Archbishop Myers a \u201ctrue blessing.\u201d \u201cDuring his 15-year tenure as New Jersey\u2019s highest-ranking Catholic, he protected pedophile priests,\u201d the board said. \u201cHe urged his flock to vote based on two issues \u2014 abortion and gay marriage \u2014 at the threat of being denied Holy Communion.\u201d Jim Goodness, the spokesman for the archdiocese, denied those allegations, saying that Archbishop Myers had permanently removed from ministry some 20 abusive priests and that he had \u201cnever threatened to deny Communion to anyone.\u201d Cardinal Tobin will bring a different message. One of his priorities, he said, would be to ensure that the archdiocese is fully compliant with church and criminal protocols on handling sexual abuse allegations. At the Vatican in the late 1990s, the cardinal recalled, it was difficult to convince people that the abuse issue was serious. \u201cI think they just believed it was an American problem,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it like I was a great crusader over there, but I did take it seriously.\u201d He later led an effort to establish protocols for abuse claims in his order. Yet the most outspoken American victims group, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests , said that Cardinal Tobin, like the church as a whole, must do more, such as posting the names of all credibly accused priests online. \u201cCertainly there are worse bishops, but that fact should comfort no one,\u201d David Clohessy, the organization\u2019s national director, said. Cardinal Tobin assumes his role in an uneasy time. He said that he hoped to lead with joy and transparency, and that he intended to encourage dialogue to bridge divisions. But he would go further if he believed that policies ran counter to the moral values that Jesus taught. On the threats by President-elect Trump to carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants, for example, Cardinal Tobin was clear. He recalled how Pope John XXIII, before he became pope, issued false baptismal certificates to help Jews escape the Nazis in World War II.

Two Freedom of Information Act experts noted that because Mayor Rahm Emanuel settled the case with the Better Government Association, there was no legal determination that he violated state open records law. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy A day after striking a deal to release 2,700 pages of emails involving public business he conducted on his personal accounts, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he \"wasn't perfect\" when it came to transparency but had resolved a lawsuit with a \"landmark\" agreement. A review of the mayor's settlement of a suit brought by a government watchdog group, however, shows that it contains loopholes that open records experts said could allow Emanuel to avoid turning over all the public records that the law requires. A double layer of Emanuel's lawyers \u2014 not a judge \u2014 decided which emails the public got to see and which ones remain secret. In doing so, the mayor's attorneys set up the rules to determine which emails were related to public business and would be released. In turn, the lawyers applied those definitions to a universe of emails that was substantially smaller than what the Better Government Association sought in its lawsuit, in large part because many of the emails no longer existed. Left unsaid by Emanuel's legal team when it turned over the documents was that emails sent to the mayor's personal accounts were deleted after 90 days. That meant the only emails released were either preserved after the lawsuit was filed last year or could be tracked down via email accounts of City Hall staffers. Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... In April 2014, investment banker Byron Trott sent an email to Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... (Rick Pearson, David Heinzmann and Jeff Coen) Beyond that, Emanuel and his attorneys maintained in the settlement that government-related emails on his personal accounts were not public records, despite Illinois law holding that government business conducted via email by a public official is subject to open records requirements. The mayor's position could allow him to continue to use his private email to conduct government business, experts who reviewed the settlement told the Chicago Tribune. \"The settlement says they disagree, that they don't think they're subject to the public records law,\" said David Cuillier, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Arizona who focuses on freedom of information issues. \"Really, that's sad and unconscionable. They are basically going to put in writing that they don't agree with the law or the principles of accountability to the public. ... They think it's OK to sneak around the public's eyes.\" Uncharted water? While Emanuel has put the BGA suit behind him, the mayor still faces a Tribune lawsuit alleging that Emanuel violated the state's open records laws by refusing to release communications about city business conducted through emails and text messages on personal devices. That ongoing suit is based on an open records request that sought electronic communications related to subjects that include the city's scandal-plagued red light camera program, as well as email and text correspondence between Emanuel and Michael Sacks, the mayor's close confidant and top campaign contributor. The Tribune sued a month before the watchdog group brought its case against Emanuel in October 2015 over a blanket open records request that sought all official emails the mayor sent from a nongovernment account. The mayor's Wednesday settlement with the BGA was announced 12 days after the Tribune won a round in its lawsuit. On Dec. 9, Cook County Judge Kathleen Pantle ordered Emanuel to produce an index of certain emails and text messages the mayor sent and received on personal devices, giving him until Jan. 27 to comply. The Tribune continues to seek those records in court. Read the story On Thursday, Emanuel discussed the settlement and repeated four times that he had been navigating \"uncharted waters\" when it came to determining whether he was allowed to conduct government business on personal email accounts. \"I think we finally, while there was a disconnect, synced up technology and transparency and have an agreement that kind of sheds a light going forward and sets a principle that not only applies to me, but all the city employees and gives people that information they need,\" the mayor said. Emanuel was asked what was so unprecedented about the notion of not sending government messages on private accounts, given that email has been commonplace for two decades and that he has spent nearly his entire career working in government, including as a congressman and as a White House senior aide in the administrations of two presidents. \"An overwhelming amount of the emails are people coming to me. I would be taking a stab, but 3 out of 4 are people just coming to me,\" Emanuel replied. \"They emailed me, and I forward it. Second, where I initiated it, I wasn't perfect. Now, you have a policy going forward, and that's it.\" The mayor also said \"sunshine was a good thing,\" but he worried about public officials becoming \"insular.\" \"It is good to have that public policy,\" he said. \"Know, though, it doesn't come, potentially, cost-free. It may actually deal with limiting people who want to talk to people in public life.\" Asked why some aldermen knew to email him on his private accounts rather than his official government email, the mayor responded, \"I'm not speaking for them.\" Emanuel also was asked how some of the city's top power brokers knew to reach him at the rahmemail.com address. \"People communicated,\" Emanuel replied without elaborating. Rahm Emanuel turned over from his personal accounts last week showed the mayor communicating with a wide range of Chicago power brokers, business leaders and media figures, including Tribune Editor and Publisher Bruce Dold. The emails included a handful of messages exchanged... The 2,700 pages of emails Rahm Emanuel turned over from his personal accounts last week showed the mayor communicating with a wide range of Chicago power brokers, business leaders and media figures, including Tribune Editor and Publisher Bruce Dold. The emails included a handful of messages exchanged... (Bill Ruthhart) Cuillier said he didn't buy the uncharted waters defense. \"He should have known better,\" Cuillier added. \"I don't think he's a dummy. I assume he and his staff are aware of the right thing to do and the law, so it surprises me they would do something so flagrantly wrong.\" A pair of Freedom of Information Act experts noted that because the BGA case was settled, there was no legal determination that Emanuel violated state open records law. Both experts contended that Emanuel's violation of the law was clear based on other rulings in similar cases around the nation. \"It would have been ideal to have a strong court ruling that clearly said he was in the wrong,\" said Cuillier, who added that it would have been better if a judge had reviewed all of Emanuel's emails and determined which ones were required to be made public. \"That didn't happen in this case, so for all we know there were important communications that the public will never see that they should see.\" Maryam Judar, executive director of the Elmhurst-based Citizen Advocacy Center that has long focused on government transparency issues, said similar lawsuits litigated across the country show that the BGA lawsuit was \"a losing case for Rahm Emanuel.\" Getting a court order would have made that clear, she said. \"They are not saying from now on that all emails pertaining to business, even if on a personal email account, should be produced pursuant to a FOIA request,\" Judar said, referring to the settlement. \"It's not a total victory.\" \"Basically, in the future, if someone wants to FOIA Rahm Emanuel's email, he could deny them all over again,\" she added, \"and they could go through this whole process all over again, because it isn't a court order.\" Deleted emails But Don Craven, a Springfield-based media attorney who has brought similar cases downstate, said there's no guarantee that a judge reviewing the emails would have come to a different determination as to which ones were public. \"In this case, the good news is even by means of the settlement, there is some indication, there is some recognition that the mayor's emails even on private accounts, private devices, are subject to FOIA, and that's a big step,\" Craven said. \"As a practical matter, this will serve to help establish that point.\" The mayor's use of the personal accounts first publicly surfaced among thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta posted by WikiLeaks this fall. A subsequent search for the mayor's email domain in 30,000 emails released by the State Department showed Emanuel used the same account to communicate with Clinton, including a 2012 email inviting her to appear at a public event with him in Chicago.

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, \u201cWe would not have let this resolution pass if it hadn\u2019t addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians.\u201d And she added that the vote \u201cdoes not in any way diminish the United States\u2019 steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.\u201d \u00a0 Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan reports.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades,\u201d Power said. The U.S. abstention was the stunning culmination of years of icy relations between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
