More than a dozen others were listed in serious or critical condition.\u00a0 The city has seen eight multiple-victim shootings, including two double homicides. One was an attack in the East Chatham neighborhood that left five dead and two wounded, and an attack in the Austin neighborhood left two dead.\u00a0 Much of the violence happened in areas \"with historical gang\u00a0conflicts on the south and west side of Chicago,\" said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. He also referenced the department's \"strategic subject list,\" which is generated daily from a computerized algorithm and assigns a score from 1 to 500 based on such factors as a person's arrests and the activities of his associates. Those people with a score in the upper 200s or higher are considered in danger of being shot or of shooting someone else. \"Ninety percent of those fatally wounded had gang affiliations, criminal histories and were pre-identified by the department's strategic subject algorithm as being a potential suspect or victim of gun violence,\" Guglielmi said Monday.\u00a0 The most recent shooting happened Monday night about 5:40 p.m. in the Back of the yards neighborhood, police said. A 34-year-old man was shot in the 4800 block of South Bishop Street about 5:40 p.m. and drove to a fire station seeking treatment. Paramedics took him to Stroger Hospital , police said.\u00a0 A 45-year-old man was shot in the 4100 block of West Arthington Street and taken Mount Sinai Hospitalf or treatment earlier in the day. He had been in an argument about 5:25 p.m., just before getting shot, police said.\u00a0 Two people were shot in the 5800 block of South May Street in the \u00a0Englewood neighborhood about 3:25 p.m. A 20-year-old man was taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County with a back wound and a 35-year-old man refused medical treatment for a graze wound. Someone in a dark-colored sedan fired shots and fled the scene, police said.\u00a0 A 22-year-old man walked into Advocate Trinity Hospital on the city's South Side seeking treatment for a gunshot wound sustained in the 7900 block of South Cottage Grove Avenue about 2:45 p.m., police said.\u00a0 Earlier,\u00a0about 11:20 a.m. in the 1800 block of South Ridgeway Avenue in North Lawndale, a 23-year-old man was shot in each leg. He was being treated at Mount Sinai Hospital, according to police. ",

(Nov. 29) AP Women participate in a self-defense class at the Muslim Community Network in New York on Dec. 3, 2016. (Photo: Religion News Service) Melissa Grajek was subjected to all kinds of taunts for wearing the hijab, but an incident at\u00a0\u00a0Discovery Lake in San Marcos, Calif., sealed the deal. Her 1-year-old son was playing with another boy when an irate father saw her and whisked his son away, telling Grajek: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until Trump is president because he\u2019ll send you back to where you came from.\u201d The man then scooped up a handful of wood chips and threw them at Grajek\u2019s son. At that moment, Grajek thought, enough was enough. She decided to take off her head covering. \u201cI had been on the fence regarding hijab, but that incident made it clear my religious choices could be putting my son at risk,\u201d she said. Grajek\u2019s decision to doff the hijab follows reports of assaults against Muslim women. Last week, Ilhan Omar, a\u00a0newly elected Minneapolis state representative, was leaving the White House, where she discussed\u00a0policy initiatives, when a cab driver\u00a0threatened to yank her hijab while shouting expletives and calling her \u201cISIS.\u201d Ilhan Omar speaks to a group of volunteers on Election Day in Minneapolis. \u00a0(Photo: Stephen Maturen, AFP/Getty Images) A day earlier, a man pushed a New York City transit worker down a staircase at\u00a0Grand Central Terminal, yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist, go back to your own country!\u201d And two weeks ago in Brooklyn, another man threatened an off-duty police officer with his pit bull, telling her and her son to \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d All three women were wearing hijabs. x Share Two Muslim women working for authorities in New York suffered hate crimes just 36 hours apart, officials say, following an explosion in such incidents across America since the election of Donald Trump. Video provided by AFP Newslook Assaults or intimidation of Muslims had been steadily rising well before the election, but they became more common during the divisive campaign of President-elect Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and proposed a registry for U.S. Muslims. A Pew Research Center analysis of\u00a0hate crimes statistics from the FBI shows that the number of physical assaults against Muslims reached 9/11-era levels last year. The number of anti-Muslim intimidation crimes \u2014 defined as threatening bodily harm \u2014 also rose. Now some imams across the country are saying it\u2019s OK to take\u00a0the hijab off, at least temporarily. Imam Abdullah Antepli recently asked a group of women at the Islamic Association of Raleigh (N.C.) how many of them felt unsafe in public. Dozens of hands shot up. He then told them the extraordinary circumstances under which Muslim Americans now live may require extraordinary measures \u2014 including taking off\u00a0the hijab, at least for a while. George Takei: Trump's Muslim registry is 'prelude to internment' \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be alarmist,\u201d said Antepli, the chief representative of Muslim affairs at Duke University. \u201cBut the nation is being sucked into a combustible mix. We have to think unconventionally.\u201d Antepli\u2019s call to remove the hijab, which he repeated at a mosque in Cary and in home gatherings of Muslims in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, is rare but not unheard of. In Texas, Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and resident scholar\u00a0at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, said women\u2019s fears should be taken seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s important to give our women support and validate the fear they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Suleiman said.\u00a0 \u201cFear isn\u2019t quantifiable; it\u2019s to the person\u2019s own experience.\u201d While Suleiman doesn\u2019t foresee a blanket call to abandon the head scarf, he advises women to consider practical measures, such as wearing a hoodie instead of a hijab if they feel like they may be in danger.

    "text": "Obama Vs Trump: Dispute Erupts Over Who Would Have Won By josh lederman, associated press HONOLULU \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 5:48 PM ET 0 Shares Star Getty Images President Barack Obama, left, speaks following a National Security Council meeting on the Islamic State at the Department of Treasury in Washington, June 14, 2016. Donald Trump addresses supporters, June 13, 2016. 0 Shares In an alternate universe in which President Barack Obama ran for a third term against Donald Trump, who would have won? No surprise: The president and the president-elect disagree. A fresh dispute erupted Monday between Obama and his successor, spurred by Obama's hypothetical musings that had he run again, he would have been victorious. Interviewed for a podcast, Obama suggested he still holds enough sway over the coalition of voters that elected him twice to get them to vote for him once again. \"I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama told his former White House adviser, David Axelrod, in a podcast released Monday. Trump, naturally, disagreed. He took to his preferred medium \u2014 Twitter \u2014 to offer his reaction. \"President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY!\" Trump wrote. He suggested Obama's record would have prevented him from securing a victory, citing jobs that have left the U.S., troubles with Obama's Affordable Care Act and the ongoing threat posed by the Islamic State group as examples. The White House declined to comment on Trump's tweet. In the podcast, Obama didn't address whether he would have been able to surmount the obstacle that the Electoral College posed for Hillary Clinton . The Democrat failed to secure a majority of electoral votes despite winning the popular vote by millions. Yet Obama said he's spoken to people across the U.S. who have told him the direction he pursued \"is the right one,\" a sentiment he said extends even to some people \"who disagreed with me.\" He suggested Democrats' failure in the election may have stemmed from the prevailing assumption that Clinton's victory was all but assured. \"If you think you're winning, then you have a tendency \u2014 just like in sports \u2014 maybe to play it safer,\" Obama said. Though Obama railed against Trump during the campaign, he's largely held his tongue since the Republican's Election Day victory, in large part to ensure a smooth transition of power. He and Trump have spoken regularly by phone, and Trump has praised his predecessor for the graciousness with which he's handled the process. But in recent days, points of tension between their two teams have started to emerge, driven by Trump's picks of Cabinet nominees who have vowed to dismantle much of what Obama has accomplished. The Obama administration has also been dismayed by requests from Trump's team for information they fear could be used to try to identify and then eliminate bureaucrats who have worked on Obama priorities like climate change and women's rights overseas. Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, was prohibited by the Constitution's 22nd Amendment from running for a third term. But Obama has said even if there weren't term limits for presidents, he believes it's important for the country to have a change of leadership after eight years. He's also suggested his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, would have had little patience for a third term in the White House. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP 0 Shares ",

Michael Putland / Getty Images Share advertisement Music legend George Michael, known for hit songs such as \"Faith,\" \"Freedom '90\" and holiday favorite \"Last Christmas,\" died at age 53 on Christmas Day, reportedly of heart failure. But the legacy of the pop star, who sold well over 100 million albums in the span of his career, extends far beyond his music. In this file photo from July 21, 2007, George Michael is seen performing in his 'Live 25' tour concert in Rome. Laura Antonelli / REX/Shutterstock \"George was probably the first gay pop star in the modern era, who was totally unabashed about gay sexuality,\" Martin Aston, a music journalist and author of \" Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache: How Music Came Out ,\" told NBC Out. Even though Michael was forced out of the closet, once he was out, Aston noted, \"he took a great leap forward\" and \"came out guns blazing.\" Infamous Outing Michael's moment of liberation followed what seemed at first to be a time of deep humiliation. He was blessed with sensual good looks and an exquisite voice, attributes he used to become first a teenybopper heartthrob and then a mature solo artist with videos that played up his considerable appeal. He kept his own sexual orientation private, until he was arrested in 1998 for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer. In an earlier era, that might have doomed his career. Instead of retreating, however, he made a single and video \u2014 \"Outside\" \u2014 that ridiculed the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police officers who busted him. The memorable image of the two uniformed policemen kissing in the video \u2014 both funny and outrageous at the time \u2014 helped Michael come out as a proud gay man. LGBTQ Legacy Despite his infamous outing, \"he never dealt with [his sexuality] in terms of shame,\" Aston told NBC Out. \"He realized he had to be true to himself, and that had to have helped bust that closet door open.\" George Michael performs on stage, Australia, March 1988. Michael Putland / Getty Images Aston referred to the late pop star as a \"very good role model\" and credited him with helping pave the way for openly gay contemporary artists such as Adam Lambert and Sam Smith. Smith, who tweeted Monday for the first time in more than six months, seems to agree: \"I would not be the artist I am if it wasn't for you. @GeorgeMichael.\" I would not be the artist I am if it wasn't for you. @GeorgeMichael \u2014 Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) December 26, 2016 In a separate tweet , the Grammy Award-winning artist referred to Michael as \"one of the most magical, talented, bravest & important figures in music & life as I know it.\" Adam Lambert also took to Twitter to remember the singer, writing simply \"RIP @GeorgeMichael.\" \u2014 ADAM LAMBERT (@adamlambert) December 25, 2016 While Michael was far from the first musician to come out as openly gay, his status as a mainstream pop icon and his \"huge female fan base\" made him unique, according to Aston. \"For somebody of that ilk to not worry about their career or their image and be that open about it, was incredibly positive,\" he said. \"From the time he was out, there was no sense of shame,\" Aston reiterated, adding \"the regret was that he hadn't done it sooner.\" George Michael performs on his Symphonica Tour at The LG Arena on September 16, 2012 in Birmingham, England. Dave J Hogan / Getty Images Following Michael's passing, a long list of celebrities paid tribute to the music legend, but openly gay entertainer George Takei may have said it best in a comment posted to Twitter on Christmas night: \"Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael. You've found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you.\" Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael. You've found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) December 25, 2016 (The Associated Press contributed to this reporting.)

Across the country, demonstrators took to the streets to protest police shootings, while at the same time officers in a number of states were targeted and killed by gunmen. Both situations have prompted law enforcement to examine use-of-force policies. Video Of Baton Rouge Man's Fatal Shooting By Police Sparks Protests, FBI Inquiry Early next year, the FBI will take the first steps in developing a national database to track police shootings. Currently, the country's 18,000 police departments report crime information voluntarily, so media outlets and academics such as Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University, work to create their own comprehensive list of police shootings. \"My best estimate is that about 1,000 times a year an on-duty police officer shoots and kills someone,\" he says. Stinson says prosecutors consider most of those cases legally justified and few officers face charges. Even so, several police shootings this year drew massive protests and widespread attention. In July, Baton Rouge was a hotbed of protests and mourning after police shot and killed 37-year-old Alton Sterling who was selling CDs outside of a storefront. A bystander's graphic video of his death shows two white officers pinning Sterling to the ground. (Warning: The video shows an intense scene that ends with gunfire.) YouTube Protests flared after both shootings. Later after a peaceful march in Dallas, a sniper targeting police killed five officers and wounded several others before he was killed. During an interview on Fox News, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick talked about eroding respect for law enforcement. Article continues after sponsorship Snipers Kill 5 Police Officers, Wound Several Others At Dallas Protest \"And I do blame people on social media with their hatred towards police,\" he said. \"I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 last night's was peaceful, but others have not been, and we've heard the 'Pigs in a blanket.' This has to stop.\" Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, says what happened in Dallas was a tragedy. \"I think people are smart enough to be able to understand that both things are tragic and that we can't be deterred from fighting for black lives,\" Cullors says. Motive In Baton Rouge Police Slayings Still Unclear, Investigators Say There would be more killings \u2014 three officers ambushed in Baton Rouge \u2014 but later in September, police shot and killed men in Tulsa, Okla. , and Charlotte, N.C., putting the spotlight back on police use of force and setting off days of protests. The Justice Department's Civil Rights division is investigating the Tulsa shooting. Vanita Gupta, head of the division, says she's also aware that, as the nation grapples with police shootings, many in law enforcement are taking a harder look at what needs to change. After Police Killing Of Unarmed Man, Tulsa Chief Promises To 'Achieve Justice' \"I have been encouraged by the fact that there is a lot of conversation in the field about de-escalation training and implicit bias and procedural justice,\" she says. Chuck Wexler with the Police Executive Research Forum says he's working with police to develop better use-of-force policies and practices. The Forum's 30 guiding principles include calling for other officers to intervene and prevent their colleagues from using excessive force. After Fatal Police Shooting, Protest Erupts In Charlotte, N.C. \"How many cases would have been prevented when someone is obviously getting upset and losing their cool, if another officer had said, 'Hey, step back, let me take over?' That's what you need \u2014 cool heads to prevail in some of these situations.\" Changes like those could begin to build trust and possibly make deadly police-civilian encounters less likely. ",

    "text": "Obama: I could have won third term Published               December 26, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Obama suggested in an exit interview with his former top adviser that, had he been able to run, he could have won a third term in the White House. Describing his confidence in an America that is \u201ctolerant\u201d and \u201cfull of energy,\u201d Obama said: \u201cI am confident in this vision because I'm confident that \u2026 if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump fired back Monday in a tweet: \"He should say that but I say NO WAY!\" He cited the rise of the Islamic State terror group and trouble with Obama administration agenda items including ObamaCare. The outgoing president made the comments as part of an extensive interview with David Axelrod, for his podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago. Axelrod was one of Obama\u2019s top advisers during the 2008 campaign and his first term in the White House. \u201cI know that in conversations that I've had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,\u201d Obama told Axelrod, defending his assertion. Obama was term-limited and could not run, clearing the way for his former primary rival \u2013 and secretary of state \u2013 Hillary Clinton to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2016. She nevertheless ran in large part on Obama\u2019s agenda, vowing to preserve some of his signature policies as Donald Trump and his Republican allies campaigned against them. As other top Democrats have done in the wake of President-elect Trump\u2019s victory, Obama did acknowledge that Democrats and progressives face political challenges, especially in rural areas. \u00a0 \u201cIf we can't find some way to break through what is a complicated history in the South and start winning races there and winning back Southern white voters without betraying our commitment to civil rights and diversity -- if we can do those things, then we can win elections,\u201d he said. Obama also warned about an \u201cera where we are looking for simple solutions \u2026 that we end up starting to shut ourselves off from different points of view, shutting down debate, becoming more dogmatic, becoming more brittle. And I don't see that being a successful strategy for us winning over the country.\u201d He reminded listeners that his party won the popular vote on Election Day, but said: \u201cWe don't have very good population distribution from a democratic perspective.\u201d Vice President Biden offered a somewhat tougher critique of his party in a similar exit interview with the Los Angeles Times . He said his party failed to connect with working-class, largely white voters, and warned that \u201ca bit of elitism\u201d has \u201ccrept in\u201d to party thinking. He recalled watching a Trump rally in Pennsylvania near where he grew up. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re all the people I grew up with,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re their kids. And they\u2019re not racist. They\u2019re not sexist. But we didn\u2019t talk to them.\u201d Advertisement ",

By Michael Kranish December 26 at 5:02 PM Follow @PostKranish President Obama said Republican strategy was to block his programs. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) President Obama said in an interview released Monday that he could have beaten Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump \u201cif I had run again.\u201d In his most pointed critique yet, Obama said Hillary Clinton's campaign acted too cautiously out of a mistaken belief that victory was all but certain. \u201cIf you think you're winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\u201d Obama said in the interview with former adviser and longtime friend David Axelrod, a CNN analyst, for his \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast. The president said Clinton \u201cunderstandably . . . looked and said, well, given my opponent and the things he's saying and what he's doing, we should focus on that.\u201d Trump took exception to this critique, tweeting out later in the day that \u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! \u2014 \u00a0jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.\u201d President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 Obama stressed his admiration for Clinton and said she had been the victim of unfair attacks. But, as he has in other exit interviews, Obama\u00a0insisted that her defeat was not a rejection of the eight years of his presidency. To the contrary, he argued that he had put together a winning coalition that stretched across the country but that the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign had failed to follow through on it. \u201cI am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I \u2014 if I had run again and articulated it \u2014 I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\u201d the president said. \u201cSee, I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class, I think that's nonsense,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLook, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters. There are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn't vote for Hillary, didn't vote for me, but are being helped by this . . . The problem is, is that we're not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we're bleeding for these communities.\u201d 1 of 9 See how Obama has aged during his presidency View Photos Eight years after he burst onto the scene with a youthful vigor, his once-black hair has gone nearly fully gray. Caption Eight years after he burst onto the scene with a youthful vigor, his once-black hair has gone nearly fully gray. Aug. 4, 2008\u00a0 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) smiles as the audience sings him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d during a campaign stop at the Lansing Center in Lansing, Mich. Rebecca Cook/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said via email that the campaign declined to comment. Axelrod, in an interview with The Washington Post, said he believed Obama went further than he had before in critiquing Clinton's campaign. \u201cThis was all in service of making the point that he believes that his progressive vision and the vision he ran on is still a majority view in this country,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cHe chooses to be hopeful about the future.\u201d [ Michelle Obama gave a somber exit interview to Oprah Winfrey ] Obama could not have run again; the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution states that \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\u201d Still, Obama\u2019s suggestion that he could have won if he ran stoked debate Monday among political observers. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican who has been an adviser to Trump, said in an interview that \u201cObama doesn\u2019t know and neither does anyone else. Obama would have increased the turnout in the African American community, but he also might have increased the repudiation of him among those who felt they were betrayed. \u201cAll of the lies he told about Obamacare, \u2018keeping your doctor\u2019 . . . would have come back to haunt him. It would have been a totally different race.\u201d Steve Hildebrand, a Democrat who oversaw Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign in battleground states, said the president had an ability to communicate with lower-income workers that Clinton lacked. He said he sent the Clinton campaign 15 emails in which he said he told them \u201cyou are not communicating with lower-income workers, you are not connecting with them.\u201d In the podcast interview, Axelrod did not press Obama on many of the most controversial parts of his presidency, such as not taking action to prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Syria. The president, who has done relatively few interviews with mainstream media organizations, repeated his long-stated complaint that the media has filtered his message and that he is subject to unfair criticism by outlets such as Fox News. Obama also blamed some of his problems during his presidency on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a longtime adversary who famously said in 2010: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d McConnell failed in that goal, but Obama said the senator was successful in blocking many of his initiatives and setting the groundwork for Trump\u2019s victory. McConnell\u2019s strategy from a \u201ctactical perspective was pretty smart and well executed,\u201d the president said. The Republican leader found ways to \u201cjust throw sand in the gears\u201d in a manner that fed into people\u2019s beliefs that things were going badly. Obama said that, as a result, Republicans blocked action that could have helped more people recover from the Great Recession. The strategy, Obama maintained, was that \u201cif we just say no, then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is \u2014 is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy. And if we can \u2014 if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House.\u201d A McConnell spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Obama stressed that he doesn't plan to get involved in day-to-day responses to a Trump presidency, just as former president George W. Bush has remained mostly on the sidelines during the Obama years. But Obama made it clear that he will be more of an activist in the long run. He said he plans to help mobilize and train a younger generation of Democratic leaders and will speak out if his core beliefs are challenged. He also said he is working on writing a book. At a news conference at the White House, Dec. 16, President Obama shared his advice to Democrats following their defeat in the 2016 election. (Reuters) His post-presidential \u201clong-term interest,\u201d Obama said, is \u201cto build that next generation of leadership; organizers, journalists, politicians. I see them in America, I see them around the world \u2014 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds who are just full of talent, full of idealism. And the question is how do we link them up? How do we give them the tools for them to bring about progressive change? And I want to use my presidential center as a mechanism for developing that next generation of talent.\u201d He said he didn't want to be someone \u201cwho's just hanging around reliving old glories.\u201d Obama in the interview also reflected on his years at college, particularly Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1983. He said he was rereading \u201cold journals\u201d and letters to girls that he was \u201ccourting,\u201d and found them unreadable. He found himself to be \u201cwildly pretentious,\u201d recalling how he begged off going to parties so he could read the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The women on campus found him \u201ctoo intense,\u201d he said. Looking back, said the president of the United States, \u201cI should\u2019ve tried, like, you know, \u2018Wanna go to a movie?\u2019 \u201d 1 of 22 ",

But this year, they found themselves scrambling for doctors' numbers, sending guests home hungry and rummaging through cupboards for\u00a0backup plans. \u00a0 At Maria Coronado 's house,\u00a0dozens of guests\u00a0made do with\u00a0a desperate meal of spaghetti and nachos. The tamales had turned out gloppy, and her husband felt so sick after a few bites he had to visit the doctor. \u00a0 \u201cWe didn\u2019t have dinner for Christmas,\u201d said Coronado, 51, who has shopped at Amapola markets for 30 years and has always regarded their masa as excellent, well worth the drive from her home in Riverside. \u00a0 She was back in line Monday, waiting for a refund of the $143 she spent, along with hundreds of others complaining of bad tamales, stomach cramps, fever, nauseated children\u00a0\u2014 and ruined Christmases. Others were lining up at Amapola stores in Compton, Paramount and West Covina. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re devastated,\u201d said Carlos Galvan Jr., the company\u2019s vice president and chief financial officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure yet what occurred.\u201d Customers wait in line as they seek refunds and explanations of why their tamales had gone bad, ruining their traditional Christmas meals.

Customers wait in line as they seek refunds and explanations of why their tamales had gone bad, ruining their traditional Christmas meals. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) Galvan, whose father and grandfather started the market chain in 1961, said the bad tamales seem to stem from a problem with a 120,000-pound supply of raw corn purchased from a longtime California vendor, though he refused to provide the name. He said Amapola has since switched vendors.\u00a0 \u201cWe know that we lost a lot of customers,\u201d Galvan said. \u201cThe only way to confront this is head-on.\u201d He said the company would refund customers not just the money they spent on masa but on other items they purchased for the meal.\u00a0 \u00a0 The scene in Downey was semi-chaotic Monday morning, as the line for refunds stretched around the building and through the parking lot. Police had been summoned to keep order. By late morning, some said they had been waiting for three hours. A besieged-looking company representative fielded angry questions in Spanish. \u00a0 Many of the people in line were loyal, longtime Amapola customers, and stories were common of people who drove from all over the Southland \u2014 and even bordering states \u2014 to buy the masa. \u00a0 \u201cChristmas was ruined.\u00a0 For Mexican culture, tamales is the main thing,\u201d said Kathy Moreno, 33, of Downey, who bought 35 pounds of masa last week and was frustrated by the disorganized system of dispensing refunds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming here over 25 years.\u201d She said she does expect to return, but \u201cit will take a while to regain trust.\u201d Eloy Alvarez, second from right, of Whittier, shows how the masa went bad after cooking his tamales at home.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) Janessa Sandoval, 28, of Bellflower, said her grandmother usually makes the Christmas tamales, but that at age 79 her health no longer permits it. So Sandoval inherited the job this year, but they turned out runny and terrible, and she spent all Christmas Day wondering if she was to blame. Monday morning, her grandfather turned on the news. \u201cHe said, \u2018Janessa, it\u2019s not your fault,\u2019\u201d she said. Esther Cervantes, 44, of Bell Gardens, said she\u2019s been buying her masa here for years. This time, she said, her 8-year-old daughter threw up. And her nieces, visiting from Corona, left hungry. \u201cMy nieces went home to Corona without eating dinner, and I felt miserable,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything else to offer them. You can\u2019t go out and buy pizza.\u201d Maria Quezada, 63, had bought 80 pounds of masa for a big Christmas Eve bash that doubled as her husband\u2019s 70th birthday party. She cut her losses quickly when she noticed that the first batch \u2014 chili and cheese tamales \u2014 had the consistency of jelly after an hour and 20 minutes. She stashed the masa in the garage and scrambled for a replacement dinner. Luckily, she had a connection for chuck roast, which she turned into barbacoa. \u201cI have 37 nephews and nieces,\u201d Quezada said. \u201cThey all came.\u201d Carlos Galvan, the company vice president, said the markets had temporarily run out of cash to give refunds and would be closed Tuesday. He said the refunds would resume Wednesday.
