Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 Mr. Trump \u201cpinned\u201d the tweet soon after posting it, making it the featured message on his Twitter profile page, which is followed by over 18 million users.\u00a0 The tweet circulated widely in a matter of minutes, with entities like the Russian embassy reposting the message. In an unexpected move, Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to take retaliatory measures against the U.S. after dozens of Russians were expe... The president-elect\u2019s message came just a day after the White House announced a string of punitive measures against Russia for its cyberhacking attempts to undermine the U.S. election.\u00a0 Later Friday evening, Mr. Trump followed the tweet up with one critical of CNN and NBC News, though it is unclear what aspect of their coverage he was specifically referring to: Russians are playing @CNN and @NBCNews for such fools - funny to watch, they don't have a clue! @FoxNews totally gets it! President-elect Donald Trump says he will meet with intelligence officials next week about Russian hacking and the sanctions ordered by the Obama... President Obama on Thursday sanctioned the GRU and FSB, leading Russian intelligence agencies the U.S. said were involved -- actions that the next administration could roll back easily. The U.S. is also booting 35 Russian diplomats from the country. In a statement early Friday, Putin called the American sanctions a \u201cprovocation\u201d that were \u201caimed at undermining the future of Russian-American relations.\u201d But he added that he would wait and see what the next administration does once Mr. Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20.

By Andrew Roth December 30 at 11:09 AM Follow arothwp MOSCOW \u2014 On a day when everyone expected him to go low, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the high road, bowing out of a growing diplomatic showdown with the administration of President Obama in a gambit to woo his successor, Donald Trump. In a rare, and calculated, break from the diplomatic tradition of reciprocal punishment, Putin opted to do nothing after the United States said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats and close a pair of Russian-owned properties in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin said he would wait to see how U.S.-Russian relations develop under the new Trump administration before planning \u201cany further steps\u201d on the issue.\u00a0 \u00a0Until Putin\u2019s surprise decision Friday, all signs pointed toward the familiar, hard-nosed Kremlin response of years past. In 2012, when Russia was slapped with U.S. sanctions over the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, Putin shot back by signing a ban on all foreign adoptions of Russian children, just days after Christmas, sparking outrage. But this time, with the Kremlin bidding farewell to Obama and betting that a friendly Trump administration will bring fresh opportunities to escape sanctions and make a grab for greater power status, Putin waxed magnanimous.\u00a0 (The Washington Post) \u201cWe will not create any problems for U.S. diplomats,\u201d Putin said in a statement late Friday afternoon. \u201cWe will not expel anyone. We will not prevent their families and children from using their traditional leisure sites during the New Year\u2019s holidays.\u201d Instead of sending the U.S. diplomats home, Putin invited their kids over for \u201cthe New Year and Christmas children\u2019s parties in the Kremlin.\u201d Then he wished the Obamas a happy new year and bid season\u2019s greetings to \u201cDonald Trump and the American people.\u201d One person in particular appreciated that approach.\u00a0 \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) \u2014 I always knew he was very smart!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet Friday afternoon, his latest public expression of admiration for the Russian leader. Russia has denied and ridiculed accusations by Obama and the U.S. intelligence community that it sponsored hackers to steal and then leak sensitive information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to sway the election in favor of Trump. Putin on Friday accused the United States of engaging in\u00a0\u201cirresponsible \u2018kitchen\u2019 diplomacy\u201d and said Russia would retain its\u00a0\u201cright to retaliate.\u201d Trump\u2019s unorthodox views on Putin have sent shock waves through his own party, and the sanctions against Russia imposed by Obama on Thursday will present him with a new challenge. Should the Republican choose to remove some or all of the sanctions after his inauguration next month, he would be acting in opposition to public statements made by congressional GOP leaders \u2014 and forcing them to decide whether to accept or resist his efforts to remake U.S.-Russian relations. Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP) Still, Putin\u2019s decision not to escalate the situation may make it easier, if just marginally, for him to do that. Putin\u2019s theatrical turnabout came just hours before Russians set off for their snowbound dachas for a week of holiday festivities. The Russian Foreign Ministry pledged to send a plane to collect the departing Russian diplomats and complained that Washington had been inconsiderate by deporting embassy employees just before the winter break. In declining a \u201csymmetrical response,\u201d Putin disregarded a public proposal from his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who suggested the expulsion of 35 U.S. diplomats and the closure of two U.S.-owned properties in Moscow \u2014 a warehouse and a dacha used for receptions. That retreat was far humbler than the compound lost to the Russians, a luxurious 45-acre estate at Pioneer Point in Maryland, a site purchased by the Soviet government in 1972 that features tennis courts and bungalows and, during the Soviet period, played host to dinner parties of vodka and caviar. \u201cPutin\u2019s asymmetric response to Obama\u2019s new sanctions is an investment in the incoming Trump presidency,\u201d Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, wrote online shortly after Putin\u2019s announcement.\u00a0 Putin\u2019s decision followed a drumbeat of threats from Russian officials about coming countersanctions that focused their ire on the outgoing Obama administration. Until the last moment, it seemed likely that Moscow would follow Friday with its own mass expulsion of U.S. diplomats, similar to when Russia and the United States deported more than 100 diplomats combined in a 2001 spat sparked by the spying case of former FBI agent Robert Hanssen.\u00a0 Earlier Friday, Putin\u2019s spokesman had said that the Russian countersanctions would bring \u201cserious discomfort\u201d for an American diplomatic corps that has already complained about harassment, including slashed tires and aggressive surveillance. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called the Obama administration a \u201cgroup of \u00adforeign-policy losers, embittered and shortsighted.\u201d And Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was openly eulogizing the Obama administration on Twitter. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Obama administration, which started out by restoring our ties, is ending its term in an anti-Russia agony. RIP,\u201d he tweeted in English. The Kremlin will be looking to negotiate with the Trump White House over the role of NATO; the status of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine; the war in Syria; and a host of other thorny issues that have led U.S.-Russian relations to their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. Perhaps most of all, Putin wants Russia to be treated as a great power that will have a seat at the table when major world decisions are being hammered out.\u00a0 Seeing those opportunities, some Russian politicians called for a measured response to the U.S. sanctions before Putin\u2019s announcement Friday, arguing that an aggressive move could force a response from Trump and set the relationship off on the wrong foot. \u201cCountermeasures, which are typically mandatory, should be weighted in this case, considering the known circumstances of the transitional period and the possible response of the U.S. president-elect,\u201d said Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the foreign-affairs committee in Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament.\u00a0 Russian officials are largely positive about the incoming administration, but there are concerns among some policymakers about the new U.S. leader\u2019s unpredictable nature and lack of experience in politics. Kosachyov had previously said that a Trump presidency could open the door to a significant improvement in relations \u2014 or a severe decline. The nomination of Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, was seen as confirmation here that Trump will move forward with his stated plans to revitalize the U.S.-Russia relationship.\u00a0But his nomination hearings will probably serve as a stage to bring Russia to the fore of the national debate, with Senate Democrats likely to pepper him with questions about his time working closely with Putin and use that as a pivot to focus on Trump\u2019s relationship with the Russian leader as well.

    "text": "Lower payout rates for most instant ticket games In lottery instant games, a percentage of ticket sales is returned to players in the form of prizes. That's known as the payout rate. While a game's final result is not entirely predictable, a game is designed to pay a specific rate if all tickets... (Cecilia Reyes) Other times, he questioned whether the advertisements fairly described the value of the grand prizes. For example, he advocated changing the fine print for \"Cash for Life\" games, in part because he questioned whether the lottery could legally or logistically guarantee anyone lifetime payments. As for how many tickets were printed for games, Jones said the state assumed Northstar was printing an appropriate number of tickets so games could be expected to award all the grand prizes. Northstar said it acted only with the state's approval. \"The Illinois Lottery was aware and involved in almost all aspects of a game launch,\" IGT said in a response to questions. Scientific Games added: \"The Illinois Lottery made final decisions with regards to prize structure, prize payout percent and the number of tickets printed.\" Ending games Scientific Games said the industry benchmark is for games to sell through 80 to 90 percent of their tickets. Birthday Surprise sold 64 percent of its tickets before it was ended with one of two grand prizes unawarded. Other big-prize instant games were ended after selling 49 percent of tickets, 37 percent of tickets, 22 percent, even 15 percent. In those four games, only one of 10 available grand prizes was awarded. Each week, the state publishes an online list showing all games and the number of big prizes each has left to award \u2014 information the state could have used to flag games pulled from shelves with unclaimed grand prizes. Yet there is no record that any lottery employee questioned at the time why the games were being ended with grand prizes left to be claimed. And in each case, the state did not veto the ending of a game. Players have up to a year after a game's sales have ended to claim winning tickets, at which point the lottery can determine exactly how many prizes that game awarded. There is no record that any lottery staff raised questions at that stage, either. A Tribune investigation found the Illinois Lottery collected hundreds of millions of dollars from selling tickets to the biggest-prize instant games in which it did not hand out all of the grand prizes in some of the games. (Illinois Lottery) Jones said that delay made it difficult to discover the practice. And even if the practice had been discovered, Jones said, a flawed contract with Northstar left state officials with few practical options for requiring changes, short of trying to dismiss Northstar. Under the deal, any request to change Northstar's day-to-day operations allowed Northstar to make demands of its own: lowering the revenue targets for the state. By the time Jones arrived, Northstar had demanded about $250 million in lowered profit targets; it received about $20 million. And, Jones said, by the time the lottery could have discovered the practice, he and his staff were focusing on severing ties with Northstar. \"Indeed, almost all of the Tribune's findings on the 17 examined games became evident after the lottery had already recommended, in the fall of 2013, that the Northstar contract be terminated. A termination that would make the practice moot,\" Jones said in a statement. Still, Jones' predecessor, Winnett, said the lottery under state management had tracked at least one metric \u2014 payout rates for sets of similarly priced games \u2014 in an effort to ensure games generally paid out as designed. \"That was our promise to the players,\" she said. Returning more Even if the state didn't study the performance of individual games, there was another metric that could have prompted questions about Northstar's management of instant games. In its winning bid, Northstar outlined an ambitious goal to help the state lottery compete in an increasingly crowded gambling environment. Northstar planned to manage a portfolio of games that, collectively, gave a greater percentage of sales overall back to players in the form of prizes. \"Payout optimization is an optimal way to provide greater excitement to players while maintaining an appropriate balance of responsible gaming,\" Northstar said in its proposal to the state. To achieve the goal, Northstar planned to improve Illinois' annual aggregate payout rate \u2014 at the time below 69 percent \u2014 to 73 percent by the fiscal year ending in June 2016. It was careful to caution that the projected payout rate was only an estimate and would most likely change as market conditions change. Northstar soon fell short. ",

Three people were found shot to death inside a home in the Fernwood neighborhood, another 2 were found shot outside the home, one of those deceased. Chicago has had more than 750 murders in 2016. (Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images) CHICAGO \u2014 Just before Christmas, Tywone Lee dialed the Chicago Police Department detective charged with investigating the murder of her 18-year-old son, who was gunned down in July just blocks from their West Side home. She\u2019s called police more than 20 times since her child, Keyon Boyd, was fatally shot in the chest and two of his friends were wounded\u00a0July 26 as they walked to play basketball at a nearby court in the city\u2019s Austin neighborhood. Most of her attempts to get information about the unsolved case ended with her leaving messages that rarely were returned, she said. On this day, she catches the detective, but receives no substantive information about the status of the investigation. \u201cThere is just no accountability,\u201d said a frustrated Lee after ending the call. \u201cI understand they have a lot of cases, but this is what they are paid to do. They need to find and hold responsible whoever killed my son.\u201d Boyd was one of more than 750 murder victims killed in Chicago in 2016, which will end as the bloodiest year the city has seen since at least 1997, when 761 people were killed. The murder toll was up 58% as of Christmas Day, with the city tallying 275 more murders than the same time last year. Nearly as unnerving as the number who have been killed in Chicago this year is how few of the assailants have been arrested. The department\u2019s murder clearance rate \u2014 the calculation of cases that end with an arrest or identification of a suspect who can\u2019t be apprehended \u2014 has hovered at or below 30% for the past three years. The national clearance rate stood at 61.5% last year, while Chicago\u2019s clearance rate was 25.6% last year, according to data compiled by the Virginia-based Murder Accountability Project.\u00a0 More than 40 shot in Chicago over the weekend The dismal rate\u00a0is a blemish\u00a0Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has acknowledged and vowed to improve. More cases will be solved, he says, by repairing the department's tattered reputation in predominantly black neighborhoods like the one where Lee lives,\u00a0and by completing a plan to add\u00a0hundreds of more detectives to the force. \"The first thing we have to do is improve our trust with the community \u2014 especially the minority community and CPD \u2014 that will help raise the clearance rate, because those individuals will be more comfortable in coming to us and giving us the information we need to hold these individuals accountable,\" Johnson said at a recent\u00a0 forum .\u00a0 As Lee has clamored for answers in\u00a0the shooting of her son \u2014 who is among 57 people killed this year in a district with a population of about 59,000 people \u2014 she says police department officials have asked for her patience as detectives throughout the city are piled with more cases than they can handle. That excuse doesn\u2019t assuage her anger. \u201cA lot of these kids are dying for no \u2026 reason, and no one seems to care,\u201d said Lee, who was badly injured as a teenager when her brother accidentally shot her while cleaning a gun. \u201cOur children\u2019s lives matter, just like white children\u2019s lives matter.\u201d Chicago hits grim milestone of 700 murders for 2016 and the year's not over The murder rate \u00a0surged in several major U.S. metropolitans in 2016, including Houston, San Antonio and Las Vegas. In terms of murders per capita, smaller cities, such as St. Louis and New Orleans outpace the nation\u2019s third largest city. But the grim toll in Chicago, which has recorded more murders than New York and Los Angeles combined, has captured the most attention. President-elect Donald Trump on the stump even compared\u00a0the city to a war-torn country. Tywone Lee sits in her home in Chicago's Austin neighborhood. Her son Keyon Boyd was killed July 26, 2016 in a shooting blocks from their home. \u00a0(Photo: Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY) Police officials say the surge in murders here is being driven by gangs in a few pockets in predominantly low-income African-American and Latino neighborhoods on the city\u2019s South and West Sides. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Johnson have also complained that repeat gun offenders are getting out of jail too quickly and contributing to the bloodshed. About 40% of homicide suspects arrested in Chicago last year had previously been convicted of a weapons offense, Johnson said. The spike in violence comes as the Chicago Police Department has struggled through a tumultuous year following the court-ordered release in November 2015 of police video showing a white officer fatally shooting Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old black suspect who was fired upon 16 times as he appeared to be running away from police. The McDonald incident \u2014 which spurred a still-ongoing U.S. Justice Department civil rights investigation of the police department's\u00a0practices and was followed by some other high-profile\u00a0police-involved shooting incidents that further exacerbated tensions \u2014 was the \u201ctipping point for long-simmering community anger,\u201d according to an April\u00a0report from the city\u2019s police accountability task force. In the aftermath of public outrage, Emanuel vowed to restore public trust for the police department in the city\u2019s African-American community, which represents about a third of Chicago\u2019s population. But more than a year into Emanuel\u2019s relationship mending effort, the dismal murder clearance rate underscores how complicated the situation has become. In response to the rising violence, Emanuel announced in September that the city would hire nearly 1,000 more cops over the next two years, including creating 350 additional detective positions. At the end of the hiring spree, the department is expected to have 13,500 sworn officers. In the recruitment drive, the police department has put an emphasis on diversifying its force. Emanuel has also outlined plans to launch a universal mentoring program to help young men in some of Chicago\u2019s most violent neighborhoods. And in a nod to bolstering transparency, Emanuel and the police department also announced earlier this week they were speeding up a plan to equip every cop on the street with a body camera.\u00a0All officers interacting with the public will now be wearing one by the end of next year. Johnson says\u00a0the low clearance rate will\u00a0improve as the department expands its detective pool as part of the hiring surge. But ultimately, Johnson says, the ability of\u00a0the police department to increase that rate correlates with the level of trust and cooperation officers build in the community. \u201cThe police very seldom \u2026 witness a lot of the murders in front of them, so we need the community to give us the information, so we can hold these individuals accountable,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cGang members count on that. They count on the public being fearful of their retaliation.\u201d The hiring push has been dismissed by some of activists in the predominantly black communities most impacted by the violence as a shortsighted attempt to solve the problem. Rev. Ira Acree, a West Side minister who counseled more than a dozen families this year who lost loved ones to the gun violence, said that instead of hiring more cops he'd rather see the city investing in mitigating some of the ills that are leading young men to join gangs and engage in other criminal activity in areas most impacted by the violence. \u201cInstead of pouring resources into hiring cops to arrest the people who are responsible for the violence, it would be more effective to focus on stopping the violence before it happens in the first place,\u201d Acree said. \u201cWe are not going to arrest our way out of this problem. This is a problem that\u2019s been caused by a lack of investment and opportunity for jobs and education in these communities.\u201d Peter Scharf, a criminologist at LSU\u2019s School of Public Health, said it will take time for the addition of detectives to impact the clearance rates. He also was skeptical that more cops on the streets of Chicago \u2014 already one of the biggest departments in the country \u2014 will drive down the murder rate. \u201cHomicide detectives are like fine wines, they take a longtime to mature,\u201d Scharf said. \u201cTo solve murders, you need to develop networks, you need snitches, you need to hone techniques. It\u2019s a brave new world, and it could take years to catch up.\u201d Follow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent\u00a0Aamer Madhani on Twitter:\u00a0 @AamerISmad Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hB4FIE NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual speech to the Federal Assembly at Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow in early December. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U.S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin's decision not to expel U.S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country \u2014 admiring the Russian leader's strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump's ongoing praise of Putin.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise \u2014 a stark break from decades of U.S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U.S. also retweeted Trump's post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram . Article continues after sponsorship Obama Announces Sanctions Against Russia In Response To Alleged Hacking On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U.S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said \"all Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions.\" President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump's praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama's actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions \"overdue\" but \"appropriate\" and said that \"Russia does not share America's interests.\" \"The Russians are not our friends,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a \"good initial step.\" Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U.S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia's economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, \"It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\" He said he would meet with U.S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Putin Says Russia Won't Expel Diplomats In Response To U.S. Sanctions Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. \"He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country,\" Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as \"talented.\" Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. \"I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said, 'Thank you very much' to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,\" Trump said. Trump Tweets Give A Glimpse Into Foreign Policy Approach But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn't going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as \"a leader far more than our president has been\" at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump's debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a \"puppet\" of Russia. Trump shot back: \"No puppet. No puppet. You're the puppet.\" He often criticizes the so-called \"reset\" with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. Bloomberg Politics YouTube With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy \u2014 violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump's staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won't end once he's in the Oval Office. So far, he's outlined his opposition to the United States' abstention from the U.N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U.S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he's often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U.S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia \u2014 perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama's.

    "text": "No US carrier at sea leaves gap in Middle East By Lucas Tomlinson Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 For the next week, not only will there be no U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the Middle East, but there will be no American aircraft carriers deployed at sea anywhere else in the world, despite a host of worldwide threats facing the United States. VIDEO: WHAT THE AIR FORCE NEEDS TO KEEP UP WITH GLOBAL DEMAND The carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her strike group returned to Norfolk, Va., Friday following a seven-month deployment. The Ike launched hundreds of airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria from both the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Two destroyers in the Ike\u2019s strike group also saw combat. The USS Nitze and USS Mason were attacked in the Red Sea when Iranian backed Houthi forces in Yemen launched cruise misisles, which\u00a0were intercepted by the Mason. A retaliatory strike by the Nitze destroyed the radar installations in Yemen in October. IRAN CONDUCTS 'WAR-GAME' EXERCISES, THREATENS TO SHOOT DOWN TRESPASSING AIRCRAFT The Eisenhower\u2019s replacement carrier, the USS George H.W. Bush, was delayed by more than six months in the shipyards and will not be able to replace the Ike until early next year, according to Navy officials. While there is no U.S. aircraft carrier in the\u00a0Middle East right now, there is a large deck U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship\u00a0with thousands of Marines on board as well as helicopters and some jets to\u00a0respond to a crisis, according to officials. In the meantime, the Navy tells Fox News the U.S. military has other jets available to make up for the aircraft carrier gap in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. The Navy can also \u201csurge\u201d a carrier now in port to deploy if necessary. But the absence of a deployed U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, long seen as a symbol of American power projection, is noteworthy.\u00a0It is believed to be the first time since World War II that at least one U.S.\u00a0aircraft carrier has not been deployed. \u201cWe are not going to discuss the timing of operational movements of carrier strike groups into and out of the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility,\u201d said Capt. Terry Shannon, a U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesman, in a statement to Fox News. Centcom is tasked with control over all U.S. forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan. It\u2019s not the first time there\u00a0was a carrier gap in the Middle East. Last fall, the U.S. Navy relied on a\u00a0French aircraft carrier to fill the void when the USS Theodore Roosevelt returned home.\u00a0At the time it was the first gap in carrier coverage in the Middle East since 2007. Other factors contribute to the U.S. Navy not having an aircraft carrier deployed anywhere in the world right now. From 2011 to 2013, the Navy maintained two carriers\u00a0in the Persian Gulf on the orders of Centcom's then-commander, Gen.\u00a0James Mattis, who is now President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary.\u00a0 The congressionally mandated budget cuts\u00a0known as sequestration have also been felt on the waterfront since 2011.\u00a0After billions of dollars were cut from the Navy\u2019s budget, ships such as the George H.W. Bush were forced to prolong their time in the shipyards, which had a ripple effect down the line. If the Bush had left the shipyard on time, she would have relieved the Ike in the Gulf or the Mediterranean, officials tell Fox News. Fox News recently flew out to the USS George H.W. Bush 40 miles off the coast of North Carolina to see the crew's final tuneup. With jets landing every 60\u00a0seconds, the flight deck crew worked on getting the time between \u201ctraps\u201d (landings) down to 40 seconds. Aboard the ship, 18- to 22-year-old men and women work 14 hour days on the flight deck, with little rest -- all this before deploying and potentially dropping live rounds on ISIS. \u201cThis is the military equivalent of spring training, because once we complete this at the end of December, then we'll be going forward and it'll be real forces that we'll be going flying with and against,\u201d said Rear Adm. Kenneth Whitesell, commander, Carrier\u00a0Strike 2, interviewed on his perch above the four-acre flight deck known as \u201cVulture's Row.\u201d In addition to fighting ISIS, the ship's commanding officer says his crew will be ready to deal with a resurgent Russia or China if necessary. \u201cWhile we don't have any emergent or pending conflicts with them, certainly, it is fair to say that we have divergent interests in many cases. and so we need to be prepared to understand how we will react to that if necessary,\u201d said Capt. Will Pennington. There is recent history with this ship. On Aug. 8, 2014, a pair of F-18s from the Bush launched the first airstrikes against ISIS in northern Iraq. Now, two and a half years later, the ship is headed back to the fight against the Islamic State terror group. \u201cThat doesn't mean that three months or six months from now, that will be the priority for our country. So we have to be ready to execute anywhere, anytime, any mission,\u201d said Capt. James McCall, commander of Air Wing 8, in charge of all of the aircraft on board. Fox News' Stephen Scarola contributed to this report. Lucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel. You can follow him on Twitter: @LucasFoxNews Advertisement ",

The actions amounted to the strongest American response yet to a state-sponsored cyberattack. United States intelligence agencies have concluded that the G.R.U., with the approval of the Kremlin, ordered the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, and that the Russian government enabled the publication of the emails it obtained to benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In addition to giving the diplomats and their families 72 hours to leave the country, the measures announced by Mr. Obama imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s two main intelligence services. Washington described the diplomats as intelligence agents working under the cover of diplomacy. Previous sanctions by the United States and its Western allies were levied against broad sectors of the Russian economy and also blacklisted dozens of individuals, some of them close friends of Mr. Putin\u2019s who were considered crucial in the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and in destabilizing Ukraine. The economic sanctions covered three main areas, including blocking Russian access to international credit, cutting off cooperation in advanced oil field technology and stopping arms deals or the sale of dual-use technology. Much of their effect stemmed from the fact that they coincided with a sharp drop in global oil prices, hitting Russia with a double blow. Companies had trouble obtaining credit, driving up the short-term cost of borrowing and compounding a deep recession. Over the long run, the effect is likely to be strongest in the oil sector because it dried up most exploration in difficult areas like the Arctic. Russia responded with sanctions of its own, mostly banning agricultural products and certain foods imported from the West. Mr. Putin and other officials have repeatedly crowed that this resulted in a successful campaign of \u201cimport substitution.\u201d The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Russia also maintained a secret list of Western officials who were no longer allowed into the country. Most, like the former American ambassador Michael McFaul, discovered it only when they applied for visas to Russia. Advertisement Before Mr. Lavrov spoke, Maria Zakharova, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, took to Facebook to denounce the Obama administration, although she spared Mr. Kerry the bulk of her criticism. Ms. Zakharova called the administration \u201ca group of a foreign-policy losers, embittered and narrow-minded.\u201d \u201cToday, America, the American people, were humiliated by their own president,\u201d she wrote. There is a long history of reciprocal expulsions and other measures between the United States and Russia, even after the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. While Mr. Obama framed the new American measures as a response to Russian hacking during the election, the expulsion of Russian diplomats from Washington and San Francisco was described as a response to continued harassment of American diplomats in Russia. Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dimitry S. Peskov denied that any such harassment takes place, but American diplomats tell a different story. Many travel around Moscow in cars with red diplomatic license plates that start with 004 , denoting United States Embassy vehicles. That makes them easy targets for traffic stops. Embassy employees said they were followed as they moved around the city, and that sometimes, when they were not at home, agents would enter and move the furniture around, just to show that they had been there. Some find it unnerving, while others shrug it off as part of the job. One young father said he was just grateful that his children were too small to realize that the family was being followed.

A woman comforts the wife of a man who died in a shooting that left four dead and 12 others wounded at a home on 2900 block of South Rimpau Boulevard in West Adams. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Maya Lau and Maya Lau Contact Reporters Violent crime increased in Los Angeles for the third straight year as police tried to stem a rash of homicides and gang-related shootings while dealing with a growing homeless population. With more than 290 people killed in the city this year, homicides also rose for the third year in a row. Still, the city remains far safer than a decade ago, when 480 people were killed and there were 46% more robberies than this year. According to statistics from the Los Angeles Police Department , robberies were up by 13%, aggravated assaults were up by 10% and rapes were down by 4% through Dec. 17, compared with  last year. Homicides were up by 5%. Overall, violent crime was up by 10% over last year and 38% over two years ago. Property crime also went up for the third consecutive year, with a 4% rise that was driven by double-digit increases in car-related thefts. The upward trend of the last several years marks a reversal of a steady decline that began in the early 1990s , when crime was at all-time highs. In 1992, 1,094 people were killed\u00a0in Los Angeles. Similar trends were evident in the areas policed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, where violent crime was up by 9% and property crime was up by 6% through Nov. 30 . It was the second year in a row that crime increased in sheriff\u2019s department territory, which includes unincorporated parts of the county as well as cities such as Compton and Lancaster that contract for law enforcement services.\u00a0 Elsewhere in the state, crime decreased in some Bay Area cities. San Francisco saw an increase in homicides and rapes, but robberies were down 13% and crime was down 10% overall through the end of November. Through Dec. 18, Oakland had two homicides, compared with nine in 2015 and seven in 2014. Overall, crime in Oakland was down 6%. Early this year, in response to a spike in homicides and shootings, the LAPD sent extraelite Metropolitan Division officers to South Los Angeles and intensified its use of daily crime statistics to identify problem spots. By the time the emergency operation ended on Oct. 1, the rate of violent crime had stabilized in South L.A. But with resources concentrated there, some other parts of the city experienced upticks in crime. Recently, the situation in South L.A. worsened \u2014 October was the worst month of the year for homicides \u2014 and Metro has increased its presence there again, said\u00a0Asst. Chief Michel Moore, who oversees the LAPD\u2019s patrol operations. South Bureau, which includes much of South L.A. as well as the San Pedro area, finished the year with a 6% increase in homicides , 6% more rapes, 10% more robberies and 19% more aggravated assaults. Overall, violent crime in South Bureau was up 15% over last year and 34% over two years ago. The efforts of police officers on the streets have had an effect, but the root causes of crime \u2013 joblessness, homelessness, substance abuse \u2013 are deep and require the community\u2019s help to solve, Moore said. \u201cIt is like fighting fires \u2013 spot fires,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a finite number of resources, and at the end of the day, the LAPD isn\u2019t going to fix this.\u201d The number of shooting victims in Los Angeles \u2013 1,152 as of Dec. 17 -- was up 6% over last year and 23% over two years ago. \u201cAny one of those could have been a homicide by another inch or centimeter,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOur most pressing matter right now is shooting victims.\u201d Crime was up even in some parts of the city that are traditionally considered safe. In West Los Angeles , robberies were up by 16%, and motor vehicle theft was up by 31%. The LAPD\u2019s Topanga Division saw a 41% increase in robberies and a 21% increase in motor vehicle theft. Moore attributed the crime jump in Los Angeles to a combination of factors, including a resurgence in gang violence and the growth in homelessness. He also pointed to criminal justice reforms such as Proposition 47, which was approved by California voters in November 2014 and reduced some drug and property offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. In Los Angeles County, the jail population has decreased, from 18,500 inmates just before Prop. 47 passed to about 16,500 inmates this November. Narcotics arrests have dropped, as busy police officers decide that the time needed to process a case is not worth it. The result, some law enforcement officials say, is that more criminals are now on the streets instead of in jail and are not receiving the drug and mental health treatment the measure had promised. Without the threat of a felony prosecution, they say, defendants are less likely to choose treatment as an alternative to serving time. \u201cUnfortunately, we see that these programs are sold to the voters as having some positive impact, and so far in two years we haven\u2019t seen that positive impact,\u201d said Assistant Sheriff Jacques \u201cAnthony\u201d La Berge, who oversees patrol for the Sheriff\u2019s Department. But supporters of Prop. 47 dispute the theory that crime increases are connected to the measure. Misdemeanors can still result in sentences of up to a year in jail, and it is up to police officers and prosecutors to enforce those penalties, said Michael Romano, a lecturer at Stanford Law School. \u201cThe idea that Prop. 47 has been responsible for an increase in crime in California over the past year or two is fake news, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one shred of evidence supporting the idea that Prop. 47 has had any impact on crime one way or another.\u201d The recent crime increases have also coincided with steep increases in homelessness. The latest homeless survey shows an 11% rise in the city of Los Angeles between January 2016 and the previous year, with a 5.7% jump countywide. Homeless encampments can provide cover for chronic predators, and many homeless people are victims of crime, said Moore of the LAPD. This year in Los Angeles, 13 homicide victims were homeless \u2013 up from six the previous year \u2013 and there was a 23% increase in aggravated assaults in which transients were the victims, Moore said. The LAPD\u2019s Central Division , which includes parts of downtown, skid row and Chinatown, saw a 59% increase in violent crime in 2015. This year, violent crime was down by 5% in Central, which Moore attributed to inroads made by police officers and social workers in homeless camps. But crime statistics can sometimes obscure the realities of living in Los Angeles, where a single police station can serve dozens of square miles and hundreds of thousands of people. Brent Page said his neighborhood of early 20th century Spanish and English Tudor cottages near the Inglewood border defies the image of South L.A. as a dangerous place. At the neighborhood council meetings he leads, which are often attended by officers from the LAPD\u2019s 77th Division, residents typically complain about minor issues such as street vending and illegally parked cars. Page sees violent crime as largely confined to gang circles. \u201cA lot of people on these blocks know each other. They\u2019re like family,\u201d Page said of his neighborhood, Morningside Circle. \u201cI know what the crime stats might say, what the perception might say, but it\u2019s good to talk to people actually breathing and living in an area instead of going to the LAPD website and making generalizations.\u201d In Compton and nearby unincorporated areas, which are policed by the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, homicides were up by 61%, with 37 through the end of November this year compared with 23 last year. Most of the killings were gang-related, according to sheriff\u2019s officials, including that of a 1-year-old girl in her crib who was hit by a bullet likely meant for her father. The spike marks a return to the violence of years past: The Compton area had 32 homicides in 2014 and 40 homicides in 2013 . Capt. Michael Thatcher, who runs the Compton Sheriff\u2019s Station, said an increase in gang conflicts is a likely cause. \u201cI take it personally,\u201d Thatcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility. Every deputy that works in that station understands that that\u2019s something that\u2019s very troubling for us.\u201d \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.
