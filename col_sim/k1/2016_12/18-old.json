(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump brought his \"thank you\" tour to the battleground state of Florida Friday night -- his first time holding a rally in the state since winning the election. The Sunshine State was his most-visited battleground state during the election, spending 19 days campaigning in the state since clinching the nomination May 26. Trump kicked off his rally thanking the \u201cincredible\u201d people of Florida, who he later called out for being \u201cvicious\u201d and violent during the campaign. \"Four weeks ago just prior to, you people were vicious violent, screaming, 'we want the wall,' screaming 'prison, prison, lock her up!' You were going crazy. I mean, you were nasty and mean and vicious and you wanted to win, right?\u201d Trump said at the Central Florida Fairgrounds Complex. \"But now it's much different. Now you're laid back, you're cool, you're mellow, right? You're basking in the glory of victory.\" President-Elect Trump Goes After Obama Press Secretary Josh Earnest in Speech During the campaign, Trump defended his supporters, arguing they should respond if anti-Trump protesters provoked them. \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them , would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,\" Trump said told supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on the day of the state's GOP caucuses. In addition to thanking his supporters, Trump finally identified \"that guy from Utah,\" whom he frequently mentions at his rallies: Former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin . But Trump didn\u2019t exactly call him by his proper name: Trupm referred to McMullin as \"McMuffin\u201d after it was shouted by a supporter in the crowd. \"That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s his name,\" Trump said. \u201cI never heard of this guy before.\u201d Days before the election, McMullin tweeted a photo of himself holding an Egg McMuffin, writing, \u201cMcMuffins for McMuFinn. #McMullinFinn.\u201d \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 5, 2016 Trump did not address President Barack's Obama's news conference, nor Russia or Aleppo. But for the second time in a row, he brought up the need for safe zones to protect refugees. \"So we are going to start using our head. We are going to do things right and try to patch that up and try to help people. We'll build safe Zones,\" Trump ensured his supporters. \"We are going to build safe Zones in Syria. We are going to build safe Zones. And we are going to get the gulf states to pay for the safe Zones and we'll try on help people. We are going to try and we are going to get it done.\" On Saturday, Trump is expected to make the final stop on his \"thank you\" tour in Mobile, Alabama. 0 Shares ",

Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Wonder and Worry, as a Syrian Child Transforms Canada welcomes Syrian refugees like no other country. But for one 10-year-old\u2019s parents, is she leaving too much behind? By CATRIN EINHORN and JODI KANTOR DEC. 17, 2016 TORONTO \u2014 As soon as Bayan Mohammad, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, arrived here last winter, she began her transformation. In her first hour of ice-skating, she managed to glide on her own. She made fast friends with girls different from any she had ever known. New to competitive sports, she propelled herself down the school track so fast that she was soon collecting ribbons. Bayan glued herself to the movie \u201cAnnie,\u201d the ballet \u201cCinderella\u201d and episodes of \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d all stories of metamorphosis. As her English went from halting to chatty, she ticked off everything she hungered to do: An overnight school trip. Gymnastics lessons. Building a snowman \u2014 no, a snow-woman. \u201cI just want to be Canadian,\u201d she said. The volunteers resettling her family \u2014 a group of teachers, pediatricians and other friends and neighbors spurred by devastating images of young refugees and casualties of war \u2014 watched Bayan with wonder. Her parents, Abdullah and Eman Mohammad, a former grocery store owner and a nurse from a rural village, felt both pride and alarm. Coming to Canada with their four children, they had braced themselves for the hostility that so many refugees were encountering around the world, including just across the border, where Donald J. Trump warned of the threat posed by Syrian refugees. Instead, they found a national movement to aid them . Advertisement Continue reading the main story As Syria shattered, everyday citizens, called private sponsors, were adopting the newcomers, donating their time and thousands of dollars to help guide them through their first year. The volunteers attended to the family\u2019s every need: an apartment, doctors, tips on finding a mosque and halal food. The sponsors even applied to bring other family members to Canada \u2014 and still they wanted to know what more they could do. Continue reading the main story The Mohammads were astonished and grateful. But over 10 months, the relationship was reshaping the family, rewriting roles and rules they had always followed. Abdullah and Eman found their marriage on new ground, the fundamental compact between them shifting. Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their now-obliterated life in Syria. On some days, her parents believed that she could meld her old and new identities; on others, they feared her Syrianness was being erased. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan was eager to embrace the regular pastimes of Canadian youth, like ice-skating. Within her first hour, Bayan was gliding on her own, \u201carms outstretched and a smile as wide to match,\u201d said one of her sponsors, Yolanda Mak. Credit Cole Burston for The New York Times If the family had landed in Munich or Minneapolis, they would have encountered new cultural dilemmas, too. But Canada\u2019s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another\u2019s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. \u201cWhat they gave us, a brother wouldn\u2019t even give to his own brother,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said. Still, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons \u2014 which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday? \u201cSponsorship brings the tension between East and West so close,\u201d said Sam Nammoura, a Syrian-Canadian refugee advocate in Calgary, Alberta. The Mohammads had left Syria and then Jordan to safeguard their children \u2014 but once they arrived here, they were bewildered by what they found. Why were teenagers here allowed to stay out past midnight? Did children move away from home at 18 and never look back? How much control did parents even have? \u201cEvery day I have this dilemma,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. \u201cAm I letting the kids do the right thing?\u201d In October, Bayan craved one item above all on her wish list: to join her school\u2019s overnight trip. For three days at the end of the month, the whole fifth grade would travel to an island in Toronto\u2019s harbor, exploring, conducting science experiments and sleeping in dorms. Advertisement \u201cI want to go but my dad said no,\u201d Bayan said over a family lunch of chicken and stuffed cabbage rolls. Her parents felt their children belonged at home; they had never been on a sleepover. \u201cI want to go!\u201d Bayan repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sad because my best friends are going.\u201d By Canadian or American standards, she was being polite: no eye-rolling or accusations. Continue reading the main story Photo Kerry McLorg, center, the organizer of group of sponsors helping to resettle the Mohammad family in Canada, showed the children and their mother how to make gingerbread houses last month. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times But in Syria, children are bound to respect the authority of their parents, even in adulthood. The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,\u201d her mother explained. Bayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group. Meticulous and restrained, Ms. McLorg never wanted to push the Mohammads, and when they asked for her advice, she tended to answer with clinical distance, lest her own preferences show. But she knew Bayan yearned for the adventure. She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl\u2019s integration into Canada. Her two children had gone on the trip years ago and still talked about the traditions \u2014 visiting a lighthouse, telling ghost stories. \u201cEvery kid in Toronto does this,\u201d Ms. McLorg had told Bayan\u2019s parents when they had asked. \u201cAcademically, it\u2019s not important. But socially, it is very important.\u201d Mr. Mohammad told Bayan again: No trip. He was not an immigrant who set out to adapt to a new world; he was a refugee trying to hold on to what had been ripped from him. \u201cWe\u2019re forced to be here,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said later. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, but we\u2019re forced to be here.\u201d Advertisement He still had a shot at preserving the identity he wanted for Bayan, but he and his wife would have to be vigilant, willing to deny their daughter some of what she wanted. \u201cI will do this for her,\u201d he said. \u201cGod help us.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Abdullah Mohammad looked at images of his village near Daraa, Syria, on Google Earth as the rest of the family was making gingerbread houses. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Shifting Family Dynamics Only one thing about Canada seemed to disconcert Bayan: its types of families she had never seen or even imagined. She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. \u201cMy mom and dad, they will not do that,\u201d she declared. The Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband\u2019s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah\u2019s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children. Now she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework. Meanwhile, she found new purpose: helping lead a therapy group for Syrian women coping with trauma and displacement. Standing in front of a whiteboard, she peppered her presentations with motivational statements: \u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d \u201cWhen we work, we are helping society around us, not ourselves alone.\u201d She earned about 70 Canadian dollars for each weekly session. Being in Canada \u201copened new doors for me that I didn\u2019t even know existed,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. Continue reading the main story Photo Clockwise from left, Batoul, Bayan, Mohammad and Ahmad walking home from school. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Her husband, however, was having difficulty. In Syria, he co-owned a grocery store and two butcher shops, and had been the unquestioned head of the household. Now the sponsors were helping support his family, along with government subsidies. While his wife went to one of the therapy groups, he took care of Bayan and the younger children, and he had been helping in the kitchen. \u201cSometimes I feel weak doing these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s job.\u201d He told himself that spending more time with his children would draw them closer. Bayan had ambitions for her father: to learn to swim, to drive, to buy a car with six seats. \u201cI dream, like, all the time we have a big house and a pool,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Mohammad was nowhere near finding work that could support a family of six in an expensive city, and he felt torn about whether he should continue to study English full time or just get the best job he could. \u201cI feel lost,\u201d he had said. Because his wife\u2019s language skills were better, he sometimes was left out of conversations. (The Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, because they feared reprisals against relatives still in Syria. This article uses part of their family name.) If Syria heals, Mr. Mohammad said, he definitely wants to go back. His wife countered: \u201cMy future and my kids\u2019 future is in this country.\u201d We have been reporting on Canada's unusual welcome of Syrian refugees for nearly a year, paying frequent visits to the Mohammad family, the volunteers helping them, and other Syrians and Canadians involved in private sponsorship. Then they laughed. The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil. Mrs. Mohammad\u2019s counseling groups were filled with women whose husbands had turned bitter at the changed circumstances. Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse. The Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband\u2019s authority \u2014 before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one\u2019s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, \u201cflexibility.\u201d Even as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls\u2019 school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone. Now that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter\u2019s life. \u201cI want to try everything here,\u201d Bayan said. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan checked her application of fake blood on Halloween before she went out trick-or-treating. Credit Cole Burston for The New York Times On the day of the school trip, with her classmates off on Toronto Island in a freezing rain, the family moved on to their next cultural debate. \u201cWhat is the meaning of Halloween?\u201d Mrs. Mohammad asked. The holiday was four days away. Bayan burst with answers. It was about being frightened in a fun way, she said, dressing as skeletons and ghosts. \u201cIt has to be something scary,\u201d she explained. She wanted to wear a devil costume. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One of the sponsors had already arranged to take them trick-or-treating. But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead? Just then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family\u2019s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve. Bayan had asked Ms. McLorg to join them for the coming trick-or-treat date, but the sponsor did not realize how Mrs. Mohammad felt. Ms. McLorg was trying to introduce Canadian customs without imposing on the family\u2019s own. \u201cThey should not have to change their essence in order to become Canadian,\u201d Ms. McLorg said later. In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture. In the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess. Abdullah Mohammad headed home early; Bayan pleaded to stay later. Her mother surveyed the spiderwebs and chains lacing the street, watching her children merge into the flowing highway of trick-or-treaters. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan studying the Quran at the school on a recent Sunday when the rest of the family were at a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Memories of Home Two weeks later, Mrs. Mohammad and her two daughters were propelled into a local Walmart by Bayan\u2019s sheer force of will. She longed for a pair of sparkly purple sneakers, and begged, nagged and nearly cried until her mother agreed. As they navigated the aisles, mother and daughters looked like members of two different families. Mrs. Mohammad wore her head scarf, neck-to-toe gown and shawl, while the girls were in leggings and skinny jeans. The question about when Bayan would start covering her head loomed over her and her parents. As they were in Canada, her mother was willing to postpone it until seventh grade. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cNo!\u201d Bayan yelled when she overheard her mother talking about it. She looked ugly with her head covered, she thought. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in grade nine \u2014 maybe,\u201d she said. But the next day, Bayan and her mother slipped inside a building a few blocks from their apartment, where the 10-year-old kicked off the brand-new sneakers and knelt. Her mother draped a thin scarf over her daughter\u2019s head, expertly folding, tucking and pinning until it covered her hair without a strand showing. Photo Eman Mohammad helped her daughter Bayan put on a head scarf before she attended the Islamic school at a local mosque. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times This was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan\u2019s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning; that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss. Sunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head. For the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an 18-year-old whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. \u201cSometimes there are tests in life,\u201d she told the children. \u201cAnd sometimes they break us.\u201d Then she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to break things when they\u2019re all together, right?\u201d Ms. Ali asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly like us.\u201d But it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan\u2019s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at \u201cCat in the Hat\u201d level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school. Other classmates\u2019 parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is foreign-born, a reflection of Canada\u2019s openness to immigrants. In her apartment building, Bayan has friends whose families are from Israel and China. Advertisement Continue reading the main story When her father picked her up, she could not take off her hijab fast enough. During lunch at home, as she chatted in English, he interjected: \u201cArabic!\u201d She continued in a mix of both. When she talked about the stick exercise, her father gave a look of recognition. \u201cI was Bayan\u2019s age when they told me the same story,\u201d he said. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan drawing a heart on the window of her family\u2019s apartment in Toronto. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Their childhoods seemed so disconnected from one another\u2019s. The family left Syria when Bayan was 7 or 8 \u2014 they had foundered in Jordan before coming to Canada \u2014 and her memories of the home where her family had lived for three generations were dimming. She could picture playing hide-and-seek with her cousins by the fountain and grapevines in the courtyard, and recall the way an adjacent garden produced enough mint for the whole neighborhood. But Bayan and her sister could no longer agree on how many olive trees stood there: 20? 100? (Eight, their mother said.) After the Mohammads left Syria, the house next door was shelled or bombed and collapsed on their own home. It was ruined now, the second story gone. The sponsors helped them use Google Maps to try to find what was left, but no one could quite pinpoint it. \u201cI love that house,\u201d Bayan had said a few days before. Suddenly, her confidence and determination kicked in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy siblings. All of us.\u201d Follow Jodi Kantor and Catrin Einhorn on Twitter.

The call alarmed old guard foreign policy experts who said it undermined the United States\u2019 decades-long \u201cOne China\u201d policy that recognizes mainland China over Taiwan. Before the Pentagon announcement, China had indicated that efforts were underway to resolve the issue, saying it was in contact with American counterparts regarding the \"appropriately handling\" of the unmanned underwater glider. However, the one-sentence comment by the country\u2019s foreign ministry offered no details on what discussions were underway or why China on seized the drone, which the Pentagon says was being operated by civilian contractors for oceanic research. The U.S. said it issued a formal diplomatic complaint over the seizure and demanded the drone's return. \"According to (our) understanding, the U.S. and Chinese sides are working on appropriately handling this matter through channels between the two militaries,\" the foreign ministry said in its statement, which was faxed to The Associated Press. China's defense ministry did not immediately respond to questions on the issue. The drone was seized while collecting unclassified scientific data about 57 miles northwest of Subic Bay, near the Philippines in the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, the U.S. Navy said Friday. \"It is ours,\u201d a Navy spokesman said. \u201cIt's clearly marked as ours. We would like it back, and we would like this not to happen again,\" The spokesman also said the drone costs about $150,000 and is largely commercial, off-the-shelf technology. The most recent, significant dispute between the countries\u2019 militaries was perhaps in April 2001 when a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter jet nearly collided about 70 miles from China's Hainan island, which led to the death of a Chinese pilot. Whatever the outcome of the drone incident, the incident is likely to fray the already tense relations between U.S. and China. Beijing was angered by Trump's decision to talk Dec. 2 by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and by his later comments that he did not feel \"bound\u201d by the One China policy, unless the U.S. could gain trade or other benefits from China. China considers the self-governing island its own territory to be recovered by force if it deems necessary. There also have been increased tensions over Beijing's ongoing military buildup in the South China Sea, mainly the development and militarization of man-made shoals and islands aimed at extending China's reach in the strategically vital area through which about $5 trillion in global trade passes annually. In one of the few reports in state media about the drone's seizure, a newspaper published by China's ruling Communist Party cited an unidentified military official as saying that a \"smooth resolution\" to the matter is expected. A Chinese navy ship discovered an \"unidentified device\" Thursday and was checking on it for the sake of maritime safety, the Global Times quoted the official as saying. \"China has received the U.S. request to return the device, communication is open between the relevant departments of the two sides and I believe this matter will obtain a smooth resolution,\" the officer was quoted as saying. In a separate report, the paper quoted retired Chinese admiral Yang Yi as saying China considered itself well within its rights to seize the drone. \"If China needs to take it, we'll take it. (America) can't block us,\" Yang was quoted as saying. Yang said he was unsure of the purpose of seizing the drone, but didn't think the matter qualified as a \"military conflict.\" However, he added that the chances of a confrontation had risen following Trump's recent comments, which were seen as testing China's bottom line on Taiwan and other sensitive issues. \"It's natural for us to take possession of and research for a bit these types of things that America sends to our doorstep,\" Yang said. \"The louder they shout, the more their protests ring hollow.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "By Robert Samuels December 17 at 6:38 PM Follow @newsbysamuels Pressure on members of the country\u2019s electoral college to select someone other than Donald Trump has grown dramatically \u2014 and noisily \u2014 in recent weeks, causing some to waver, but yielding little evidence Trump will fall short when electors convene in most state capitals Monday to cast their votes. Carole Joyce of Arizona expected her role as a GOP elector to be pretty simple: She would meet the others in Phoenix and carry out a vote for Trump, who won the most votes in her state and whom she personally supported. But then came the mail and the emails and the phone calls \u2014 first hundreds, then thousands of voters worrying Trump\u2019s impulsive nature would lead the country into another war. \u201cHonestly, it had an impact,\u201d said Joyce, a 72-year-old Republican state committeewoman. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough funerals. I\u2019m tired of hearing bagpipes. . . . But I signed a loyalty pledge. And that matters.\u201d Such is the life these days for many of the 538\u00a0men and women who are scheduled to meet Monday across the country to carry out what has traditionally been a perfunctory vote after most every presidential election. In this image from video, Electoral College voter Jim Skaggs looks through his mail from people writing him about being an elector in Bowling Green, Ky. (Dylan Lovan/AP) The role of elector has intensified this year, in the wake of a bitter election in which Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of nearly 3 \u00a0million and a secret CIA assessment revealed that Russia interfered to help Trump get elected. Amid the uncertainty caused by Russian influence, 10 electors \u2014 nine Democrats and one Republican \u2014 asked for an intelligence briefing to get more information about Moscow\u2019s role. Their request was endorsed by John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThe administration should brief members of the electoral college on the extent and manner of Russia\u2019s interference in our election before they vote on Dec. 19,\u201d Podesta wrote Thursday in a Washington Post op-ed . The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Friday evening that it would not brief the electors, because it is engaged in a presidentially ordered review of the Russian interference. \u201cOnce the review is complete in the coming weeks, the intelligence community stands ready to brief Congress\u201d and may release findings, the ODNI said in a statement posted to its website. Meanwhile, Joyce and the other 305\u00a0Republican electors who are supposed to cast their votes for Trump have been subject to intense campaigns orchestrated by anti-Trump forces to convince them that they alone can block the reality television star from the White House. Others have targeted Democratic electors, who are supposed to cast votes for Hillary Clinton, to persuade them to switch to a more conventional Republican who could also draw enough support from GOP electors to swoop into office. While there is little sign the efforts will prove successful, the push has unleashed intense pressure on individual electors, who have now been thrust into a sometimes uncomfortable spotlight. Rex Teter, 59, a music teacher and preacher, received about 35,000 emails and 200 letters urging him not to support Donald Trump. (David J. Phillip/AP) Joyce has received emails from \u201cBenjamin Franklin\u201d and \u201cJohn Jay\u201d \u2014 and a Christmas card that read: \u201cPlease, in the name of God, don\u2019t vote for Trump.\u201d The rancor about the role of electors started early in the campaign. In August, Baoky Vu, a GOP activist in Atlanta, said he planned to resign from the job because he was so morally opposed to Trump. He planned to defer his voting responsibility to someone more willing \u2014 an alternate who would be put in place Monday. After the election, Vu started getting phone calls and emails asking him not to resign. He was asked instead to consider joining a coalition of electors hoping to vote against Trump. He declined. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should drag this election out any longer,\u201d Vu said. \u201cAnd can you imagine if the electors overturned the results? If we attempt to change them in anyway, you\u2019ve got these far-right elements that are just going to go haywire.\u201d Mark Hersch, a 60-year-old Chicago-based marketing strategist, joined a group known as the Hamilton Electors, who have been organizing efforts to contact electors and change their minds. Before the election, Hersch said, the most political activism he had ever undertaken was planting a yard sign. He said he believes the goal to deny Trump seems reachable if not probable. Rather than persuade an entire country, he and his allies must find 37\u00a0Republicans willing to vote for someone else, a tipping point at which the responsibility of picking the president would shift to the U.S. House of Representatives. No one knows for sure how many are considering alternate votes; estimates vary from one to 25. The GOP-controlled House could vote for Trump anyway, but those trying to flip voters say there is still value in taking a stand. Hersch said he was inspired to continue to flip electors by the movie \u201c300,\u201d which depicts ancient Sparta\u2019s war against a Persian army that outnumbered them 1,000 to one. \u201cI would like to think we would be successful, but if not, we need to do all we could to prevent this man from being president,\u201d he said. Then he modified a line from the movie: \u201cPrepare your breakfast, and eat hearty, for tonight, we will go to battle. This isn\u2019t 300, but 538.\u201d That \u201cbattle\u201d has intensified as electors draw closer to their convening Monday. Joyce was getting 15\u00a0letters a day and 300\u00a0emails in the days after Nov.\u00a08, but those numbers quickly increased to 50\u00a0and 3,000. Some of them have been form letters, others handwritten. The letters came from Washington state and from China, stuffed with copies of the U.S. Constitution or Alexander Hamilton\u2019s writing in Federalist Paper No. 68, which states that the meeting of the electoral college \u201caffords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u201d On Thursday, Joyce received so many letters that the letter carrier just gave her a U.S. Postal Service bucket filled to the brim. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this is happening to you,\u201d Joyce recalled the letter carrier saying in a phone interview. While some electors have complained of harassment, Joyce shrugged off the mail and placed it all on a sofa decorated with American flag pillows. \u201cThis is America,\u201d she said, adding that most of the messages were thoughtful. \u201cPeople have a right to say what they want.\u201d On Friday, she said, her emails became more positive. The messages were from Republicans, thanking her for taking Trump to the finish line of an arduous process. \u201cHow refreshing!\u201d she said. Although some Democrats (who have in the past five elections lost two in which they won the popular vote) and even Trump himself have questioned the necessity of the electoral college, many opposing Trump have said this election proves just how important it is. Norman Eisen, a former ambassador to the Czech Republic who served as legal counsel to both the Bush and Obama administrations, began telephoning electors to explain that their job is not necessarily to certify the results, but to have a reasonable discussion over whether the public made the right decision. For instance, Eisen, who focused on government ethics in Obama\u2019s White House, noted that Trump could be violating a clause in the Constitution that prevents presidents from receiving gifts and funds from foreign governments; it is unclear whether his businesses do because he has not publicly disclosed his tax returns. In Massachusetts, Republican operative and attorney R.J. Lyman said he didn\u2019t want to harass anyone, so he used his connections to find electors who were willing to chat about the lessons he learned in American history class and at the dinner table. He became one of the few people in America more willing to talk about Hamilton the man than about \u201cHamilton: An American Musical.\u201d The electoral college, he said he tells them, was \u201cnot intended to be a rubber stamp.\u201d Otherwise, he said, the Founding Fathers would have tasked the responsibility to a clerk or simply used the popular vote as a way of choosing a president. \u201cI\u2019m reminding them of their duty to think about their choice in a way that\u2019s consistent with their conscience and the Constitution,\u201d Lyman said. So far, Lyman said, he has identified 20 electors who might be willing to vote \u201cother than their party pledge.\u201d He couldn\u2019t name more than one publicly but insisted that more were out there. Earlier this month, Chris Suprun of Texas became the first Republican elector in a red state that voted for Trump to declare, in a Dec. 5 New York Times column , that he would not cast his electoral vote for Trump. Suprun voted for Cruz in the primary and said he left behind his wallet on Election Day and thus did not vote in the general. Nonetheless, Suprun said, he was willing to vote for Trump in the electoral college until the candidate claimed with no evidence that millions of Clinton supporters voted illegally. Suprun\u2019s public stance has elicited death threats and hate mail, he said. \u201cAs of yesterday, people are calling to say, \u2018Get your ass together, or we\u2019re coming for you,\u2019 \u201d said Suprun, who was the sole Republican elector to ask for an intelligence briefing on Russia. \u201cThey are doing it with their own phone number, not even blocking the number. That\u2019s not been surprising \u2014 look at what Trump says himself.\u201d Vinz Koller, a Democratic elector from Monterey County, Calif., said he read Suprun\u2019s column and started thinking about his own role in the college. It inspired him to support a new theory: If he could persuade other Democrats to abandon their Clinton votes, perhaps he and Republicans could agree on a more conventional choice \u2014 a la Ohio governor and failed candidate John Kasich \u2014 to vote for over Trump. The plan seemed unlikely, he said, but Trump\u2019s candidacy unsettled him so much that he felt he needed to try anything. California is one of 29 states that mandate electors vote for the candidate who won the state, so Koller sued them to continue his plan. \u201cFrankly, this is hard and not something I do lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in partisan politics a long time, and I don\u2019t like voting against my candidate, but I never thought that the country might be unstable until now.\u201d On Thursday evening, he found himself in the Library of Congress. Strolling through its stacks, Koller sought a librarian with one request: Can I see the original Federalist Papers? He looked to see Federalist No. 68, written by Hamilton to describe the need for the electoral college. \u201cWe have been getting a civic lesson we weren\u2019t prepared to get,\u201d Koller said. \u201cThey gave us the fail-safe emergency brake, in case the people got it wrong. And here we are, 200 years later. It\u2019s the last shot we have.\u201d Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Basically they were piling up at 50 mph,\" eyewitness Marvellous Amasiatu said of the 4:45 a.m. pileup on the elevated portion of I-95 in downtown Baltimore near the Washington Boulevard exit. \"Oh my God,\" he said. \"I could see those trailers coming. They had no idea how bad that bridge froze.\" The driver of the tanker truck was killed and one other person died in the pileup, which was sparked by debris from the tanker crash and explosion, Maryland Transportation Authority Police Lt. Kevin Ayd said. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Winter storms and frigid temperatures that have affected large parts of the country have been blamed in 13 deaths since Tuesday and hundreds of car crashes. At least seven people were killed in crashes since Friday night. A third person in Maryland was killed Saturday morning after he stepped out of his car on I-95 to inspect damage from a fender-bender and was struck by a vehicle, Ayd said.

Two separate crashes in Indiana between Friday night and Saturday afternoon left two people dead, and more freezing conditions were expected Saturday night, state police said. Overall state police responded to 380 crashes and 150 slide offs by 2 p.m., police said. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan said \"road conditions in many areas of the state are still extremely dangerous, and all those who can avoid travel should stay off the roads until conditions have improved.\" Parts of Baltimore County and the city one-fifth of an inch of ice was recorded, the National Weather Service said, and near-freezing temperatures were expected in Maryland, extreme northern Virginia and eastern West Virginia Saturday night. Trucks and vehicles are shown in a pile-up involving a fuel tanker which skidded off the an icey 1-95 highway in Baltimore on Dec. 17. Sage Hiller / via Reuters In New Mexico, state police also reported a pileup that included \"approximately 40 vehicles\" on Interstate 40 Saturday morning. According to law enforcement, the roadway is covered in snow and ice, but they have not confirmed that the accident was caused by the inclement conditions and have not reported any deaths or injuries. In St. Louis, the fire department reported more than 50 vehicle accidents and 40 falls. A firefighter was also struck by a vehicle and remains in serious but stable conditions. Two to five inches of snow were reported to have accumulated across the Northeast and a second bout of cold was expected to create icy conditions. The wintry precipitation is expected to taper off, ending by late Sunday after leaving treacherous conditions in the Mid-Atlantic region, forecasters said. \"It's pretty much winding down especially in the Northeast,\" said Senior Weather Channel Meteorologist Dave Houtz. \"There's still a little bit of freezing rain in parts of New England. Most of it is either rain or snow at this point.

    "text": "> Barrels shipped in 2015:\u00a05.2 million > Owner:\u00a0Anheuser-Busch InBev Michelob Ultra is bucking the trend of sales decline among major domestic beer brands. While shipments of industry titans beers like Budweiser, Bud Light, and Coors Light have declined dramatically in the last half decade, Michelob Ultra is gaining popularity faster than nearly any other brew. Americans consumed 5.2 million barrels of Michelob Ultra last year, a 54.8% increase from five years prior. What sets Michelob Ultra apart may be marketing. Introduced to beer drinkers in 2002, Michelob Ultra initially marketed itself as a beer for the diet conscious drinker, containing far fewer carbs than the typical beer. Now the brand\u2019s marketing has shifted focus from the dieter to the fitness fanatic. This year, AB InBev paid between $4.6 million and $5 million for a 30 second Super Bowl spot to run an ad that more closely resembled a sports drink ad than a beer commercial. See the rest of the Top 10: America's Fastest Growing Beer Brands More on the fastest-growing beer brands Sales of once unassailable beers such as Budweiser and Miller High Life have declined by more than 25% from 2010 through 2015. Meanwhile, sales of such beers as Modelo Especial and Stella Artois \u2014 once more marginal brands in the United States \u2014 have more than doubled. Based on five-year increases in U.S. sales, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 fastest growing beers in America. Premium brands such as Michelob Ultra and Coors Banquet, as well as imports, especially from Mexico, dominate the list of beer brands with increasing shipments. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Eric Shepard, executive editor with industry news organization Beer Marketer\u2019s Insights, said, \u201cThere has been significant trade up in the U.S. beer industry.\u201d Drinkers have increasingly chosen craft beers, higher-priced premium brands, wine, or spirits over the traditionally dominant mainstream domestic beer brands. \u201cConsumers trade up for various reasons, whether it\u2019s something that they perceive as being more prestigious, more flavorful, [or] whatever the image issues may be,\u201d Shepard said. Despite their popularity, many of the nation\u2019s fastest growing beer brands would be difficult to distinguish from one another in a blind taste test. Beer critics also generally rate these brands very poorly. As a result, advertising in the mainstream beer industry is essential. A beer like Stella Artois can go from being associated with binge-drinkers and abusive alcoholics (as it was in the early 2000s) to a high-end, classy beverage \u2014 all from advertising and despite an unchanging formula. Of the 10 fastest growing beers in America, four are Mexican imports. Shepard noted changing U.S. demographics as one factor that could explain Mexican beers\u2019 massive growth. Hispanics made up 17.3% of the U.S. population in 2014, much more than their 3.5% share in 1960. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police gather outside a home in the 100 block of West 105th Street, where four people were found dead at the scene and another person was taken to the hospital in critical condition on Dec. 17, 2016. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Deanese Williams-Harris and William Lee Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Four people were shot dead on the scene of an apparent domestic related attack and three other people including a 9-year-old were wounded during Saturday shootings on the South and West sides. The quadruple fatal shooting happened about 12:40 p.m. in the 100 block of West 105th Street at a home in the Fernwood neighborhood, said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. At least five ambulances were sent to the scene after officers were alerted by an anonymous call that several people were shot there, police said. Three men and a woman were pronounced dead at the scene, and a woman in her 20s was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, officials said. Chicago police gather outside a home in the 100 block of West 105th Street, where four people were found dead at the scene and another person was taken to the hospital in critical condition Dec. 17, 2016. Earlier information stated a 2-year-old toddler was wounded but that information was incorrect. Officials later said the child was taken to Roseland Community Hospital for observation, said Jeff Lyle, a Chicago Fire Department spokesman. Lyle said all of the shooting victims were in their 20s. At a news conference about a half block from the scene of the shootings and with more than a dozen relatives looking on, First Deputy Police Supt. Kevin Navarro said authorities received an anonymous 911 call of five people shot at the home. Once they arrived they found two female victims outside of the home -- one dead, the other critically injured. Inside, police found three male victims dead, Navarro said. The two female victims were found on the front porch. Police did not provide ages or relationships for any of the victims, but said the shooting appeared domestic-related. Police also found a two-year-old child who was unharmed. The child was taken to a hospital for observation. \"At this point the case is still unfolding,\" Navarro said. \"We have more questions than answers.\" Family says at least four people lived in the house but they're tight lipped about who the shooter is, but confirmed he escaped in a red truck.\u00a0\u00a0 Navarro said a weapon was not recovered at the scene. Police were expected to be at the scene for much the night as forensic specialist comb through the home for details. Police were also expected to check for any past incidences of trouble at the home, Navarro said. After the news conference, relatives of the suspected dead struggled with the tragedy, saying they still didn't know which of their family members were killed as authorities hadn't yet released the identities of the dead. They suspected that one of their cousins was among the dead because he had not answered the phone all day. \"(Why would) somebody do something like this? Just another senseless act of violence,\" said Melvin Jackson. \"This is a massacre, man. Who would do something like this?\" Police offered no information about the gunman. As word of the deaths spread, family members began to arrive at the crime scene, some in thin jackets, waiting behind the crime scene tape waiting for news about their loved ones. Relatives said neighbors told them that they didn't hear gunshots but did see a red truck speed backwards up the one way street just before the child fled the home. About 10 minutes before the Fernwood\u00a0attack, a 21-year-old man was seriously wounded outside of a funeral home on the West Side. Two people were in police custody in that attack, officials said.\u00a0The shootings were not related. Most recently, a 9-year-old boy was shot and seriously hurt on the West Side about 4:25 p.m. Paramedics were called to the 5900 block of West Rice Street in the Austin\u00a0neighborhood for the boy who had been shot. Police said the shooting was accidental and self-inflicted. The boy was taken to Loyola\u00a0University Medical Center in Maywood where he was listed in serious condition. No one was in custody for the 105th Street slayings, and police were investigating.

Trump! Trump!\u201d the president-elect crowed his approval of the state, saying voters \u201cpropelled\u201d the campaign to \u201ca historic win for the American worker and the American people.\u201d The president-elect relived what he counted among his campaign\u2019s greatest hits, including his defeat of third-party candidate Evan McMullin in Utah , his scant spending on political advertising and the frenetic pace of his rallies in the home stretch of the election. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s worked harder in the last months of a presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referencing himself. Trump evades discussion of Russia's election tampering But the spotlight wasn\u2019t all on the president-elect. Mr. Trump also brought out a parade of surrogates during his own speech, calling to the stage Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now a top adviser to his transition team. (She told rally-goers that the president-elect had won \u201cover 2,600 counties\u201d and 306 electoral votes.) He also had spokeswoman Hope Hicks join him at the podium (she smiled and wished the crowd a \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d) and, earlier, his first Senate backer, Jeff Sessions, took over the mic. Later, Mr. Trump gave his account of Nov. 8, claiming that halfway through election night he wanted to switch venues with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, which had rented out a convention center on the west side of Manhattan. \u201cI took sort of a small ballroom because if I lost, I wanted to get out,\u201d Mr. Trump jokingly explained. He added that his campaign had even offered to buy the fireworks ordered by the Clinton team because \u201cI found fireworks just don\u2019t work when you lose.\u201d The last stop on what was billed as a \u201cThank You\u201d tour, Mobile was an appropriate place for the president-elect to reminisce on his year-and-a-half long journey to the White House: It was in the state where Mr. Trump won one of his largest margins of victory, where Sessions (now his attorney general pick) first publicly jumped aboard the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d train and where, as the president-elect said, people began to think \u201csomething was really going on there.\u201d But the jaunt through Mobile was also an attempt to look toward Jan. 20, his inauguration, and the four years to come.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to the old days,\u201d the president-elect said, with an economic agenda that included the promise to \u201cbuy American and hire American.\u201d \u201cMade in the USA, remember?\u201d he asked. Mr. Trump once again promised to build \u201ca great wall\u201d that would stop illegal immigration \u201cfor good.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cwe will have doors in that wall,\u201d where people can come through -- legally -- \u201cby the tens of thousands.\u201d \u00a0 The president-elect did not address the latest reports of Russia hacking during the U.S. election season. At the conclusion, Mr. Trump addressed first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s recent remarks about a hopeless America, pushing back on the notion and saying \u201cwe have tremendous hope.\u201d \u201cI actually think she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out,\u201d he said, referring to an interview with Oprah Winfrey that\u2019s scheduled to be broadcast Monday. \u201cNow we\u2019re feeling what not having hope feels like. You know? Hope is necessary. It\u2019s a necessary concept,\u201d Mrs. Obama told Winfrey in a clip released in advance. \u201cAnd Barack didn\u2019t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes. I mean, he and I and so many believe that if you -- what else do you have if you don\u2019t have hope?\u201d The president-elect countered that by saying of his administration and the country as a whole: \u201cWe have tremendous potential.\u201d \u201cWe are going to be so successful as a country again,\u201d he vowed. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "December 17, 20169:00 AM ET Molly Solomon Fermin Domingo, 61, worked at HC&S; for 40 years. He drove in the last truck hauler of sugar cane on the plantation's final day. Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio Fermin Domingo, 61, climbs up the side of a sugar cane hauler for the last time. The haul truck driver has worked at Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar (HC&S;) company for the past 40 years, harvesting and hauling sugar cane to the mill. This is the last of Hawaii's sugar mills, and it too, is closing. Domingo and hundreds of other co-workers have gathered to wrap up the final harvest and say goodbye to a crop that shaped the islands. Domingo fires up the engine and the truck slowly rumbles toward the mill, its tires churning through thick mud. It stops at the base of a conveyor belt and a giant crane hooks the final load of Maui sugar cane. Cheers break out from the hundreds of workers standing nearby. \"I came here when I was 18 from the Philippines,\" says Domingo. \"I joined the company and I started harvesting. It was fun working out there, but we're at the end and I don't know what to do later.\" Workers at the mill look on as the last piece of the final harvest drives up to the factory to be processed. Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio For over a century, the sugar industry dominated Hawaii's economy. But that changed in recent decades as the industry struggled to keep up with the mechanization in mills on mainland U.S. That and rising labor costs have caused Hawaii's sugar mills to shut down, shrinking the industry to this one last mill. Article continues after sponsorship Bill Cavilla is one of 675 workers who will lose their jobs once this operation closes by the end of the year. \"It's just an emotional thing,\" he says. \"Just realizing it's going to end.\" The sugar mill started harvesting cane on Maui 145 years ago, around the time sugarcane plantations began taking over the islands' landscapes when the Civil War cut off sugar supplies from the south. Then, in the 1870s, the U.S. signed a \"reciprocity treaty\" with the Kingdom of Hawaii. The United States agreed to cut tariffs on Hawaiian sugar and rice, in exchange for Hawaii cutting tariffs on imported cotton and other American products. The spread of sugarcane plantations on the islands brought immigrant labor in waves from China, Japan and the Philippines. A smaller number of people also came from Portugal, Puerto Rico, Scotland and Germany. That immigration laid the foundation for the multicultural population of today's Hawaii. Some of the remaining workers at the mill stand in front of the last hauler truck of Hawaiian sugar cane. Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio \"My grandparents emigrated from Japan to work in the plantations more than 100 years ago, like so many others,\" says David Ige, Governor of Hawaii, who has briefly stopped by to attend the last harvest at HC&S;, along with some 500 other people. The company has been financially struggling for decades, reporting losses of $30 million last year. Like other sugar companies, it blames the losses on rising costs from labor and transportation to land, as well as increased competition from producers such as Brazil. The HC&S; mill is owned by Alexander & Baldwin (A&B;), a real estate and agricultural company in the state. Ige says the state supports A&B;'s plan to keep HC&S; lands in agriculture. The company currently has about 140 acres of biofuel crops in the ground, as it transitions toward diversified agriculture. A&B; also recently expanded its cattle pasturelands to 4,000 acres. Back at the mill, Howard Scott Pereira, a retired worker, has come by to say his final goodbyes. The 78-year-old brought his daughter Colleen who says the story of sugar is what brought her family to Hawai'i. \"Our families came when it was a territory to work the plantations,\" she says. \"So we had to come.\" Fields of sorghum, one of the trial crops planted by Alexander & Baldwin. The company plans to replace the sugar cane acreage with diversified agriculture and cattle pasture.

Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio The remaining workers at the mill process the last harvest, producing sugar for shipping to mainland U.S. The last shipment of sugar, a little more than 30,000 tons, is scheduled to reach Crockett, California in the coming weeks.

The L.A. County Department of Health Services was one of more than a dozen county departments targeted in a May 2016 cyberattack disclosed this week. A mural at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center. The L.A. County Department of Health Services was one of more than a dozen county departments targeted in a May 2016 cyberattack disclosed this week. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Tony Barboza Contact Reporter Confidential health\u00a0data or personal information of more than 750,000 people may have been accessed in\u00a0a cyberattack on Los Angeles County employees in May that led to charges this week against a Nigerian national, officials have disclosed. The May 13 attack targeted 1,000 county employees from several departments\u00a0with a phishing email. The message\u00a0tricked 108\u00a0employees\u00a0into providing usernames and passwords to their accounts,\u00a0some of which contained\u00a0confidential patient or client information, officials said. Most of the 756,000 people whose information may have been accessed had\u00a0contact with the Department of Health Services, according to the county. A smaller amount of confidential information\u00a0from more than a dozen other county departments also was compromised. Among the data potentially accessed\u00a0were names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, financial information and medical records\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including diagnoses and treatment history \u2014\u00a0of clients, patients or others who received services from county departments. Officials said there is no evidence that confidential information has been circulated, sold or released. The county learned of the attack the day after it happened, and officials said they responded with security measures and a criminal investigation. But the county waited more than seven months to inform the public , citing an exemption under state law that allows delayed notification to protect ongoing investigations. Cyber investigators with the L.A. County district attorney\u2019s office traced the attack to Nigeria. Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant Thursday, accusing Austin Kelvin Onaghinor, 37,\u00a0of launching the attack and charged him with nine felony counts, including unauthorized computer access and identity theft. Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey said in a statement, \u201cMy office will work aggressively to bring this criminal hacker and others to Los Angeles County where they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d These kinds of phishing attacks are on the rise throughout society \u2014 and the County has not been immune from that trend. \u2014 Joel Sappell, L.A. County spokesman Once charges were filed, county officials began mailing notices Thursday to people whose information may have been accessed. The county\u2019s Chief Executive Office said it delayed public notification of the attack at the request of the district attorney\u2019s office \u201cto protect the confidentiality of the sensitive, ongoing investigation and prevent broader public harm.\u201d Notifying the public of the\u00a0attack earlier \u201cmay have hindered\u201d the investigation, the county said in a notice about the data breach Friday. In response to the attack, officials said they have strengthened security measures on county\u00a0email accounts and enhanced employee training to guard against a growing number of cyber intrusions. \u201cThese kinds of phishing attacks are on the rise throughout society \u2014 and the county has not \u00a0been immune from that trend,\u201d county spokesman Joel Sappell said in a statement. In February, officials disclosed that the\u00a0Department of Health Services had been targeted in a smaller-scale\u00a0\u201cransomware\u201d attack , a type of malware that\u00a0cuts off users\u2019\u00a0access to files or threatens to destroy them unless a ransom is paid. The district attorney\u2019s office said in a news release Friday that its cyber investigation team has protected the county from prior attacks, \u201chas investigated 85 cases, involving hundreds of thousands of potential victims\u00a0and has resulted in several successful prosecutions and restitution totaling nearly $4 million.\u201d The county is offering a year of\u00a0free credit and identity-theft monitoring for people\u00a0affected by the May phishing attack and has set up a website and call center for those seeking information: (855) 330-6368.
