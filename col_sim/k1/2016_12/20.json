(Chicago Tribune) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Donald Trump started racking up electoral votes Monday even as anti-Trump protesters across the country tried to persuade the Electoral College to prevent him from winning the White House. Trump didn't lose any electors with votes counted in a half dozen states he won Nov. 8: Tennessee, West Virginia, Arkansas, South Carolina, Mississippi and Oklahoma. Initial results gave Trump 44 votes and Democrat Hillary Clinton, 10. It takes 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency. Electors were voting throughout the day and there was scant evidence many GOP electors would peel away from their Election Day winner. More than three dozen would have to abandon him to complicate his path to the presidency. More than 200 demonstrators braved freezing temperatures at Pennsylvania's capitol, chanting, \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" and \"No treason, no Trump!\" Protesters also gathered in Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and other states. The protesters, however, were unlikely to persuade the Electoral College to dump Trump. An Associated Press survey of electors found very little appetite to vote for alternative candidates. Only one Republican said he would vote for someone else. Republican electors have been deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many of the emails are part of coordinated campaigns. \"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They are generally freaked out. They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\" Electoral college meets amid push to stop Trump Protests are planned for state capitals, but they are unlikely to persuade the electoral college to dump Trump. Protests are planned for state capitals, but they are unlikely to persuade the electoral college to dump Trump. See more videos Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\" A joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results of the Electoral College vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner \u2014 almost certainly Trump \u2014 will be sworn in on Jan. 20. The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. The AP tried to reach all of the electors and interviewed more than 330 of them, finding widespread aggravation among Democrats with the electoral process, but little expectation Trump would be derailed.

German media reported that the truck jumped the sidewalk and drove into the crowd around wooden stands at the market, which was set up around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Germany has not seen a large-scale terror attack, such as the ones earlier this year in Brussels and Nice, in southern France, but authorities have said that the country remains on alert. ",

(Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential electors in all 50 states are meeting Monday to officially cast their votes for Donald Trump as GOP electors are under intense pressure to oppose him. Electors in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania\u00a0voted during the morning and early afternoon and parceled out their state's votes with no rogue electors. Trump won Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Democrat Hillary Clinton carried Illinois and New Hampshire. \u00a0 Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there\u2019s little indication of a significant rebellion. The meetings, which occur\u00a0more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, is typically a formality. This year, the nation\u2019s 538 electors are in the spotlight as Trump critics mount a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state have been released throughout the day Monday. Read more: GOP electors targeted with $500K ad buy in final anti-Trump push Electors have received thousands of emails and phone calls\u00a0arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nation\u2019s history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls. Thousands of protesters have gathered outside state capitols throughout the country. \"Many Republican electors have told me they're open to sending the vote for President to the U.S. House of Representatives, which has happened twice in our nation's history,\u201d said Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who is not voting for Trump . \u201cFrankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,\" he said. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe. \u00a0 Yet, so far, Suprun is the only Republican to publicly say he\u2019ll vote against Trump. Opponents would need 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov.\u00a0John Kasich, has told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would kick to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which is unlikely to override their own party\u2019s president. Further, the\u00a0Republican National Committee\u00a0has been conducting a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump. Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump got 306 of the 538 electoral votes \u2014 the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a state\u2019s congressional delegation. Read more: A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote It\u2019s the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gore\u2019s loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadn\u2019t been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote. The coalition of outside groups, calling themselves the Hamilton Electors, ran $500,000 in television ads over the weekend featuring actors\u00a0including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing quoting from the Federalist Papers about the need for electors to exercise their conscience in casting their votes. Yet a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows 46% of voters say electors should be bound to vote for the candidate that won their state, to 34% who think electors shouldn\u2019t be bound if they have significant concerns about the winner. Trump himself took to Twitter on Sunday night to express his frustration, saying his supporters would be \u201cscorned and called terrible names\u201d if the situation was reversed. If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2016 The polls also show how significantly false information has spread as Trump recently declared that he won in \u201ca massive landslide victory.\u201d Half of Republicans think Trump won the popular vote, according to recent survey of 1,011 Americans conducted by Qualtrics. Trump lost the popular vote by a by a wider margin than any president in modern history .\u00a0Among Republicans without college education, the share was 60%. Posted!

    "text": "At least nine people were killed and dozens injured when a truck plowed through a crowd at a popular Christmas market in Berlin, police said Wenzel said the truck was registered in Poland, but that police were still investigating where it came from and who the driver is. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawki said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. Zurawki said that \u201cthey must have done something to my driver,\u201d he told TVN24. Berlin\u2019s top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and said that reports the truck may have been hijacked were \u201cpure speculation.\u201d\u00a0 5:22 p.m. ET -- The White House released a statement Monday evening about the truck plowing through the crowd at the Berlin Christmas market.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas Market in Berlin, Germany, which has killed and wounded dozens,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cWe send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded.\u201d 4:53 p.m. ET -- Berlin police are encouraging people to use a Facebook safety check to learn if loved ones are safe after a truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market.\u00a0 The tweet linked out to Facebook, which has set up checks periodically after natural disasters and attacks around the world.\u00a0 But police also asked people to refrain from spreading videos to protect privacy \u00a04:40 p.m. ET --\u00a0Germany\u2019s justice minister says that federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, are taking over the investigation after a truck rammed into a Christmas market in Berlin.\u00a0 Heiko Maas didn\u2019t give further details in a post on Twitter Monday night about the \u201cshocking news\u201d from the capital. He added: \u201cwe are mourning with the relatives\u201d of the victims. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere says that he\u2019s in constant touch with security authorities, but didn\u2019t give any indication in a statement whether they believe the incident was an attack. BERLIN - At least nine people were killed and dozens injured when\u00a0a truck plowed through a crowd at a popular Christmas market in Berlin late Monday, police said. Polizei Berlin said that a suspect had been arrested near the scene. A passenger in the truck died at the scene, although it\u2019s not clear how or when that happened yet. The identity of the passenger and arrested suspect have not been released. Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel told ZDF television that the suspect arrested was believed to be the truck driver. The incident happened in Breitscheidplatz, a major square in the center of the German capital, that is normally filled this time of year with people celebrating the holiday season.\u00a0 While officials haven\u2019t stated whether it was an purposeful attack or an accident, CBS News correspondent Charlie D\u2019Agata reports that witnesses said there was little doubt it was a deliberate attack based on the way it jumped the curb. \u00a0 Additionally, the incident happened just a few weeks after the U.S. State Department warned that various terrorist groups were going to be targeting outdoor markets and festivals this holiday season throughout Europe. A large Scania truck with its windshield smashed out could be seen on the sidewalk alongside the market, although officials have not yet confirmed that it was the truck used in the attack. \u00a0 A firefighter walks in front of a truck at the site of an accident at a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS Witness Shandana A. Durrani said she was walking and texting when the truck entered the market about 20 feet away. She said she heard some popping but wasn\u2019t sure if it was a gun or not. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t stopped to check my phone, I would have been hit,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cEveryone went scurrying. So many people hurt.\u201d She said the way the market was laid out, \u201cthere was just no place to run so a lot of us hid behind other stalls.\u201d Every year, the city of Berlin hosts a Christmas market there near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue. The incident happened at the foot of the landmark Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church, which was kept as a ruin after World War II.\u00a0 Paramedics work at the site of an accident at a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Several  people in the U.S. intelligence community told CBS News that the situation in Berlin has all the hallmarks of a terror attack. Officials here in the U.S. say it bears similarities to the recent terror attack in Nice, France \u00a0- in which 86 people were killed and hundreds injured - and is what terror groups have been calling for their followers to do. German police have recently rounded up a series of people for planning attacks on Christmas markets, and even detained last week a 12-year-old Iraqi boy for attempting to set off a nail bomb in one of them. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports the U.S. State Department issued a warning in late November specifically cautioning Americans in Europe to \u201cexercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets.\u201d The release cited ISIS, al Qaeda and \u201ctheir affiliates\u201d as planning attacks using \u201cconventional and non-conventional weapons\u201d focusing on the upcoming holiday season and \u201cassociated events.\u201d Many in Germany have been fearful of a rise in terrorism since the country took in more than a million migrants and refugees last year, mostly fleeing conflict in the Mideast.\u00a0 German prosecutors were already investigating a 12-year-old boy who allegedly attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen last week. A survivor of an accident with a Polish truck is rescued on a stretcher near a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch The German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources. In the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported. Police said it would have burned but would not have exploded. Stephan Meyer, the parliamentary spokesman on security issues for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said the boy apparently had turned rapidly to Islamic extremism. \u201cThis shows how quickly the radicalization of a young person, a child, can take place,\u201d he said. In the Nice attack, officials said Mohamed Lahouaiyej Bouhlel deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into thick crowds on the French Riviera celebrating the country\u2019s independence day. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Electoral College Members Meeting Across the Country to Cast Votes By Meghan Keneally Dec 19, 2016, 12:56 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Presidential Electors to Cast Their Votes 0 Shares Email The 538 electors are meeting today to cast their votes in the last step of the presidential election . But what is usually a formality has taken on new significance this year with Donald Trump 's election and calls for electors to defect. In order to win the election, candidates need to reach 270 Electoral College votes. Trump reached that mark, garnering 306 electoral votes on Nov. 8 compared to Hillary Clinton \u2019s 232 votes, although he trails her in the popular vote. Electoral College: What to Know About Monday's Vote Over the past six weeks, left-leaning groups have called for electors to break rules that require them to vote in a way reflective of their states\u2019 popular votes, a move that would make them \u201cfaithless electors.\ufffd? Electors are not bound by the Constitution or federal law to vote according to the popular vote of their state. Thirty states have laws that require electors to do, but those laws have not been scrutinized, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Activist Michael Moore has offered to pay the fines of those who choose to break with their states' vote. One of the biggest concerns among some electors is the role of Russian hackers ahead of the election, and the potential impact that the revelations from the stolen emails had. All but one of the 80 electors who have called for classified briefings on Russia\u2019s suspected hacking are already pledged to Clinton. The gap between the results of the popular vote and the Electoral College tally has also left some electors unhappy, with Clinton garnering some 2.8 million votes more than Trump. Only one elector who is pledged to Trump -\u2013 Chris Suprun from Texas -\u2013 has said that he won\u2019t be voting for Trump today. And one elector from Maine said he plans to vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Clinton. One elector will likely be voting for Clinton is her husband, former President Bill Clinton , will be casting his vote in New York. Clinton won the state by a large margin. The Electoral College vote won\u2019t be formalized until Jan. 6, when Congress counts the ballots. Additional reporting by Shushannah Walshe, MaryAlice Parks and Lauren Pearle. 0 Shares ",

Got it (Nicki DeMarco,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) By David Filipov , Kareem Fahim and Liz Sly December 19 at 6:11 PM Follow @davidfilipov Follow @kfahim Follow @LizSly MOSCOW \u2014 A Turkish police officer who angrily denounced the bloodshed in Syria killed the Russian ambassador to Turkey in Ankara on Monday, shooting the diplomat in front of a room full of horrified spectators at an art gallery in an assassination captured on video and quickly shared around the world. As the ambassador, Andrei Karlov, lay on the floor, the assailant, still waving his gun, screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo! Don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d\u00a0 The shooting was among the most brazen retaliatory attacks yet on Russia since Moscow entered the war in Syria on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, and unleashed a bombardment on Aleppo that has drawn international condemnation for what observers on the ground\u00a0have called indiscriminate attacks on civilians.\u00a0 But in Moscow, where the Kremlin has maintained that its aerial sorties and missile attacks have exclusively targeted \u201cterrorists,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry called the shooting \u201ca terrorist attack,\u201d and President Vladi\u00admir Putin called it a\u00a0\u201cprovocation aimed at rupturing ties between Russia and Turkey.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe only answer to the murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey must be the intensification of the struggle against terrorism,\u201d Putin said in nationally televised remarks.\u00a0\u201cAnd the bandits will feel it.\u201d 1 of 7 What the scene of the fatal shooting in Turkey looked like View Photos A gunman in Turkey killed Russia\u2019s ambassador at a photo exhibit. Caption A gunman in Turkey killed Russia\u2019s ambassador at a photo exhibit. \u00a0Dec. 19, 2016 Turkish police secure the area near an art gallery where Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, was fatally shot. Umit Bektas/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Putin ordered his major crime investigative unit to work with Turkish authorities, who identified the gunman as 22-year old Mevlut Mert Altintas, an officer with the riot police. In the video, Altintas, dressed incongruously in a black suit and tie, shouts out, \u201cWe are those who pledged jihad to Mohamed.\u201d Referring to Syria, he added, \u201cEvery single person who has a share in this atrocity will pay for it!\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0Several other people were wounded in the attack, which came as Karlov was speaking at the opening of an exhibit of Russian photos, but their identities were not immediately made public. [ Gallery: Scenes from Aleppo ] Altintas was killed in a shootout with police at the gallery, but Russian authorities vowed\u00a0to reveal a larger plot \u2014 and some in Moscow suggested that the West was to blame for its support of moderate rebel factions in Syria.\u00a0 Putin stopped short of that, saying only,\u00a0\u201cWe need to know who guided the hand of the murderer.\u201d The assassination was Turkey\u2019s third major attack in less than 10 days, and followed months of deadly violence \u2014 including a failed coup attempt and a suicide attack on Istanbul\u2019s international airport \u2014 that has highlighted the threats facing Erdogan\u2019s government and left the country reeling from a sense of siege. The attacks have reflected a convergence of crises that Turkey, a NATO member and major ally of the United States, has been forced to weather over the last few years. They include the spillover from the war in neighboring Syria, a failed peace deal with Kurdish militants and a domestic challenge from a shadowy network tied to a Turkish preacher living in the United States.\u00a0 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has successfully seized on the crises to consolidate his own authority. His government has moved forcefully against Kurdish and Islamist militants as well as followers of the preacher, Fethullah Gulen.\u00a0 It was not clear whether the Altintas, the assassin, fit into any of those categories. The interior minister said Altintas hailed from a town near Izmir, on the Aegean coast, and had been on the force for two and half years. Some pro-government commentators tried to brand him as a follower of Gulen, while his shouted manifesto after the shooting suggested, at the very least, he was acting out of anger at the carnage in Syria.\u00a0 In a television address hours after the shooting, Erdogan also condemned the assassination as \u201ca provocation\u201d aimed at disrupting warming ties between Turkey and Russia. Erdogan, who has been a leading regional opponent of the Syrian government, also defended Turkey\u2019s cooperation with Syria\u2019s sponsor, Russia, saying that it aimed to \u201cfind a solution for the humanitarian crisis in Syria\u201d and \u201c to stop the oppression in Aleppo.\u201d Erdogan and Putin, two strongmen with global aspirations, have found common ground in recent months in their desire to secure an end to the Syrian war that would guarantee their long-term influence at a time when U.S. diplomacy has collapsed. Their foreign ministers, as well as their counterpart from Iran, which backs Assad, are planning to meet Tuesday in Moscow to negotiating a settlement to the Syrian war that would exclude the United States and assert the three powers as the region\u2019s most vital players.\u00a0 Russia and Turkey\u2019s newfound cooperation over Syria was exemplified by\u00a0 the deal they brokered last week for the evacuation of besieged people from the last few blocks of rebel held territory in eastern Aleppo. The statements by Putin and Erdogan suggested that the assassination may not disrupt the budding convergence of interests between Moscow and Ankara. Until last summer, the two presidents had been bitter rivals over Syria, supporting opposite sides in the war and embroiled in recriminations over the shoot-down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet in November 2015. [ How the Russia-Turkish rivalry shaped the world ] Those circumstances have led some Russian politicians to accuse the West of complicity in the attacks.\u00a0 \u201cThey are afraid of that alliance, it\u2019s a counterweight to the European Union and NATO,\u201d said Vladi\u00admir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist politician whose often outlandish remarks on foreign policy are sometimes seen as a trial balloon for things the Kremlin would rather not say. Many players risk losing out in any Russian-Turkish deal over the future of Syria, including the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition, extremists with the Islamic State,\u00a0and Syria\u2019s al-Qaeda affiliate. The United States, meanwhile, joined other nations in condemning the shooting.\u00a0 \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, the Russian people, and with the other victims who were injured in this shooting,\u201d Secretary of State John F. Kerry said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe stand ready to offer assistance to Russia and Turkey as they investigate this despicable attack, which was also an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world. President-elect Donald Trump also issued a statement condemning the killing. Karlov started his diplomatic career during the Soviet era in 1976 and took the post in Ankara in July 2013, according to the embassy\u2019s website. Putin referred to him as a \u201cbrilliant diplomat\u201d who \u201chad excellent relations with the leadership of Turkey and other political forces.\u201d The incident could spur even more vigorous efforts between Russia and Turkey to secure their role as Syria\u2019s main power brokers and negotiate a settlement to the war on their terms. Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, said that any fallout \u201cwill entirely depend on Russia\u2019s reaction.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAll indications thus far is that they will retain the relations they have built with Turkey since the rapprochement a couple of months ago,\u201d he added. The recent cease-fire cobbled together was to Russia\u2019s long-term benefit in Syria, while also addressing Turkey\u2019s real concern about civilian casualties, Stein said.\u00a0 Fahim reported from Cairo, Sly from Beirut.

    "text": "Twitter Donald J. Trump will be the next president of the United States. That's been the case since Nov. 8, when Trump won 306 electoral votes, despite losing the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million. And on Monday, the result was ratified by Electoral College voters, who gathered in state capitols across the United States to formally vote for president. 5 Things You Should Know About The Electoral College Trump secured 304 electoral votes \u2014 two fewer than he earned in November, according to the Associated Press, which tracked results from capitol to capitol. That was despite a pitched effort by some on the left who wrote letters to Trump electors trying to persuade them to switch their votes or not vote at all and keep Trump short of the 270 needed. Not only did it not happen, but more electors tried to defect from Hillary Clinton Monday than from Trump, by a count of seven to two, as of Monday afternoon. Three Democratic electors in Maine, Minnesota, and Colorado tried to vote for candidates other than Clinton. The electors' votes, however, were disallowed because of state rules binding them to the statewide popular vote winner. Four more electors in Washington state defected from Clinton. Three voted for Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American who gained some notoriety for her protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Breaking 4 \"faithless electors\" break ranks in Washington state electoral college vote. 3 vote for Colin Powell, one for Faith Spotted Eagle \u2014 Ed Pilkington (@Edpilkington) December 19, 2016 Some of the Democratic electors tried to vote for Sanders. Others, including the Powell voters in Washington, were attempting to promote alternate Republican candidates that the House of Representatives could theoretically elect as president instead of Trump. The Electoral College gathering is usually a formality \u2014 a chance for political activists to gather amid pomp and circumstance to formalize their party's victory in each state. Article continues after sponsorship MAILBAG: Could 'Faithless Electors' Keep Donald Trump Out Of The White House? But the fact Clinton won the national popular vote by such a large margin, combined with the unconventional and unpredictable \u2014 and to many, threatening \u2014 way that Trump carried himself before and after winning the White House, led to an unprecedented effort to lobby electors to vote for someone else. Electors found themselves inundated by letters, petitions, tweets and Facebook posts, urging them to cast a ballot for an alternative candidate. Many people behind the lobbying campaign cited a Federalist Paper written by Alexander Hamilton, which frames the Electoral College as a safeguard against \"foreign powers\" that try to \"gain an improper ascendant in our councils\" \u2014 a potentially relevant line, in the midst of revelations that Russia attempted to disrupt this year's election by hacking and releasing Democratic emails. Hollywood celebrities even got in on the act, recording video pleas to electors. But, unsurprisingly, that effort had no effect on Trump electors. Just in: Maine elector David Bright voting for @BernieSanders today. #mepolitics pic.twitter.com/AMPUkNog3e \u2014 Michael Shepherd (@mikeshepherdME) December 19, 2016 \"They don't understand us,\" said Pennsylvania elector Ash Khare. \"I received over 70,000 emails. I received over 5,000 letters. I received over 500 phone calls at all times of day and night.\" But Khare, like most electors, is a longtime Republican political activist who was proud to cast a ballot for Trump. MN elector Muhammad Abdurrahman is deemed a \"faithless\" elector. Is dismissed and replaced. \u2014 Brian Bakst (@Stowydad) December 19, 2016 \"I've been an elector since 1996,\" Khare told Harrisburg public radio station WITF. \"But I've never been asked to do anything because we never won since 1988.\" Maine elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would cast a ballot for Sanders. But Bright ultimately changed his vote to Clinton, after his initial ballot was ruled out of order. A Minnesota elector, Muhammad Abdurrahman, tried to vote Sanders, according to Minnesota Public Radio reporter Brian Bakst. He was replaced by another elector who cast a ballot for Clinton. Two Texas electors defected from Trump \u2014 one went for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the other for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The Kasich defector, Chris Suprun, told The Hill beforehand his plans. Another Texas elector, Art Cisneros, resigned instead of voting for Trump. He spoke to NPR earlier this month. Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Mark Makela/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Mark Makela/Getty Images Many Republican electors dismissed the pleas to \"vote their conscience,\" pointing out that their consciences were perfectly fine with Trump. With protesters heckling from the gallery of Pennsylvania's House chamber, Pennsylvania elector Robert Gleason seemed to pointedly respond to their efforts. \"My fellow electors,\" Gleason said, \"let us always remember this shared moment when we stood up for our constitutional system, followed our conscience, answered the call of Pennsylvania voters, and did our part by electing the next president and vice president of the United States, Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\" On Monday night, Trump issued a statement saying, \"today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy.\" In fact, in nearly 80 percent of previous presidential elections, the winning candidate earned a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump. There are two more steps in the process. States will submit a \"certificate of vote\" to the Federal Register by Dec. 28. Then, on Jan. 6, Congress will formally tally the Electoral College's votes in a joint session and make it official. ",

Mike Pence afterward tweeted \"congratulations\" to his running mate while saying he was \"honored & humbled\" to be officially elected the next vice president.\u00a0 Republican National Committee Co-Chair Sharon Day\u00a0urged Trump\u2019s detractors to stop fighting his election, now that his victory is affirmed. \u201cThis historic election is now officially over and I look forward to President-elect Trump taking the oath of office in January,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cFor the good of the country, Democrats must stop their cynical attempts to undermine the legitimacy of this election, which Donald Trump won decisively in the Electoral College with more votes than any Republican since 1988.\u201d\u00a0 Elector antics were few and far between throughout the day, with most the disruptions occurring on the Democratic side. A Democratic elector in Maine tried to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders, but switched to Clinton after it was ruled improper. Another who tried to vote for Sanders in Minnesota was replaced; a Colorado elector who tried to back Ohio Gov. John Kasich likewise was replaced. One of the biggest deviations was in Washington state, where three electors voted for Colin Powell and one voted for \u201cFaith Spotted Eagle;\u201d the remaining eight went to Clinton, the state\u2019s winner. \u00a0 It marked the first time in four decades the state's electors broke from the popular vote. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman vowed to work with the state attorney general and charge the four unfaithful electors with a violation of Washington state civil law. Such violations carry a fine up to $1,000. With Trump\u2019s win now secured, a joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results. Trump\u2019s clear Electoral College victory could serve to deter any further last-ditch efforts to effectively nullify his November win and prevent his inauguration, though the battle may shift next to his Cabinet picks. \u00a0 Few expected the \u201cfaithless elector\u201d push to imperil Trump\u2019s victory on Monday. Only one Republican elector \u2013 Texas\u2019 Chris Suprun \u2013 publicly stated he would vote for an alternative candidate. (He backed Kasich, while another Texas elector used his ballot to vote for former congressman Ron Paul.) More than three dozen Republicans would have had to abandon Trump to complicate his path to the presidency. But GOP electors still faced immense pressure -- with some even receiving threats -- from Trump foes in the run-up to Monday\u2019s Electoral College vote. Those urging disorder in state capitals often cited Clinton\u2019s popular-vote win, by roughly 2.6 million votes, over Trump in November. Celebrities made public appeals to electors to use the arcane process to upend Trump\u2019s victory, as some Democratic electors tried to persuade their Republican counterparts to defect. Reports that U.S. intelligence officials determined Russia interfered in the election to boost Trump \u2013 findings disputed by Trump himself \u2013 only fueled efforts to wield the Electoral College vote as a political circuit-breaker. As electors met, thousands of protesters descended on state capitals Monday in one last push to convince Trump voters to change their minds. In Arizona, dozens of protesters gathered outside the meeting site, marching around the Capitol mall and carrying signs that said, \"Stop Trump.\"\u00a0More than 200 demonstrators gathered at Pennsylvania's Capitol, chanting, \"No treason, no Trump!\" Both states, and dozens of others, cast their electoral votes for Trump anyway. In Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant dismissed attempts to sway Republican electors. \"This idea \u2026 that we want to change the electors\u2019 minds who have been dedicated to Donald Trump very early in the process I think is just misguided,\u201d he said. If nothing else, the furor over Monday\u2019s proceedings has served to re-acquaint Americans with a process that few pay attention to every four years. The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. To be elected president, the winner must get at least half plus one -- or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins that state's popular vote. Maine and Nebraska award them by congressional district. After a joint session of Congress certifies the results on Jan. 6, the next president will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Trump already is nearly done naming his Cabinet appointees, as he prepares for confirmation hearings and the inauguration ceremonies, in addition to his first 100 days agenda. Despite the transition process being well underway, Republican electors said they were deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support the billionaire businessman in the days and weeks leading up to Monday\u2019s proceedings. Many of the emails were part of coordinated campaigns. \"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\" Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\" Arizona elector Robert Graham told Fox News on Saturday that the state\u2019s 11 electors received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he\u2019s received information that some of the other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat. \u201cIt\u2019s out of hand when you have such \u2026 a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\u201d said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \u201cThe Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "text": "Dec. 19, 2016, 2:25 p.m. Trump officially gets 270th electoral vote, sealing his election as president (Associated Press) Donald Trump has obtained the required 270 electoral votes\u00a0to become president. Although electors in dozens of states still have to vote, the electoral balloting in Texas put Trump over the majority threshold, according to a state-by-state tally by the Associated Press. Thirty-six of the state's electors voted for Trump, one for John Kasich and one for Ron Paul . The next, and last, official step in the electoral process is for Congress to count the votes. Under the procedure set out by the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, that formal process is scheduled for Jan. 6. Some anti-Trump activists had hoped against hope that they could persuade electors in states that voted for Trump to defect, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Electors are nearly all party loyalists. Additionally, they faced more than two centuries of tradition\u00a0and, in some states, legal obligations\u00a0that called for them to cast their ballots according to which candidate won the popular vote in their states. No\u00a0defectors have ever changed the result of a presidential election. Four\u00a0electors today successfully defected in Washington state. Instead of voting for Hillary Clinton, who won the state's popular vote,\u00a0three electors voted\u00a0for former secretary of State\u00a0Colin Powell and one voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, an environmental activist.\u00a0Electors in two other states who tried to vote against the state's winner were replaced with alternates. There may be additional defections in the remaining states, but since Trump now has a majority of the electoral votes, those would\u00a0not be enough to change the result. Latest updates ",

    "text": "Dec 19 2016, 5:50 pm ET Electoral College Vote Seals Trump White House Victory by Andrew Rafferty advertisement The Electoral College formalized Donald Trump's election victory on Monday despite protests around the country to encourage GOP electors to abandon the Republican. The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House. Interest in the normally mundane voting process spiked this year as opposition to Trump continues to fester, fueled by Clinton's success in capturing over 2.6 million more votes than her Republican opponent.

Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump. And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump. An elector in both Maine and Minnesota attempted to cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary. However state laws requiring electors to follow the statewide vote invalidated both efforts. Only one Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, publically pledged not to vote for Trump despite his state heavily favoring the president-elect last month. One other Texas elector also abandoned Trump in the final vote. Play ",
