Protesters wait Friday outside Chicago Public Schools headquarters, where Black Lives Matter Youth met with city officials and Marist's principal. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The fathers of two girls expelled from Marist High School after being accused of sending racist text messages have filed a lawsuit against the private Southwest Side school that claims another teenager altered the texts. The lawsuit was filed in Cook County on Monday, one month after Indianapolis resident Joshua Beal, 25, was allegedly shot to death by a Chicago police officer in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood, where Marist is located. The shooting led to protests by both Black Lives Matter and pro-police demonstrators. Days later, in a group text message exchange between more than 30 students, a discussion began about the impact of the police shooting and the resulting Black Lives Matter protests would have on classes at Marist. During the exchange, someone allegedly wrote \"I f------ hate n------.\" Screenshots of the exchange were later posted to Twitter. The lawyer handling the lawsuit, which was filed anonymously under the names John Roe and John Doe, claims the images were doctored. \"According to my clients, another student, who particularly doesn't like one of my clients, somehow edited some of these chats to make it look more incriminating than it was. It appeared to be more of an outwardly racially hate-filled statement when the context was removed,\" attorney Steven Glink said in an interview Tuesday. \"It's a personal vendetta.\" Marist expelled the two girls, whose names have not been released. Three other students were also either suspended or expelled, according to the lawsuit. School representatives said they could not comment because of the pending litigation. ",

The car was driving fast, but not so fast as to draw attention. That was essential. The lives of the two men in the front seat depended on their ability to keep a low profile and pass through undetected. In the passenger seat, Khaleel Al-Dhaki was focused on the secret mission he was leading to rescue a Yazidi woman and her child, both of whom were taken by ISIS and dragged into Mosul. \"This kind of operation can't be done during daytime,\" he later told NBC News. \"We are basically going in there to kidnap them back from ISIS.\" Khaleel AlDhaki filmed as he coordinated the secret rescue mission of Leila and her three-year-old son. Marc Smith / NBC News Al-Dhaki, a lawyer by training, runs a small team of activists who regularly make dangerous trips into ISIS territory to rescue Yazidi women, members of a non-Muslim minority that live mostly in northern Iraq. \"Saving a soul is the best thing a man can do,\" Al-Dhaki said. \"You get more motivated when you watch them meeting their families. I can't describe the moment of the reunion. We devote our whole lives to rescuing these women.\" Related: Yazidi Women Tell of Rape and Enslavement at Hands of ISIS Al-Dhaki estimates ISIS kidnapped around 7,000 Yazidis and that roughly 3,000 of them managed to escape on their own or were ransomed out of bondage. The fate of 1,000 Yazidi men remains unknown, he adds. That leaves, by his calculation, some 3,000 Yazidi women and children like Leila and Ahmed in ISIS' hands.

Yazidi women, sometimes with their children, were taken as sex slaves. In 2015, ISIS' propaganda magazine, Dabiq, boasted about reviving the ancient practice of slavery. But ISIS is now under intense pressure. Its last stronghold in Iraq, the city of Mosul, is surrounded by Iraqi and Kurdish forces who are elbowing their way in with close support and guidance from U.S. troops. Amid the offensive, Al-Dhaki was sneaking into Mosul to steal the hostages from ISIS. Related: ISIS Mines Pose 'Unprecedented' Threat to Families in Mosul He had arranged to pick up a 23-year-old woman and her 3-year-old son. Although he shared her real name with NBC News, al-Dhaki asked that she be called \"Leila\" \u2014 for her safety and the safety of other Yazidis held by ISIS. Leila had managed to leave her captor's home and go with her son to a safe house that al-Dhaki's team had secured for them. Leila spoke to NBC News of her \"marriage\" to an ISIS fighter, the rape and the abuse she went through while in ISIS captivity. Marc Smith / NBC News Now, outside that safe house, Leila and her son were climbing into the car. She was wearing a headscarf that left her face uncovered. She appeared terrified and sat silently as the car passed other vehicles along the road, each one potentially driven by an ISIS fighter. The boy, whom NBC News is calling \"Ahmed,\" slept in his mother's arms in the backseat. The extraction was a success. Relatives were waiting to receive Leila and Ahmed once they were safely out of ISIS territory. They cried, hugged and kissed one another before driving into Kurdish-held territory near the Turkish border, far away from ISIS. Leila and her son had been gone for two-and-a-half years. Silent and still terrorized by the horrors of ISIS, Leila is now back with her family in northern Iraq. Marc Smith / NBC News \"They took my husband away from me and gave me to an ISIS fighter. They married me to him,\" she told NBC News. Leila is now a refugee living with relatives in a tented camp. Her own village is still occupied by ISIS. Related: Amal Clooney Takes on ISIS for Persecuted Yazidis Leila spoke hesitantly, struggling to finish her sentences. She described how, after the trauma of being separated from her husband and being forced to marry another man, she was \"resold\" twice again to other ISIS radicals. ISIS fighters seemed to trade Yazidi women like baseball cards. Leila's last rapist was a squat, thickly-built Iraqi fighter with an unkempt beard that fell to his chest. His wife was also an ISIS fanatic. \"I hated her even more than him,\" Leila said. \"She would beat my son.\" Children 'Not the Same' As Leila spoke, Ahmed was crying and throwing whatever he picked up from the carpet covering the tent's floor. For most of his life, Ahmed had been surrounded by violent armed men. To prevent Leila from escaping, her ISIS captor would take Ahmed with him when he went to ISIS headquarters, where acts of savage brutality were carried out. Once the the Mosul offensive began, Leila said her captor and his wife wore explosive suicide vests in their home, ready to kill and die if U.S.-backed Iraqi troops came knocking. How had all of this shaped Ahmed during his formative years? Al-Dhaki said many of the Yazidi children he has rescued remain troubled. \"They need help. They are showing signs of violence. They are not the same as before,\" he said. Leila said that Ahmed had seen beheading videos and passed by the body of a crucified man on the street. She doesn't know what he saw during those long hours at ISIS headquarters. The night of her rescue from ISIS Leila reunited with some of her and her husband's relatives who had also been previously rescued from ISIS captivity. Marc Smith / NBC News As Leila spoke about the past from her new home, Ahmed walked back inside the tent after briefly going outside to play with other children. He came back carrying a pair of scissors. Leila went over and tried to pry the scissors from his hands. Ahmed screamed and cried. \"I'll slaughter you,\" he told his mother. Al-Dhaki said another Yadizi boy he'd rescued had tried to slit his sister's throat, apparently mimicking something he had seen ISIS fighters do. Richard Engel ",

Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi leaves a  Catholic hospice in Cesano Boscone on May 9, 2014, after serving his first day of community service for tax fraud. Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi leaves a  Catholic hospice in Cesano Boscone on May 9, 2014, after serving his first day of community service for tax fraud. Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images He was a flamboyant, alpha-male billionaire who said things no career politician ever would \u2014 someone who promised to use his business savvy to reform the system and bring back jobs. Voters believed that his great wealth insulated him from corruption, because he couldn't be bought. But his administration was marked by criminal investigations and crony capitalism. Italian Prime Minister Silivo Berlusconi was \u2014 until Donald Trump came along \u2014 the best known example of a certain type of wealthy businessman who decides to go into politics, promising that, as an outsider, he is uniquely qualified to shake up the system, says Darrell West , vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Trump's Loans From Troubled German Bank Pose Conflict Of Interest \"Most of the time, they win, and for exactly the same reason that Trump did, which is [that] people like business people. They think they know how to create jobs and run the economy. It's a kind of white-knight phenomenon,\" West says. In the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Bidzina \"Boris\" Ivanishvili formed his own political party and was elected prime minister in 2012 after the sitting leader threatened to join NATO, West notes. At the time, Ivanishvili was worth more than $5 billion, about a third of his country's annual economic output. Other immensely wealthy people who have been elected to office include Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , as well as regional and local politicians in Austria, France, Australia and the Philippines. Many of these politicians succeed by assembling unconventional coalitions and displaying a willingness to think outside the box, West says. But in some cases, their immense wealth can become a problem. \"Over time, people notice that they're not separating their personal businesses from the government,\" West says. \"There is corruption. Their friends are getting rich. And by the end, they almost always suffer a big fall in popularity.\" Enlarge this image Thailand's deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra (left) and his wife Pojaman greeted supporters on arrival at a court in Bangkok in July 2008.

He was convicted on conflict of interest charges and lives in self-imposed exile. Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty Images Berlusconi came to office bragging that his wealth made him incorruptible, says Alexander Stille , author of The Sack of Rome: How a Beautiful European Country with a Fabled History and a Storied Culture Was Taken Over by a Man Named Silvio Berlusconi. But the Italian leader had a history of bribery and corruption, and his business interests were a lot more tenuous than anyone knew, Stille says. Article continues after sponsorship Once elected, Berlusconi set about trying to derail investigations into his conduct by rewriting Italy's penal code and giving immunity to business associates. He even made sure members of his defense team were elected to parliament, Stille says. \"It was a situation where the conflict of interest was massive and entered into some of the most important business of the Italian state,\" Stille says. Despite numerous corruption investigations and trials, Berlusconi clung to power for nine years total, resigning in 2011 after his party lost a parliamentary majority. He has since been convicted of tax fraud and abuse of power, though the latter conviction was subsequently overturned. The Berlusconi case illustrates what happens when politicians can pursue policies that benefit them financially, and underscores the need to set up strong firewalls between elected leaders and their business interests, says Meredith McGehee of Issue One , a group that works to get money out of politics. \"Those places where you've had these kinds of businessmen as leaders and they have not taken steps to take care of these conflicts \u2014 their administrations have become bogged down in scandal,\" McGehee says. Trump Sold Stocks In June, Lifting Some But Not All Conflicts Of Interest It also highlights some of the problems that could face President-elect Trump, who has said he will \"separate\" from his business operations, but so far provided no details. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said Tuesday that the president-elect sold all his stock holdings back in June. A federal disclosure form Trump filed in May suggests his shares were worth in the tens of millions of dollars, a fraction of his multi-billion-dollar fortune, which is largely made up of commercial real estate and golf courses. Trump's business holdings are widely expected to become an ethics minefield, presenting the new chief executive with numerous conflicts of interest . McGehee notes that the United States has often held itself up as a paradigm of clean government, lecturing other countries about the need for strong bribery laws and an independent legal system. Even the appearance of conflict of interest by the Trump administration threatens to undermine that, she says. \"The United States has been the shining light on these issues and has been respected around the world for how you deal with these conflicts,\" she says. \"And I would hate to see us lose that leadership.\" ",

(Dec. 5) AP It's not exactly a war of words, but China and Donald Trump are going after each other in public media. Chinese state media denounced the U.S. president-elect as a \"diplomatic rookie\" on Tuesday, hitting him for his phone call with the leader of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, and his subsequent comments about China's government. \"Provoking friction and messing up China-US relations won't help 'make America great again,'\" said a front-page opinion piece in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, reports the AFP wire service . The Global Times'\u00a0Chinese edition hit Trump\u00a0for his \"inability to keep his mouth shut,\" and his \"provocation and falsehoods,\" according to AFP. Trump said Tsai called him to congratulate him on his election; others in the president-elect's orbit described the call as part of an effort to re-calibrate the relationship with China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province. After China protested the Taiwan call, Trump hit back Sunday night in a pair of tweets. \"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!\" Trump said. ",

Gen. Michael Flynn -- was forced out of the transition efforts amid controversy over a fake news story that he pushed on Twitter. \"The younger Michael Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early on in the transition process,\" Trump team spokesman Jason Miller said, adding that he is \"no longer involved with the transition efforts.\" The decision came from President-elect Donald Trump himself, two Trump transition officials said. Flynn Jr. is accused of pushing the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory in a flood of tweets Sunday and Monday, prompted by gunplay at Ping Pong Comet Pizza in Washington, D.C. The suspect in that case allegedly went to the eatery to investigate what turned out to be a fake news story involving Hillary Clinton and campaign manager John Podesta . ",

    "text": "Anti-Trumpers trying to sow chaos in Electoral College Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Amid a rowdy recount push in battleground states, anti-Donald Trump forces are escalating efforts to invalidate his election on another front: the Electoral College. The people who technically choose the next president will gather on Dec. 19 to, presumably, make the results of the Nov. 8 presidential election official. Trump won 306 electoral votes in the election, well above the 270 needed to defeat Hillary Clinton and claim the White House. But even as Clinton herself has conceded and joined President Obama in urging a smooth transition of power, a group of electors from Colorado and Washington known as the \u201cHamilton Electors\u201d is trying to persuade other electors to unite behind a Republican alternative to Trump. On Monday, they peeled off one Republican. Chris Suprun, from Texas, said he won't cast one of his state's 38 electoral votes for Trump because \"I am here to elect a president, not a king.\" Suprun previously indicated he would support Trump. But he now says the president-elect's postelection attacks on the First Amendment, as well as the billionaire businessman's continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas, changed his mind. The anti-Trump electors, however, face a very steep climb. In total, they would need to persuade 37 electors to either abstain from voting or switch their vote from Trump to someone else. This would throw the vote for president to the House of Representatives. Texas law doesn't mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state's presidential election, which Trump won by nine percentage points over Clinton. But a majority of states bind their electors to the state\u2019s popular-vote winner, complicating efforts to switch those votes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a binding position,\u201d Cherilyn Eagar, a Utah elector, told The Salt Lake Tribune of the law in her state, dismissing efforts to get fellow electors to defect from Trump. The same newspaper notes that some attorney groups have offered to defend electors who try to defy the will of their states. Politico reported Monday that advocates of the latest stop-Trump plan have been in touch with Clinton allies, though Clinton and her campaign have not commented on the plan. Clinton likewise has not gotten behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s efforts to pursue a recount in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The plan for Electoral College chaos doesn\u2019t necessarily hold promise for Clinton anyway. Anti-Trump electors are pushing for members of the Electoral College to support a Republican alternative in order to bring Trump\u2019s number down \u2013 not elevate Clinton\u2019s. According to Politico , Democratic electors backing the push are leaning toward Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for president, as the likely alternative. Suprun said he \u201cwould have to strongly consider someone like Kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together.\u201d Suprun said he was waiting to see if other electors revolt and rally behind a Trump alternative like Kasich. \"I'm looking for someone we can all unify behind,\" he said. The Kasich camp is pushing back on efforts to put forward his name on Dec. 19. Adviser John Weaver told Politico: \u201cThere\u2019s no question Trump won enough votes in the states to receive over 270 votes when the members of the Electoral College meet.\u201d He voiced confidence the Electoral College \u201cwill affirm this when it gathers later this month.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "text": "Authorities have begun identifying the victims of a deadly warehouse fire that claimed the lives of 36 people Mayor Libby Schaaf deflected questions about whether more aggressive action by authorities could have prevented the tragedy at the building known as the Ghost Ship. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and prosecutors said they are looking into the possibility of criminal charges.\u00a0 The Alameda County Coroner\u2019s Bureau released the names late Tuesday of 9 more victims who have been positively identified.\u00a0 The news release issued by the city of Oakland says the nine were men and women in their 20s and 30s, and most came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Authorities say all but one of the 36 people who died have been identified. Most, but not all of those who have been identified, have been publicly named. The local sheriff, who is also the coroner, told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud he doesn\u2019t believe there are more bodies inside.\u00a0 The building itself is so compromised that work here is dangerous and they\u2019re getting much-needed help from some heavy machinery. Crews brought in a large crane to help comb through the charred rubble where the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d once stood as a criminal investigation begins. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at two things: one is whether or not there is any criminal liability attached to this fire and secondly, if there is criminal liability, against whom,\u201d said Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley. \u00a0 O\u2019Malley said potential charges could range from involuntary manslaughter to murder.\u00a0 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says it is looking at the possibility that a refrigerator or other appliance was the source of the fire.\u00a0 Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge of the ATF\u2019s San Francisco office, said it\u2019s too early to say for sure a refrigerator caused the blaze, but she said it was a potential source of ignition. Snyder said investigators are looking at anything electrical on the first floor of the warehouse near where the fire started. Record searches and interviews by The Associated Press indicate that the couple who leased the warehouse and turned it into living spaces and artists\u2019 studios, Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison, were already under scrutiny by several agencies. Some of those agencies had been told or could have seen for themselves that the family of five and their dozens of artist tenants were living in a warehouse that had no permit to operate as a living space and allegedly had no proper kitchen, electricity, adequate fire exits or solid stairs.\u00a0 Almena, 46, is on probation for receiving stolen property, an Airstream trailer he was accused of stealing and stashing at the warehouse. The terms of his probation allowed authorities to enter his home to search without a warrant, records show. Child welfare workers had taken away the couple\u2019s three children in mid-2015 but returned them by this past summer, despite the illegal conditions at the warehouse and the children being hungry, infested with lice and frequently truant, Micah Allison\u2019s father and other acquaintances said. Almena confirmed in a 2015 document that child welfare workers visited the warehouse at least twice. Child welfare authorities refused to comment on the family, citing privacy laws. In returning the children, the authorities set certain conditions, including that the youngsters be out of the warehouse during the many parties held there, according to those who knew the couple. On the night of the fire, Allison and the three children had checked into an Oakland hotel, according to Almena. All of them survived. Almena said in a TV interview that he had little involvement in the party and had gone to the hotel as well.\u00a0 Almena told the \u201cToday Show\u201d on Tuesday that he was \u201cincredibly sorry.\u201d \u00a0 Almena said he started the community in the warehouse as a dream for the arts and performing arts, but, he said, sometimes \u201cyour dream is bigger than your pocketbook.\u201d He said he signed a lease for the building that \u201cwas to city standards supposedly.\u201d Almena said he lived in the warehouse with his family and other residents, but said he didn\u2019t make a profit. He said, \u201cThis is not profit; this is loss. This is a mass grave.\u201d ",

By Drew Harwell and Rosalind S. Helderman December 6 at 12:36 PM Follow @drewharwell Follow @PostRoz President-elect Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June, his spokesman said Tuesday, a move that could have created a cash windfall as he ramped up to begin a costly general election presidential campaign that at the time he claimed he would personally support with \u201cmajor contributions.\u201d The sell-off could help address conflict-of-interest worries about his stock portfolio, a sizable part of Trump\u2019s financial life that was worth roughly as much as $40 million as of December 2015, a May disclosure filing shows. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio, the May filing shows, included shares in a number of banks, oil giants and other companies with business pending before the U.S. government and whose value could rise due to Trump\u2019s decisions in office. Those stock holdings, ethics advisers said, offered a potentially troublesome facet of Trump\u2019s private finances that could entangle his public decision-making. Beyond comments to The Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since the May filing. Trump spokesman Jason Miller, who told The Post about Trump\u2019s stock sale Tuesday morning, did not immediately answer why Trump had sold the shares, how much he sold them for, or whether he has bought anything since. Trump will not be required by law to file another personal financial disclosure until May 2018. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) [ Trump\u2019s stock holdings may give him a personal stake in rules on banks and oil firms ] Trump\u2019s campaign had given no indication of the sale in the five months since it apparently took place in June. As president, Trump will be subject to the STOCK Act, a law passed in 2012 that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1,000 within 45 days. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio, which is separate from his broader real estate and branding businesses, included stocks and bonds invested in companies such as Apple, AT&T, ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs. The June stock sale would have coincided with a point when Trump was pouring money into his presidential campaign. During the Republican primary, Trump loaned his campaign $47 million of his own money. In June, as the general election began, he formally forgave the loan and began making cash infusions to his campaign, first donating $2 million on June 22. Trump then gave $2 million a month between July and August before donating $10 million in October. Much of Trump\u2019s campaign was ultimately funded by other donors. In all, Trump gave his campaign $66 million, federal filings show \u2013 short of the $100 million that he repeatedly claimed he was spending on his race. Miller, the Trump spokesman, told The Post about Trump\u2019s stock sale Tuesday morning, following Trump\u2019s criticism of aviation giant Boeing. Trump tweeted that Boeing\u2019s federal contract to build new Air Force One jets should be cancelled because costs had gone \u201cout of control.\u201d Trump was once a company shareholder, tweeting in January 2013 that \u201c@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!\u201d Trump reported owning between $50,000 and $100,000 of Boeing stock in the May filing. In the three years between Trump\u2019s original tweet about buying Boeing stock and June 2016, Boeing\u2019s share price climbed about 70 percent. Trump has tweeted that he will separate from his own business, the Trump Organization, but has provided no additional details other than promising to hold a press event on Dec. 15 to outline his plans. [ Citing high cost, Trump says Boeing\u2019s contract to build Air Force One should be canceled ] Trump told Fox Business News in August that he was dumping stocks because he predicted the market was crashing, saying, \u201cI did invest, and I got out, and it was actually very good timing.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s August comments, stock prices have generally been on the rise since June. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post last month that Trump had in June also sold his shares in Energy Transfer Partners, the majority stakeholder in the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline project that has drawn protests from environmentalists and Native Americans. The Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday it would not allow the oil pipeline to be drilled further near a Standing Rock Sioux reservation, but Trump has said he supported completing the pipeline. The company\u2019s chief executive was a major campaign donor to Trump, but its stock had declined in value in the face of protests. Trump said in a financial filing released in May 2015 that he owned between $500,000 and $1 million worth of stock in Energy Transfer Partners. By May 2016, when Trump updated his annual filing, the value of the holding had fallen to less than $50,000. Norm Eisen, who served as ethics counselor to President Obama and has criticized Trump over his conflicts, said it would be \u201cabsolutely a step in the right direction\u201d if Trump had sold his stock holdings in June, divesting himself of ownership in companies whose fates could be tied to his policies. But he added that it is now important to know how Trump spent the money he earned from the sale. \u201cWe need to know, has he put them in conflict free assets ... or has he bought other stocks or assets that would create new conflicts?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more reason that we need a prompt and full financial disclosure. If he did liquidate all his stocks, what did he do with the money? What bank is the money in? What did he buy? It\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d He called this the latest example of the tension between Trump\u2019s promise to drain the swamp and how he has managed his own business conflicts. \u201cThe swamp draining should begin with Trump\u2019s own wetlands,\u201d Eisen said.

Mr. Dole also assisted in Taiwan\u2019s successful efforts to include language favorable to it in the Republican Party platform, according to the documents. Mr. Dole\u2019s firm received $140,000 from May to October for the work, according to the documents. The documents suggest that President-elect Trump\u2019s decision to take a telephone call from the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, was less a ham-handed diplomatic gaffe and more the result of a well-orchestrated plan by Taiwan, one that sought to use the election of a new president to deepen its relationship with the United States \u2014 with an assist from a seasoned lobbyist well versed in the machinery of Washington.

A federal judge said Tuesday that she would approve San Bernardino's bankruptcy plan, meaning that the city can begin the process of emerging from four years of bankruptcy. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Paloma Esquivel Contact Reporter After four long, painful years, San Bernardino will soon emerge from bankruptcy. A federal judge on Tuesday said she\u00a0 would approve the city\u2019s plan to exit bankruptcy, marking a major step toward the end of the process for San Bernardino. \u201cThis is a very important day for the city,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Jury said. \u201cThe city came in in financial chaos and it\u2019s leaving in a much better place.\u201d Approval of the city\u2019s plan to pay its creditors and restructure its finances was touted by officials as the start of a new era for the battered Inland Empire city, even as it faces a daunting list of challenges to truly right itself. \u201cWe want our residents to know, and we want people who would invest in the city ... to know we\u2019ve cleared this burden and we\u2019re ready to do business,\u201d City Manager Mark Scott said. The plan includes a list of agreements with employees, retirees, municipal bondholders and many others. The confirmation order is tentative until being made official, which Jury said would be done within 30 days. \u201cNobody is walking away from this proceeding without having taken some kind of hit,\u201d Jury said. The plan, the broad outlines of which have been known for some time, preserves pension benefits for employees and retirees, though employees will have to contribute more to their pension plans and benefits were modified for new employees. Retirees will lose some health benefits they were promised. Meanwhile, some bondholders and unsecured creditors will be paid only 1% of what they were owed. The vast majority of the city\u2019s creditors have agreed to the plan. But during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, a number of lawyers for clients with federal civil rights lawsuits against the city that allege police abuse argued forcefully against it. Those clients stand to get 1 cent on the dollar for the first $1 million in judgments if the city is found liable. Insurance would cover the remaining amount. City representatives have argued that any savings from their compromises with creditors would go to rebuilding the city\u2019s depleted infrastructure and improving municipal services. In issuing her ruling, Jury noted that the city must be able to offer adequate services \u2014 particularly those for public safety \u2014 if it is to improve. \u201cAnybody who lives in this area knows that the crime problem in San Bernardino is significant,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to be able to get safe in order for people to want to live there.\u201d City Atty. Gary Saenz said the city\u2019s creditors, employees and others made significant compromises for the plan to move forward. They \u201crealized that the city is in bankruptcy, has no money, and is in an extremely difficult situation,\u201d he said. And they \u201cgave up much to help the city get to a place where we could have a plan that would help the city survive.\u201d San Bernardino has been in bankruptcy since summer 2012. Over the last four years, other municipalities have entered and emerged. Stockton filed bankruptcy in 2012 and exited last year. Detroit filed in 2013 and exited the following year. Years of cuts to public services and struggles to raise revenue in the impoverished city have battered its infrastructure and taken a heavy toll on its ability to meet basic public needs and attract new economic opportunities. The bankruptcy process and cost-cutting efforts in years prior mean the city is now a very different place than it was just a few years ago. Its storied Fire Department has been outsourced to the county and trash collection, recycling and street sweeping services have been contracted out. City staff has been cut by hundreds, while street repair, libraries, parks, community centers and other services have been severely neglected. The Police Department\u2019s staffing has been cut 30%, hampering its ability to deal with a recent surge in homicides. \u201cThe public has had to put up with a lot,\u201d Scott said. \u201cNothing would make us happier than to get back to where we\u2019re serving them at a higher level.\u201d But in a city that is among the poorest in the nation, officials say raising revenue will continue to be a major challenge. The city declared bankruptcy having been devastated by the effects of the Great Recession and housing crisis, which left it grappling with huge unemployment rates, one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation and plummeting property and sales tax revenues. Those tax revenues have improved moderately in recent years but are unlikely to do so significantly in the near future, officials have said. Although city officials have explored raising various sales and other taxes to increase revenue, they concluded that the city\u2019s poor residents could be overly burdened by such increases and voters may not approve them. The city has taken steps to raise fees, which do not require voter approval. To boost the city\u2019s economic foundation, officials hope to attract new development. But challenges including the city\u2019s high violent crime rate, difficulty in providing needed services and the well-publicized bankruptcy itself have made that difficult. On Tuesday, officials expressed hope that the impending exit from bankruptcy would help it begin to address some of those issues. Voters also recently approved a new charter that restructured the city\u2019s complex governmental structure. In issuing her ruling, Jury sounded an optimistic note and congratulated the city\u2019s leadership. The city\u2019s top positions are now filled by different people from when the bankruptcy process started. Four years ago, she said, city officials appeared to be working at odds with each other. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this community for 40 years,\u201d Jury told the packed room of attorneys and city officials who gathered for the momentous hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018that city needs help.\u2019 And it got it.\u201d ",
