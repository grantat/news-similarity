(Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Whatever President Obama had planned for life after the presidency, the election of Donald Trump will likely change those plans. Instead of building on his legacy, he'll be defending it. Instead of helping to nurture his Democratic Party as an elder statesman, he'll be helping to rebuild it\u00a0\u2014 finding new generational leaders who can carry the banner in future elections. And instead of providing friendly counsel to President Hillary Clinton, he'll have a more complicated relationship with President Donald Trump. \"Obama's post-presidency just got exponentially more interesting,\" said Cody Foster, a University of Kentucky historian who has studied\u00a0 the post-presidential\u00a0lives of former presidents . \"Whereas he might have focused on building upon policies created during his administration, he must now defend his administration's legacy,\" Foster said. \"Every policy, every veto, every word must now be carefully defended against an incoming leader eager to blindly press 'undo'\u00a0on everything that Obama created. And President Trump can do that because he has a Republican Congress and is likely to have a more conservative Supreme Court.\" Read more: Trump gives mixed signals on transition with Obama It's Obama's relationship with Trump that will likely be most scrutinized. Presidents have often relied on their predecessors for advice, support and even some sensitive diplomacy. In return, modern presidents have avoided public criticism of their successors \u2014 although they've sometimes conducted freelance foreign policy in a way that's flummoxed the incumbent, as with Jimmy Carter's outspoken work on human rights. \"I don\u2019t see him immediately becoming a Jimmy Carter-like thorn in the new president's side,\" said Anthony Clark, author of\u00a0 The Last Campaign: How Presidents Rewrite History, Run for Posterity & Enshrine Their Legacies .\u00a0\"But I also think he's going to be more critical than previous presidents have been.\u00a0He's going to have to find a way to be anti-Trump without appearing to be anti-Trump.\" After the election, Obama himself described that tightrope as having\u00a0\"less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle\" but about \"core questions about our values and our ideals.\" In recent weeks, Obama has begun to talk more specifically about the role he'll play in partisan politics after the election.\u00a0At his end-of-the-year press conference , Obama said he sees a role in giving \"counsel and advice\" to the Democratic Party in an effort to reach areas of the country where Democrats have not performed well \u2014 places where he said \"Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, politically correct, out-of-touch folks.\" Obama said he'll also work to rebuild a Democratic Party that's been decimated over the course of his presidency. Democrats have won the popular vote in six of the past seven\u00a0presidential elections. But since 2010, Democrats have lost\u00a0thousands of downballot races\u00a0\u2014 the congressional seats, governor's mansions, state legislative districts and local offices that form a kind of\u00a0bench for a political party. \"With respect to my priorities when I leave, it is to build that next generation of leadership; organizers, journalists, politicians. I see them in America, I see them around the world, 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds who are just full of talent, full of idealism,\" he said. \"And the question is how do we link them up? How do we give them the tools for them to bring about progressive change? And I want to use my presidential center as a mechanism for developing that next generation of talent.\" \"But the day-to-day scrum, not only is it contrary to tradition for the ex-president to be involved in that, but I also think would inhibit the development of those new voices,\" Obama\u00a0said. That's not a departure from past presidents, Clark said, but Obama may be a bit more upfront about using his foundation as a party-building tool. \"Prior\u00a0to the election, my thought was that both the library and the foundation would be more in line with Jimmy Carter, who spent more time on his foundation and less on his library,\" Clark said. \"Now, I see it more like the Reagan Presidential Center, which is the altar on which rising conservative stars must go to become baptized.\" Posted!

    "text": "Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images WATCH House Republicans Withdraw Move to Weaken Ethics Watchdog 0 Shares Email House Republicans reversed plans to gut a congressional ethics watchdog on Tuesday after a backlash that included criticism from President-elect Donald Trump over the timing of the move. Late Monday night House GOP members voted to dramatically restructure the Office of Congressional Ethics, putting the independent office under the jurisdiction of a congressional committee. Trump tweeted this morning that the timing of the change was poor and should not have been the first priority for the newly elected Congress. \"With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\" he wrote. He included a hashtag referring to one of his campaign slogans, \"Drain the swamp.\" One of his main campaign promises was to end perceived corruption in Washington. GOP leadership, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Leader Kevin McCarthy, had spoken out against the move. Like Trump, McCarthy said that he didn't think it was the \"right time\" for a controversial change to the chamber's independent ethics watchdog. The OCE is currently a nonpartisan office led by lawyers, former members of Congress and others tasked with investigating alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress. The group may publicly release its findings and call for the House Committee on Ethics to take action. The amendment passed by House Republicans would have limited the OCE's ability to act autonomously and make its investigations public. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Monday's vote in a statement, saying, \"Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.\" Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., the outgoing chairman of the Ethics Committee, told reporters the amendment was too \"ambiguous\" and \"needed further clarification.\" Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., agreed, saying members were bombarded with calls after waking up to bad headlines this morning. \"There was a perception that this would weaken independence ... American people want to see that ethics are for real,\" he said. \"Now we're going to work this through properly ... going to open up bipartisan debate.\" Some members, including Steve King, R-Iowa, voiced their disappointment with the reversal. King doubled down on the idea that all members of Congress should have a right to face accusers on ethics issues and promised to continue to fight for \"full abolishment\" of the office. Asked if Trump\u2019s tweet made a difference, King said, \"Yes, it animated the press.\" 0 Shares ",

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Lawmakers returned to Washington and wasted no time getting to work on the repeal of Obamacare. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., introduced a resolution just hours after the new Congress convened Tuesday that will serve as the vehicle for repealing much of the president's signature health care law. \"Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation's broken health care system, removing Washington from the equation and putting control back where it belongs: with patients, their families, and their doctors,\" Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a press release posted on his website Tuesday. It's the first step in Republican lawmakers' plan to fulfill their most ardent campaign promise \u2014 to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a Republican alternative. Republicans have to use a special legislative maneuver, called a budget resolution, to undo the ACA because they don't have enough votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Budget bills aren't subject to filibuster, so lawmakers will be able to repeal the parts of the law that have budget and tax implications. Article continues after sponsorship That means they can essentially gut the law, removing all the subsidies that help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance and getting rid of the smorgasbord of taxes \u2014 on medical devices, insurance companies and wealthy individuals \u2014 that pay for those subsidies Enzi's resolution calls on the Senate to get a bill to the Senate Budget Committee by Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers say they don't want the 20 million people who have newly gained insurance because of the ACA to lose their coverage. So they plan to phase out Obamacare over time while they devise a replacement plan that they say will make affordable health insurance available to everyone, without the much-hated mandate to buy insurance if you don't want it. Many analysts are skeptical that this \"repeal and delay\" strategy will work. \"The most likely end result of 'repeal and delay' would be less secure insurance for many Americans, procrastination by political leaders who will delay taking any proactive steps as long as possible, and ultimately no discernible movement toward a real marketplace for either insurance or medical services,\" said Joe Antos and James Capretta of the conservative American Enterprise Institute in a blog published Tuesday in Health Affairs. Antos and Capretta say a partial repeal with no replacement would lead insurance companies to pull out of the Obamacare market altogether, leaving those who get coverage there today with no insurance at all. It's not clear exactly what will be included in the actual repeal bill. The best model we have now is a bill passed by the House and Senate and vetoed by President Obama last year. That bill eliminated the mandate for individuals to have insurance coverage right away but delayed the other parts of the repeal for two years. \"I can see how it would be hard for Republicans to maintain the individual mandate, which is possibly the most objectionable part of the ACA in their view,\" says Larry Levitt , a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"On the other hand, getting rid of the individual mandate immediately risks a collapse of the individual insurance market.\" The ACA includes the mandate to ensure that both sick and healthy people buy insurance to spread the costs across a broad population and keep premiums low. If Republicans follow the model of last year's bill and eliminate the mandate immediately, many healthy people would forgo insurance, and the price of coverage for sick people would spiral out of control, analysts say. \"That is a prescription for health plan disaster during this transition and brings into question just how many plans would stay in the program for 2018,\" says Robert Laszewski , a health policy consultant.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Megyn Kelly has decided to join NBC News, and Fox News says her last day on the air will be Friday. The network announced today that Kelly will be giving up her prime-time role at Fox for a multi-year deal that includes several roles at NBC. She will launch a daytime program as well as a Sunday evening news magazine show, and be part of the network\u2019s coverage of major political and breaking-news events. Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a statement: \u201cWe thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to FOX News. We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best.\u201d In a Facebook posting, Kelly said: \u201cWhile I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge. I remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters.\u201d Fox News fought hard to keep Kelly, who became a breakout star and whose 9 p.m. show was the second-highest rated in cable news, behind \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Kelly during the campaign helped turn her into an international celebrity and she was featured on the cover of the New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and other publications. She also just published a best-selling memoir, \u201cSettle for More.\u201d Kelly\u2019s contract at Fox was not due to expire for another six months. Kelly stood to make an eight-figure salary wherever she went. As she talked about her decision, it became clear that a top priority was a schedule that would allow her to spend more time with her three young children, who went to bed before she returned home from her nighttime program. Fox News now faces the challenge of replacing Kelly in prime time, as well as at such major events as debates and political conventions, where she has generally appeared alongside Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. Kelly was an increasingly unhappy lawyer in 2004 when she parlayed a part-time gig at a Washington station into a reporting job at Fox. She quickly rose through the ranks, co-anchoring \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d with Bill Hemmer and then hosting a 1 p.m. show before the move to prime time. In agreeing to join NBC, Kelly said, \u201cI have decided to end my time at FNC, incredibly enriched for the experiences I've had.\u201d NBC Universal Chairman Andrew Lack said in a statement, \u201cMegyn is an exceptional journalist and news anchor, who has had an extraordinary career\u201d Lack said. \u201cShe\u2019s demonstrated tremendous skill and poise, and we\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d The move gives Kelly access to the potentially larger audience of a major broadcast network. But launching a daytime program can be difficult, even for famous journalists. Katie Couric, the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host and CBS anchor, lasted two years in an ABC-backed daytime show whose first executive producer was Jeff Zucker, now CNN\u2019s president. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper also lasted two seasons in daytime. The largely female audience tends to favor entertainment and lighter fare over serious news topics. NBC did not announce a time for Kelly\u2019s new show. Trump\u2019s attacks on Kelly after the first presidential debate, when she asked him about his demeaning comments toward some women, brought her a torrent of online abuse and, she disclosed in her book, her family was forced to use security guards. The two buried the hatchet in an interview that aired on the Fox broadcast network. Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

    "text": "CBS/AP January 3, 2017, 5:46 PM Criminal investigation underway into accidental poisoning that killed 4 kids Email DALLAS -- A criminal investigation is underway into an apparent accidental poisoning involving a professional-grade pesticide that left four children dead and an Amarillo woman in critical condition, police said Tuesday. Authorities are looking into why the family had the pesticide pellets, called Weevil-cide, which is only supposed to be sold to people with professional licenses or certification. The product\u2019s manual, available online, outlines stringent guidelines for using the product including having two trained individuals apply it. Figures from the American Association of Poison Control Centers show that deaths from the pesticide are rare. The father of the children who died told first responders through a Spanish language interpreter that he had spread the pellets under the family\u2019s mobile home after obtaining the product from a friend, Amarillo Fire Capt. Larry Davis said. Davis said the product is not available for sale to the general public. The product\u2019s manual says it\u2019s intended for use in pest control in commercial transport or storage of commodities and animal feed.\u00a0 An investigation is underway into a deadly leak of highly poisonous gas in a Texas home. Four children were killed and six other family members w... Davis said the father does not have professional certification as far as he knows. He did not know whether the friend who gave him the product had a certification. Amarillo police spokesman Officer Jeb Hilton says the department\u2019s special crimes unit is investigating because of the child deaths. Once completed, the investigation will be turned over to the district attorney to determine whether charges will be filed. Hilton said other federal and state environmental regulation agencies may also investigate the use and storage of the chemical.\u00a0 Fire officials said the children who died were three boys -- ages 7, 9 and 11 -- and a 17-year-old girl. Officials have said all four children lived at the home in Amarillo, which is about 350 miles northwest of Dallas.\u00a0 Four children died from gas poisoning believed to have been caused by a pesticide sprayed under their Amarillo home, officials said. CBS News The children\u2019s mother, Martha Balderas, 45, was in critical condition Tuesday at University Medical Center in Lubbock, according to a hospital spokesman. Five other family members, including the father and four other children, were being treated at BSA Health System in Amarillo and were in stable condition, hospital and fire officials said early Tuesday. Crews who responded to a 5 a.m. call to the home on Monday originally thought it was related to carbon monoxide poisoning. Authorities later determined that phosphine gas was likely released when the father took a garden hose at some point Sunday and tried to rinse away some of the pellets because family members had complained of the smell.\u00a0 Toxic Phosphine gas is produced when aluminum phosphide is mixed with water or moisture,\u00a0 CBS Amarillo affiliate KFDA reported. The water started the chemical reaction that released the phosphine gas. A visitor arrived early Monday, found everyone sick and called 911. Phosphine gas can cause respiratory failure and in severe cases can cause a pulmonary edema, which fills the lungs full of fluid. The American Association of Poison Control Centers, which compiles data on poisoning, shows nine deaths from ingesting or breathing in aluminum phosphide between 2010 and 2015. Two of those deaths happened in Utah in 2010, when two young children died after a pest control company spread vole pesticide pellets that released phosphine gas. Authorities believe the gas seeped into the home through cracks in the foundation. Cynthia Aaron, the medical director for the Michigan Regional Poison Control Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan, said doctors there more often treated adult patients for exposure to phosphine gas from aluminum phosphide because the pesticide is often used in industrial shipping. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rare exposure, but deaths like this are rare,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see mostly the overdoses. For example, they used to use this in ship holds when they ship grain. So if they are de-mousing the big ship hold and someone doesn\u2019t realize the pesticide has been activated or they haven\u2019t yet been aired out properly, they might enter and pass out or die.\u201d Chip Orton, emergency management coordinator for the city of Amarillo and Potter and Randall counties, says his staff was working with a number of state and federal agencies to decontaminate the Amarillo home. He did not know when it would be safe for the family to return. About 10 police, fire and medical personnel who first responded to the home were taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, Davis said. Two were kept overnight for observation because of headache and nausea but were in good condition Tuesday, he said. Davis said the home was far enough away from neighbors that no other evacuations or treatments were necessary. Neighbors\u00a0 told KFDA \u00a0that the Balderas family was well known and liked in the community. \u201cThere was a lot of love in that family and still is,\u201d said Nichole Wells, a teacher at Travis Middle School who taught 3 of the 8 Balderas children. \u201cThey\u2019ll wave, they\u2019re polite, they\u2019re respectful. They were just such a great family, and they really knew what it was to be a family. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d \u00a0 Many said the family is going to struggle with the costs associated with the tragedy. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to have to change, and they\u2019re going to need a lot of help with four funerals simultaneously,\u201d said Wells. \u201cSo they\u2019re going to need the love and support from the community and even surrounding areas to really make this happen, and at least give them some sense of normalcy.\u201d \u00a0 A GoFundMe page has been set up \u00a0in the family\u2019s name, and surpassed its goal of $25,000.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Jan 3 2017, 4:05 pm ET Ford Cancels Mexican Plant But Still Moving Small Car Production by Paul A. Eisenstein Ford Announces Plan to Create 700 New US Jobs 0:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170103210822if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/846480963812\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Ford Motor Co. announced Tuesday it has scrubbed plans to build a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico, a project that had been spotlighted by then-candidate Donald Trump, especially after Ford said it would move small car production from the U.S. into that new factory. But while the move is being hailed by some as a victory for the president-elect, a closer look at the announcement, made by senior Ford executives at a suburban Detroit assembly plant, did not actually reverse the central decision the automaker announced last April. Small car production, such as the compact Focus model, will still move to Mexico, just into an existing Ford plant in Hermosillo. And while Ford will use some of the savings from the planned Mexican plant to expand its factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, that project appears likely to have happened anyway. The maker's new body shop and expanded assembly line will handle production of two new battery-based models that were not expected to be built in Mexico, anyway. \"We reached the point where we believed we could get\u2026capital savings\" by abandoning the new plant, Joe Hinrichs, Ford's President of the Americas, told NBCNews in an exclusive interview. One of the key reasons was an update of sales projections for the Ford Focus. Demand for passenger cars - smaller models, in particular -- has been falling rapidly as American motorists shift to SUVs, crossovers and light trucks. That was a key reason Ford wanted to move the Focus and C-Max \"people-mover\" out of the Wayne Assembly Plant to Mexico in the first place. The factory is being converted to built higher-volume, and notably higher-profit, light trucks. According to Hinrichs, the revised forecast didn't justify building an entirely new plant. Instead, he explained, Ford now can make room for lower volume production at its existing factory in Hermosillo. In the process, that frees up money to update a second factory in suburban Detroit. Even then, the \"net savings,\" the executive explained, come to around $500 million. Ford will also get improved economies of scale for the Focus by building it in Hermosillo, since the plant will now operate near capacity. And, it will save substantially on labor costs compared to what it paid union workers in Michigan to produce the Focus. \"There's more to manufacturer than labor costs,\" Hinrichs noted. Logistics are critical, as is the fact that Mexico has more free trade agreements in place than any other country in the world but for Israel. That means fewer tariffs when exporting the Focus, further improving the business case for keeping it in Mexico. Meanwhile, some of the savings on the abandoned Mexican plant will help Ford not just justify upgrading its plant in Flat Rock, but, in turn, help make a business case for adding two new electrified models that will be produced in the factory. That includes an all-new pure battery-electric vehicles expected to have a range of \"at least\" 300 miles. The other product will be a hybrid-powered model due out in 2020 that would be Ford's first model to allow fully autonomous driving. The Tuesday announcement is expected to be promoted by the incoming Trump Administration as an indication of how its hardball stance on trade with Mexico is paying off - even if Ford will continue with its plan to move small car production out of the U.S. At the very least, the shift in plans will create about 700 new jobs in suburban Detroit. Whether that will be enough to bring a simmering feud between the two sides to an end is uncertain. After candidate Trump started criticizing Ford, the maker's Chairman Bill Ford met with the business-cum-politician but failed to get Trump to stop criticizing Ford. Shortly after the November election, during a keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford CEO Mark Fields went public with the dispute, arguing that the idea of trade barriers, especially steep tariffs, would be harmful to U.S. consumers and the overall economy. On Tuesday, Chairman Ford -- the great-grandson of the automaker's founder - made a private call to advise the president-elect of the news. Hinrichs told NBCNews that Trump had not been in the loop as the decision was being made to abandon the Mexican plant. There appears to be no direct quid-pro-quo, though Ford CEO Fields was effusive in his praise of the president-elect on Tuesday, suggesting he had \"confidence\" in Trump's \"pro-growth policies.\" That may help Ford to step out of the spotlight. Though the incoming president has already turned his attention towards Ford's cross-town rival General Motors. \"Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax,\" the next president declared in an overnight tweet, slamming General Motors for \"sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.\" The nation's largest automaker fired back later in the morning by noting, \"General Motors manufacturers the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio.\" In a rebuttal statement, it added, \"All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.\" Senior officials with several other manufacturers contacted by NBCNews said they are watching developments with Ford and GM closely to see if they will next be targeted. \"We're waiting to see,\" said an executive with one of the major Japanese automakers. Mexico has found itself at the center of the manufacturing debate, and the auto industry is at ground zero. The country has gone from a relative backwater a decade ago to become one of the world's five largest sources of automotive production. Virtually every major automaker now assembles vehicles in Mexico. In the past year alone, new factories have been opened or started by players including Nissan's Infiniti - which is pairing up on a plant with Mercedes-Benz - Kia and Audi. Paul A. Eisenstein ",

Ryan of Wisconsin with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter The new Congress opened with a stumble Tuesday after the Republican majority\u2019s plan for gutting an independent ethics office drew a firestorm of criticism \u2014 including tweets of displeasure from President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 that forced lawmakers to reverse course in a sign of battles to come. The messy debut of what was supposed to be a celebratory start on Capitol Hill foreshadowed roadblocks ahead as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan tries to lead his often willful GOP majority while maneuvering unexpected outbursts from the party\u2019s new leader in the White House . Trump\u2019s early-morning tweet storm against surprise\u00a0GOP plans for a watered-down ethics watchdog showcased a president-elect who has no qualms about publicly opposing and embarrassing members of his own party, even lawmakers he will rely on to implement much of his agenda. And the instant course correction by the House to suit Trump\u2019s preference showed he may not pay much of a political price for intervening. He may even draw praise. \u201cMr. Trump has shown a penchant for being effective with Twitter,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks , an Alabama Republican. \u201cI am glad Donald Trump intervened because a change of this magnitude needs to be done more publicly and with more lead time.\u201d Despite the dramatic turn of events, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded upbeat Tuesday as they opened the 115th Congress, welcoming new lawmakers who arrived with families and friends to be sworn in to office and snap official photos. The unforced error\u00a0did not appear to harm Ryan\u2019s reelection as speaker, nor did his fraught on-again, off-again relationship with Trump. House Republicans overwhelmingly chose the Wisconsin Republican for another term, avoiding the tumult of past leadership elections, including in 2015 when he took over after former House Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s abrupt retirement. Just one Republican dissented on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of foreboding today,\u201d Ryan said after taking the gavel. \u201cThere\u2019s only a sense of potential.\u201d The speaker reminded his colleagues of their vast responsibilities now that Republicans control the House, Senate and soon the White House. It\u2019s \u201cthe kind of thing that most of us only dream about.\u00a0I know \u2014 because I used to dream about it, a lot,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThe people have given us unified government.\u00a0And it wasn\u2019t because they were feeling generous.\u00a0It\u2019s because they wanted results.\u00a0How could we live with ourselves if we let them down?\u201d Republicans have unfurled an ambitious conservative agenda, including repealing the Affordable Care Act, lowering tax rates, boosting economic growth and tightening immigration rules. Many are in sync with Trump\u2019s campaign promises. But despite their unified front, Republicans have yet to produce the kind of detailed first-100-days plan that often comes with a new session of Congress or a new president. \u201cWe know that the coming days are going to require hard work,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cBut if we work together, we\u2019ll be able to continue a record of achievement.\u201d Senate Republicans quickly introduced legislation to begin the painstaking process for repealing Obamacare, with mostly symbolic votes likely to begin next week. The thorny details will not come until later, and because\u00a0 parts of the bill are popular even with Republicans, full repeal may never pass. Democrats vowed to fight Trump on some issues \u2014 including efforts to deport immigrants here illegally \u2014 but said they will work with him when they can. As Tuesday showed, Democrats may be able to find daylight between the White House and Republicans in Congress. Many Democrats were officially aghast at the last-minute Republican push to weaken the ethnics panel. But Democrats also see possible coalitions with Trump on his calls to rebuild roads and bridges and to expand child care. Those issues have drawn a cool reception from conservatives on the Hill, but Trump\u2019s team has signaled he wants to pursue them. \u201cWe\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not going to just oppose things to oppose them,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), told CNN after he was sworn in as the Senate minority leader. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to work with [Trump] is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues.\u00a0That\u2019s not going to happen very often.\u201d The ethics controversy was not the way Republican leaders had planned to showcase the new Congress when they convened GOP lawmakers for a private meeting late Monday night. But the proposal from Rep. Robert W.\u00a0Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to rein in the Office of Congressional Ethics struck a nerve with rank-and-file lawmakers. Many have chafed at the watchdog panel, which was set up in 2008 after high-profile corruption scandals sent several members to prison. Under Goodlatte\u2019s plan, the independent office would be put under jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee, which is made up of lawmakers, and barred from investigating anonymous tips or releasing any details of its work to the public. Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield)\u00a0warned lawmakers that opening day was not the time to make such controversial changes. They argued the proposal would carry more weight if it had bipartisan support from Democrats. The leaders\u2019 advice was ignored. Late Monday, House Republicans voted to tuck the proposal into a\u00a0 broader rules package set for a vote on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cSometimes you win, sometimes you lose,\u201d McCarthy told reporters Tuesday morning as he struggled to explain the changes amid an onslaught of questions. Then Trump tweeted his point of view. \u201cWith all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it........may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\u201d He closed with \u201c#DTS\u201d \u2014 a reference to one of his campaign slogans, \u201cDrain the swamp.\u201d Office telephone lines on Capitol Hill were already ringing by that time, and social media accounts filled with howls of protest. Republicans said they had little choice but to back down. Ryan convened a quick meeting behind closed doors in the Capitol basement, where GOP lawmakers were told the provision might tank the broader rules package that was set for a vote in several hours \u2014 a potentially embarrassing setback on opening day. They agreed to shelve the issue \u2014 for now. \u201cThe feeling was, it was the right thing to do, but the wrong time to do it,\u201d said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.). \u201cIt was better to delay it.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) One person was killed and two wounded in a shooting in the East Garfield Park neighborhood Jan. 3, 2017. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas and Elyssa Cherney Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Two 16-year-old boys were killed and a woman in her 60s was wounded in the leg in a shooting in the East Garfield Park neighborhood Tuesday. The shooting happened about\u00a0noon in the 3400 block of West Fulton Street, authorities said.\u00a0 Neighbors said the shots apparently came from a passing SUV. One of the boys was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other 16-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Authorities said the teens were outside on the street or sidewalk when they were shot. A 65-year-old woman in the house behind them was hit in the leg and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was stabilized, police said.\u00a0 Neighbors said the woman had just moved to the neighborhood and the teens were standing in front of her house when they were shot. A 51-year-old man who lives across the street said he was lying in bed when he heard about seven gunshots. He and his wife rushed outside to find the two teens lying on the ground, shot. \"In the past year there's been so much shooting, it's pathetic,\" said the man, who works at a hotel laundry service. He did not want to be named. The woman with him said she recognized one of the boys as her son's friend. She said the woman who was shot just moved to the block and kept to herself. The woman said she rushed across the street to help the boys. \"It hurt my heart watching them lying on the ground struggling to breathe. I'm glad my baby was inside. This used to be a nice neighborhood where kids could play.\" About an hour later, a 32-year-old man was shot in the shoulder while riding in a car at 69th Street and Lafayette Avenue in Englewood, police said. An acquaintance drive him to 71st Street and Jefferey Boulevard where he called police. \u00a0The man was taken in good condition to a hospital. ",

Got it House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) addresses the House on Tuesday, the first day of the 115th Congress. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Robert Costa , Mike DeBonis and Philip Rucker January 3 at 6:52 PM Follow @costareports Follow @mikedebonis Follow @PhilipRucker A day of pageantry to open the 115th Congress and usher in a new period of Republican governance was overtaken Tuesday by an embarrassing reversal on ethics oversight, with the GOP gripped by internal division and many lawmakers seeking to shield themselves from extensive scrutiny. The 19 hours of tumult was set in motion the night before behind closed doors at the Longworth House Office Building, where Republican lawmakers decided over the objections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to amend House rules to effectively gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. They awoke Tuesday to an intense public outcry. Social media lit up with criticism of representatives trying to rein in the ethics office created a decade ago in the aftermath of scandals. Angry constituents inundated their representatives\u2019 offices with calls of protest. Journalists peppered lawmakers with questions. The halls of the Capitol felt chaotic. Then, at 10:30 a.m., came the loudest objection of all: A pair of tweets from President-elect Donald Trump scolding Congress for making the weakening of the ethics watchdog its \u201cnumber one act and priority.\u201d He punctuated his second tweet with the hashtag \u201cDTS\u201d \u2014 shorthand for \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d one of his campaign-trail mantras. With Washington\u2019s latest power dynamics in their nascent state, Tuesday\u2019s events illustrated the weight of Trump\u2019s voice in discussions on Capitol Hill. The president-elect\u2019s tweets hovered over everything and helped turn what might otherwise have been an insider-driven rule change into a national ruckus over government ethics. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) greets people in the House chambers at the Capitol on Tuesday, the first day of the 115th Congress. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) [ House Republicans vote to rein in independent ethics office ] The events were fast-moving Tuesday morning. As Trump was using his political capital on Congress, Republican House leaders were meeting in Ryan\u2019s office contemplating just how the day had gotten away from them \u2014 and what they might do to salvage it. Ryan would soon be sworn in for another term as speaker, and his wife and children, dressed up for the occasion, lingered outside. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told the leaders that the rules legislation with the ethics amendment would have trouble getting the 218 votes needed to pass \u2014 and they decided it must be scrapped. The leaders called an emergency meeting of Republican House members in the Capitol basement. McCarthy pointedly asked the members whether they had campaigned last fall on decimating the ethics office \u2014 or on repealing President Obama\u2019s health-care law and changing the tax code. The windowless room fell silent, according to several lawmakers in attendance. McCarthy gave them an ultimatum: Reverse course now, among fellow Republicans, or take a public floor vote. He asked for unanimous consent to remove the rules change \u2014 and shortly after noon, he got it. The push to amend ethics rules was now dead, or at least fast asleep. \u201cI can tell you the calls we\u2019ve gotten in my district office and here in Washington surprised me, meaning the numbers of calls. People are just sick and tired,\u201d Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.) said of the simmering outrage over the proposed change. \u201cPeople are just losing confidence in the lack of ethics and honesty in Washington.\u201d For the lawmakers who had supported the rules change, the OCE had become an unaccountable office with little transparency. Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.), who was the subject of an OCE referral over a 2011 trip he took with his wife to Taiwan, likened the office to Old English royal courts that dictated harsh and arbitrary sentences to powerful figures. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) \u201cIt\u2019s a star chamber,\u201d said Roskam, who was cleared by the Ethics Committee in 2013. \u201cIt needs to be reformed.\u201d House Republicans have not abandoned an OCE overhaul entirely, but any changes are being put off until later in the year. Tuesday\u2019s actions disrupted a day of ceremonial rituals, as Ryan was easily reelected as speaker with the support of all but one Republican \u2014 far fewer defectors than when he first won the speakership in 2015. Most Democrats voted for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who will remain the minority leader. Members of the new House and Senate were sworn in throughout the afternoon. Republicans will hold a 52-48 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, and 241-194 in the House. Delivering his inaugural floor speech as Senate minority leader, Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed to fight Trump on issues where Democrats disagree. \u201cIt is not our job to be a rubber stamp,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt is our job to do what\u2019s best for the American people, the middle class and those struggling to get there.\u201d But in a sign of his party\u2019s diminished influence, Schumer spoke to a mostly empty chamber save for several dozen of his Democratic colleagues. Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stood on the floor whispering to each other, ignoring Schumer. [ Here are the eight Trump Cabinet picks Democrats plan to target ] The House rules package that ultimately passed Tuesday contained a controversial provision that will impose fines on members using electronic devices to take photographs, record audio or video or conduct live streams on the House floor. The provision came in response to House Democrats staging a sit-in last summer aimed at forcing votes on gun-control legislation. At issue earlier in the day were changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was created in 2008 after the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal to address concerns that members of the House Ethics Committee had been too timid in pursuing allegations of wrongdoing by fellow lawmakers. The amendment, proposed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), would have renamed the office as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review and prevented it from investigating anonymous tips or referring criminal wrongdoing to prosecutors without the express consent of the Ethics Committee. It also would have prohibited the office from employing staff to communicate with the public or the media. House leaders knew days in advance of Monday night\u2019s meeting of Republican lawmakers to finalize the House rules package that Goodlatte would seek to undermine the independent ethics office. The leadership made an effort to head off the proposal before the meeting, but Goodlatte refused to budge. As the meeting started at 5:30 p.m., aides were confident that members would reject Goodlatte\u2019s proposal once Ryan and McCarthy weighed in against it. That did not happen. Goodlatte was backed by a chorus of rank-and-file lawmakers \u2014 many of whom had been targeted by OCE probes or feared they might be next \u2014 who were emboldened to make changes. The measure passed handily, 119 to 74. Dozens of other members were absent because they were not yet in Washington. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) echoed the views of many colleagues in saying changes to the OCE were long overdue. \u201cThere\u2019s no due process,\u201d he said. \u201cAn anonymous source can destroy your life, put you on the front page of the newspaper \u2014 and when it\u2019s too late, you\u2019re completely exonerated. I\u2019ve watched that happen to close friends who were straight as an arrow.\u201d [ Donald Trump, meet your toughest hurdle: the U.S. Senate ] Others foresaw the political toll that could be exacted for a decision to make gutting ethics oversight the first act of the new Congress. \u201cI had cautioned some of my colleagues last night that that one provision would create quite a public stir \u2014 and it did,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said with a slight chuckle. Ryan and McCarthy initially seemed resigned to accepting the will of their members, even though they understood the less-than-optimal message it sent to voters nationally, especially after a campaign during which Washington was vilified. Before GOP members could meet to change course, McCarthy had to face a conference room full of skeptical reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re a collective group of individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\u201d The development blindsided Trump transition officials, prompting Ryan staffers to explain to Trump aides late Monday night and into Tuesday morning what exactly House members had voted on and why they did it. Early Tuesday, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, partially defended the proposed changes to the ethics office in an appearance on MSNBC. But that was before she discussed the matter with the president-elect, and a few hours later it became clear he disagreed with what House Republicans had done. \u201cWith all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it . . . may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, health care and so many other things of far greater importance!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect was not taking a position on the merits of the ethics rules changes, only on the prioritization. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of strengthening or weakening,\u201d Spicer told reporters . \u201cI think it\u2019s a question of priorities and the president\u2019s belief that with all that this country wants and needs to have happen, this really shouldn\u2019t be the priority.\u201d Ryan and Trump eventually spoke by phone following the conference meeting and during the vote for speaker, per aides. But earlier, as Trump was firing off tweets, McCarthy reflected on the discord that had engulfed Congress\u2019s first day. During the morning news conference, McCarthy was flung questions from journalists \u2014 including one about whether the day\u2019s events signaled weakness on the part of House leaders. \u201cMan,\u201d McCarthy replied, \u201cwelcome back.\u201d Sean Sullivan, Paul Kane, Ed O\u2019Keefe, David Weigel, Kelsey Snell, Scott Higham and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report. powerpost ",

By JON MOOALLEM Continue reading the main story First, the back story, because, B.J. Miller has found, the back story is unavoidable when you are missing three limbs. Miller was a sophomore at Princeton when, one Monday night in November 1990, he and two friends went out for drinks and, at around 4 a.m., found themselves ambling toward a convenience store for sandwiches. They decided to climb a commuter train parked at the adjacent rail station, for fun. Miller scaled it first. When he got to the top, electrical current arced out of a piece of equipment into the watch on his wrist. Eleven-thousand volts shot through his left arm and down his legs. When his friends reached him on the roof of the train, smoke was rising from his feet. Miller remembers none of this. His memories don\u2019t kick in until several days later, when he woke up in the burn unit of St. Barnabas Medical Center, in Livingston, N.J. Thinking he\u2019d resurfaced from a terrible dream, he tried to shamble across his hospital room on the charred crusts of his legs until he used up the slack of his catheter tube and the device tore out of his body. Then, all the pain hit him at once. Doctors took each leg just below the knee, one at a time. Then they turned to his arm, which triggered in Miller an even deeper grief. (\u201cHands do stuff,\u201d he explains. \u201cYour foot is just a stinky, clunky little platform.\u201d) For weeks, the hospital staff considered him close to death. But Miller, in a devastated haze, didn\u2019t know that. He only worried about who he would be when he survived. Continue reading the main story For a long time, no visitors were allowed in his hospital room; the burn unit was a sterile environment. But on the morning Miller\u2019s arm was going to be amputated, just below the elbow, a dozen friends and family members packed into a 10-foot-long corridor between the burn unit and the elevator, just to catch a glimpse of him as he was rolled to surgery. \u201cThey all dared to show up,\u201d Miller remembers thinking. \u201cThey all dared to look at me. They were proving that I was lovable even when I couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d This reassured Miller, as did the example of his mother, Susan, a polio survivor who has used a wheelchair since Miller was a child: She had never seemed diminished. After the operation, when Miller was rolled through the hallway again, he opened his eyes as he passed her and said: \u201cMom, Mom. Now you and me have more in common.\u201d Photo A room at the Zen Hospice Guest House in San Francisco. Credit Todd Hido for The New York Times It wasn\u2019t that Miller was suddenly enlightened; internally, he was in turmoil. But in retrospect, he credits himself with doing one thing right: He saw a good way to look at his situation and committed to faking that perspective, hoping that his genuine self might eventually catch up. Miller refused, for example, to let himself believe that his life was extra difficult now, only uniquely difficult, as all lives are. He resolved to think of his suffering as simply a \u201cvariation on a theme we all deal with \u2014 to be human is really hard,\u201d he says. His life had never felt easy, even as a privileged, able-bodied suburban boy with two adoring parents, but he never felt entitled to any angst; he saw unhappiness as an illegitimate intrusion into the carefree reality he was supposed to inhabit. And don\u2019t we all do that, he realized. Don\u2019t we all treat suffering as a disruption to existence, instead of an inevitable part of it? He wondered what would happen if you could \u201creincorporate your version of reality, of normalcy, to accommodate suffering.\u201d As a disabled person, he was getting all kinds of signals that he was different and separated from everyone else. But he worked hard to see himself as merely sitting somewhere on a continuum between the man on his deathbed and the woman who misplaced her car keys, to let his accident heighten his connectedness to others, instead of isolating him. This was the only way, he thought, to keep from hating his injuries and, by extension, himself. Miller returned to Princeton the following year. He had three prosthetics and rode around campus in a golf cart with a rambunctious service dog named Vermont who, in truth, was too much of a misfit to perform any concrete service. Miller had wanted to work in foreign relations, in China; now he started studying art history. He found it to be a good lens through which to keep making sense of his injuries. Advertisement Continue reading the main story First, there was the discipline\u2019s implicit conviction that every work is shaped by the viewer\u2019s perspective. He remembers looking at slides of ancient sculptures in a dark lecture hall, all of them missing arms or noses or ears, and suddenly recognizing them for what they were: fellow amputees. \u201cWe were, as a class, all calling these works monumental, beautiful and important, but we\u2019d never seen them whole,\u201d he says. Time\u2019s effect on these marble bodies \u2014 their suffering, really \u2014 was understood as part of the art. Medicine didn\u2019t think about bodies this way, Miller realized. Embedded in words like \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d was a less generous view: \u201cThere was an aberrant moment in your life and, with some help, you could get back to what you were, or approximate it.\u201d So, instead of regarding his injuries as something to get over, Miller tried to get into them, to see his new life as its own novel challenge, like traveling through a country whose language he didn\u2019t speak. This positivity was still mostly aspirational. Miller spent years repulsed by the \u201cchopped meat\u201d where his arm ended and crushed with shame when he noticed people wince or look away. But he slowly became more confident and playful. He replaced the sock-like covering many amputees wear over their arm stumps with an actual sock: first a plain sock, then stripes and argyles. Then, one day he forgot to put on any sock and \u2014 just like that \u2014 \u201cI was done with it. I was no longer ashamed of my arm.\u201d He became fascinated by architects like Louis Sullivan, who stripped the veneer off their buildings and let the strength of their construction shine through. And suddenly, the standard-issue foam covers he\u2019d been wearing over his prosthetics seemed like a clunky charade \u2014 Potemkin legs. The exquisitely engineered artificial limbs they hid were actually pretty interesting, even sexy, made of the same carbon fiber used as a finish on expensive sports cars. \u201cWhy not tear that stuff off and delight in what actually is?\u201d Miller recalled thinking. So he did. For years Miller collected small, half-formed insights like these. Then, he entered medical school and discovered palliative care, an approach to medicine rooted in similar ideas. He now talks about his recovery as a creative act, \u201ca transformation,\u201d and argues that all suffering offers the same opportunity, even at the end of life, which gradually became his professional focus. \u201cParts of me died early on,\u201d he said in a recent talk. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something, one way or another, we can all say. I got to redesign my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left.\u201d One morning in July 2015, Miller took his seat at a regular meeting of palliative-care doctors at the University of California San Francisco\u2019s cancer center. The head of the team, Dr. Michael Rabow, started with a poem. It was a tradition, he later told me, meant to remind everyone that this was a different sort of hour in their schedule, and that, as palliative-care physicians, they were seeking different outcomes for their patients: things like comfort, beauty and meaning. The poem was called \u201cSinkhole,\u201d and it seemed to offer some sneaky, syntactically muddled wisdom about letting go. When it was over, there was a beat of silence. (It was kind of a confusing poem.) Then Rabow encouraged everyone to remember any patients who had died since their last meeting. Miller was the first to speak up. Miller, now 45, with deep brown eyes and a scruffy, silver-threaded beard, saw patients one day a week at the hospital. He was also entering his fifth year as executive director of a small, pioneering hospice in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, which originated as a kind of compassionate improvisation at the height of the AIDS crisis in San Francisco, when members of the San Francisco Zen Center began taking in sick, often stigmatized young men and doing what they could to help them die comfortably. It is now an independent nonprofit group that trains volunteers for San Francisco\u2019s Laguna Honda public hospital as well as for its own revered, small-scale residential operation. (Two of the facility\u2019s six beds are reserved for U.C.S.F., which sends patients there; the rest are funded through sliding-scale fees and private donations.) Once an outlier, Zen Hospice has come to embody a growing nationwide effort to reclaim the end of life as a human experience instead of primarily a medical one. The goal, as Miller likes to put it, is to \u201cde-pathologize death.\u201d Around the table at U.C.S.F., Miller stood out. The other doctors wore dress pants and button-downs \u2014 physician-casual \u2014 while he wore a sky blue corduroy shirt with a tear in the sleeve and a pair of rumpled khakis; he could have come straight from camping or Bonnaroo. Even just sitting there, he transmitted a strange charisma \u2014 a magnetism, people kept telling me, that was hard to explain but also necessary to explain, because the rapport Miller seems to instantly establish with everyone is a part of his gift as a clinician. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to say that it\u2019s impossible to describe what it feels like to be with him,\u201d Rabow told me. \u201cPeople feel accepted. I think they feel loved.\u201d It\u2019s in the way Miller seems to swaddle you in his attention, the way his goofiness punctures any pretensions. (Miller, who has an unrepentant knucklehead side, habitually addresses other men as \u201cBrother man\u201d or \u201cMon\u201d and insisted to me many times that he hasn\u2019t finished a book in 20 years.) For people who know him, his magic has almost become an exasperating joke. When I spoke to Miller\u2019s childhood friend Justin Burke, he told me a story about Miller running around on a beach with his dog in San Francisco years ago. A man came hobbling over and explained that he was about to have his own leg amputated and that just watching Miller run around like this, on two prosthetics, had instantaneously reassured him that he was going to be O.K. I told Burke to hang on: Someone at Zen Hospice had already told me this story, except that in her version, Miller was running on a trail in Texas. \u201cAsk him how many times it\u2019s happened,\u201d Burke deadpanned. Now Miller also seemed to be on the cusp of modest celebrity. He\u2019d started speaking about death and dying at medical schools and conferences around the country and will soon surface in Oprah\u2019s living room, chatting about palliative care on her \u201cSuper Soul Sunday\u201d TV show. Several of Miller\u2019s colleagues described him to me as exactly the kind of public ambassador their field needed. \u201cWhat B.J. accomplishes is to talk about death without making it sound scary and horrible,\u201d Rita Charon, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical School, says. \u201cWe know from seeing him standing in front of us that he has suffered. We know that he has been at the brink of the abyss that he\u2019s talking about. That gives him an authority that others may not have.\u201d Vicki Jackson, the chief of palliative care at Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed. Nobody welcomes conversations about dying, she said, not even about making the experience less miserable. \u201cBut people will listen to B.J.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jackson pointed to the talk Miller gave to close the TED conference in 2015. Miller described languishing in a windowless, antiseptic burn unit after his amputations. He heard there was a blizzard outside but couldn\u2019t see it himself. Then a nurse smuggled him a snowball and allowed him to hold it. This was against hospital regulations, and this was Miller\u2019s point: There are parts of ourselves that the conventional health care system isn\u2019t equipped to heal or nourish, adding to our suffering. He described holding that snowball as \u201ca stolen moment,\u201d and said, \u201cBut I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin, the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water. In that moment, just being any part of this planet, in this universe, mattered more to me than whether I lived or died.\u201d Miller\u2019s talk has been watched more than five million times. And yet, Jackson told me: \u201cIf I said all that \u2014 \u2018Oh, I could feel the coldness of the snowball ...\u2019 \u2014 you\u2019d be like: \u2018Shut. Up. Shut up!\u2019 But no one is going to question B.J.\u201d Now, at the morning meeting, Miller began describing the case of a young man named Randy Sloan, a patient at U.C.S.F. who died of an aggressive cancer a few weeks earlier at Zen Hospice. In a way, Sloan\u2019s case was typical. It passed through all the same medical decision points and existential themes the doctors knew from working with their own terminal patients. But here, the timeline was so compressed that those themes felt distilled and heightened. And then there was the bracing idiosyncrasy of everything Miller\u2019s staff had been able to do for Sloan at Zen Hospice. Rabow told me that all palliative-care departments and home-hospice agencies believe patients\u2019 wishes should be honored, but Zen Hospice\u2019s small size allows it to \u201cactualize\u201d these ideals more fully. When Miller relayed one detail about Sloan\u2019s stay at the hospice \u2014 it was either the part about the sailing trip or the wedding \u2014 one doctor across the conference table expelled what seemed to be an involuntary, admiring, \u201cWhat?\u201d Everything Miller was saying had a way of sharpening an essential set of questions: What is a good death? How do you judge? In the end, what matters? You got the sense that looking closely at Sloan\u2019s case might even get you close to some answers or, at least, less hopelessly far away. This is the story he told. It started with an email late one night, in April 2015. \u201cI\u2019m the mother of Randy Sloan,\u201d a woman named Melany Baldwin wrote to Miller. She reminded Miller how he met her son the previous year. And then: \u201cAnyway, last week my dear son was diagnosed with mesothelioma,\u201d a rare, terminal cancer. \u201cWe are devastated. He is only 27 years old.\u201d Miller got emails, texts and calls like this almost daily from friends, friends of friends or total strangers. And he put pressure on himself to help as much as he could. But it was also exhausting, and he put equal and opposing pressure on himself to live his own life fully \u2014 a byproduct of his extreme intimacy with mortality. \u201cThe lessons I get from my patients and their families, and from this work,\u201d Miller said, \u201cis to enjoy this big, huge, mystical, crazy, beautiful, wacky world. And I\u2019m too often not doing that. That can feel distressing to me.\u201d A few months earlier, Miller had another brush with death \u2014 a pancreatic-cancer scare that turned out to be nothing \u2014 and he told me that \u201cit was interesting to watch myself play with that thought. Where my mind went was: \u2018Cool. Now I get to quit all this work.\u2019 \u201d Maybe he would just disappear, get weird, grow weed. And so, as it happens, Miller didn\u2019t get Baldwin\u2019s email for several days, because he\u2019d decided to experiment with going off the grid. He went on a weeklong, aimless road trip around the West with his mutt, Maysie, riding shotgun, and he rode his treasured motorcycle \u2014 a sleek, black, heavily customized Aprilia \u2014 up to Sonoma for a weekend with old friends. He was pulled over for speeding on the bike twice. The first cop approached a little freaked out; unable to compute a one-limbed man riding a motorcycle, he mistook Miller\u2019s prosthetic arm for a weapon. \u201cI love bikes,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cI love gyroscopic, two-wheel action!\u201d Mountain biking had become his way of releasing pressure in the turbulent decade after his accident. (Miller sued Princeton and New Jersey Transit, which operated the train, charging that they failed to make safety upgrades after similar accidents in the past. He won settlements totaling nearly $6 million, but was blindsided when some in the press excoriated him as a symbol of America\u2019s binge-drinking youth and their lack of personal responsibility.) He had returned to cycling quickly, tooling around trails with a specialized arm clipped to the handlebar and two prosthetics pedaling. It allowed him to be alone without being lonely, to remind himself that his life still allowed for adventure and risk. Soon, he was wandering into motorcycle dealerships, explaining how badly he wanted to get back on a motorcycle too, asking if anyone could build him one. But for years, none of the mechanics Miller approached would touch the idea: Engineering a machine for a triple-amputee seemed nearly impossible, the potential liability too great. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then, in late 2013, Miller checked out Scuderia West, a boutique motorcycle shop not far from Zen Hospice, in the Mission District. Scuderia was staffed by a crew of young, wisecracking gear-heads, who, after finishing their shifts, stayed late drinking beer and rehabilitating decrepit old bikes for fun. Right away, Miller noticed a different vibe. They were excited by the challenge of retrofitting a bike for him. This was especially true of the young tech who ultimately volunteered to take the project: Melany Baldwin\u2019s son, Randy Sloan. Sloan grew up in Texas. He was bald, with a bushy, reddish beard and a disarming, contented smile. His social life in San Francisco revolved around Scuderia, and he was the baby of the group: not just younger, but more sensitive and trusting. \u201cHe was way too nice to work here,\u201d his friend and co-worker Katie Putman told me. Sloan\u2019s closest relationship may have been with his dog, a husky named Desmo, whom he rescued from a disreputable breeder. The dog was weird-looking: It had one blue eye and one eye that was half-brown and half-blue. (\u201cHe would always select the misfit,\u201d Baldwin said.) Sloan threw himself into overhauling a bike for Miller. For six months, he confronted a cascade of problems \u2014 like how to run all the controls to a single handlebar so Miller could accelerate and brake with one hand \u2014 while Miller made excuses to check in on his progress. \u201cIt was just an immediate man crush,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThe guy was helping me build this dream.\u201d Sloan was feeling it, too. Everyone at Scuderia was. They stalked Miller online, learning about his career at Zen Hospice. His work with the dying impressed them as fearless, just as his conviction to ride a motorcycle again did. Sloan never carried on about people or even talked that much, but he frequently referred to Miller as \u201ca legend,\u201d and those close to him knew what that meant. \u201cThere were not many \u2018legends\u2019 in Randy\u2019s eyes,\u201d Putman said. Sloan finished Miller\u2019s motorcycle in April 2014. A crowd gathered at Scuderia to watch Miller take possession. Sloan had him climb on, then clambered around and under the bike, making final adjustments. Then he stepped back and started, quietly, to cry. Miller was tearing up under his helmet, too. But he didn\u2019t drag things out. He started the engine, said thank you, then streaked down the alleyway at the back of the shop. Everyone hollered and applauded as they watched him disappear down Valencia Street \u2014 very fast, but with a pronounced, unsettling wobble. Miller had been lying. He\u2019d never ridden a motorcycle before. A year later, Miller got Melany Baldwin\u2019s email. Once he was back from his road trip, he contacted Sloan\u2019s doctors at U.C.S.F. to learn more about his case. Sloan was walking Desmo up a hill a few weeks earlier, in April, and found he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He was rushed into surgery, to fix an apparent collapsed lung. But the surgeon discovered a raft of tumors spread across his lung, diaphragm and heart: mesothelioma. The diagnosis alone was improbable. Mesothelioma is typically seen in older people, after long-term asbestos or radiation exposure. And the way the cancer was moving through Sloan\u2019s body was shocking. A subsequent PET scan revealed it had already spread to his pancreas and brain. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His doctors at U.C.S.F. believed the tumor on his brainstem would paralyze him within weeks. And so, Sloan underwent whole-brain radiation to shrink it before attacking everything else. He didn\u2019t want to be cut off from his body \u2014 he wanted to be as much like his old self as possible. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being sick, and I\u2019m sick of talking about being sick,\u201d he kept telling his mother. He insisted that she go back home to Illinois while he returned to the small apartment he shared with two roommates, waiting to start chemo. The next two weeks were grim. Tumors crusted over Sloan\u2019s heart, hindering it from pumping blood through his body. His capillaries began seeping water into his tissues. Soon, his feet were literally leaking, and the retained water cracked his skin from the shins down, mashing him with pain. Sloan\u2019s ankles grew as wide as logs. He started walking with a cane. And because the pain in his torso kept him from lying down or even sitting comfortably, one night he fell asleep standing up and cut his head open when he collapsed. Photo Randy Sloan Credit From Melany Baldwin Putman, Sloan\u2019s friend from Scuderia, had swept in to take care of Desmo, the husky. Now she transitioned into Sloan\u2019s de facto nurse. But Sloan was a bad patient. He played down his condition and seemed to resent Putman\u2019s help, out of shame or guilt. Several times, Putman told me, she had to race to his apartment and take him to the emergency room: \u201cI started calling it our date night.\u201d Finally, she asked Sloan if she should just sleep over. Sloan accepted her offer this way: \u201cI think Desmo would like that.\u201d Early in June, Sloan was readmitted to U.C.S.F., and Baldwin, his mother, returned to San Francisco to be with him. Miller saw both of them for an appointment that morning, and when he walked in, it hit him how quickly Sloan\u2019s body was failing: In roughly six weeks, Sloan had gone from a functioning, happy 27-year-old, walking his dog up a hill, to very clearly dying. His decline was relentless, by any standard. At no point had any doctor been able to give him a single bit of good news. Even now, Sloan\u2019s oncologist was reporting that after the first dose of chemotherapy, his heart was likely too frail to take more. Still, Sloan talked to Miller about \u201cdoing battle\u201d with the cancer and \u201cwinning this thing\u201d; about getting back to work at Scuderia and flying to Illinois, where Baldwin would remarry later that summer. He also wanted to go to Tokyo Disneyland, he said. Miller looked at Sloan, then looked at Baldwin, trying to intuit who knew what and who might have been pretending not to know and how best to gently reconcile everyone\u2019s hopes with the merciless reality. Good palliative-care doctors recognize there\u2019s an art to navigating clinical interactions like this, and Miller seems particularly sensitive to its subtleties. In this case, Miller realized, his job was to \u201cdisillusion\u201d Sloan without devastating him. Hope is a tricky thing, Miller told me. Some terminal patients keep chasing hope through round after round of chemo. But it\u2019s amazing how easily others \u201cre-proportion,\u201d or recalibrate, their expectations: how the hope of making it to a grandchild\u2019s birthday or finishing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d becomes sufficiently meaningful. \u201cThe question becomes,\u201d Miller says, \u201chow do you incorporate those hard facts into your moment-by-moment life instead of trying to run away from them?\u201d At an initial appointment with Sloan, two weeks earlier, Miller made the calculation not to steer Sloan toward any crushing realizations. He worried that if he pushed too hard, Sloan might feel alienated and shut down. (\u201cI needed his allegiance,\u201d Miller later explained; it was more important, in the long term, that Sloan see him as an advocate.) At the second meeting, Miller remembered, \u201cI felt the need to be more brutal.\u201d And, he imagined, by now Sloan would have started to suspect that the story he\u2019d been telling himself didn\u2019t fit the reality. \u201cI just said, \u2018Randy, this is not going like any of us want for you,\u2019 \u201d and Miller began, calmly, to level with him. Traveling was out of the question, Miller explained; best guess, Sloan had a few months to live. \u201cYou could just watch his world collapse,\u201d Miller recalled. \u201cWith each sentence, you\u2019re taking another possibility away.\u201d Sloan started crying. And yet, Baldwin also knew that her son had been waiting for his doctors to say this out loud. Sloan couldn\u2019t understand why, if he had Stage 4 of an incurable cancer, he was still taking 70 pills every day, with the doses laid out in a dizzying flowchart. And as Miller went on, he was stunned by how well Sloan seemed to be absorbing this new information, without buckling under its weight. \u201cHe was actually kind of keeping up with his grief, reconciling the facts of his life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a moving target, and he kept hitting it.\u201d Baldwin told me: \u201cRandy was a simple guy. He would say to me, \u2018Mom, all I want is one ordinary day.\u2019 \u201d He was sick of being sick \u2014 just like he\u2019d been saying. He wanted to go back to living, as best he could. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Quickly the conversation turned to what was next. A standard question in palliative care is \u201cWhat\u2019s important to you now?\u201d But Sloan didn\u2019t muster much of a response, so Miller retooled the question. He told Sloan that nothing about his life was going the way he expected, and his body was only going to keep breaking down. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your favorite part of yourself? What character trait do we want to make sure to protect as everything else falls apart?\u201d Sloan had an immediate answer for this one. \u201cI love everybody I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he said. Baldwin had heard her son say this before, with total earnestness. And he said it with such conviction now that Miller immediately believed it, too. Besides, Miller had already felt it to be true, a year earlier, when he drove his motorcycle away from Sloan at Scuderia. \u201cHe was an amazing person that way,\u201d Miller told me. Sloan got apprehensive when Miller started telling him about Zen Hospice\u2019s residential facility, known as the Guest House; it sounded as if it was for old people. But Miller explained that it was probably the best chance he had for living the last act of his life the way he wanted. His other options were to tough it out at home with two weekly visits from a home hospice nurse or go to a nursing home. At Zen Hospice, Sloan\u2019s friends would always be welcome, and Sloan could come and go as he pleased as long as someone went with him. He could eat what he wanted. He could step out for a cigarette. He could even walk up the street and smoke on his own stoop \u2014 the Guest House was just two blocks from Sloan\u2019s apartment. Besides, Miller told him: \u201cIt\u2019s where I work. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Sloan agreed but didn\u2019t seem entirely comfortable with the idea. He told one of his friends from Scuderia: \u201cI\u2019m moving in with B.J.\u201d Sloan arrived at the Guest House with his mother five days later, on the morning of June 9. He insisted on walking there, trundling the two blocks from his apartment with his cane. The Guest House is a calm, unpretentious space: a large Victorian home with six beds in five bedrooms, vaulted ceilings, slightly shabby furniture and warm, Oriental rugs. There is a large wooden Buddha in the dining room. The kitchen is light-filled and bursting with flowers. There\u2019s always a pot of tea and often freshly baked cookies. And while Zen Hospice has a rotating, 24-hour nursing staff, the tiny nursing station is literally tucked into a kind of cabinet in the hall upstairs; the house, in other words, feels very much like a house, not a hospital. You don\u2019t have to spend much time there to realize that the most crucial, and distinctive, piece of the operation is its staff of volunteers. Freed of most medical duties by the nursing staff, the volunteers act almost as existential nurses. They sit with residents and chat, offering their full attention, unencumbered by the turmoil a family member might feel. The volunteers are ordinary people: retired Macy\u2019s executives, social workers, bakers, underemployed millennials or kibitzing empty-nesters. Many are practicing Buddhists. Many are not. (Miller isn\u2019t.) But Buddhism informs their training. There\u2019s an emphasis on accepting suffering, on not getting tripped up by one\u2019s own discomfort around it. \u201cYou train people not to run away from hard things, not to run away from the suffering of others,\u201d Miller explained. This liberates residents to feel whatever they\u2019re going to feel in their final days, even to fall apart. At first, many volunteers experience a confused apprehension. They arrive expecting nonstop, penetrating metaphysical conversations with wise elderly people and instead just wind up plying them for recipes or knitting advice or watching \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d with them or restocking latex gloves for the Guest House nurses. But one especially well-liked volunteer, Josh Kornbluth, told me that, after a year working at the Guest House, he understood that the value of Zen Hospice is actually \u201cin the quotidian \u2014 the holding of someone\u2019s hand, bringing them food that\u2019s been beautifully arranged on the plate, all the small ways of showing respect to that person as a living person and not as \u2018predeceased.\u2019 Those are actually deep things. And I say that as the least Zen person!\u201d In fact, Kornbluth was raised by Jewish Communists in New York City, and once, after a woman died at the Guest House and no more-senior volunteer was on hand to take charge, I watched him \u2014 adrenalized, uneasy, perspiring \u2014 fumble around on his iPhone for something to say over the body before they wheeled it away, then mangle the pronunciation of Thich Nhat Hanh.
