We know nothing about them,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday. \"They can say they vet them. They didn't vet them. They have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don't know anything about them and you have no papers?\" Though the United States government already utilizes a thorough nine-step vetting system for refugees, the president's executive order is said to go further. It is still unclear what these steps would mean and if it would target any particular religious group as the president stated on the campaign trail. According to the Pew Research Center , the United States welcomed almost 85,000 refugees in 2016. Forty-six percent of them were Muslim. The president sets the number of refugees accepted annually into the U.S. and from that authority can suspend the program at any time. President George W. Bush took similar actions following the 9/11 attacks when the program was suspended for several months. Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the Homeland Security committee, said on Friday that he applauds the president's move. \"We are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\" McCaul said in a statement. \"Today, President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States.\" The response from advocates for refugee rights was swift. \"I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war,\" Malala Yousafzai, a student activist and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate said in a statement through a press office. \"I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants \u2014 the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the social media platform to express his concern about the executive order' impact on those fleeing violence and oppression in their homelands. His great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. The parents of his wife, Priscilla, were refugees from China and Vietnam. \"We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation,\" he wrote . \"We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today.\" Trump also called for a \"great rebuilding\" of the nation's military. \"New planes, new ships, new resources, new tools for our men and women in uniform.\" Halimah Abdullah ",

    "text": "Donald Trump Says He'll Give Christian Refugees Priority By Meghan Keneally Jan 27, 2017, 5:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump Signs Executive Orders at Pentagon 0 Shares Email Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to cut down or stop the number of refugees entering the country, but he has now said that persecuted Christians will be treated as priorities. During an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, the president said today that Christians in Syria have been treated unfairly in the refugee process. \"They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them,\" Trump said in a clip of the interview that was released this afternoon. Trump Speaks to Mexican President by Phone 1 Day After Canceling Meeting In the remarks released by CBN in advance of the full interview airing on Sunday, Trump did not give any examples or cite evidence to support his claim that it is more difficult for Syrian Christians to gain refugee status than Syrian Muslims . According to the CIA World Factbook , as of June 2014, 87 percent of Syrians were Muslim while 10 percent were Christian. And likewise, there were more Muslim refugees from Syria who came to the United States last year than Christian refugees. The Refugee Processing Center reports that in 2016, there were 15,302 Muslims who arrived in the U.S. from Syria and there were 93 people, also from Syria, who identified as either Catholic, Christian, Protestant or Jehovah's Witness. \"The Middle East is a region of extraordinary ethnic and religious diversity,\" said Chris Boian, the senior communications officer of the U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR. \"UNHCR believes that any human being that has been forced to flee his or her homeland to escape life-threatening conflict and persecution should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\" he told ABC News. 0 Shares ",

President Donald Trump, left, hands Defense Secretary James Mattis, right, a pen after he signed an executive action on rebuilding the military during an event at the Pentagon in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. (Susan Walsh / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Setting a hard-line tone on national security, President Donald Trump on Friday ordered strict new screening for refugees to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States and alternated tough talk with kind words in his diplomatic standoff with Mexico. Trump traveled to the Pentagon where he joined Defense Secretary James Mattis for the signing of an executive action to bring sweeping changes to the nation's refugee policies and put in motion his plans to build up the nation's military. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" During his election campaign against Hillary Clinton, Trump pledged to put in place \"extreme vetting\" procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. The White House did not immediately release details on the order Trump signed, but a draft of the order called for suspending the issuing of visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 30 days. Donald Trump has repeatedly characterized as incubators of crime are generally safer than other cities, according to a new analysis of FBI crime data. There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, but most observers adopt criteria used by Immigration and... The so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that Donald Trump has repeatedly characterized as incubators of crime are generally safer than other cities, according to a new analysis of FBI crime data. There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, but most observers adopt criteria used by Immigration and... (Christopher Ingraham) Joined earlier in the day at the White House by British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump reaffirmed the United States' \"special relationship\" with Great Britain. But he was also asked about more contentious issues, including his recent statements that torture \"does work\" in prying information out of terror suspects. Giving ground, he said his defense secretary's opposition would override his own belief. Hours later he stood at the Pentagon as Mattis, the retired general, was sworn in as the military's chief. Trump was also pressed on whether he would revert back to Bush-era use of torture, in the news since The Associated Press and other news organizations obtained copies of a draft executive order signaling sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. Trump said he would defer to the views of Mattis, who has questioned the effectiveness of such practices as waterboarding, which simulates drowning. \"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. ... I don't necessarily agree. But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert,\" Trump said. The draft order, which the White House said was not official, also would reverse Obama's effort to close the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba \u2014 a place Trump has said he wants to fill up \"with bad dudes.\" Trump Bryan R.

(Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) The draft also requests recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America's image on the world stage Trump held firm Friday on another controversy \u2014 trade and illegal immigration from Mexico. He told reporters at a joint news conference with May that he had a \"very good call\" with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto earlier in the day, but he reaffirmed his belief that Mexico has \"outnegotiated and beat us to a pulp\" on trade \u2014 and that would change. \"We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing,\" he declared a day after the Mexican leader canceled his visit to Washington in response to Trump's plans to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it. While the refugee actions are aimed at thwarting terrorists, the border wall is more for keeping out immigrants trying to enter the U.S. for economic reasons \u2014 though Trump has continually also raised concerns about criminals flowing north. The flurry of national security moves and foreign policy outreach capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House, giving Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the United States around the globe.

(Louisa Gouliamaki / AFP/Getty Images) Trump, who met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, has the authority to determine how many refugees are accepted annually, and he can suspend the program at any time. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later. During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. Trump, according to the draft of the executive action, plans to cut that to 50,000. The draft order says that while the program is suspended, the U.S. may admit people on a case-by-case basis \"when in the national interest\" and the government will continue to process refugee requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion ... is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" That suggests it would allow the admission of Christians from Muslim-majority countries. In an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status. \"We are going to help them,\" Trump said. \"They've been horribly treated.\" Applauded by some in his own party, Trump's refugee action was strongly criticized by some Democrats.

By Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff By Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff January 27 at 3:29 PM Follow @missy_ryan Follow @Tmgneff President Trump announced two executive actions, one relating to vetting refugees, the other to increased military funding, on Jan. 27 at the Pentagon. (The Washington Post) President Trump paid his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Friday, signing executive actions subjecting potential immigrants to greater scrutiny and seeking to enhance American military power. Appearing at the\u00a0Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes, which honors military personnel who have received the Medal of Honor, Trump held up an order he said would establish new measures designed to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from entering the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said, flanked by Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.\u201d The text of the orders was not immediately available. A draft of one executive order obtained this week by The Washington Post, in keeping with Trump\u2019s campaign promises to subject immigrants to \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d\u00a0laid out plans for a\u00a0temporary ban on the entry of people from certain countries, many of them majority Muslim. It also ordered a temporary halt to refugee admission, prompting an outcry from civil rights groups. Some advocates have said the measures, if implemented, would amount to a ban on Muslims entering the country. [ Draft executive order would begin \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 of immigrants and visitors to the U.S. ] Trump said in remarks before a crowd of current and retired defense officials that he was also signing an order that would \u201cbegin a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States,\u201d including plans for new aircraft, ships and other military equipment. The incoming administration has already signaled its intent to restore defense funding and improve military capabilities following a period of declining budgets and shrinking ranks. In another\u00a0 draft executive order \u00a0obtained this week, the White House instructed Mattis to conduct a 30-day review of military readiness and lay plans for ensuring the United States can meet a host of challenges, not only such terrorist groups as the Islamic State but also \u201cnear-peer\u201d nations that could include Russia and China. It also signaled a desire to invest in a host of military capabilities, including Special Operations forces and nuclear weapons. It was not immediately clear if the draft orders made public this week were the same ones signed by Trump on Friday. [ What is an executive order? And how do President Trump\u2019s stack up? ] In his first week in office, Trump has created anxiety among allies by staking out positions in favor of waterboarding, insisting that North American Free Trade Agreement partner Mexico will pay for a wall along the U.S. border and laying out a number of controversial executive orders. His\u00a0first official interaction with senior military leaders suggested he will attempt to follow through on promises to grow U.S. defenses, boost military spending, and restore personnel cut in recent years. But it provided few clues about how a leader with little national security experience will approach fraught issues including the potential for conflict with nations like China and North Korea and decisions on when to risk American lives overseas. After\u00a0a visit of about 90 minutes that included a meeting with senior uniformed officials, Trump\u00a0said that the Hall of Heroes, one of the Pentagon\u2019s most solemn spaces, was a \u201ctestament to the undying courage\u201d of U.S. service members. Appearing to read from prepared remarks, Trump spoke in noticeably\u00a0more somber tones than he did in front of the CIA\u2019s Memorial Wall last weekend. The new president was criticized by some former officials for failing to show adequate gravity during that event. \u201cI am privileged to be here with you and I promise that our administration will always have your back,\u201d Trump said, addressing U.S. service members. \u201cWe will always be with you.\u201d In his remarks, Trump repeatedly praised Mattis, a retired Marine officer with a long combat record who Trump called \u201ca general\u2019s general.\u201d Already, Mattis has already suggested he may differ with his commander-in-chief on key issues such as the importance of the NATO alliance. [ Draft executive order shows how Trump wants to grow the U.S. military significantly ] Earlier in the day, speaking alongside visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump suggested he would defer to Mattis on treatment of detainees. Trump has said he favors waterboarding, while Mattis does not. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree, but I would tell you that [Mattis] will override because I\u2019m giving him that power,\u201d Trump said of harsh interrogation methods. Trump, who has tapped a number of prominent former generals to lead his national security team, has also promised to aggressively combat militant groups as part of his drive to exterminate \u201cradical Islamism.\u201d Trump takes command as U.S. advisers support local troops battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, U.S. military personnel have coached Iraqi commanders as they oversee a push through the city of Mosul, seized by militants more than two years ago. In Syria, a small force of Special Operations troops are working with a Kurdish-led force laying the groundwork for an assault on Raqqa, another Islamic State stronghold. Military officials have been developing options that the incoming administration might support in the campaign against the Islamic State. Those could include the authority to place U.S. troops even closer to the front lines in Iraq, increased forces for Syria and greater authority for military commanders to expand the way U.S. forces are used without going to the White House for approval. A defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said Trump\u2019s meeting with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officials\u00a0lasted roughly an hour. Trump was accompanied by his national security adviser, retired Gen. Mike Flynn, and the meeting covered a broad array of topics, including the role of the national guard and the responsibilities of the combatant commands, the official said. Officials agreed on the need to accelerate progress against the Islamic State, though it was unclear if a timeline or specifics were addressed. While North Korea and other threats were discussed, the official declined to say if Russia was another topic. In a statement issued after Trump\u2019s visit, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that Mattis shared \u201cthe president\u2019s goal of ensuring our military leaders have the support they need to accelerate the campaign against [the Islamic State], and to build combat readiness now and for the future.\u201d John Wagner and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.

The two spoke for about an hour, and both presidents made an effort to say that the call had been productive, suggesting that tensions had cooled, at least publicly. But they stood their ground on their positions, with no suggestion that the call had resolved their disagreement over fundamental issues. \u201cWith respect to the payment for the border wall, both presidents recognized their clear and very public difference between their stances on this very sensitive issue,\u201d the Mexican president\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe presidents also agreed for now to not speak publicly about this controversial issue.\u201d The standoff with Mexico\u2019s president has been the first full-blown foreign policy clash with a foreign leader for the Trump administration. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After Mr. Trump ordered the border wall to be built , months of tensions between the two men came to a boil this week. On Thursday, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has long urged diplomacy in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexico, canceled a meeting with the new American leader. Mr. Trump quickly fired back, saying that Mexico saddles the United States with criminals, illegal immigrants and unfair trade. On Friday, he repeated the same themes. \u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a news conference in Washington. \u201cThe border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re no longer going to be the country that doesn\u2019t know what it is doing.\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cI have great respect for the Mexico. I love the Mexican people.\u201d But \u201cas you know,\u201d he added, Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders.\u201d Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Brown, AFP/Getty Images) 30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump ended his first week in office Friday by ordering the State Department to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures for immigrants from countries with ties to terrorism. After speaking at the Pentagon, Trump signed an executive order to implement the new vetting measures to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States.\u00a0Doing so, he said, is one\u00a0way to honor the sacrifices made by Americans who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001,\u00a0and those fighting terrorism around the world. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" Trump's expected ban on refugees, who could be affected? Media outlets, including the New York Times and Reuters, have reported this week that Trump's order would suspend the U.S. refugee program and temporarily halt all legal immigration from Syria and six other countries with close ties to terrorism.\u00a0The White House did not immediately release the order Trump signed on Friday, but critics and supporters responded quickly. Trump drew widespread condemnation from Democrats, immigrant and civil rights groups\u00a0around the world. The American Civil Liberties Union described Trump's \"extreme vetting\" as \"just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims.\" And\u00a0David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said the order was completely unnecessary since the U.S. already has the \"strongest, most successful\" resettlement program in the world. \"In truth, refugees are fleeing terror \u2014 they are not terrorists,\" Miliband said. \"And at a time when there are more refugees than ever, America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" This is what it looks like for refugees rescued from Mediterranean Sea Congressional Republicans said they would work with Trump to implement the new vetting procedures. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, described the U.S. refugee program\u00a0as a \"Trojan Horse\" for would-be terrorists that had been ignored by President Obama. \"President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States,\" McCaul said. \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\" President Obama had increased the refugee resettlement program during his time in office, increasing the cap from 60,000 to 70,000 to 85,000 in 2016. He reserved 10,000 of those spots for refugees from Syria. While Trump has claimed that most Syrian refugees coming to the U.S are single, military-age men, the\u00a0State Department said those numbers didn't add up. As of Nov. 2015, 77% of Syrian refugees who entered the U.S. were women and children. Only 23% were adult men, and only 2% were \"single men unattached to families.\" 30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jGhjoD NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Donald Trump speaks about immigration and refugees during a campaign event in Sunrise, Fla., on Aug. 10, 2016. (Cristobal Herrera / European Pressphoto Agency) Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman Contact Reporters President Trump signed an executive order Friday that would temporarily halt the nation\u2019s refugee program and usher in the most sweeping changes in more than 40 years to how the U.S. welcomes the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. The order would block all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and suspend the acceptance of refugees from war-torn Syria indefinitely. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not letting into our country the very threats that our soldiers are fighting overseas,\u201d Trump said after swearing in new Defense Secretary James N. Mattis at the Pentagon. Trump would also block visa applicants entirely from a list of countries that the administration considers of major terrorism concern, including Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, until a new \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedure for visa applicants can be launched. Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States Open link The action capped Trump\u2019s frenetic first week in the White House, as well as a busy day that included his first meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May. Trump also spoke by phone for about an hour with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, attempting to soothe what has already become a tense relationship. And he swore in Mattis and signed a second directive that instructs the Pentagon to draw up a list of plans to upgrade equipment and improve training. The U.S. has admitted more than 3.3 million refugees since 1975, including more than 80,000 refugees in the last year. Under Trump\u2019s plan, those numbers would plummet to a trickle for the next several months. For the full fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the order sets a cap of 50,000 refugees. The order provides an exception for \u201creligious minorities,\u201d a category that could include Christians fleeing largely Muslim countries as well as other groups including Yazidis and Bahais that face persecution in the Mideast. Trump said in an interview Friday with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the order would help Christians fleeing Syria enter the United States. The order also expands the ability of local jurisdictions to block the settlement of refugees they object to. During the Obama administration, the federal government stopped efforts by some local officials to block refugee resettlements. Trump\u2019s action, seen as part of his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, sparked an international outcry, given the historic role that the U.S. and other industrialized nations have long played in embracing victims of war and oppression. The last major change in U.S. refugee policy came during the Vietnamese resettlement programs of the mid-1970s. In recent months, Trump has backed away from a blanket ban on Muslims and instead said he would focus on blocking people from countries linked to terrorism. Democrats, however, say the new order is just a more cleverly worded way of achieving the same goal. And the Council on American-Islamic Relations immediately announced that it would sue. \u201cMake no mistake \u2014 this is a Muslim ban,\u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris of California. \u201cBroad-brush discrimination against refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, most of whom are women and children, runs counter to our national security interests, and will likely be used as a terrorist recruitment tool.\u201d But Trump won backing from some key congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who leads the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cWe are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants,\u201d McCaulsaid. \u201cBut as we know, terrorists are dead-set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan horse to attack us.\u201d The new vetting procedures would block admission of individuals who engage in \u201cacts of bigotry or hatred\u201d or \u201cwould oppress members of one race, one gender or sexual orientation.\u201d Trump called the vetting procedures \u201ctotally extreme\u201d during an interview with Fox News on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have extreme vetting for people coming into our country, and if we think there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s not going to be so easy for people to come in anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the president of a safe country,\u201d Trump told ABC News on Wednesday when asked about the policy. \u201cWe have enough problems.\u201d In the ABC interview, Trump said Germany and other European countries had made a \u201ctremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people.\u201d He said residents of countries left out of the ban \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia \u2014 would nonetheless face what he calls \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d and dismissed concerns that his actions will inflame tensions in the Muslim world. \u201cThe world is as angry as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat, you think this is going to cause a little more anger?\u201d Critics called Trump\u2019s order a betrayal of long-held American ideals. \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said in a statement. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , whose family fled the communist takeover of then-Czechoslovakia when she was a child, said she had benefited personally from the American \u201ctradition of openness.\u201d \u201cThis order would end that tradition and discriminate against those fleeing a brutal civil war in Syria. It does not represent who we are as a country,\u201d she said. Traditionally, the U.S. has accepted refugees based on their \u201cvulnerability\u201d and their ties to friends and family in the U.S., said Michelle Bran\u00e9, a director at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission. \u201cReligion and nationality are factors to consider in evaluating the refugee claim, but the program should not exclude a refugee on one of those grounds alone,\u201d she said. Several of those who condemned Trump\u2019s order noted that it was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day , a reminder that thousands of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany were denied safe harbors in the United States and elsewhere, forcing them back to Nazi-controlled territory, where many were murdered. \u201cDonald Trump is retracting the promise of American freedom to an extent we have not seen from a president since Franklin Roosevelt forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York City.

Trump signed the executive action at the Pentagon, where he met with the joint chiefs of staff and participated in the swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary James Mattis. \"We don\u2019t want them here.\" - President Trump Trump said the new measure was intended \u201cto keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Trump said. The executive order also suspends visa entry into the U.S. from seven countries that have predominately Muslim populations. They include: Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen. The order also creates an \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process for any and all immigrants and visitors to the U.S. \u00a0 House Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News, \u201cIt\u2019s a safer day for America.\u201d American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero blasted Trump's plan as unconstitutional. \u201c\u2018Extreme vetting\u2019 is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" Romero said in a statement issued moments after the signing. \"Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions.\" Trump defended the executive order during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \"Right now, the FBI has over 1,000 [terrorism] investigations going on \u2026 and these are people that we let in,\" Trump said from the White House Thursday. \"We don\u2019t need this. Some people have come in with evil intentions. Most haven\u2019t, I guess, but we can\u2019t take chances.\" Trump added that the U.S. has taken in tens of thousands of people. \u201cWe know nothing about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say they vetted them. They didn\u2019t vet them, they have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don\u2019t know anything about them and they have no papers?\u201d Civil rights and refugee advocates around the world have sounded the alarm over Trump\u2019s executive order after a draft copy was leaked late Wednesday. \u201cThese actions taken by Donald Trump are tantamount to a Muslim ban,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, the legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u201cThis is the Muslim ban that was promised by him on the campaign trail.\u201d As president, Trump has the authority to set how many refugees are allowed in annually. He can also choose to suspend the program altogether. Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush suspended refugee processing. It was later restarted. In the last budget year, the U.S. has accepted 84,995 refugees of which 12,587 were from Syria. Former President Barack Obama set the refugee limit for the current budget year at 110,000. Sources close to Trump tell Fox News he has plans to cut that by more than half to 50,000. In an interview with CBN, Trump said persecuted Christians from Syria would get priority. \u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "info <p>This photo provided by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows agents taking a person into custody in New Jersey, March 28, 2012, during operation Cross Check III, a federal arrest sweep of undocumented immigrants who allegedly committed serious crimes or were considered threats to national security.</p> Close AP Photo/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement NEW YORK - President Donald Trump signed an executive order \u00a0Wednesday that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a weekly list of \u201ccriminal actions committed by aliens.\u201d \u201cMany aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety,\u201d the order states. \u201cThis is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 The order also calls for the establishment of an Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens, to, among other things, study \u201cthe effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security did not provide answers to Crimesider \u2019s questions regarding how the federal government would go about collecting this data from the nation\u2019s more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies, but the order nonetheless begs the question, how big a problem is crime committed by immigrants? Florida State University Professor of Criminology Daniel Mears says that \u201cgood data\u201d focused on immigrant criminality - specifically undocumented immigrant criminality - is scarce. Determining definitively whether someone who has been arrested is in the country legally can take significant effort, and the result might not be noted in all law enforcement records. In addition, researchers often have to rely on arrest and conviction numbers, which may be misleading because they can reflect law enforcement priorities more than criminal behavior. A jurisdiction might see a spike one year, for example, if a police chief or prosecutor decides to prioritize enforcement against immigrants.\u00a0 Despite this, Mears and others who study this subject seem to agree that most research indicates immigrants actually commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. According to analysis of the 2010 census and the American Communities Survey done by the non-profit \u00a0 American Immigration Council , immigrants to the United States are significantly less likely than native-born citizens to be incarcerated. The authors found that 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born. Murder in San Francisco sparks immigration debate The divide was even sharper when the authors examined the incarceration rate among immigrant men the authors believe likely to be undocumented \u2014 specifically less-educated men from El Salvador and Guatemala between age 18-29. According to AIC senior researcher Walter Ewing, there are very few ways for men in this demographic to emigrate legally. According to the analysis, these likely undocumented immigrants had an incarceration rate of 1.7 percent, compared with 10.7 percent for native-born men without a high school diploma. One study published in the journal Criminology and Public Policy in 2008 looked at recidivism among inmates at the Los Angeles County Jail in 2002 and the authors wrote that their results \u201clend no support to the ubiquitous assertion that deportable aliens are a unique threat to public safety.\u201d\u00a0 This conclusion is no surprise to Christopher Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University who has studied antisocial behavior like drug use, gambling and fighting in immigrant and non-immigrant populations. \u201cThe evidence is really compelling that immigrants are involved in these behaviors at a far lower rate than native-born Americans,\u201d Salas-Wright says. A paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2007 found that immigrants had incarceration rates about one-fifth that of native-born Americans, and that the difference actually increased between 1980 and 2000. The reasons for this so-called \u201cimmigrant paradox\u201d aren\u2019t fully understood, said Salas-Wright, but \u201cone theory is people who choose to pick up their lives and move to a foreign country and set up a new life tend to be healthier people. And they tend to be interested in making this new life work.\u201d In other words, he said, after undertaking the economic and social sacrifice necessary to emigrate, it doesn\u2019t make sense to imperil that new life by committing crime or engaging in risky behavior. During his campaign, President Trump often spoke about immigrants as criminals, and highlighted violent crimes to make his point, including the 2015 shooting death of Kathryn Steinle , who authorities say was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been deported five times. It was a powerful example, but not exactly representative of the millions of immigrants living in the country today, researchers say. Kathryn Steinle, left, and Francisco Sanchez Close \u201cTo ascribe group guilt to crimes just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says AIC\u2019s Walter Ewing. \u201cIf every time a native-born white man shot up a mall we tried to round up all native-born white men, it wouldn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Steinle was killed in San Francisco, a so-called \u201c sanctuary city ,\u201d which offers certain protections for undocumented immigrants who might otherwise be deported by federal immigration officials. Mayors of some sanctuary cities, including Philadelphia\u2019s Jim Kenney , Boston\u2019s Martin Walsh , New York\u2019s Bill de Blasio, and Chicago\u2019s Rahm Emanuel argue that forcing local law enforcement to act as immigration officers will deter immigrants from reporting crime and negatively impact public safety. U.S. leaders split over Trump's crackdown on \"sanctuary cities\" As part of Trump\u2019s order to compile a weekly list of \u201ccriminal actions committed by aliens,\u201d the president directed that the list include \u201cany jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\u201d While there is no doubt that some immigrants commit crimes, Salas-Wright says that the myth that they are generally criminals is \u201ctoo bad, because it doesn\u2019t match up with what we know.\u201d\u00a0 To this point, FSU\u2019s Mears wonders what Trump\u2019s plan to create a public list of crimes committed by \u201caliens\u201d is supposed to accomplish. \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal here? If the goal is to vilify immigrants or to create the appearance that immigrants disproportionately contribute to crime in America \u2014 which isn\u2019t true \u2014 then that makes sense. But if the goal is to reduce crime, this isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.\u201d Anne Piehl, the director of the Program in Criminal Justice at Rutgers University, agrees, saying that immigration and crime have, since at least the 1920s, gotten \u201cconflated in ways that I don\u2019t think are particularly productive in terms of policy.\u201d She continues: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about immigration issues as a way to solve the crime problem, but if we really want solve the crime problem, immigration is a very small part of it.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
