    "text": "<p>Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager and senior advisor to the Trump Presidential Transition Team, speaks to the media at Trump Tower in New York, U.S. November 16, 2016.&nbsp;</p> Close REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, drew widespread criticism Sunday after she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s press briefing on inauguration crowd sizes , saying the newly minted spokesman had given \u201calternative facts\u201d to those cited in media reports. Chuck Todd, of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d asked Conway early Sunday morning why Mr. Trump had Spicer utter a \u201cfalsehood\u201d the first time he formally faced reporters from the White House briefing room. \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d Todd questioned, referencing Spicer\u2019s incorrect assertion that the audience at Friday\u2019s inauguration was the largest to ever witness the ceremony both in person and around the globe. \u201cIt undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office on day one.\u201d Conway dismissed the question. \u201cDon\u2019t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s a falsehood and they\u2019re giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.\u201d \u201cAlternative facts?\u201d Todd shot back. \u201cLook, alternative facts are not facts, they\u2019re falsehoods.\u201d The television host followed up on the continuing argument over audience turnout, which Mr. Trump also harped on Saturday while visiting CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. \u201cWhat was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?\u201d Todd pressed. Conway quipped: \u201cYour job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president. That\u2019s not your job.\u201d The senior Trump defended Spicer further against Todd: \u201cChuck, I mean, if we\u2019re going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think that we\u2019re going to have to rethink our relationship here,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to gave a great open relationship with our press.\u201d Following the interview, social media exploded with a new trending topic: \u201c#AlternativeFacts.\u201d Twitter users criticized Conway\u2019s television appearance by coming up with their own \u201calternative facts.\u201d\u00a0 As a member of the @backstreetboys , I had a love child with @BettyMWhite . #AlternativeFacts \u2014 Lance Bass (@LanceBass) January 22, 2017 I'm about to devour this alt-salad. #alternativefacts pic.twitter.com/EZKdmDN1RP \u2014 Andrea Chalupa (@AndreaChalupa) January 22, 2017 Even a member of Congress got in on the social media action: BREAKING NEWS: @seanspicer at #WhiteHouse says Warriors beat Cavs in championship game last year. Period. #alternativefacts \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) January 22, 2017 And the Merriam-Webster dictionary company seemed to play on the trend Sunday, tweeting out its definition of the word \u201cfact.\u201d \uf4c8A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality. https://t.co/gCKRZZm23c \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 22, 2017 Spicer himself has previously promised not to tell falsehoods to the White House press corps as an administration official. During an appearance at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics earlier this month, Spicer told David Axelrod: \u201cI don\u2019t think any communicator worth their salt to go out and tell a lie...To go out and tell a lie is something that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d \u201cI may tell a reporter I can\u2019t comment on something\u2026 I\u2019m not able to discuss it. But I\u2019ve never lied,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI would argue that anybody who\u2019s an aspiring communicator adhere to that.

Trump didn\u2019t agree with some in the intelligence community\u2019s who concluded that Russia influenced the 2016 White House race to help him win. And he argued more recently that somebody within that community leaking an unofficial dossier with alleged damaging personal information about him was like living in \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d Priebus told Fox that \u201cone bad actor\u201d likely leaked the document so Trump wasn\u2019t angry at all of the country\u2019s intelligence officers. \u201cI\u2019m telling you; It was a love fest in there,\u201d Priebus said about Trump\u2019s visit at CIA headquarters that was attended by about 300 staffers. He also suggested that a reporter was at best careless in erroneously reporting that Trump has removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. \u201cIt could have had explosive ramifications. \u2026 It was shoot first, point later,\u201d he said about the inaccurate report, for which the reporter later apologized. Priebus also defended Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s comments Saturday about the news media underreporting the crowd size at Trump\u2019s swearing-in Friday. At a hastily called White House press conference, Spicer angrily accused the media of \u201cfalse reporting\u201d on the inauguration as part of what he called a \u201cshameful\u201d attempt to minimize enthusiasm for Trump. He then left without taking questions. Priebus said Sunday: \u201cThe point is not the crowd. The point is the media is trying to delegitimize the presidency.\" Advertisement ",

At least 14 people died and around two dozen were injured in Georgia from tornadoes early Sunday morning, following four tornado-related deaths that occurred in Mississippi on Saturday morning. According to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, three people died in Dougherty County near Albany, seven in Cook County near Adel, and two people died in both Berrien and Brooks counties. Branden Camp/AP Photo Marilyn Bullard makes her way to her parents home that was damaged by a tornado, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Georgia. After storms ripped through the region overnight, more tornado watches were issued today for the Panhandle of Florida and southern Alabama, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency has issued a state of emergency for the seven south central Georgia counties impacted by the storm. \"The National Weather Service predicts a third wave of severe weather today, which may reach as far north as metro Atlanta. I urge all Georgians to exercise caution and vigilance in order to remain safe and prevent further loss of life or injuries,\" Gov. Nathan Deal said in a statement. Branden Camp/AP Photo Jenny Bullard carries a pair of boots from her home that was damaged by a tornado, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Georgia. President Trump expressed condolences to the people of Georgia affected by the tornadoes to the press today from the White House. \"I want to start off by telling you I just spoke with Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia, great state, great people,\" Trump said. \"Florida affected, Alabama affected by the tornadoes, and just expressed our sincere condolences for the lives taken.\" Trump added that the tornadoes \"were vicious and powerful and strong,\" and said that people suffered as a result of them. \"So we'll be helping out the state of Georgia,\" Trump added. Images on social media showed telephone poles cracked in half, and what looked like entire streets torn apart by the storms that have churned through the South this weekend.

In the area of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where at least four people died, a large tornado leveled homes and buildings, trapping residents in their homes, authorities said. Further north in Choctaw County, Mississippi, on Saturday at least four people were injured and at least 20 homes damaged from a possible tornado, according to the National Weather Service.

Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! Got it (Reuters) By Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan By Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan January 22 at 12:44 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @WaPoSean President Trump\u2019s executive order instructing federal agencies to grant relief to constituencies affected by the Affordable Care Act has begun to reverberate throughout the nation\u2019s health-care system, injecting further uncertainty into an already unsettled insurance landscape. The political signal of the order, which Trump signed just hours after being sworn into office, was clear: Even before the Republican-led Congress acts to repeal the 2010 law, the new administration will move swiftly to unwind as many elements as it can on its own \u2014 elements that have changed how 20 million Americans get health coverage and what benefits insurers must offer some of their customers. But the practical implications of Trump\u2019s action on Friday are harder to decipher. Its language instructs all federal agencies to \u201cwaive, defer, grant \u00adexemptions from or delay\u201d any part of the law that imposes a financial or regulatory burden on those affected by it. That would cover consumers, doctors, hospitals and other providers, as well as insurers and drug companies. The prospect of what could flow from pulling back or eliminating administrative rules \u2014 including no longer enforcing the individual mandate, which requires Americans to get coverage or pay an annual penalty, and ending health plans\u2019 \u201cessential benefits\u201d \u2014 could affect how many people sign up on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces before open enrollment ends Jan. 31 for 2017 coverage, as well as how many companies decide to participate next year. Robert Laszewski, president of the consulting firm Health Policy and Strategy Associates, called the executive order a \u201cbomb\u201d lobbed into the law\u2019s \u201calready shaky\u201d insurance market. Given the time it will take Republicans to fashion a replacement, he expects that federal and state insurance exchanges will continue to operate at least through 2018. \u201cInstead of sending a signal that there\u2019s going to be an orderly transition, they\u2019ve sent a signal that it\u2019s going to be a disorderly transition,\u201d said Laszewski, a longtime critic of the law , which is also known as Obamacare. \u201cHow does the Trump administration think this is not going to make the situation worse?\u201d [Trump signs executive order that could effectively gut Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate] Teresa Miller, Pennsylvania\u2019s insurance commissioner, said Saturday that several insurers on her state\u2019s exchange \u201cseriously considered leaving the market last year\u201d and that Trump\u2019s action could propel them to indeed abandon it in 2018. In fact, she added, some have raised the possibility of withdrawing from the ACA\u2019s exchanges during 2017, which would mean consumers could keep their plans but no longer receive federal subsidies to help them afford the coverage. \u201cThat would create a nightmare scenario,\u201d Miller said. As of this year, nearly a third of all counties nationwide have just one insurer in the federal marketplace, and almost two-thirds have two or fewer insurers. The White House did not return requests for comment over the weekend. On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders offered cautious praise for the president\u2019s executive order. Yet more broadly, the GOP remains in a state of uncertainty on health care, with unresolved questions about the path forward. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was briefed on the details of Trump\u2019s order only Thursday, according to a GOP aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks. Alexander said in a statement late Friday that Trump was \u201cright to make the urgent work of rescuing Americans trapped in a collapsing Obamacare system a top priority on his first day in office.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace,\u201d focused primarily on what Trump could do through executive action. \u201cPresident Obama implemented a lot of Obamacare himself, so President Trump will be able to undo a lot of it himself,\u201d McConnell said. Asked whether he knew what the new president\u2019s replacement plan is, he said Senate Republicans are working with the administration \u201cto have an orderly process.\u201d The GOP-led House and Senate have passed a budget measure that was designed to serve as a vehicle for repealing key parts of the law. But they have yet to rally around a consensus idea for when and what to do to replace it. They were placed under further pressure to act quickly after Trump vowed \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d in a recent interview with The Washington Post. A key Trump ally said Sunday that the president\u2019s decision to sign the order on his first day in office, coupled with his recent comments about moving swiftly on repealing and replacing the law, has applied pressure on GOP lawmakers to act faster than they might have initially planned. \u201cI think Trump has consistently moved that needle with the mindset of our conference,\u201d Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said. [ Pressure mounts on GOP for an Obamacare replacement ] Democratic leaders, however, are casting the executive order as evidence that Republicans are in a state of disarray on health care. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do. They can repeal, but they don\u2019t have a plan for replace,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said in an interview that aired Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s executive order just mirrored that.\u201d At least publicly, the insurance industry\u2019s reaction has been muted. America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow, whose group represents nearly 1,300 insurers, said in an email Saturday that it is \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d what the executive order will mean for the industry. \u201cThere is no question the individual health-care market has been challenged from the start,\u201d Grow said. \u201cThe president said he would take swift action to move our country to improve it, and he has.\u201d A key question following Trump\u2019s order is what actions Republican-led states might take to withdraw from key provisions of the law. Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s (R) office said Saturday that he was reviewing his options. Jackie Schutz, a Scott spokeswoman, said the governor \u201cappreciates\u201d that the new administration is \u201cswiftly taking action.\u201d But as to how and when Scott would seek to take advantage of it, \u201cwe\u2019re still looking into it to see what it specifically means to Florida,\u201d Schutz said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who met with Senate Finance Committee Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and nearly a dozen other GOP governors on Thursday to discuss the future of Medicaid, said afterward that there are \u201csome fundamental things that we can do that can settle people down so they are not worried they are going to lose their coverage but that at the same time bring significant changes to the Obamacare package.\u201d Kasich, who expanded Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act, said that one option he favors is paring Medicaid coverage to people with incomes up to 100 percent of the poverty level, rather than the current 138 percent, and then letting those above 100 percent go on the marketplace to get coverage. Asked whether he could guarantee that none of his constituents would lose health-care coverage, Kasich responded, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything.\u201d Even if the new administration is eager to grant waivers to states, it does not have the political appointees in place at the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments to do so. But timing is important. While the exact deadline varies depending on the state, insurers generally must decide by the spring whether to participate in Affordable Care Act marketplaces for the next year and, if so, propose the rates they would like to charge. Their decisions could be complicated if the president\u2019s order results in rule changes that affect the benefits those health plans must include \u2013 or alters rules in other ways that, in turn, prompt fewer healthy customers to seek coverage through the marketplaces. Chris Jennings, who served as a senior White House adviser on health care in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said that in the health-care arena, \u201cmore than any other domestic policy, details matter. Plans, they live off a comma, or an incentive, or a disincentive, or a penalty, or an enforcement mechanism.\u201d Ceci Connolly, president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, said her members are in a particularly difficult position because they are unlike large national companies that can \u201cpick and choose\u201d which markets they operate in under the federal exchange. \u201cLocal nonprofit plans are in their communities, so they can\u2019t look around for certain markets and pull out of ones that they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Connolly, who added that her group\u2019s \u201cbiggest concern\u201d is that some consumers might stop paying their premiums if they believe they will not be penalized for lacking coverage. That could lead to hospital and doctor visits that would not be reimbursed, which then would impose costs on providers and insurers more broadly. With fewer than 10 days to go in the current enrollment period, Mila Kofman, executive director of the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange Authority, said that \u201call of this discussion of whether or not people will have access to affordable quality health insurance is very unsettling.\u201d Some residents have asked Kofman whether she can assure them they will get the same health benefits if Congress and the administration overhaul the system in the coming months. \u201cI tell them, \u2018Sign up. We will certainly do everything we can to ensure that you\u2019ll have access to quality health insurance.\u2019 \u201d Yet Mona Mangat, a solo practitioner in allergy and immunology in St. Petersburg, Fla., is not sure what to say when patients ask her whether they will be able to afford the kind of prescriptions and services they have taken advantage of under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have an answer for them,\u201d Mangat said. \u201cI say, \u2018Oh my God, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. national ",

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gathered the press to deliver a five-minute statement Saturday in which he issued multiple falsehoods, declaring erroneously the number of people who used the D.C. metro on Friday, that there was a change in security measures this year and that \"this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\" Spicer said Saturday. However, crowd size experts told the New York Times they estimated Trump's audience at fewer than 200,000 people, and widely distributed side-by-side photographs showed the stark contrast between the comparatively sparse crowd for Trump's inauguration and the record-setting crowd for Obama's first. Asked on \"Meet the Press\" why Spicer used his first appearance before the press to dispute a minimal issue like the inauguration crowd size, and why he used falsehoods to do so, Conway pushed back. \"You're saying it's a falsehood and Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,\" she told NBC's Chuck Todd. She then went on to echo Spicer's claim on Saturday that it wasn't possible to count the crowd, despite Trump's team's accompanying insistence that it was the \"largest audience.\" \"I don't think you can prove those numbers one way or another. There's no way to quantify crowd numbers,\" Conway said. Conway also suggested that Todd's insistence on asking why Spicer delivered a demonstrably false statement could affect the White House's treatment of the media. \"If we're going to keep referring to the press secretary in those types of terms I think we're going to have to rethink our relationship here,\" she said.

    "text": "Adam Elmahrek and Joseph Serna Contact Reporters The latest and most powerful in a series of three winter storms slammed into California on Sunday, flooding roads, forcing evacuations in communities near burn areas and adding more snow in mountains from the Sierra Nevada\u00a0to the San Bernardinos.\u00a0 Numerous roads around Southern California were flooded by sustained bursts of intense rain. The 710 Freeway flooded near Pacific Coast Highway, and the 110 Freeway experienced high water near Torrance. Numerous surface streets were also blocked by standing water and fallen trees. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for a large swath of the region, including the South Bay, harbor area, Long Beach, Anaheim,\u00a0Santa Ana and the Inland Empire. Several people had been rescued from cars in flooded intersections, and thousands have lost power. Forecasters had been warning this storm could be the strongest in Southern California in seven years, and it appears to be delivering. While earlier storms produced periods of heavy showers, this storm has\u00a0delivered several hours of pounding rain, which has caused the street flooding.\u00a0 The heaviest rain was hitting Sunday afternoon and evening, with forecasters anticipating as much as an inch per hour during the storm\u2019s peak, said Stuart Seto, weather specialist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\u00a0Some areas will see up to 3 inches of rain by the end of the day, Seto said. Evacuation orders were issued for burn areas in Glendora, Duarte, Silverado Canyon in Orange County and parts of Santa Barbara County. The city of Glendora issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents adjacent to the burn area of the 2014 Colby fire . The order affects about 1,000 homes in an area bounded by the Little Dalton Wash, Sierra Madre Avenue and Yucca Ridge Road. Officials established an evacuation center at the Teen Center at 214 W. Dawson Ave. Also Sunday, the city of Duarte issued evacuation orders for residents living in the areas burned in last\u00a0year\u2019s Fish fire in the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa. An evacuation center was set up at the Duarte Community Center at 1600 Huntington Drive. The city of Santa Clarita issued evacuation notices Saturday evening for about 120 homes in the vicinity of last year\u2019s Sand fire. The affected area is bounded by\u00a0Placerita Canyon to the south, Sand Canyon to the west and Iron Canyon to\u00a0the north. Fast moving waters flooded\u00a0several roads leading to the Val Verde area Sunday afternoon, where residents are being urged to shelter in place. An evacuation center was set up at Canyon High School, 19300 Nadal St. Animals may be taken to the Castaic Animal Shelter at 31044 Charlie Canyon Road. Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday National Weather Service Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday (National Weather Service) Residents are urged to visit the county\u2019s storm season website at www.lacounty.gov/LARain for additional information. Most of Southern California is under a flash flood watch. The city of Hermosa Beach closed its pier as a precaution because of high surf and it will remain closed until further notice, said Sgt. Mick Gaglia\u00a0of the Hermosa Beach Police Department. Orange County officials were also bracing Sunday for possible flooding, particularly in Silverado Canyon, which is still recovering from a fire in 2014. Extra emergency crews have been brought in to help, including a bulldozer operator and two additional swift-water rescue teams. \u00a0 \u201cThe ground still remains pretty saturated and \u2026 it can be problematic,\u201d said Capt. Alan Wilkes, of the Orange County Fire Authority. \u201cWe just want to be ahead of [any problems].\u201d During the heaviest period of rain on Sunday, coastal areas are expected to see up to an inch of rain, the San Fernando Valley up to 1\u00bd inches, the San Gabriel Mountains up to 2\u00bc\u00a0inches, and downtown Los Angeles up to 1\u2153 inches.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s shaping up to be the strongest storm of the season,\u201d said Carol Smith, of the National Weather Service. A Southern California Edison official\u00a0said Sunday morning that about 5,500 customers in its service area have lost power as a result of the storm. The worst outages are in the San Bernardino Mountains, where 1,500\u00a0customers have lost power, said spokeswoman Susan Cox.\u00a0 Flooding forced road closures across the region. All lanes of northbound and southbound traffic along the\u00a0110 Freeway at 223rd Street has been halted due\u00a0to flooding.\u00a0A weather-related rockslide that occurred Friday has kept Malibu Canyon Road closed into Sunday afternoon, said Officer Elizabeth Kravig, spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.\u00a0 Thunderstorm conditions will ease slightly late Sunday into\u00a0Monday. But the rainfall is expected to continue until Tuesday and end sometime before noon. All told, the storm system is expected to generate 4 to 6 inches of rainfall over the next three days, with the most rainfall in the foothill and mountain areas. Clearer skies and temperatures in the mid to high 60s are expected to return beginning Friday.\u00a0 The storm is also expected to hit the Sierra Nevada\u00a0hard. The weather service warned of \u201ccrippling snow amounts on top of existing snow cover\u201d and urged\u00a0residents to stock up on food, water and firewood, and \u201cessentially prepare for being stranded at home for multiple days.\u201d Power outages are likely, and mature trees are expected to\u00a0fall. It\u2019s possible that residents could endure multiple-day power outages, failures of carports and decks, and avalanches. As of Sunday morning, there was flooding reported in some areas including Santa Cruz County. Snow\u00a0once again closed Interstate 80 in the Sierras, where a new avalanche warning was issued. For the second time in as many days, mudslides closed Highway 17, the main route between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz. The forecast is heightening concerns about mudslides and flooding across the state. Another powerful storm that hit California on Friday caused numerous road closures and mudslides in areas burned by recent fires, including a major incident near Santa Barbara\u00a0that destroyed cabins\u00a0and cars, and forced rescues. The storm is expected to peak on Sunday, with thunderstorms possible and continuing into Monday. ",

    "text": "View slideshow Updated at 6:10 p.m. ET As the Women's March on Washington has swelled in support, attracting attention and supporters in the lead-up to Saturday's demonstrations, its name has become something of a misnomer. Women's March Floods Washington, Sparking Rallies Worldwide Sister marches have been organized in all 50 states, several U.S. territories and countries around the world. They have tried to express solidarity with the aims of the original march: opposition to President Trump's agenda, and support of women's rights and human rights in general. Given the quirks of time zones, many of those marches kicked off before the event that inspired them. In Sydney, London, New Delhi, and other cities, demonstrators broke out their signs and pink hats before even their compatriots in D.C. could. Straight from NPR and member station reporters on the ground: Here's a glimpse of the marches Saturday \u2014 across the country, and around the world. Boston Tens of thousands participated in the Boston Women's March, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Marty Walsh (bottom right). Meredith Nierman/WGBH hide caption toggle caption Meredith Nierman/WGBH \"It is shoulder to shoulder\" in Boston Common, WBUR's Deborah Becker tells Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday. She describes the rally there as a \"sea of pink,\" referring to the pink knit caps that have become distinctive of the Women's March on Washington. The caps have come to be known as \"pussyhats,\" in reference to a tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women by grabbing their genitals. Deborah reports that the message of the Boston protesters is one of solidarity with the primary march in Washington. They bear signs not only protesting Trump, but supporting a range of issues \u2014 from climate science to women's access to abortion and birth control. Both Massachusetts senators, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, addressed the rally in Boston. \"I'm here to fight back!\" Warren told the crowd. \"We are in marches to say we are fighting back. That's who we are.\" Article continues after sponsorship Chicago Protesters make their way through Chicago during the city's women's march. John Gress/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption John Gress/Getty Images In what the Chicago Tribune is reporting to be the largest crowd outside of Washington , Chicagoans gathered at Grant Park on Saturday morning with plans for a rally, followed by a march. In the end, the march portion of the event was cancelled by the organizers when they determined there were too many people to march safely. \"Our march route is flooded. There is no safe way to march. We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhmer told the crowd, according to the Tribune. If participants were disappointed, they didn't show it. Organizer Liz Radford told the crowd, \"We called, and you came. We have flooded the march route. We have flooded Chicago.\" London Source: NPR Credit: Frank Langfitt Thousands marched through the British capital Saturday in what was billed as a women's march, but was ostensibly an anti-Trump rally. Marchers walked about 2 miles from the U.S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square to Trafalgar Square, within eyesight of Big Ben. The event ran for more than three hours and the size of the crowds easily dwarfed political rallies in the lead-up to last summer's Brexit vote here. As in other cities around the world, protesters carried signs criticizing America's 45th president. Many signs read \"We Shall Overcomb,\" referring to the U.S. president's signature hair-style. \"Trump Special Relationship? Just Say No,\" read others, referring to the historically close diplomatic ties between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Many in this cosmopolitan, multicultural city \u2014 which voted heavily against the U.K. leaving the European Union \u2014 were already upset by Trump's election in November. The president's \"America first\" inaugural speech only fueled alarm here. In Inaugural Address, Trump Decries 'Carnage' And Promises 'America First' A British software engineer named David said he watched the speech with officemates yesterday in stunned silence. \"It was a harrowing, chilling experience,\" David said, as he stood in front of London's National Gallery overlooking the rally in Trafalgar Square. \"The sense of nationalism and protectionism was there and there was quite a sinister undercurrent.\" David, who did not offer his last name, said he was disturbed by the insularity of the Trump's address, elements of which reminded him of the positions espoused by the political far-right here in the U.K. \"There is a movement in Britain called 'Britain first,' \" he said, \"which is a terrifying, horrible right-wing group.\" The march in London was among a number of anti-Trump rallies across Western Europe on Saturday, including cities such as Berlin, Paris, Belfast and Copenhagen. Los Angeles Participants hold signs as they wait for the start of the women's march in Los Angeles. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \"I've never seen so many people standing in one place in Los Angeles in my life, and that includes sold-out Dodger Stadium,\" NPR's Ina Jaffe tells Michel Martin on Weekend All Things Considered. As the demonstrators marched from one rally in Pershing Square to another rally outside City Hall, Ina says a single street could not contain all of them. Instead, marchers had to proceed down three parallel streets. Supporters there brought up LGBTQ rights, religious freedom and women's rights, Ina reports \u2014 including one marcher who held up a sign with a picture of Carrie Fisher, which read: \"A woman's place is in the resistance.\" New York City Thousands of participants converge on Dag Hammarskjold Plaza and Second Avenue during the women's march in New York City. NY Daily News via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption NY Daily News via Getty Images For a march fueled in part by dissatisfaction with President Trump, it seems only natural that the protesters finished their procession nearby Trump Tower on Saturday. WNYC reporter Sarah Hayley Barrett tweeted that marchers shut down whole stretches of Madison Avenue, as they spilled off the planned route and took alternate paths to Trump Tower. Shumita Basu, a producer with WNYC, noted that in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, where many of the protesters converged, the march was a \"sea of pink hats, signs.\" Raleigh, N.C. \"There's been a steady stream of marchers\" in the streets of downtown Raleigh, reports Jess Clark of member station WUNC. \"It spans the spectrum \u2014 protesters represent diverse issues, diverse backgrounds.\" She notes that she has seen men in baseball caps, women in hijabs and several people in those distinctive pink caps. \"The massive crowd has taken over the downtown area, shutting down several streets in the process,\" The Associated Press reports from Raleigh. The news service notes marches and rallies are taking place in cities across the state, including Charlotte and Asheville. Mexico City \u2014 Carrie Kahn (@ckahn) January 21, 2017 The march in Mexico City began at the U.S. Embassy and proceeded to the Angel of Independence monument. But, as NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, the march was so large, the crowd of demonstrators stretched from one landmark to the other. Carrie says the march comprised a mix of Americans and Mexicans, who appeared to be protesting Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto as much as President Trump. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has dismal approval ratings in his own country; a recent poll showed only 12 percent of Mexicans approve of the job he's doing. The chants \u2014 shouted in both Spanish and English \u2014 focused not only on the two leaders, but women's rights and gender equality, as well. Sioux Falls, S.D. \u2014 Kealey Bultena (@KealeySDPB) January 21, 2017 In Sioux Falls, the women's march has focused partly on American Indian rights, reports Kealey Bultena of South Dakota Public Broadcasting. Chants of \"Native lives matter\" rippled throughout the march. \"We want to protect Mother Earth, first of all, for the future generations and also we have our human rights as women,\" marcher Julia Brown Wolf told Kealey. Brown Wolf had traveled from the Crow Creek Indian Reservation for the demonstration. \"You know, we have to think in seven generations ahead.\" Kealey reports Brown Wolf marched with her granddaughters. \"She does not want them to face discrimination for being a woman or a Native American,\" Kealey says. Sydney Protesters demonstrate against President Trump in Sydney. Brook Mitchell/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brook Mitchell/Getty Images Demonstrators gathered in the city's Hyde Park carrying signs with slogans like \"Bridges not walls,\" and \"A woman's place is in the revolution.\" As protester Stef Vogt told The Sydney Morning Herald, \"We want to send a sign to the women in the U.S. that we're all in this together.\" But participants also say this isn't just about Trump. \"Women's rights are not about women,\" musician Amanda Palmer told a the marchers. \"They're about everyone. My son and husband are feminists.\" Buenos Aires, Argentina In Buenos Aires, American expats and locals held signs and wrote messages across their bodies as they gathered for a rally in support of the women's march. Local organizers echoed the guiding principle behind the march in Washington, D.C. \u2014 that \"Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights.\" New Delhi Indian women in New Delhi participate in a nationwide \"I Will Go Out\" march to raise questions about safe access for women and marginalized communities in public spaces across India. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images While some protests are principally marching to express solidarity with the demonstrators in the U.S., others are directly raising issues of misogyny on a more local level. In New Delhi, protesters carried signs reading \"I will go out,\" to protest sexual harassment in public spaces. Park City, Utah Crowds gather for the women's march on Main Street during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb hide caption toggle caption Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb Women's Marches Go Global: Postcards From Protests Around The World 1:25 Embed Embed <iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/510940708/511106148\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\"> The Sundance film festival is underway in the city, but women, men and children still stepped away to trudge down Main Street in the blustery snow. Many of the filmmakers and movie-lovers in Park City for the annual event came to protest Donald Trump's presidency and to defend women's rights. They chanted slogans such as \"Love Not Hate, Make America Great\" and \"We live in Trumpled Times.\" Then they rallied as the snow flurried around them, with comedian Chelsea Handler and actress Maria Bello among the speakers. Longtime activist Dolores Huerta, who's the subject of a documentary that premiered at the festival, led the crowd in chanting, \"Si se puede, Yes, we can.\" Jessica Williams, who stars in one of the feature films premiering at the festival, told the crowd that her ancestors fought for her to be where she is \u2014 to \"stand in the snow in front of a bunch of white people in Uggs.\" \"I grew up thinking (the) civil rights movement already happened,\" said Williams. \"This election is a wake up call. The silver lining is, we are here ... in literally 21 degrees supporting each other.\" And all the way from Baltimore, the Lethal Ladies of Bliss step team, featured in a new documentary premiering Saturday, roused the crowd with foot-stomping chants of resistance. Paradise Bay, Antarctica \u2014 linda zunas (@lindazunas) January 21, 2017 There were even \"marchers\" in Antarctica. Linda Zunas, a reseacher in a remote corner of the continent called Paradise Bay, told The Independent that she organized a group of 30 people with banners reading \"Penguins for peace\" and \"love from seven continents.\" ",

    "text": "With False Claims, Trump Attacks Media on Turnout and Intelligence Rift By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and MATTHEW ROSENBERG JAN. 21, 2017 Video Comparing Inauguration Crowds President Trump and his press secretary disputed estimates of attendance at his inauguration, but footage from Friday\u2019s event, compared with those from President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, showed a different story. By THE NEW YORK TIMES on Publish Date January 22, 2017. Photo by Left, Lucas Jackson, Right, Stelios Varias/Reuters. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community, Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community, a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago. He also called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth,\u201d and he said that up to 1.5 million people had attended his inauguration, a claim that photographs disproved. Later, at the White House, he dispatched Sean Spicer, the press secretary, to the briefing room in the West Wing, where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country, warning that the new administration would hold them to account. Continue reading the main story The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump , a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in. It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency, usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader. OPEN Graphic Instead, the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive, signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation\u2019s highest office. Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community, with an appearance at the C.I.A.\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va. While he was lavish in his praise, the president focused in his 15-minute speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation\u2019s spy agencies, and meandered to other topics, including the crowd size at his inauguration, his level of political support, his mental age and his intellectual heft.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cI just want to let you know, I am so behind you,\u201d Mr. Trump told more than 300 employees assembled in the lobby for his remarks. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia meddled in the United States election on his behalf. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Trump, he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on Twitter , \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 11, 2017 On Saturday, he said journalists were responsible for any suggestion that he was not fully supportive of intelligence agencies\u2019 work.

Mr. Spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed \u201cto minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d although he provided no proof of either assertion. Photographs of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 and of Mr. Trump\u2019s plainly showed that the crowd on Friday was significantly smaller , but Mr. Spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the Mall. Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009. \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. He also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on Friday that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, calling the mistake \u2014 which was corrected quickly \u2014 \u201cegregious.\u201d And he incorrectly claimed that ridership on Washington\u2019s subway system was higher than on Inauguration Day in 2013. In reality, there were 782,000 riders that year, compared with 571,000 riders this year, according to figures from the Washington-area transit authority. Mr. Spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the National Mall this year, preventing \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d from viewing the ceremony. But the Secret Service said the measures were largely unchanged this year, and there were few reports of long lines or delays. Video White House Press Secretary Slams Media At his first news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, accused news outlets of intentionally manipulating photographs \u201cto minimize the enormous support\u201d that President Trump had received at his inauguration. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb Commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made Mr. Trump increasingly angry on Friday, according to several people familiar with his thinking. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on \u201cdishonest media\u201d coverage \u2014 mostly referring to a Twitter post from a New York Times reporter showing side-by-side frames of Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd and Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. But most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president. However, in his remarks at the C.I.A., he wandered off topic several times, at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39 (he is 70); reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying, \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person\u201d; and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy. Photo The photograph of President Trump\u2019s inauguration that was displayed during Mr. Spicer\u2019s briefing. Mr. Trump said that when he looked out from his podium, \u201cit looked like a million, a million and a half people.\u201d Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cProbably everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same wavelength, folks.\u201d But most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media. And Mr. Spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the White House briefing room. But his appearance, according to the people familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking, went too far, in the president\u2019s opinion. Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the C.I.A. touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials. Nick Shapiro, who served as chief of staff to John O. Brennan, who resigned Friday as the C.I.A. director, said Mr. Brennan \u201cis deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump \u2019s despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of C.I.A.\u2019s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. \u201cBrennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,\u201d Mr. Shapiro added. \u201cI was heartened that the president gave a speech at C.I.A.,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency. \u201cIt would have been even better if more of it had been about C.I.A.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he had had high hopes for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community, but that Mr. Trump\u2019s meandering speech had dashed them. \u201cWhile standing in front of the stars representing C.I.A. personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country \u2014 hallowed ground \u2014 Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cHe will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world.\u201d Mr. Trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d He did not mention his apparent willingness to believe Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is widely detested at the C.I.A., over his own intelligence agencies. He also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president. The agency sees the president as its main audience, and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the White House. Since the election, hopes at the C.I.A. that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what Mr. Trump and his loyalists have planned. But the nomination of Mike Pompeo, a former Army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community, to lead the C.I.A. has been received positively at the agency. \u201cHe has left the strong impression that he doesn\u2019t trust the intelligence community and that he doesn\u2019t have tremendous regard for their work,\u201d Mark M. Lowenthal, a retired C.I.A. analyst, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe obvious thing to do is to counter that by saying, \u2018I value you. I look forward to working with you.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe called them Nazis,\u201d Mr. Lowenthal added, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the intelligence community. Mr. Lowenthal said Saturday\u2019s visit should have been \u201ca stroking expedition.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Glenn Thrush, Michael S. Schmidt and Eric Schmitt.

Police investigate the scene on the 1500 block of West Huron Street in Chicago where three people were shot Sunday morning Jan. 22, 2017.\u00a0 (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Tony Briscoe and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Tucked into the third row of a minivan, talking on FaceTime with a friend, Angela Wojcik wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the conversation of her boyfriend and his acquaintances in the front of the vehicle as it sat parked in West Town on Sunday morning. That was until the percussion of gunfire began. \"The driver was bleeding from the mouth,\" said Wojcik, who lives in the suburbs and spent the previous night out at various clubs in the city. Police later identified the driver as a 26-year-old man who was shot in the lip. \"It was blood over his whole face. It was so surreal,\" Wojcik said. Her\u00a0boyfriend, 30, was hit twice in the right calf. The front passenger, who police said was a 25-year-old man shot in the left shoulder, appeared to be in the worst condition of the three, Wojcik said.\u00a0 \u201cNo one screamed,\u201d Wojcik said. \u201cBut I was FaceTiming with my friend Robert, and he was freaking out.\u201d All three were taken to\u00a0Stroger Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized, police said. It was the second triple shooting of the morning Sunday. The\u00a0other happened\u00a0around 6:30 a.m.\u00a0 Hours later there was\u00a0another shooting with multiple victims, this one leaving\u00a0four people wounded at 12:15 p.m. in the 1800 block of West 63rd Street in the Englewood neighborhood. In all, 10 people were wounded in multiple-victim shootings within less than six hours Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon. \"We've had quite a few multiple-victim incidents this weekend,\" said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. There were six triple shootings from Friday afternoon to early Sunday afternoon, in addition to the quadruple shooting.\u00a0 The most seriously injured in the Englewood shooting was a 26-year-old man who suffered a gunshot wound to the right eye and was taken by a family member to St. Bernard Hospital before being transferred to Stroger Hospital in critical condition, police said. The others wounded were: Another 26-year-old man, shot in the right buttocks and left foot; a\u00a056-year-old woman, shot multiple times in the left leg; and a 48-year-old woman shot in the right hip. All three were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where their conditions were stabilized. The four were in a convenience store when they heard gunshots and ran outside, where four armed men or boys shot\u00a0them, police said. The four attackers got into a white sedan and fled the scene. No one was in custody. Earlier in an attack that only injured one victim, a\u00a0man was shot while driving along the 1100 block of North Lockwood Avenue about 11 a.m., police said.\u00a0 He was traveling north on Lockwood in a 2014 Ford Escape when someone opened fire on his vehicle. He was shot in his left shoulder, arm and ear before crashing his vehicle in the same block, causing his SUV to overturn.\u00a0 He was taken to Stroger, where he was listed in stable condition, officials said. No one\u00a0has been arrested in connection with the shooting and authorities continue to investigate.\u00a0 The shootings come as part of a particularly violent weekend in Chicago, with 29 people shot, three fatally, in a 24-hour period from Saturday to Sunday. From Friday to Saturday, one person was killed and 14 were wounded in shootings across the city.\u00a0 ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Crowds fill Pennsylvania Avenue during Saturday's Women's March on Washington. (Photo: Joe Lamberti/Courier-Post) In his inaugural address , President Trump bragged that he was leading \"a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\" Turns out he helped spawn two of them. On Friday, a legion of Americans cheered Trump as a refreshingly pugnacious leader elected with a promise to shake\u00a0the regular order in a country they say has gotten off on the wrong track. On Saturday, a multitude of Americans demonstrated against the new president for policies and rhetoric they see as misogynist\u00a0and dangerous. Elections are by definition divisive, of course, and Trump takes control of the White House at a time politics have\u00a0become increasingly polarized. But historians struggle to cite a precedent for a new president who is both beneficiary and target of such powerful and rising grass-roots movements. At stake are clashing visions of America on everything from the role of women and the impact of immigration to how the United States should engage with the world. \"It's hard for anyone to say when we're at a pivotal point, but I think these may be seismic shifts,\" Timothy Naftali, an historian at New York University and the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, said in an interview. \"We thought there was an era of new politics because of the role Trump played in the Republican Party, but the new politics may not just be of the right. We may be seeing a new politics in the center and the left.\" Read more: Change direction?\u00a0 Last year's surprising presidential primaries set the landscape for this year's political turmoil. Among Republicans, Trump tapped\u00a0rising discontent, especially\u00a0among whites, men and workers who had watched well-paying manufacturing jobs evaporate in the Rust Belt. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders did the same \u2014 especially among liberals, women and Millennials \u2014\u00a0with his strong bid for the Democratic nomination. Now both movements believe politics-as-usual has failed them, and neither owes their origins to the political establishment.\u00a0While those in both movements would agree the nation is headed in the wrong direction, though, they disagree on just what the right direction would be. In his address Friday, Trump said his lodestar would be \"America First,\" a phrase with resonant history suggesting a withdrawal from global engagement. One core campaign promise was to protect American workers by ending or renegotiating free-trade deals. Another was to build a wall along the Southern border to limit illegal immigrants he portrayed as rapists and murderers. He suggested he might propose a registry for Muslims. He wants the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision recognizing abortion rights.

Marchers made a point of welcoming Muslims to their ranks and extolling\u00a0the value of immigrants, including the young people known as DREAMers who may be about to lose protection from deportation that former president Barack Obama had extended. Katie Page Sander \"boycotted\" watching Trump's Inauguration,\u00a0instead driving to Washington from her hometown of Ann Arbor., Mich., to march against him on Saturday. \"Trump is the quintessential bully and we teach our children how to stand up to bullies,\" she said, marching alongside her husband and three children. \"What I hope is this is a catalyst that people realize you can't be complacent any more.\" A day earlier, Gary Nystrom of Boone, Iowa, was elated as he stood on the National Mall to watch Trump sworn in, calling it a victory for the \"silent majority.\" \"It's a breath of fresh air,\" said Nystrom, a city councilman and member of the Iowa GOP state central committee. \"There's a new life ahead of us.\u00a0President Trump \u2014\u00a0I can say that now:\u00a0President\u00a0Trump \u2014 said today is a new day, and the people are going to dictate what goes on from this point forward. I truly believe that\u2019s why he got elected.\u201d Read more: Analysis: Trump\u2019s short, dark and defiant inaugural address A secret swearing-in Demonstrations in Washington are nothing new, even during Inaugural celebrations.\u00a0Tens of thousands of marchers protested the Vietnam War during President Nixon's second inaugural, in 1973. At Woodrow Wilson's first inaugural, in 1913, suffragettes demanding the right for women to vote staged their own parade and were roughed up by police. In 1877, the official swearing-in of Rutherford Hayes was held in secret for fear that\u00a0supporters of Samuel Tilden, who had won the popular vote in a disputed election, might try to disrupt it. (There was a public ceremony the next day.) But the size of the protests in Washington and across the country Saturday were unprecedented, dwarfing the number of Americans who had gathered to cheer Trump into office. Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee, on ABC's This Week called Saturday's turnout \"an urgent plea for us all to sit down together.\" The broad reach and rapid pace of new technology and social media have made the crowds bigger and the conversation coarser. \"It's not enough to disagree with somebody else,\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said with dismay. \"You have to hate them.\" President Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters on Jan. 21, 2017, in Langley, Va. \u00a0(Photo: Pool, Getty Images) Trump didn't comment on the protesters Saturday during an appearance at the CIA , but on Sunday morning he posted a mocking tweet : \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Two hours later, he took a different tone on Twitter: \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.\" Some political veterans worry about the task of governing in a nation where battle lines are hardening. Even inside the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer at his first briefing accused reporters of trying to delegitimize the new president , inaccurately asserting that news stories had misrepresented the size of the Inaugural crowds. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday's Meet the Press said Spicer was presenting \"alternative facts,\" sparking a derisive Twitter meme. \"We've never had as many people who don't trust the media, don't trust the politicians, don't trust economics, don't trust business,\" Republican political consultant Frank Luntz said on CBS' Face the Nation. \"I think we're going to remember this weekend for a long time to come as not the end, not the campaign being over, but this is the beginning of the most tempestuous ... awful conflict between left and right, between men and women, between young and old.\" He warned, \"I think we\u00a0are breaking apart.\" Contributing: Kathleen Gray of the Detroit Free Press, Jason Noble of The Des Moines Register.\u00a0 ",
