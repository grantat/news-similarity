    "text": "Jan 10 2017, 3:38 pm ET Trump's Call For 'Quick' Obamacare Replacement Complicates GOP Efforts by Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe Share advertisement President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wants to see Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act soon and pass a replacement \"very quickly or simultaneously.\" His urging contradicts Republican leaders who have been cautioning that overhauling the massive health care law would take time. Trump would like Obamacare repealed within days and contended that \"the replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter,\" he told the New York Times in an interview Tuesday . \"Long to me would be weeks,\" Trump added. Trump's statements could be an effort at public persuasion but they are complicating efforts for congressional Republicans working to plot out plans to repeal and replace the ACA in a manner that would be politically and economically viable while maintaining the support of enough Republicans to pass the legislation. While the repeal effort is scheduled to be complete by the end of January, if all goes according to plan, Republican leaders have said replacement could take much longer, possibly months or even years. Play How quickly will GOP replace Obamacare? 3:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170110222559if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/850747459849\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Republican leaders are feeling pressure from some rank-and-file members who are feeling jittery to speed up the multi-step process and replace the health care law at the same time it is repealed. House Speaker Paul Ryan indicated Tuesday morning, before Trump's comments, that he is taking into consideration the concerns of some in his GOP conference about a long lag between repeal and replace. \"It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently,\" Ryan said for the first time. \"We are going to use every tool at our disposal through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal so we can save people from this mess.\" Related: More Republicans Express Concern About Repealing Obamacare The Senate and House are expected to vote on the first step of the repeal process this week as part of a budget resolution known as reconciliation. The legislation directs that the second part of the repeal process, which would actually start to dismantle the health care law, be complete by January 27. But Trump's latest remarks have put him in front of the debate, putting even more pressure on Republican leaders to speed up the process. Republican leaders Tuesday declined denounce - or support - Trump's timeline and insisted they are on the same page. Trump's plans are \"not any way inconsistent with the timeline we're aiming for,\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said. One member of leadership, Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said that Trump's public pronouncements and apparent lack of understanding of the complexities of how Congress works - and the difficulty in passing legislation so quickly - are complicating their efforts. \"From a messaging standpoint, yes I worry,\" Thune said about Trump's comments. Trump had been publicly cautioning Republicans for the past week, telling them via Twitter to \"be careful\" in their health care repeal efforts, which could be politically challenging. Five Republican senators have proposed an amendment that would postpone the repeal deadline until March 3, giving legislators enough time to draw up a replacement plan to vote on simultaneously. There is division among Republicans about that idea and Republican leaders haven't committed to allowing a vote on it. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, is one of the members sponsoring that amendment. He said about Trump's accelerated timeline: \"I'm looking forward to hearing how they would anticipate that occurring.\" Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 As President Obama returns to his adopted hometown of Chicago to give his farewell speech Tuesday night, a dark cloud hangs over the city where the record-setting murder rate is so high there are pleas to declare a state of emergency. \u201cWhen there is a fire in America, a tornado, a hurricane, they call it a state of emergency, federal funds come in, and help rebuild that town or that community,\u201d said prominent anti-crime activist, Father Michael Pfleger.\u00a0 \u201cWell, hell, we have a state of emergency in Chicago.\u201d In 2016, 762 people were murdered in Chicago. That\u2019s a 63 percent increase from the 468 murders recorded in 2015 and almost double the murders in 2014, according to Chicago Police. Shootings also are way up -- 4,331 people were shot in Chicago in 2016, up from 3,550 in 2015, according to police. In recent months, the president has been mostly quiet about an aggressive solution to Chicago\u2019s violent crime epidemic. The city saw more murders in 2016 than New York and Los Angeles combined, yet is considerably smaller in population than either city. Chicagoans wonder if the president will address the city\u2019s crime \u2013 the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2013 during his speech Tuesday night. \"I cannot recall a time that President Obama said directly about Rahm Emanuel that he needs to do something about this violence,\u201d said Chicago community leader and activist Pastor Corey Brooks. In a series of interviews last week previewing his speech and visit to Chicago, Obama discussed the city\u2019s carnage, noting a lot of the crime is happening in the \u201cbackyard\u201d of the home he and the first lady own on the city\u2019s South Side. \u201cWe've been trying even from the federal level to provide assistance to the city. I don't think that we're going to be able to reverse these things overnight,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOn the other hand, the fact that crime overall is much lower around the country when it was when I took office and that Chicago is the one big city where you've seen this huge spike means that there's something specifically happening there and that means we can fix it if we work together.\u201d Community leaders all agree Chicago\u2019s violent crime and murder rate is unacceptable but the exact cause and how to fix it is a matter of debate. The issues most often pointed to are the city\u2019s uncontrollable illegal gun market, gang wars, cheap heroin and increasing disrespect for law enforcement. Former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who is credited with a drop in the city\u2019s crime up until 2015 through his community-policing approach, says officers haven\u2019t felt a ton of support from the Obama administration. \u201cI can't help but just look at criminal justice, and criminal justice in this country has not had a friend in the federal government during this administration,\" McCarthy said. Lori Lightfoot, president of the Chicago Police Board\u2014an independent entity tasked with investigating complaints into misconduct and corruption\u2014says Chicago\u2019s crime is not something police can arrest their way out of and requires all levels of the government and community to work together beyond analyzing crime stats and police performance. \u201cWe need to make sure we are out there with job training, everything we can to drive down unemployment, make sure kids aren\u2019t living in poverty, good schools,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cThis really does take a multi-faceted approach.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has already weighed in, making headlines when he tweeted that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal help if he can\u2019t fix the city\u2019s crime\u2014which also raises the question if policing in the city and even nationwide might grow beyond a state and local operation under the Trump administration. \u201cPresident-Elect Trump is directly putting the ball in the mayor\u2019s court and that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d Brooks said. Emanuel\u2019s spokesperson replied to the Trump tweet with a statement, in part writing, \u201cAs the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety\u2026we are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.\u201d All this comes as the Department of Justice is in the midst of a patterns and practice investigation into the Chicago Police Department for allegations of racism and police brutality. This follows the release of a highly controversial, graphic dash cam video depicting a Chicago police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The DOJ\u2019s findings are expected to be released before or shortly after the inauguration of Trump on Jan. 20 and could result in an expensive Consent Decree with CPD that will continue to keep Chicago\u2019s crime problems in the national spotlight. Pfleger said he reached out to Trump during the campaign but did not hear back. He says he hopes the DOJ\u2019s findings and the new administration could make a difference in Chicago. \u201cThe question being will they reach out and want to really see some substantive changes and make a difference or do they\u00a0just want to continue to Band-Aid,\u201d Pfleger said.\u00a0 Matt Finn is a Fox News correspondent based in the Chicago bureau.

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP President Obama waves to supporters at an election night party in Chicago to proclaim victory in the 2012 presidential election. Carolyn Kaster/AP President Obama's adopted hometown of Chicago is often the stage for pivotal moments in his career. He claimed victory in Chicago in 2008 and again in 2012. And it's where he will give his farewell address on Tuesday night. Many Chicagoans use the word \"pride\" when talking about Barack Obama. You can hear it in their voices. In this city, where President-elect Donald Trump got only 12 percent of the vote, admiration for President Obama is strong. Kim Chisholm stood with thousands of others in the bitter cold this weekend to get a ticket to Obama's speech. Scorecard For A Departing President: Assessing Obama's Successes And Shortcomings \"I'm so excited,\" she says. \"History in the making. I never made it to the White House, but I will see him here in Chicago.\" Chicago officials say there are pluses and minuses to having such close ties to the Obama administration. On Monday, the city won a federal grant for nearly $1 billion to upgrade a major portion of the city's elevated commuter rail line. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's first White House chief of staff, worked to make sure the funding came through before the administration changed hands. \"This will over the next four years create 6,000 jobs in the city of Chicago,\" he says. Illinois' senior U.S. senator, Dick Durbin, says the city has been able to make significant infrastructure improvements with the help of federal funds, including high-speed rail and upgrades to O'Hare International Airport. \"Time and again, the Obama administration has not forgotten where he came from,\" Durbin says. \"[He] has not forgotten the city of Chicago.\" Article continues after sponsorship Obama's Farewell Address: How Presidents Use This Moment Of Reflection That's in part because the administration included a bevy of Chicagoans as Cabinet members and advisers, such as former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, advisers Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Tuesday night's speech and talk about an Obama legacy in Chicago are much more personal for some. Jacky Grimshaw worked in Chicago government under Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, and was Obama's next-door neighbor for years. She says the country's first black president faced the same sort of opposition that Washington did and both men prevailed. \"And he put through the stimulus package that allowed communities across the country to deal with infrastructure projects that needed to get done,\" Grimshaw says of Obama. Some community organizers take a more nuanced stance. Jitu Brown of the Institute for Educational Leadership says that while the president conducts himself with grace, he disagrees with many of his administration's education policies. \"And I think the disappointment is in a president who started as a community organizer. I would have really hoped there would have been space to really listen to the voices of the people directly impacted,\" Brown says. 'That's Our Guy': Chicagoans Welcome Obama Back To D.C. At Valois Restaurant, not far from the president's Chicago home, customers can order a variety of Obama specials on the menu. Kimberly Barnes Staples was eating breakfast with her husband. \"For Chicago, specifically, he gave us a national profile,\" she says. \"He showcased who we are as Chicagoans. He made us proud.\" And Devi Austin, a retiree, says she personally benefited from policies Obama advanced. \"Because of the laws that he put in place for people who had just bought homes and was underwater, I got forgiven \u2014 forgiven, not modified \u2014 forgiven $60,000,\" she says. \"I will miss President Obama.\" Obama Says Goodbye This Week, But His Message Hasn't Always Gotten Through Jan. 8, 2017 While some Chicagoans express disappointment that the president didn't provide more help to deal with gun violence and gangs, others give him a pass, saying that's a problem for the mayor, not the president. So as Obama says farewell, Patty McNamara, a museum consultant, says she will be watching wistfully. \"It's kind of bittersweet,\" she says. \"It's going to be a tough transition, I'm afraid.\" There will be a tangible Obama legacy for Chicagoans, though. His presidential library and foundation will be built on Chicago's South Side. That means that even if the Obamas don't return there to live, the president will remain engaged in the city that gave him his political start. ",

The information is contained in a 35-page file that was published Tuesday by BuzzFeed , which said it was publishing the material in the interest of \u201ctransparency,\u201d but had not been able to corroborate it. Several news organizations reported that senior U.S. intelligence officials had included a two-page synopsis of the file in the materials they presented to Trump when they briefed him last week on evidence of Russian involvement in the election and that they had also informed top leaders of Congress about the allegations. The purpose of including the material was to back up their conclusion that Russia had acted to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, gathering information on both sides in the election, but only publicly releasing information damaging the Democrats, according to CNN, which first reported on the briefing. Trump responded in a tweet Tuesday evening that did not address any of the specific allegations, but denounced the stories. The material alleged that Russia for years had been \u201ccultivating, supporting and assisting\u201d Trump\u2019s political rise and possessed damaging personal and financial information that could be used to blackmail the president-elect. According to BuzzFeed and CNN, the dossier was compiled by a former British intelligence agent who was hired to do opposition research by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and later by Democrats. The report was prepared over the summer and was provided to U.S. analysts. The two-page summary contained allegations that there was a \u201ccontinuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for Russian government,\u201d CNN reported, citing two national security officials. It also alleged that information sharing between Trump\u2019s team and the Russians went both ways. The Russians provided Trump\u2019s aides with \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d on Clinton, the report said, while Trump\u2019s associates gave Russian operatives information about Russian oligarchs. CNN reported that the U.S. intelligence community vetted the former British operative and found him and his network of sources to be credible enough to justify including some of the information in reports provided to elected officials. The existence of the file has circulated among political figures and reporters in Washington since at least October, when then-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey saying that the FBI possessed \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.\u201d Mother Jones ran an article at that time reporting on the existence of the file and saying that the former British intelligence operative had provided his dossier to the FBI. The report on Tuesday became a viral sensation on social media, and even provided fodder for questioning at Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 Senate confirmation hearing. Sessions (R-Ala.), who was picked by Trump to be his attorney general, said he was not aware of the report and had no contacts with the Russian government. Latest updates ",

Jeff Sessions , Donald Trump \u2019s pick to become the next attorney general, further clarified today his position on controversial comments the president-elect made about women, telling a Senate panel that grabbing women by the genitals without their consent would \"clearly\" be sexual assault. Several months ago , Sessions came under fire for saying that it would be a \u201cstretch\u201d to call such behavior sexual assault -- a position he clarified shortly afterwards. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, Sessions, R-Alabama, went even further. \"Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?\" Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont, asked the Republican nominee. Sessions was unequivocal: \"Clearly it would be ... Yes.\" Leahy, who until recently was the top Democrat on the committee, then pushed Sessions on whether he would be able to prosecute and investigate \"a sitting president or any other high federal official ... accused of what the president-elect described\" on tape, assuming federal laws were implicated. \"The president is subject to certain lawful restrictions, and they would be required to be applied by the appropriate law enforcement official,\" Sessions replied. Sessions said he could not recall exactly what Trump said on the tapes, including whether the talk included \u201cunwanted\u201d advances. But, Sessions said, \"if that\u2019s what the tape\" indicated, then \"certainly it would meet the definition\u201d of sexual assault. In October 2016, just a month before Election Day , the New York Times obtained and released video from a 2005 interview with Trump for \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d \u201cYou know, I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful [women] \u2014 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump could be heard telling TV personality Billy Bush . \u201cGrab \u2019em by the p----. You can do anything.\u201d During a presidential debate days after the video surfaced, Trump described the recorded discussion as just \u201clocker room talk.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologized to the American people,\" he said. \"Certainly, I am not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\u201d Trump said he never actually did the things he described on the tapes, insisting he has \u201ctremendous respect for women.\u201d Shortly after the debate, Sessions came under fire for appearing to suggest he did not believe Trump\u2019s taped comments about women amounted to sexual assault. \u201cI don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that's a stretch,\u201d Sessions was quoted by The Weekly Standard as saying. Two days later, Session issued a statement saying he was confused by the questions posed to him \u201cin a chaotic post-debate environment,\u201d and the subsequent \u201cinaccurate article ... misrepresented my views.\u201d \u201cOf course it is crystal clear that assault is unacceptable. I would never intentionally suggest otherwise,\" Sessions said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY NETWORK In this Dec. 28, 2016, file photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) During a special briefing last Friday, leaders of the intelligence community gave President-elect Donald Trump a synopsis of unsubstantiated and salacious allegations that Russian operatives had obtained potentially compromising personal and financial information about the president-elect, a U.S. official confirmed Tuesday. The official who is not authorized to comment publicly, said that the document was provided along with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. The separate document presented to the president-elect represented a summary of a much larger 35-page compilation of documents prepared by a former foreign intelligence officer.\u00a0The officer, the official said, is known to U.S.\u00a0intelligence, but the contents of the specific contents of the document have not been verified. Trump responded Tuesday evening by Twitter, calling the report \"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\" Read more: Clinton allies react to reports on Russia, Trump The decision to present the information to Trump, first reported by CNN , was made after it was determined that the document \u2014 in many forms \u2014 had been circulated widely to political opposition researchers, U.S. lawmakers, journalists and others. CNN said it reviewed the compilation of the memos, described as originating as opposition research first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats.\u00a0Buzzfeed has\u00a0 posted the intelligence documents . In the end, U.S. authorities determined that Trump needed to know the information, if he didn\u2019t know its existence already, the official said, adding that the contents remained the subject of investigation.\u00a0The official declined to comment on Trump's reaction to the presentation. And the president-elect, who has scheduled his first news conference Wednesday , did not immediately comment on the revelations. The summary document also includes allegations that information was exchanged over a long period of time between the Russian government and Trump representatives. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, accused of meeting with a Russian operative in Prague last year, said in a tweet that \"I have\u00a0never been to Prague in my life.\" The news came on a day in which the Senate Intelligence Committee\u00a0conducted hearings into the reported Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and emails provided to the website Wikileaks. Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C.,\u00a0said the panel will conduct an independent review of the intelligence community's report about Russian interference to help Trump. FBI Director James Comey declined to answer questions from\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about whether the FBI is investigating possible contacts between the\u00a0Trump campaign\u00a0and the Russian government during the presidential campaign. \"I think the American people have a right to know this,\" Wyden said. \"And if there is a delay in declassifying this information and releasing it to the American people, and it doesn\u2019t happen before Jan. 20\u00a0(Inauguration Day), I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to happen.\" Wyden declined comment late Tuesday about the unsubstantiated reports that Russians have compromising information about Trump. The senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, also had no comment, said spokeswoman Rachel Cohen. Read more: Putin ordered hacking to help Trump, intelligence report says Then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., angry over FBI statements about the email investigation of Clinton, referenced these allegations in an October letter to the bureau. It said in part, \"it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.\" Rep. Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., said late Tuesday that she finds the latest reports about Russia and Trump alarming and called on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to appoint a special counsel to continue investigating the allegations \"until all facts have been unearthed.\" \"I find troubling these reports that Russian intelligence apparatuses sought compromising information on the Republican candidate, as well, but released only information related to Democrats,\" the congresswoman said. \"However, particularly alarming are suggestions that surrogates for an American presidential campaign were actively exchanging information with Russian government intermediaries.\" She said the allegations \"raise important legal issues that need to be investigated quickly, thoroughly and impartially, without political interference.\" Contributing: Erin Kelly Posted!

    "text": "By Greg Miller January 10 at 7:23 PM Follow @gregpmiller A classified report delivered to President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump\u2019s personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations, but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. A senior U.S. official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at least in part to underscore that Russia had embarrassing information on both major candidates, but only released material that might harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered U.S. spy agencies\u2019 conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump win. The inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report, a development first reported Tuesday by CNN, adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine American democracy. If true, the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging information \u2014 known in espionage circles by the Russian term \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2014 that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White House. The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report, an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and representatives of Moscow. U.S. officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising material were based not on information through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British intelligence official. The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in October. U.S. officials said that while the FBI had so far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims, U.S. officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm, considered them credible, and determined that it was plausible that they would have first-hand knowledge of Russia\u2019s alleged dossier on Trump. The CIA, the FBI and the White House declined to comment on the matter. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. K.T. McFarland, Trump\u2019s designated deputy foreign service adviser, declined to respond to a question about the report. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the story that you\u2019re talking about that\u2019s broken. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate\u2026I know in Washington people prefer to talk about something about which they know nothing, but I\u2019m going to refrain,\u201d she said during participation in a panel at the U.S. Institute of Peace. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had. I think I\u2019d just say what [Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, Jr.] said, which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome.\u201d Clapper, however, testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election result. The two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three separate versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last week, including an abbreviated declassifed draft that was made public. It was unclear whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI, CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report, of whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts\u2019 conclusions. Senior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report on declined to comment. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Ca.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team, said that \u201cwe can\u2019t comment on what goes on in\u201d classified briefings, but added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on U.S. leaders \u201cshould not be a surprise to anyone.\u201d \u201cThe Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be news.\u201d Asked whether he was aware of any contacts between the Trump team and Russia, Nunes said, \u201cNo. I found that hard to believe. I have not heard that.

I want you to build a bridge and tie them back in. I was to heal the wounds, and I want to get back to work on Saturday morning.\u2019\u201d The inauguration will take place in Washington, D.C. on Friday, January 20th. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will be in attendance, and President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will ride together to the Capitol for the swearing-in.
