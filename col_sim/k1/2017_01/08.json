    "text": "President Obama speaks to Caterpillar employees in East Peoria, Ill., in February 2009 about the then-struggling economy. Charles Dharapak/AP hide caption toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP President Obama speaks to Caterpillar employees in East Peoria, Ill., in February 2009 about the then-struggling economy. Charles Dharapak/AP The final chapter of the Obama economy drew that much closer to its end on Friday, with the final jobs report of the 44th president's time in office. That report showed the 75th straight month of job growth, with employers adding 156,000 jobs. Solid, but nothing flashy. In that way, it was emblematic of how the job market has generally fared since the worst of the Great Recession's aftermath: chugging along, slowly but surely recovering. With the final Obama administration jobs day in the books, it's a good time to look at how American workers have fared. Donald Trump will inherit a job market that is vastly rehabilitated from devastating lows just a few years ago. However, it has also undergone profound changes that have scarred many American workers. Unemployment: How low can it go? As Obama prepares to leave office, the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, less than half of the peak it reached in October 2009. That decline is the result of a prolonged period of job growth. The administration has grown fond of showing off its prolonged run of job growth every month. Longest streak of total job growth on record \u2713 Fastest wage growth since the start of the recovery \u2713 https://t.co/uo6Mz0WggU #JobsReport pic.twitter.com/DUjA4cmPWg \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 6, 2017 For some perspective, here's how big that job growth was: Obama averaged 109,000 jobs per month. That's far better than either President Bush experienced, but it's well below the 242,000 that Bill Clinton presided over in the roaring 1990s. For Reagan, it was 166,000. Article continues after sponsorship Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Of course, President Obama came into office as the economy was plunging into a recession (a plunge that also drags down George W. Bush's number). But even if you average out Obama's 75 straight months of job growth, you get 199,000 jobs per month, still shy of Clinton's economy. In other words, the Obama recovery has been moderate, but remarkably steady. The question is how long that steady climb can continue uninterrupted. The unemployment rate is already near a nine-year low, as Steven Russolillo at the Wall Street Journal pointed out this week, and there is some question among economists how low it can go. Wages finally climbing Having a job is one thing. Having a job that pays well is another. And slowly through Obama's tenure, those wages have inched upward. In fact, wages were one bright spot of Friday's jobs report. Average hourly wages were up by 2.9 percent in December. After several years of hovering around 2 percent, that's welcome growth. Aside from meaning more money in workers' pockets, wage growth serves as yet another sign of a tightening labor market, signaling that employers are willing to pay more to attract workers. Rising wages may inspire the Federal Reserve to take its foot further off the gas pedal in the coming months (that is, allow interest rates to rise) \u2014 a reminder that the economy isn't exactly under the president's control. (More on this later.) Labor force participation is low, but what does it mean? This one became a flashpoint in the presidential election, with Trump at times pointing out how much the labor force shrank under Obama. The main measure of this is the labor force participation rate \u2014 that is, the percentage of people who are either working or looking for work (that is, who are in the labor force). That figure was at 65.7 percent in January 2009, at the start of Obama's presidency, and today is at 62.7 percent \u2014 a steep drop. And today, the figure is well below its 2000 high of 67.3 percent. But it's not clear how bad or how benign that change is. Many Americans are out of the labor force and entirely happy about it. Quitting work to retire, for example, is a totally nonalarming reason to leave the labor force. But then, there may be many people who, facing a tough job market, have given up looking for work. That's not good, and it also happened for many Americans both during and after the recession. In the aftermath of the recession, economists have tried to figure out exactly how many people are voluntarily versus involuntarily out of the labor force. As of 2014 , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that half the decline in the participation rate at that time had come from \"long-term trends\" like aging \u2014 as baby boomers age, that means a large chunk of the population will naturally retire. But that left half of the decline a result of economic weakness and a slow recovery, in the CBO's estimation. Should the participation rate hold steady or creep upward during a Trump presidency, that could keep the unemployment rate from dropping, as only Americans who are looking for work are counted as \"unemployed.\" That would be one of those cases where a slightly higher unemployment rate could be a good thing. Improvement for part-time workers Full-time job growth over the course of the Obama presidency has far outstripped part-time job growth, as FiveThirtyEight's Ben Casselman has pointed out. Part-time jobs ticked up in November, but overall, employment growth in recovery has been almost all full-time. pic.twitter.com/m1MrB1ZA3e \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 2, 2016 Of course, some of those people working part time want to be working part time, and some don't. Another bright spot here is that the share of those workers who are involuntarily part time has fallen off. However, that figure is still a fair bit higher than it was prior to the recession (and that level was itself, in turn, higher than it was before the prior recession). That's one place where there could still be some improvement \u2014 there are still about 1 million more of those involuntary part-time workers than there were prior to the recession. An economy more about doing than making Politicians of both parties love to talk about manufacturing. Obama pushed manufacturing initiatives throughout his presidency, and Trump built much of his economic message during the campaign around singing the praises of America's manufacturers. But when it comes to employment, the goods-producing share of the economy has continued to fall. Throughout the past few decades, the share of Americans who make things \u2014 people in manufacturing, mining, logging and construction \u2014 has fallen off, and that trend continued during the recent recession, finally flattening out toward the end. We present this chart over a longer time frame, which makes it a little bit of a cheat \u2014 this isn't exactly a measure of Obama's \"record on jobs.\" Nor is it necessarily a measure of economic weakness; in fact, manufacturing has, thanks to technological advances, maintained strong output while shedding workers . It's a reminder that all the usual macroeconomic indicators (unemployment, wages, labor force participation, GDP) can quantify a lot of things in the economy, but you have to dig in to learn about the quality of that economy \u2014 what exactly is going on behind those numbers. This decline in goods-producing jobs doesn't signal that the economy is getting worse or better \u2014 it's just changing, in this case to become more focused on providing services , instead of goods. All of this is to say that Trump inherits a job market that is humming along comfortably, given how poor of shape it was in only recently. But it's also an economy that has sharply moved away from manufacturing and other goods-producing industries \u2014 the very ones he pushed the most in the election. That change has hurt plenty of Americans, despite the job market's improvement. Trump has tried to claim credit for several hundred goods-producing jobs here and there (credit that he doesn't always deserve, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump has reported ), but bringing manufacturing employment back in a sizable way seems like a tall order for any president. Furthermore, alternative work \u2014 like driving an Uber or Lyft \u2014 continues to grow quickly as a share of the economy. That change could eventually require policy attention, as more workers take jobs that don't come with benefits. But there's another big caveat here. Presidents get lots of credit and blame for the economy's performance, despite the fact that they don't really have firm control over that performance. (If they did, why would recessions ever happen?) Yes, a president can push an economic agenda and in some cases push particular policies that end up having a sizable impact on the economy (see: the 2009 stimulus package, which undeniably had a positive impact). But they also need Congress to enact those policies. Not only that, but the Federal Reserve has its own set of controls \u2014 a set to which the president does not have access, despite some conspiracies of politically motivated Fed scale-tipping. So, like Obama, whatever happens to the economy under Trump, he may not deserve whatever credit he may claim (and the same goes for whatever blame is thrown his way). ",

Three of the five victims of a lone gunman's rampage flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from out of state, bound for Caribbean cruise ships with their spouses. Related: Suspected Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooter Charged, Faces Possible Death Penalty But their sailing getaways turned tragic when a gunman opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, randomly killing his targets and wounding another six people at a baggage claim, officials and witnesses said. The FBI said officials would only provide names of victims after relatives were contacted, although family members and loved ones have been releasing them. The victims are identified as: Olga Woltering, 84 Woltering, of Marietta, Georgia, was going on a cruise as a special treat for her husband, Ralph, who was celebrating his 90th birthday, according to Bruce Publicover, a deacon and family friend. Bruce Woltering survived the shooting. \"It was, 'Hey, we're gonna have some fun,' and they were cruise people,\" Publicover told NBC News about the couple's plans. Olga Wolteringwith her husband in an undated family photo. Courtesy of family The Wolterings were originally from England and had been married for over 60 years, Publicover said. They were also longtime members of their local Catholic church, always sitting in the front row during services. \"I think that they were the most lovely couple south of the Mason-Dixon line,\" he said. \"They're truly in love ... and if anybody exhibited youthful love in a mature senior setting, they did.\" The couple had two sons. One of them, Tim Woltering, told NBC News that his mother was a \"loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and good friend to many ... she remains in our hearts, thoughts, and memories forever.\" Publicover said they would be supporting Ralph Woltering, who lost his \"beautiful angel\" and wife with whom he was \"so perfectly paired.\" \"We're going to watch out for him like he was our own dad, our own brother, and try to help the best we can,\" he added. Terry Andres, 62 Andres, of Norfolk, Virginia, was going on a cruise with his wife, Ann, and was set to celebrate his birthday later this month, his daughter told NBC affiliate WAVY . She was not physically harmed. Terry Andres, 62, of Virginia Beach, Va., was going on a 16-day cruise with his wife when he was killed Friday. Courtesy of Andres family Andres was an employee at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, The Virginian-Pilot reported, and was a support technician volunteer with the Oceana Volunteer Fire Department since 2004. \"He was well liked and respected for both his dedication to being a volunteer as well as his professional approach to his job as a support tech,\" the department said in a statement. \"We mourn his passing as we do all the victims of the senseless attack in Ft. Lauderdale.\" Ryan Kim, Andres' daughter, told The Palm Beach Post that her father texted upon landing in Fort Lauderdale for their 16-day cruise. She added that she was in disbelief that her father was taken so suddenly. \"I know that everyone always says that people are the greatest in the world, but he was the greatest person you could know,\" Kim said. \"He never had a horrible word to say about anyone or anything.\" He often traveled just for work, she added, and this was the first time her parents were getting to go on such a cruise. Michael Oehme, 57 Oehme, of Council Bluff, Iowa, flew to Florida with his wife, Kari, to go on a high seas adventure, his family said. Kari Oehme, 52, suffered a shoulder wound, but was expected to recover, Oehme's sister, Elizabeth Oehme-Miller, told NBC affiliate WOWT . Oehme-Miller said the couple were frequent travelers, and that another family member was flying to Fort Lauderdale to help Kari Oehme come home. Oehme worked as a surveyor, while his wife is a customer service representative for a telecommunications company, according to her Facebook profile. Phil McCausland ",

    "text": "The FBI says Esteban Santiago-Ruiz, the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting suspect and U.S. Army veteran, first popped up on their radar two months... Santiago , 26, had trouble controlling his anger after serving in Iraq and told his brother that he felt he was being chased and controlled by the CIA through secret online messages. When he told agents at an FBI field office his paranoid thoughts in November, he was evaluated for four days, then released without any follow-up medication or therapy.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI failed there,\u201d Bryan Santiago told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this.\u201d Speaking in Spanish outside his family\u2019s house in Penuelas, the brother said: \u201cThe federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u00a0 Bryan Santiago speaks about his brother Esteban, a man accused of shooting five people at a Florida airport, in Penuelas, Puerto Rico, Jan. 7, 2017. AP A law enforcement source said when Santiago -- who had been living in Anchorage, Alaska -- walked into the FBI office in November, he had a handgun in his possession, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. It is not known if the handgun was the 9mm handgun that authorities said Santiago used in the Florida attack on Friday.\u00a0 The weapon had been taken away when he entered the FBI reception area and was held while he was interviewed by the FBI, Milton reports. When the Anchorage Police Department transported Santiago to the hospital, they took possession of the weapon. The law enforcement source said that apparently the police department returned the weapon to Santiago after he received a medical evaluation. A U.S. law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CBS News that Santiago had said that his mind was being controlled by the CIA and the U.S. government and that he was being forced to watch videos from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The FBI office in Alaska declined to comment ahead of a Saturday news conference. There were other signs of trouble. Santiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend\u2019s Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents.\u00a0 A month later, municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. Bryan Santiago said his brother had requested psychological help but barely received any. \u201cI told him to go to church or to seek professional help,\u201d he said. Family members have said Esteban Santiago changed after serving a yearlong tour in Iraq. He was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. He deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. Esteban Santiago\u2019s mother wiped tears from her eyes as she stood inside a screen door Saturday. She said her son had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode near two friends while serving in Iraq.\u00a0 Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a Guard spokeswoman, told The New York Times that two soldiers in Santiago\u2019s company had died during his stint in Iraq. Former neighbor Ursula Candelario in Penuelas recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \u201cHe was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in shock. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead said. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. She would not elaborate on his discharge. The Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. ",

Atmospheric rivers are key to California's rainfall. Louis Sahagun , Joseph Serna , Tony Barboza and Paige St. John Contact Reporters The first band of what forecasters predict will be the region\u2019s\u00a0most powerful storm in a decade moved into Northern California on Saturday, prompting official\u00a0warnings of widespread\u00a0flooding and\u00a0epic snowfall. \u201cPeople are definitely in a state of panic right now,\u201d\u00a0said El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Todd Hammitt.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of calls asking if we\u2019re going to be able to deal with everything. It\u2019s the general pandemonium of not knowing what\u2019s coming.\u201d The storm system \u2014\u00a0known as an atmospheric river \u2014\u00a0could dump so much rain and snow that some ski runs and roads will be declared off-limits, with\u00a0forecasters warning of significant flooding, mudslides and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada. Up to 12 inches of rain is expected to fall on areas below 8,500 feet\u00a0beginning Saturday morning,\u00a0and up to 7\u00a0feet of snow could bury higher elevations, according to the\u00a0 National Weather Service .\u00a0Forecasters said\u00a0the storm was\u00a0packing the same wallop as one that hit Northern California in 2005, causing\u00a0$300 million in damage. Live updates: Winter weather slams California \u00bb This weekend\u2019s system could bring 36 consecutive\u00a0hours of heavy rain from Mammoth Mountain to Susanville, in Lassen County. Though that\u00a0 is good news \u00a0for California, which is entering its sixth year of drought,\u00a0the coming rain could melt already standing snow \u2014 feeding watersheds swollen from storms earlier this week, forecasters said.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a busy weekend,\u201d said Edan Weishahn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno, sighing.\u00a0 The rain moved in late Friday and continued into Saturday morning, with the most powerful punch expected later in the day. In the eastern Sierra Nevada, snow continued to fall\u00a0at higher elevations while rain drizzled lower down as officials warned that wetter, rainier conditions on tap for later this weekend could spell trouble. Officials toiling to keep highways clear said they were\u00a0concerned about a warmer phase of the storm that could fall as rain even at higher elevations, melting the built-up snow and unleashing mudslides, flooding and avalanches. \"It's the rain over the snow that we're worried about,\" said Greg Miller, a Caltrans maintenance manager. \"We've had snow since Christmas, but now with the warmer trend, we're worried about water.\" With storm drains frozen, he said, an influx of rain could send water and mud into roadways. Miller said crews were taking special precautions to prevent rockslides from a segment of U.S. 395 near Lee Vining and avalanches from several other critical transportation corridors. Friday morning, Caltrans closed part of California 120 near June Lake while a crew set out off remotely detonated charges to clear avalanche-prone slopes of accumulating snow. Crews were plowing, sanding and blowing snow from roadways around the clock in 12-hour shifts, Miller said. The California Highway Patrol responded to several reports of rolled-over vehicles and other snow-related collisions on U.S.\u00a0395. Tire chain restrictions were in effect across much of the Sierra Nevada. Residents in Mammoth Lakes are concerned that warm rain and slush will dam up behind banks of shoveled snow piled high in empty lots and along roads throughout town, then flow wherever it can find a path, clogging existing drainage systems with debris and ice. \u201cIn this town, we don\u2019t even have rain gutters because they get ripped down by snow,\u201d said Lisa Isaacs, a resident and environmental activist. \u201cSo, we\u2019re very worried that this storm will flood homes and garages.\u201d The National Weather Service issued a flood watch warning for Sunday, and town officials advised residents to stock up on water, food, first aid supplies, clothing and bedding, tools and emergency supplies, along with special items for medical conditions. On a winter war footing, Mammoth Lakes residents lined up throughout the day on Saturday at the town\u2019s utility yard to load up on 40-pound sandbags they hoped would steer waves of slush away from homes, ground-floor condominiums and businesses. Among them were Mammoth Lakes residents Greg Newbry, 66, a recently retired Mono County employee, and his wife, Linda Salcido, 67, Mono County\u2019s director of public health. \u201cI was here in 1982 when this town was wrecked by massive flooding,\u201d Newbry recalled. \u201cMain Street was under 2 feet of water. Businesses closed. The roofs of five mobile homes collapsed under the weight of rain on snow. \u201cIf we get all the rain predicted in the forecasts,\u201d he added, \u201cevery slab of concrete at ground level is vulnerable, and we live in a ground-floor condominium.\u201d As she helped tote 20 sandbags to their vehicle, Salcido said she was concerned about\u00a0the potential effects of flooding countywide. \u201cSnow, even lots and lots of it, we can handle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a major flood event would lead to countless challenges.\u201d Up on Mammoth Mountain, the mood was more upbeat as thousands of skiers and snowboarders raced down slopes that had received as much as 80 inches of snow over the last week alone. Rising 11,000 feet from a gap in the Sierra Nevada range, Mammoth Mountain\u2019s steep chutes stand in the path of freshly brewed atmospheric river systems. With relatively low mountains to the west of it, Mammoth receives most of their unspent snow. But big snowfall, high winds, warm rain and rising temperatures are forces that transform pile powder into unstable clumps that set off avalanches. So Mammoth Mountain Resort specialists were bringing snowpacks down with artillery including howitzers. Down in Mammoth Lakes, Isaacs\u00a0spent Saturday hoping that \u201cthe rain they keep talking about will turn out to be snow.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019ll probably be like having a giant fire big hose turned on us and we\u2019ll be swamped,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh. \u201cI just hope that my little $150 water pump can keep with it.\u201d Mammoth Mountain Chief Executive Rusty Gregory had few answers. \u201cThe main topic of conversation over cocktails on Sunday night,\u201d he mused, \u201cwill be about what actually happened.\u201d As snow and rain continued to dump over the Sierra Nevada, highway patrols and maintenance crews were kept busy Friday responding to snow-related accidents and icy road conditions. Steve Coons operated a massive Caltrans wing plow. Its engine strained as it worked in tandem with another truck to clear and sand two northbound lanes of U.S. 395 north of Bishop, a key transportation corridor along the Eastern Sierra Nevada. From behind the wheel of the rumbling truck, Coons can feel the weight of the heavy, wet snow as it pushes against the plow blade and is shoved to the side of the highway. \u201cThe truck is really chugging,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d Coons monitors closely the consistency of the snow, which wavers between soft, large flakes and icy shards. The more that it falls as rain and ice, the more he worries it will make the roads slick and cause serious trouble for drivers. \u201cAs soon as it gets cold all this ices up,\u201d Coons said. \u201cNot good.\u201d He and other plow operators are on the roads 24 hours a day, working 12-hour shifts. They will have no shortage of snow to clear with the series of storm cells expected to continue dumping moisture over the area for days. \u201cOur guys have pretty much been on since Christmas, and it\u2019s not letting up,\u201d said Greg Miller, maintenance manager for Caltrans District 9, which includes Inyo, Mono and eastern Kern counties. The storm was also bringing wind gusts that topped 50 mph. Officials said they were low snow and icy conditions on Interstate 5 and 80 as well as U.S. 50 and some mountain highways. The National Weather Service on Saturday released a new timeline for the storms moving through the region: Saturday: Moderate to heavy snow in mountain areas. Sunday: Heaviest rain and snow, with risks of flooding. Monday: Showers and snow continue, with continued flood risk. Tuesday: New storm moves in, lower snow levels, flood risk. Wednesday: Showers and snow, with rivers running high. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting heavy, heavy rain. It starts out as snow then turns to rain then turns to snow again,\u201d Hammitt said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the melt increasing waterways and all the lakes.\u201d Hammitt recalled storms in 1997 and 2005\u00a0when\u00a0runoff overwhelmed local rivers and creeks and sent water into roads and homes,\u00a0lifting some buildings\u00a0off their foundations. \u201cWe have streams, creeks, rivers. We have lakes and ponds,\u201d Hammitt said. \u201cAnybody near a water source could be in jeopardy depending on the severity of the storm.\u201d Two sinkholes have been reported on El Dorado County roads as a result of\u00a0three days of rain\u00a0this week. Residents have already filled 12,000 sandbags in preparation for the storm and an additional 20,000 were on the way in, Hammitt said.\u00a0 \u201cAnytime it\u2019s Mother Nature, you have to be ready,\u201d Hammitt said.

    "text": "Suspect Charged With Federal Crimes in Fort Lauderdale Airport Attack By Morgan Winsor Jan 7, 2017, 7:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Alleged Gunman Esteban Santiago Arrives at Broward County Jail 0 Shares Email The man suspected of opening fire in a baggage claim area of a Florida airport Friday, killing five people and wounding six, allegedly told the FBI he had planned the attack and bought a one-way ticket to Fort Lauderdale to carry it out, according to an FBI affidavit. Esteban Santiago, 26, has been charged with federal crimes linked to the shooting, including performing an act of violence against a person at an airport, using a firearm in a crime of violence and causing death with a firearm. The charges come with the possibility of the death penalty. Investigators have found \"no specific reason\" why he chose the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and have yet to determine a motive for the shooting, which took place Friday afternoon just before 1 p.m. ET in the baggage claim at Terminal 2, according to George Piro, special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami office. \"We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack,\" Pirro said at a press conference Saturday morning. \"We're pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack.\" President Obama 'Heartbroken' for Victims' Families After Fort Lauderdale Shooting Senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that Santiago arrived Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale on a flight from Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had connected from a flight from Anchorage, Alaska, that he boarded Thursday night. The Associated Press People stand on the tarmac at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after a shooter opened fire inside a terminal of the airport, killing several people and wounding others before being taken into custody, Friday, Jan. 6, 2017. Anchorage Airport Police and Fire officials told ABC News Santiago only checked one bag -- a hard case carrying his gun. TSA regulations allow guns to be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that cannot be easily accessed. \"That is absolutely something that I think we need to revisit,\" U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said at the press conference Saturday morning. \"We have revisited our security measures at airports every time we\u2019ve had a security breach.\u201d According to court records, Santiago told authorities he loaded a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun in a bathroom at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, came out out and \"shot the first people he encountered.\" Santiago fired 10-15 rounds and was \"aiming at victims' heads,\" the FBI said in a sworn affidavit to support the federal criminal charges. Agents saw surveillance video that support witness statements that Santiago was \"walking while shooting in a methodical manner,\" the affidavit said. At one point he exited Terminal 2 baggage claim, walked outside and then re-entered. At that point a sheriff's deputy confronted him, and Santiago dropped the weapon, its ammunition spent, according to the affidavit. In his interview with the FBI, Santiago said \"he had planned the attack, purchasing a one-way ticket,\" according to the affidavit. Santiago confirmed he claimed the box with the gun, brought it into a bathroom, put the gun in his waistband, left the men's room and \"shot the first people he encountered.\" He emptied one magazine, reloaded, and then emptied another magazine, the affidavit said. In addition to those wounded initially amid the gunfire, dozens of others were injured after the incident. A total of 54 patients have been taken to Broward Health Medical Center since Friday's shooting. Of those 54, nine patients were admitted, six of them with gunshot wounds. As of Saturday afternoon, eight patients remain hospitalized at Broward Health Medical Center -- six are listed in good condition and two are in critical condition, the hospital said in a press release. Piro said law enforcement officials have identified the five victims and are in the process of notifying family members and loved ones. Their names have not been released. According to authorities, Santiago did not try to take any hostages during the incident, nor did he make any statements while firing the weapon. The FBI said they are not aware of any incident on board the flight or at the baggage claim that might have triggered the shooting. Law enforcement officials said Santiago was carrying military identification at the time of the incident. The suspect was apprehended and placed in federal custody. He was booked overnight at the Broward County Jail and is currently being held for murder, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office. Santiago will likely make his first court appearance Monday, Piro said at the press conference Saturday. The Associated Press Esteban Santiago, 26, the suspect in the deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, is transported to the Broward County Main Jail by authorities, Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017. More details are beginning to emerge about the suspected gunman. Santiago, who spent nine years in the military, was a combat engineer with the Alaska Army National Guard and left the military in August, according to Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions at the rank of Private First Class. Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011. Along the way, he earned a number of awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal, according to his service record. A senior law enforcement official told ABC News that Santiago walked into the FBI's Anchorage field office in November last year after his discharge from the military and said he was under mind control by a U.S. intelligence agency. The official said he appeared incoherent and agitated, saying the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos. The official said Santiago stated he didn't want to hurt anyone. Still, the FBI contacted local law enforcement, which, out of caution, had him medically evaluated. The FBI closed the probe after reviewing databases and interviewing family, the official told ABC News. Broward County Sheriffs Office Esteban Santiago's booking record with the Broward County Sheriff's Office. The Associated Press This booking photo provided by the Broward Sheriff's Office shows suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago, 26, Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Sources told ABC News that Santiago had received mental health treatment after the encounter with the FBI in Anchorage. A person who answered the phone for Signal 88 -- a company in Anchorage where Santiago worked in a security capacity -- told ABC News it has no comment and is \"currently under the advisement of federal authorities.\" A senior law enforcement official briefed on the case told ABC News that authorities are \"tearing apart\" Santiago's service record to determine if he was suffering from PTSD. The FBI said investigators are also reviewing Santiago's social media accounts and online activity. During a press conference Saturday morning, FBI special agent in charge Piro said they have interviewed Santiago and members of his family. Local and federal authorities now are in the process of conducting further interviews and pursuing leads in south Florida and several locations throughout the United States. So far, officials interviewed 175 witnesses and have recovered various video and physical evidence, Piro said. \"God have mercy not only for us but for everyone,\" Santiago's aunt, Maria Ruiz, speaking in Spanish, told reporters outside her Union City, N.J., home Friday. \"I am really sorry. I am so sad.\" The Associated Press Employees and passengers walk into the parking garage near the scene of a deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport, Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was closed to departing and arriving flights following the deadly shooting. Cargo and general aviation (private small planes, corporate jets) operations resumed at midnight, the airport said on its Twitter page. Marke Gale, aviation director of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, said the airport resumed its operations for commercial and passenger services at 5 a.m. ET Saturday. But Gale warned that there may still be cancellations and delays due to poor weather conditions and the aftermath of the shooting. Terminal 2, the location of the shooting, remained closed Saturday morning, Gale said. Allan Siegel, the airport's committee outreach coordinator, told ABC News the two airlines that fly out of Terminal 2 -- Delta Airlines and Air Canada -- will operate from other terminals. At the press conference Saturday morning, Gale said airport officials have collected more than 20,000 various personal items that were left behind during the evacuation, including luggage, cellphones and laptops. Passengers can call 1-866-435-9355 to report their missing items, Gale said. \"We are in the process of cataloguing all those items, protecting it, securing it so we can get it back to its rightful owner as soon as we possibly can,\" he told reporters. \"Please understand it's going to take some time to process that large number of items.\" Hundreds of passengers who spent the night at nearby Port Everglades were brought back on buses Saturday to the airport to catch their flights. The Red Cross provided bedding, food and water for the displaced passengers. Wasserman Schultz said Florida is working with its partners in \"a united front\" to cope and heal from the mass shooting. \"This is obviously a horrific tragedy and we are devastated that this happened in our hometown, in our corner of paradise,\" she told reporters Saturday morning.

    "text": "Federal prosecutors file charges against Santiago, he could face the death penalty Published               January 07, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 The suspected killer in the Ft. Lauderdale rampage, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, was charged on Saturday with performing an act of violence at an airport, which could earn him the death penalty if he is convicted. Federal prosecutors filed the charges, which include violations related to firearms, in Broward County, Florida. Earlier, the FBI announced that Santiago apparently traveled to the airport for the purpose of carrying out the bloody rampage. Terrorism may have been a \"potential motivation\" for the attack on Friday that killed five people,\u00a0Special Agent in Charge\u00a0George Piro said during a news conference, adding that officials would release specific charges later Saturday. Later in the afternoon, police in Alaska said they had returned a handgun to the Florida airport shooting suspect which was temporarily taken from him when he underwent a mental evaluation late last year, according to a Reuters report. Anchorage Police Chief Christopher Tolley said it was not immediately clear if it was the same gun used in Friday's deadly rampage. Officials told a news conference the gun was returned to the suspect because the Iraq war veteran had not committed a crime. Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the\u00a0 Sun Sentinel reported . VIDEO: SEN. RUBIO REACTS TO AIRPORT SHOOTING\u00a0 The suspected shooter had a history of mental health problems -- some of which followed his military service in Iraq -- and was receiving psychological treatment at his home in Alaska, his relatives said. FBI investigators questioned Santiago for hours. Piro said investigators were scouring the 26-year-old suspect's social media footprint and looking into where he'd traveled before. Santiago was not on any no-fly list, according to the FBI. He allegedly carried out the attack with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, Piro added. FT. LAUDERDALE SHOOTING SUSPECT SAID HE WAS FORCED TO WATCH ISIS VIDEOS Broward County Sheriff\u00a0Scott\u00a0Israel said six people were wounded in the attack -- not eight, as officials had said Friday. Three were in the intensive care unit and three were in good condition, Israel told reporters. \"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good,\" Santiago's uncle, Hernan Rivera,\u00a0 told The Record newspaper . Santiago deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. In recent years, Santiago -- a new dad, family said -- had been living in Anchorage, Alaska, his brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press from Puerto Rico. Bryan Santiago said his brother's girlfriend had recently called the family to alert them to his treatment. In November, Esteban told FBI agents in Alaska that the government was controlling his mind and was forcing him to watch Islamic State group videos, a law enforcement official said. The official was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation by name and spoke Friday on condition of anonymity. The FBI agents notified the police after the interview with Esteban Santiago, who took him in for a mental health evaluation. Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. \"We have not talked for the past three weeks,\" Bryan Santiago said. \"That's a bit unusual ... I'm in shock. He was a serious person ... He was a normal person.\" Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. Former neighbor Ursula Candelario recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \"He was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\" she said. \"We're in shock. I couldn't believe it,\" said Candelario. While in Iraq, Santiago cleared roads of improvised explosive devices and at least two members of his company were killed, spokesman Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead told The New York Times. He was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead told the AP. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \"unsatisfactory performance,\" said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman. His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. She would not elaborate on his discharge, but the Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. Still, he'd had some successes during his military career, being awarded a number of medals and commendations including the Iraq Campaign Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. His uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago after his arrest at the Fort Lauderdale airport. \u00a0FBI agents arrived at their house to question them, and reporters swarmed around. Maria Ruiz told The Record that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling. \"It was like he lost his mind,\" she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. \"He said he saw things.\" Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun. Santiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend's Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents. A month later municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. Law enforcement officers were at the girlfriend's home Friday afternoon, and officers guarding the property outside told a reporter who approached the home to step away. Senator-elect Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live in Puerto Rico, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting. \"They're very humble and very Christian people,\" Cruz said of Esteban Santiago's brother and mother. \"They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Officials say he reached out to the FBI in November and told them that the Islamic State had taken control of his mind. USA TODAY NETWORK This booking photo provided by the Broward Sheriff's Office shows suspect Esteban Santiago, 26, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Relatives of the man who police say opened fire Friday killing several people and wounding others at Fort Lauderdale airport report that he had a history of mental health issues. (Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office, AP) Federal\u00a0prosecutors late Saturday\u00a0filed charges\u00a0against a man accused of going\u00a0on a shooting rampage at a Florida airport that killed five people. The charges could bring the death penalty if he is convicted.\u00a0 The Miami U.S. attorney's office accused Esteban Santiago of an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death. He was also charged with two firearms offenses. Earlier Saturday, the FBI said Santiago flew to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport\u00a0specifically to carry out the attack, but his motive remains unclear. Federal authorities, who concluded\u00a0their interview\u00a0with Santiago\u00a0early Saturday, said they have not ruled out terrorism in the attack Friday but believe he acted alone. \"Indications are that he came here to carry out this horrific act,\" said George Piro, special agent in charge of the Miami office. \"We have not identified any triggers that would've caused this attack.\" He also said it was unclear why the shooter would have picked the Florida airport for the rampage. Share Fla. Governor Rick Scott speaks at the Fort Lauderdale - Hollywood International Airport Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq veteran, was\u00a0taken into custody only seconds after the melee ended at\u00a0the baggage claim area of Terminal 2. Witnesses said the shooter reloaded at least twice, then dropped to the floor spread-eagle and waited to be arrested after running out of ammunition. Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel on Saturday revised downward the\u00a0number of people wounded in the incident\u00a0from eight to six, including three people being treated in intensive care and three listed in good condition. Piro said Santiago was cooperative during\u00a0interviews with investigators and was\u00a0booked on\u00a0federal murder charges at the Broward County jail. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale early Friday aboard a Delta flight that originated Thursday. Piro said\u00a0Santiago allegedly retrieved his 9mm automatic handgun that he had packed in\u00a0checked luggage\u00a0and opened fire on passengers around a baggage carousel. He said investigators were looking at video to get a clear picture of how the shooting unfolded\u00a0and whether any other person might have helped the gunman. \"We are continuing to look at the terrorism angle as a potential motivation,\" Piro said. \"At this point, it appears he acted alone.\" He added\u00a0it appeared the suspect followed federal procedures in checking in the weapon before boarding his original flight. Piro\u00a0also\u00a0said authorities have\u00a0conducted more than 100 interviews in connection with the case and have\u00a0confiscated evidence, including cellphones and laptops. Authorities in Alaska who last year referred Santiago for mental evaluation said\u00a0Saturday he was allowed to retrieve his gun in early December.\u00a0Santiago\u00a0could not be denied his weapon because he was not declared \"adjudicated mentally ill,\" Alaska U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler said during a press conference. Federal law prohibits the mentally ill from possessing weapons, but only if they've been formally declared adjudicated. In November, the suspect appeared unannounced in the FBI offices in Anchorage, complaining that the Islamic State had gained control of his mind and was urging him to fight on its behalf, a federal law enforcement official not authorized to speak publicly about the incident told USA TODAY. \"His erratic behavior concerned FBI agents,\" Piro said. The FBI conducted a background check, learning of his military record, which included service in Iraq, but found no connection to terror groups. Determining that the man apparently needed psychiatric care, the FBI alerted local law enforcement and turned him over to their custody for a medical referral.\u00a0It is not clear whether Santiago received treatment following that incident.

Then-President-elect Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, and daughters Sasha and Malia,\u00a0 onstage after Obama's acceptance speech in Chicago's Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2008. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy As the political stages got bigger for Barack Obama on the way to a historic presidency, so did the size of the rooms he commanded in his adopted city. Small, at the beginning. The cozy Hyde Park Ramada Inn near the lake to kick off his 1996 state Senate bid. To launch his underdog 2004 U.S. Senate run, a slight upgrade to a small room at Hotel Allegro, a Loop spot long favored by Democrats. Then the biggest stage of them all, Grant Park, where he and 240,000 supporters celebrated a landslide 2008 victory that made him the nation's first black president. As Obama returns to Chicago for the final time in office, the venue is a bit smaller. Some of the same faithful who gathered at McCormick Place to mark his 2012 re-election will be there again Tuesday night as the president delivers a farewell address he's described as \"a chance to say thank-you for this amazing journey.\" Obama library: Latest stories, photos, commentary Open link What Chicago has meant to Obama is clear: It remains a part of his core, the home base where he'll build his presidential library and headquarter his foundation \u2014 even if it's not where he'll call home in his immediate post-White House days. But ask the city's political and community leaders what Obama's presidency has meant to Chicago, and the perspectives are as diverse as the city's 77 neighborhoods. Top aides who worked with him in the West Wing point to key projects Obama's administration awarded to Chicago, from a new runway at O'Hare and improvements to CTA lines to an expanded Riverwalk and a new high-tech digital manufacturing hub. They stress that Obama's signature Affordable Care Act has provided insurance to hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans who wouldn't have it otherwise. And they give the president credit for restoring a cratering national economy and saving an American auto industry rooted in the Midwest, moves that helped lead Chicago out of its recession. These Obama allies also acknowledge Obama didn't achieve everything he sought. A national infrastructure program that could have meant more big projects and jobs for Chicagoans eluded him. So, too, did securing tougher gun control measures \u2014 an issue that remains prominent as the city's homicides and shootings have surged. I'm sure there are many areas in which he would have liked to have done more, and there are many areas in which if he had some cooperation, he could have done more. \u2014 David Axelrod His backers argue those type of achievements were unattainable in large part because of the challenges posed by the Great Recession at the outset of his presidency and Republican control of Congress in Obama's final six years that made it difficult for him to win legislative victories in the face of constant obstruction on Capitol Hill. \"I'm sure there are many areas in which he would have liked to have done more, and there are many areas in which if he had some cooperation, he could have done more,\" said David Axelrod , Obama's longtime political strategist who served as a White House senior adviser. \"But the disappointments don't go away even as you take satisfaction in your accomplishments. You have to accept that you're there for a short period of time in the big scheme of things, and you do as much as you can and then spend the rest of your life trying to make contributions in other ways.\" To some Chicago community organizers and activists \u2014 the very role in which Obama sowed his own political seeds \u2014 the president's track record is more mixed. They laud the president and First Lady Michelle Obama for setting an example as role models for young African-Americans, but lament that Obama didn't do more to tip the scales of inequality they see in city schools that lack proper resources and in Chicago neighborhoods void of economic opportunity. \"I think Barack Obama has ignored the black community for eight years, and now he's coming to take a bow in Chicago while our neighborhoods are suffering from disinvestment and soaring unemployment,\" said Ja'Mal Green, who rose to Chicago prominence among a group of young activists who decried police misconduct following the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video. \"We are seeing young black men getting gunned down at a horrific rate,\" Green said, \"and he has shown no willingness to seriously address these issues.\" President Barack Obama will give his farewell address Jan. 10 at McCormick Place. Since the president's inauguration in 2009, he has made it back home to Chicago 28 times. The vast majority of those visits were for campaign events and fundraisers, but he also has given a handful of speeches on... (Nausheen Husain and Jonathon Berlin) For his part, Obama has sought to reconnect with Chicago ahead of his farewell speech. On Thursday, he sat for a rare round of short White House interviews with reporters from the city's five major TV stations. The White House declined multiple Chicago Tribune requests for an interview with the president. In his Saturday radio address, Obama explained why he picked the city for his speech. \"I chose Chicago not only because it's my hometown \u2014 where I met my wife and we started a family \u2014 but also because it's really where my career in public service began,\" he said. Projects that 'stand the test of time' Ask Rahm Emanuel what Obama's presidency has meant for Chicago, and the mayor immediately launches into a list of projects that have received federal funding \u2014 most of them on his watch. But funding first started to flow to Chicago in the early months of Obama's presidency when Emanuel still was working as the president's first chief of staff. With the economy plummeting, Obama and the Democratic majority in Congress pushed through an $840 billion stimulus program. Illinois received nearly $12 billion in grants, contracts and loans for projects ranging from new roads and repaved runways to research grants and faster rail lines. That ranked the state fourth nationwide in overall funding, but 22nd when measured per capita, at $921 per citizen. Chicago received 76 stimulus awards worth $513 million, in the form of money for neighborhood stabilization, homelessness prevention, airport paving, resurfacing major arterial roads and rebuilding Congress Parkway in the Loop. Other state transportation projects funded by the stimulus benefited the city, such as the $126 million Englewood flyover that separated two major railroad crossings on the South Side. Transportation money also flowed: an additional $155 million for a new O'Hare runway that opened in 2013, $345 million for a sixth east-west O'Hare runway and new taxiways. The CTA got several grants, including $47 million for Blue Line work, $20 million to expand the 95th Street Red Line station and a commitment for $1.1 billion to revamp the Red and Purple lines between North and Devon avenues. The lakefront and riverfront also were helped. Emanuel secured a $98.6 million federal loan to expand the Riverwalk from State to Lake streets, while Chicago benefited from a $2.2 billion Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an effort to restore wetlands and clean up pollution. \"If you think about it, these are all major economic and culture investments that will stand the test of time,\" Emanuel said. \"Those are things that have, and will, going forward, drive Chicago's economic and cultural growth and keep the city a world-class city.\" Chicago also was awarded two other competitive grants from the Obama administration, including $70 million in federal money to build a public-private digital manufacturing institute on Goose Island, beating out the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and aerospace hub Huntsville, Ala., among other competitors. White House \u00a0and positions... Barack Obama\u00a0was elected America's first black president promising hope and change \u2014 but he inherited an economy at risk of collapse and a military fighting two wars abroad. So the 47-year-old president-elect turned to a deep bench of trusted Chicagoans to fill top jobs at the\u00a0 White House \u00a0and positions... (Katherine Skiba) Argonne National Laboratory in suburban Lemont won a $120 million grant from the Department of Energy to create a so-called Energy Innovation Hub to advance battery technology through a partnership with researchers at the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, University of Illinois at Chicago , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Michigan. Emanuel lobbied heavily for some of the projects, making nearly 50 trips to Washington in his five-plus years as mayor. His official calendars showed him meeting with Defense officials before the digital manufacturing grant was awarded and several meetings with transportation officials in the months running up to grant announcements. The mayor said Chicago projects had to meet a higher standard because the Obama administration did not want any deals for the president's hometown to \"come under the political microscope.\" \"It's a double-edged sword. One side is you're his first chief of staff, helped assemble the administration and you're also a former member of Congress and know that process, so it's helpful,\" said Emanuel, who represented a North Side district before leaving that post to work for Obama. \"On the other hand, the projects had to be better than good, they had to be great. It was getting double scrutiny, because it couldn't be a gift.\" William Daley , the son of one former Chicago mayor and the brother of another, said he saw firsthand the aversion in the Obama White House toward any perceived favoritism for Chicago. That was particularly true, he said, when Chicago did not win any of the initial education grants under Obama's Race to the Top program, even as former Chicago Public Schools CEO Arne Duncan was serving as secretary of education. \"The president was rightfully very sensitive to an allegation that somehow they were rigging the system to help Chicago,\" said Daley , who served as Obama's second chief of staff. \"A lot of people in Chicago were ticked off because they didn't make the cut. There was an expectation by a lot of the press that Chicago was going to get a ton of (education) money, because Obama was from there and Emanuel was mayor ... but that wasn't the case.\" Chicagoans tell their stories about important policy decisions as well as personal connections with the Obamas. Obama, though, did tap plenty of Chicagoans to take top positions in the administration. In addition to Emanuel and Daley as chiefs of staff, Axelrod as a senior adviser and Duncan as education secretary, Valerie Jarrett served as a top Obama confidant and adviser for all eight years and billionaire businesswoman Penny Pritzker was tapped for commerce secretary. Scores of other Chicagoans filled key advisory and staff positions and could emerge as key political players down the line, Obama's top advisers agreed. Emanuel often has said he didn't want to take the chief of staff job, content with his family settled in Chicago and a leadership role in Congress. But, the future mayor said, he abided by his grandfather's rule of only offering one of two answers to a request by the president, \"yes\" or \"yes, sir.\" The high-profile job did position Emanuel to move back to Chicago and run for mayor once Richard M. Daley announced his retirement. Asked if it's unlikely he would have become mayor otherwise, Emanuel laughs. \"That's a hypothetical that neither you or I can answer, OK?\" Emanuel said in an interview last week. \"I do know this: It helped.\" 'Sick of Barack Obama the politician' Some community activists and organizers, however, aren't as quick to paint a rosy picture of Obama's Chicago legacy. Jitu Brown, a longtime community organizer who helped lead a hunger strike to save Dyett High School in the Washington Park neighborhood after Emanuel tried to close it, termed Obama's impact on Chicago as \"complicated.\" Brown said he used to take Chicago students to visit then-state Sen. Obama in Springfield, and said his legacy as a role model for young people in the city can't be overstated. And he applauded Obama's successes on the economy and health care reform, saying working-class and poor Chicagoans have better lives because the president chose to emphasize those initiatives. But Brown termed the Obama administration's reliance on competition among states for federal education grants and the pro-charter school ethos exemplified by Duncan's tenure as education secretary \"a major disappointment, and a missed opportunity.\" I hear about people crying in Grant Park when he won in 2008, and now eight years later those same people are saying \"What happened?\" \u2014 Ja'Mal Green, Chicago activist Brown said many urban education activists hoped Obama's background in Chicago would lead to a re-examination of ways to fund local schools so children in all parts of the city would be able to get a good education near their homes. \"They aren't addressing the fact a child in a school at Diversey and Ashland is learning Mandarin and enjoying a strong arts program and a host of after-school activities, while at 45th and King Drive you have schools with 52 kindergartners in a classroom,\" Brown said. \"That's an ugliness I think the Obama administration failed miserably on.\" Green, the young activist who has been vocal on Chicago police misconduct, was unsparing in his assessment of Obama's disappointments. He said the president hasn't done enough to spur jobs in black neighborhoods, confront unjustified killings by police or work to prioritize solutions to the city's violent crime woes. \"I'm sick of Barack Obama the politician. We need somebody who's actually going to care about the issues,\" Green said. \"Young people and black people are the reason he's in office, and I think he's lost a lot of that support. I hear about people crying in Grant Park when he won in 2008, and now eight years later those same people are saying 'What happened?'\" Green gave Obama credit for efforts to pardon people in prison for drug crimes, but said the president has done too little to respond to the local and national outcry over police shootings. \"How can you be a black president coming from Chicago and not speak out at this time?\" he asked. \"Black Lives Matter started during your administration. Where's your voice on this?\" Amid concerns over police-neighborhood relations as an outgrowth of police-related shootings across the nation, Obama spoke to the International Association of Chiefs of Police at McCormick Place in October 2015. He sought to strike a balance between concerns of overaggressive policing and urging law enforcement to support tougher gun-control laws. But community organizer Amisha Patel said Obama too often tried to walk a fine line on such issues. \"I think the president was afraid to be clear on an urban agenda. I don't think he thought he had room to move on that, and so you get a really hands-off approach, these half-solutions,\" Patel said. \"There was tremendous pressure on Obama, being the first black president of this country, and I think he was focused on being seen as the president for everybody in the country, and so he moved away from urban issues.\" Patel applauded Obama's success with Obamacare and noted the great pride many Chicagoans feel in him, but said the high expectations many locals had when Obama took office because of his background and understanding of city problems were met with disappointment. \"When he campaigned in 2008, he campaigned as a community organizer, but he didn't govern as one,\" she said. \"I think that's a missed opportunity.\" ",

By Ed O'Keefe and Sean Sullivan January 7 at 6:03 PM Follow @edatpost Follow @WaPoSean A top ethics official has warned that plans to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s top Cabinet choices before background examinations are complete are unprecedented and have overwhelmed government investigators responsible for the reviews. The concerns prompted Democrats on Saturday to call for delaying the confirmation process, but Republicans signaled they are unlikely to budge on the eve of a slew of hearings in the Senate. The Trump administration-in-waiting faces its first big test in coming days, with as many as seven nominees for Cabinet positions \u2014 many of them already the subject of questions about their qualifications \u2014 scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill. The process begins Tuesday, when Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s controversial nominee for attorney general, is scheduled to begin two days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the big show is planned for Wednesday, when five hearings are scheduled, bringing a marathon of nationally televised scrutiny to the thin public records and vast wealth of many of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. Democrats have vowed to cast the hearings as a proxy test of Trump himself, in hopes of discrediting his new government before it begins. They hope to remind the public of the president-elect\u2019s own lack of government experience and reluctance to separate himself from an entanglement of global business interests while he leads the nation. View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far But even Democrats acknowledge that Trump\u2019s slate of Cabinet picks will probably sail through. The packed schedule, similar to those for nominees of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was orchestrated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the Trump team. In addition, Trump has scheduled a news conference Wednesday that will overlap with several hearings, at which he has promised to talk about separating his presidency from his business interests. Whether the schedule holds in the coming days is unclear. McConnell\u2019s office declined to respond to warnings by Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, who said in a letter released Friday the current confirmation calendar is \u201cof great concern to me\u201d because nominees have not completed a required ethics review before their hearings. [ Ethics office warns that Trump, GOP rushing Cabinet confirmations ] The schedule \u201chas created undue pressure on OGE\u2019s staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews,\u201d Shaub wrote in response to an inquiry by Democratic senators . \u201cMore significantly, it has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings.\u201d Shaub added: \u201cI am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.\u201d Republican aides have disputed that notion, saying that in some cases, nominees of both parties have sat for hearings before the paperwork process was completed. But Democrats struck back Saturday, saying that hearings should be delayed until all paperwork is completed. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said consideration of GOP power broker Betsy DeVos to be education secretary should be postponed until OGE finishes reviewing her background and financial investments for possible conflicts of interest or other ethics concerns. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) [ Democrats seek to delay confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, citing unfinished ethics review ] Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) condemned what he called a lack of cooperation and communication by the Trump transition and asked for a \u201ctimeout\u201d on consideration of nominees until such basic information as an ethics agreement is available to members of the Senate. \u201cWe should put all of these on hold until the background checks by the FBI and the ethics office reports are completed,\u201d he said in an interview Saturday. The OGE enforces federal ethics rules and reviews potential conflicts of interest for nominees to government posts. Shaub, a lawyer and political appointee of President Obama, took over the office in 2013. He donated a total of $500 to Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, federal elections records show. Ethics experts from both political parties expressed dismay at the possibility that confirmation hearings would proceed before the OGE reviews are completed. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Trevor Potter, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who has served as counsel to several Republican presidential candidates and Cabinet nominees in the past. \u201cThis suggests that there has been a real breakdown between the transition and the Office of Government Ethics.\u201d Much of the attention this week is expected to focus on Sessions and his controversial record on civil rights, and on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, who has never served in the public sector. [ Jeff Sessions\u2019s comments on race: For the record ] Tillerson is scheduled to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday. The health and education panel is set to consider DeVos the same day, while the Senate Intelligence Committee has announced plans to review the nomination of Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director. Elaine Chao \u2014 a former secretary of labor who is married to McConnell \u2014 is set to appear before the Commerce Committee to discuss her choice as transportation secretary. On Tuesday, in addition to Sessions, retired Marine general John Kelly is scheduled to testify at a Homeland Security committee hearing to review his nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, the Trump transition team said Saturday that the president-elect \u201cis putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly.\u201d The statement added that \u201cit is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country. This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.\u201d McConnell had already vowed Wednesday that \u201call the president-elect\u2019s Cabinet appointments will be confirmed.\u201d He called on Democrats to not delay votes on Trump\u2019s less controversial choices for national security posts, including Kelly and retired Marine general James Mattis, the nominee for secretary of defense. \u201cBasically, they can delay the process. They can\u2019t stop it,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said of his Democratic colleagues. [ Tillerson\u2019s Hill tour: No new friends, but some sympathy on Russia sanctions ] Republicans said they are proceeding quickly in hopes of confirming a handful of Trump picks on Inauguration Day, as happened eight years ago, when seven of Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees were confirmed unanimously on his first day in office. But Democrats said Obama\u2019s nominations moved quickly because nominees had submitted requisite paperwork by early January. On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Shaub\u2019s warning \u201cmakes crystal-clear that the transition team\u2019s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they\u2019ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.\u201d Murray said in an interview last week that Trump \u201cran his campaign telling people he was about jobs and workers. Many of these nominees don\u2019t share that view. Our responsibility is to make sure that we know what we are buying and the country knows what they bought.\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with more billionaires than we\u2019ve ever seen in one place in this Trump Cabinet. It creates a special challenge.\u201d Democrats said they plan to focus intently on nominees\u2019 business interests and financial disclosures. Several nominees, including DeVos and other picks not yet scheduled for hearings, will probably be grilled over past statements in support of dismantling portions of the departments they have been tapped to lead. Kelly, Pompeo, Sessions and Tillerson are the furthest along in responding to written questionnaires and divulging personal and financial information, according to Senate aides. But reviews by the FBI and OGE are still underway for most nominees, according to the aides, who are tracking the process but not authorized to speak publicly about details. Sessions\u2019s FBI check is complete, but other nominees have yet to complete all of the paperwork required by committees, because the FBI and OGE reviews continue, the aides said. Many of Trump\u2019s picks are widely unknown on Capitol Hill, prompting his transition team to recruit former GOP senators and the party\u2019s top-flight communications and policy talent to make introductions and assuage concerns among Republicans and Democrats alike. Nominees have been scheduled for more than 60 meet-and-greets with senators of both parties, according to Senate aides. Dress rehearsals to prepare for contentious lines of questioning have been underway for several days. Given Trump\u2019s refusal to release tax returns and other financial information during the presidential campaign, Democrats see his Cabinet choices as a way to revive the issue. But if Trump uses his scheduled news conference to divulge details of his finances amid a flurry of confirmation hearings, it may capture the news cycle and neutralize opposition. While each committee has different disclosure rules for Cabinet picks, just three panels \u2014 Budget, Finance, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \u2014 have the authority to require nominees to release three years of tax returns. Republicans have rebuffed Democratic requests to force all Cabinet nominees to do so. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, recalled that his panel\u2019s long-standing tax disclosure rules unearthed trouble for several of Obama\u2019s Cabinet choices, including former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle, who was forced to withdraw his nomination to serve as secretary of health and human services due to questions about unreported earnings and gifts. With Democrats vowing to pepper Tillerson about his tenure as an oil executive, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, said the former CEO\u2019s decision to completely cut ties with ExxonMobil was \u201cresponsible.\u201d \u201cIt certainly takes away an issue that we knew had to be taken away,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI mean, my very first conversation with him \u2014 he knew that, Exxon knew that.\u201d Corker added that Tillerson will probably have \u201cone of the cleaner [financial] disclosures because his whole life and his whole net worth\u2019s been in one company.\u201d Some Democrats on the judiciary panel say they have no plans to give Sessions an easy pass despite his status as a well-liked senator and a former U.S. attorney. Several have vowed to rehash his staunch opposition to immigration reform, his recent support for Trump\u2019s call to require \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and his civil rights record. Sessions was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 over charges of racial insensitivity and prejudice. [ Jeff Sessions should have been a tough sell in the U.S. Senate. But he\u2019s too nice. ] \u201cA person\u2019s whole lifetime career should be considered in such an important position,\u201d Blumenthal said in an interview last week. \u201cThis position is not just a government lawyer or another Cabinet position. It is the nation\u2019s chief enforcer of the rule of law, which is the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d Schumer said last week that Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and oversee changes to Obamacare, will endure heavy scrutiny once his hearing is scheduled. Price is bound to face attacks for his support for privatizing Medicare and over stock he\u2019s owned in health insurance, pharmaceutical and biotech companies despite serving on a health-care subcommittee. [ Here are the eight Trump Cabinet picks Democrats plan to target ] Schumer and others have called on the House Ethics Committee to begin investigating Price\u2019s stock holdings before his confirmation hearing. Republicans noted that several senators on the health panel have similar stock holdings. Democrats are also targeting Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a fiscal conservative tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget; Andrew Puzder, a restaurant executive set to serve as labor secretary who opposes raising the minimum wage and has made controversial comments about women; Steven Mnuchin, a billionaire former Goldman Sachs partner set to serve as treasury secretary; and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who was picked by Trump to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, which he has sued in the past. Anticipating political combat, Trump\u2019s transition office has tapped incoming White House Communications Director Sean Spicer and Bryan Lanza, a veteran of the Trump campaign, to oversee hearing preparations. They are offering strategic advice and sitting in on practice sessions for nominees, according to R.C. Hammond, a transition spokesman. Party luminaries, including former Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and former Arizona senator Jon Kyl, are also on board to vouch for the nominees, transition officials confirmed. Kyl was spotted shadowing Sessions at the Capitol last week. Ron Bonjean, a longtime Republican operative who has worked for the Senate and House leadership, also joined the transition team last week as an adviser focused on the most politically sensitive nominees. Tillerson and Mnuchin, who some Republicans privately worry could face difficult exchanges with senators from both parties, are being assisted by several former officials from George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Mnuchin\u2019s team includes Tara Bradshaw, a Bush-era spokeswoman at the Treasury Department, and Mary Waters, an official in the Agriculture Department under Bush. Tillerson\u2019s team includes Christian Whiton, who worked at the State Department during the Bush presidency; and Margaret Peterlin, a former Commerce Department official and senior House Republican aide. Collectively, these former senators and administration officials, who come armed with deep familiarity with the arcane nature of the Senate and the complex policies a nominee will tackle, are known as \u201csherpas.\u201d But as one transition official quipped: \u201cThere\u2019s no climbing equipment or walking toward mountains involved.\u201d Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "DEC. 30, 2016 By The New York Times Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said. He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue. Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own. Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a b\u00eate noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm\u2019s president, Gary D. Cohn , as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company co-founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother. Photo A Bank Hapoalim branch in Tel Aviv. The bank has given multiple loans to Kushner Companies. Credit Nir Elias/Reuters Mr. Trump has said that his son-in-law, an Orthodox Jew, will play a central role in dealings with Israel , describing him as so talented that he could help \u201cdo peace in the Middle East.\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s company has received multiple loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement. So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China\u2019s \u201cdeep displeasure\u201d at Mr. Trump\u2019s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan , the White House did not call the president-elect\u2019s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors. Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions. Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201d Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201d Photo From left, Josh, Charles and Jared Kushner, in 2014. The family has extensive holdings in real estate and private equity firms. Credit Patrick McMullan The Family Business Like the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father. In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New Jersey-based construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading Democratic donor , contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and winning appointment to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business\u2019s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister.

He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate. It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before. Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier. Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. \u201cJ-Vanka,\u201d the headlines blared , as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven. Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men. In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit. In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle. Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia. Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.

Credit Jean Catuffe/GC Images Investors and Creditors As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently reached a $7.2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore. Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces. He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm valued at about $1.5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is Oscar , a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar\u2019s investors have included Li Ka-shing, who is one of Hong Kong\u2019s richest men, and China\u2019s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times The Kushner brothers have counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, as investors in another endeavor \u2014 Cadre , a tech-savvy real estate investment company they started with a friend. Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures. But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies. One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified. The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants two-year visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500,000. The program, known as EB-5, has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing; in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9,764 of the visas \u2014 overwhelmingly to applicants from China . Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the program, which must be renewed periodically by Congress, has lately come under fire . The Government Accountability Office has issued several reports raising concerns about what it termed the program\u2019s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels . Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China. Photo Kushner Companies\u2019 real estate holdings include, clockwise from top left, 666 Fifth Avenue; the former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses headquarters in Brooklyn; the old New York Times building; and Trump Bay Street in Jersey City.

The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet. But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant. Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington. The Times reported last year that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People\u2019s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board. Photo Wu Xiaohui, the chairman and chief executive of Anbang Insurance, a Chinese financial behemoth which owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and controls as much as $285 billion in assets. Credit Ben Asen/International Insurance Society Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines. Anbang\u2019s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he decided to seek other accommodations . American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time; a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns. Advertisement Continue reading the main story National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States. One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection. Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain, outbidding Marriott with a $14 billion offer . It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately Anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail. And while Anbang\u2019s planned $1.57 billion purchase of Des Moines-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it stalled after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang\u2019s shareholding structure. Photo Mr. Kushner, left, met with President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, at the White House on Nov. 10. Credit Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment. Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment. It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while. By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments. Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria. Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that benefited donors to her family\u2019s charitable foundation while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium-extraction capacity. On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated. \u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present. ",
