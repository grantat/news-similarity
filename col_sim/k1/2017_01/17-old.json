The attacker has been apprehended and taken to Haseki hospital in Istanbul, a police source told NBC News. Related: Istanbul Nightclub Attack Involved Intelligence Organization: Turkey The suspect was arrested during a police operation, security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on talking to the media told Anadolu news agency. The private Dogan news agency and other media said the suspect was caught in Istanbul's district of Esenyurt in a police operation late on Monday, according to the Associated Press. A video capture shows the gunman entering the Reina nightclub in Istanbul early on Jan. 1, 2017. DHA via DEPO PHOTOS/EPA The suspect had escaped following the deadly shooting at Reina nightclub , one of the city's most exclusive, after opening fire in a crowd gathered to celebrate the new year. The man allegedly killed a police officer and civilian outside the club before firing on revelers around 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Eve (5:30 p.m. ET Saturday). Twenty-eight of the victims were foreigners, Turkish Health Ministry officials said after the attack. Canadian, Iraqi, Saudi, Indian, Lebanese, Tunisian, Kuwaiti and Syrian citizens were among the dead. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the shooting, identifying the attacker as \"a heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The terrorist group said the attack was carried out in response to a call from ISIS' leader, but it did not say whether it had directed or simply inspired the assailant. Earlier this month, Turkish authorities said they had identified the main suspect in the shooting, but were not revealing his identity as he remained at large. \"The identity of the person carrying out the attack in Ortakoy has been determined,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview with the state-run Anadolu news agency on Jan. 4. Turkish authorities did not make the suspect's identity public. Daniella Silva ",

Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune After being honored at the White House on Monday afternoon, the Cubs revealed the real reason why they desperately wanted to make the trip before President Barack Obama left office. Touring the White House and being celebrated for their first championship since 1908 was certainly fun for the team, but it wasn't nearly as important as converting the die-hard White Sox fan into a Cubs fan, a task more difficult than turning Hillary Clinton supporters into Donald Trump backers. Cubs President Theo Epstein said they offered Obama a \"midnight pardon\" to switch to the Cubs. When Obama stopped laughing, Epstein turned up the heat. The Cubs presented Obama with several gifts that Epstein said would \"recognize this terrific conversion on this great day,\" including a No. 44 panel from Wrigley Field 's manual center-field scoreboard, recognizing his status as the 44th president, a lifetime pass to Wrigley, a No. 44 jersey, and a \"W\" flag signed by Cubs players that Epstein said should be flown at his presidential library in Chicago. Sitting alongside Billy Williams , Ryne Sandberg and Jose Cardenal, Cubs great Fergie Jenkins shouted out to Obama to put the jersey on. The president politely declined. \"It'd be hard for me, Fergie, to wear the jersey,\" he said. \"I do know that among Sox fans, I am the Cubs' No. 1 fan.\" Full video: President Obama welcomes the 2016 World Series champion Cubs to White House President Obama welcomes the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to the White House. (White House/YouTube) President Obama welcomes the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to the White House. (White House/YouTube) See more videos Obama said the gifts were the \"best swag I've got since I've been president.\" The ceremony began with Obama poking fun at the Cubs' storied drought, saying, \"They said this day would never come,\" and pointing out none of his predecessors \"ever got a chance to say welcome to the White House, the World Series champion Cubs. \u2026 I will say to the Cubs, it took you long enough. I've only got four days left.\" Obama then took a page out of his 2008 playbook, comparing the Cubs' journey to his own unlikely rise to president of the United States. \"I made a lot of promises in 2008,\" he said. \"But even I was not crazy enough to suggest that during these eight years we would see the Cubs win the World Series. But I did say that there's never been anything false about hope. The audacity of hope. Yes, we can.\" After Obama's remarks, Epstein then took over and began reminiscing about their World Series title, which he said \"even saw some White Sox fans smiling.\" Finally, Epstein got to the plan.

(Paul Sullivan/Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"Which, Mr. President, brings us to you,\" he said. \"We know may have some allegiances to another team on another side of town, but we know you're a very proud Chicagoan, and we know your better half, the first lady, has been a lifetime and very loyal Cubs fan, which we appreciate very much. \"And of course we have great faith in your intelligence, your common sense, your pragmatism and your ability to recognize a good thing when you see one. So, Mr. President, with only a few days remaining in your tremendous presidency, we've taken the liberty here today of offering you a midnight pardon. And so we welcome you with open arms today.\" Epstein later said he found out on the plane ride to Washington that he was supposed to make a speech. \"Obviously we had to address the fact he's a White Sox fan, give him all the respect he's due,\" he said. \"We figured we could pardon him since he's going to pardon so many in his final days.\" The Cubs-Sox byplay was one of manager Joe Maddon 's favorite parts of the afternoon. \"The slings and arrows at the White Sox are always entertaining,\" Maddon said. It capped a memorable day for the Cubs players, staff and their wives, who met with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama beforehand and toured the White House. Obama said Michelle had never attended any of the championship celebrations before but decided to attend this one to tell the team about her family's love for the Cubs \"and why it meant so much to her.\" \"I almost choked up listening to it,\" Obama said. \"And it spoke to how people feel about this organization, and it's been passed on from generation to generation. And it's more than just sports.\" Anthony Rizzo on Cubs' visit to the White House: 'Just icing on the cake' Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo reacts to the team's visit to the White House and meeting President Barack Obama on Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. (Paul Sullivan/Chicago Tribune) Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo reacts to the team's visit to the White House and meeting President Barack Obama on Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. (Paul Sullivan/Chicago Tribune) See more videos Obama mentioned several of the Cubs players' accomplishments, including David Ross, Kris Bryant , Anthony Rizzo and Addison Russell. He even referred to Maddon's \"shaggin' wagon,\" the old Dodge van he drove onto the field in spring training . Obama said not many managers are \"as cool as this guy,\" pointing to Maddon's casual attire, which included no tie. \"That's pretty cool that the president calls you cool,\" Maddon said. \"I knew that I had a pretty good chance, being the only one that didn't wear a tie today. ... It's a humbling experience to be here in the first place, and under the set of circumstances we're here, to be able to have the president recognize you like that is pretty awesome.\" Obama also poked fun at his own party, pointing to Epstein's success with two drought-stricken organizations, the Red Sox and Cubs. He said the teams were \"wandering in the wilderness\" before Epstein took them to \"the promised land,\" making him a perfect candidate for chairman of the DNC. Epstein politely declined Obama's offer. \"Good thing I signed a contract with (Chairman) Tom Ricketts, who was kicking me, saying I can't leave,\" Epstein said. \"It was a kind offer, though.\" Several Cubs players who've left the team this winter flew in, including Dexter Fowler, Aroldis Chapman, Trevor Cahill and Chris Coghlan , while some of the current Cubs missed the trip, including Jon Lester, John Lackey and Jake Arrieta, who had family issues. The Cubs celebration was the last public White House event of Obama's presidency. The audience in the East Room was filled with politicians like Sen. Dick Durbin, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Attorney General Lisa Madigan, along with former Obama adviser David Axelrod and singer Jimmy Buffett, a longtime Cubs fan. All in all, it was a fitting final chapter for the Cubs, and a nice last hurrah for Obama as well. \"What an amazing experience, to get to enjoy today with the guys on this team,\" Rizzo said. \"It's something we'll never forget. It's something you never take for granted. This is one of the best days I've ever had.\" Twitter @PWSullivan Joe Maddon on Cubs' visit to the White House Cubs manager Joe Maddon reacts to the team's visit to the White House on Monday, Jan. 16, 2017.

He missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow,\" Obama said in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus in September after Trump's comment. Trump also triggered controversy when he mentioned black youth unemployment in his stump speeches, claiming multiple times that 58 percent are out of work. His campaign has told ABC News that he based the number on 2015 Bureau of Labor Statistics data and included not only 16- to 24-year-old black Americans who were unemployed, but also those whom the federal government didn\u2019t count in the labor force, which likely included a number of full-time students not seeking work. Public Outreach During the Campaign Trump made a handful of campaign stops directly aimed at African-American voters , including his first visit to a black church in Detroit in September alongside Carson where he delivered a message of unity that included a call to address economic challenges in the black community. He then later visited another black church in Flint, Michigan, but was scolded by the pastor when he started to condemn Hillary Clinton. Trump later called the female pastor \"a nervous mess.\" Carlo Allegri/Reuters Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Omarosa Manigault attend a church service, in Detroit, Michigan, Sept. 3, 2016. He declined several invitations to speak to groups such as the NAACP, the Urban League and a joint conference of the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists. When asked in August about Trump\u2019s decisions to skip those events, Manigault pointed out that the NAACP event was scheduled for the same day as the start of the RNC, so Trump \u201cmade the difficult decision\u201d to skip the conference in favor of being in Cleveland to hear his wife, Melania Trump, address the crowd. \u201cCertainly he should have an opportunity to address the bodies of those organizations, but it\u2019s not the only opportunity,\u201d Manigault said of the declined invitations.\u201d Trump also held meetings with groups of African-American pastors, most of whom became part of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. In the end, he did get 8 percent of the African-American vote in the presidential election. Pre-Campaign Clashes Even before entering the political fray, Trump had public run-ins with the African-American community. The first came in 1973, five years after he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. Trump was deeply involved in the family\u2019s New York City real estate business when the Justice Department filed a housing discrimination suit against Donald Trump, father Fred and their real estate management corporation. The civil suit claimed the Trump management corporation \u2013 of which Donald Trump was president \u2013 had been \u201cdiscriminating against black persons in the operation of their buildings,\u201d according to the DOJ's news release on the date of the filing, Oct. 15, 1973. The Trumps \u201cvigorously deny said allegations,\u201d the court document states. The agreement, which laid out the specific terms that the Trumps would have to abide by moving forward, noted that it was \u201cin no way an admission by it of a violation of the prohibition against discrimination.\u201d The complaint against Fred Trump and Donald Trump was \u201cdismissed against them in their personal capacity, with prejudice.\u201d Later, in 1989, Trump inserted himself in the controversial Central Park Five case , in which five minority teens were accused of brutally attacking a white woman. Trump paid for open letters to be published in four major New York-area papers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in connection to the case and painting a stark picture of life in the city amid a diminished police force. All five of the accused -- four of whom are African American and one is Hispanic -- made various confessions, which later came under review, and were convicted on differing combinations of charges \u2014 including rape, robbery, attempted murder, assault and riot \u2014 and served time. In 2002, the five were exonerated after an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Another man confessed to the crime. The Central Park Five case came up during last year\u2019s campaign, when in October Trump reiterated his suggestion that he still believed the five were guilty . 0 Shares ",

NASA hide caption toggle caption NASA Gene Cernan prepares for his 1969 Apollo 10 flight, adjusting his headset outside a lunar module simulator. NASA The last person to leave footprints on the moon has died. NASA reported that Gene Cernan died Monday at the age of 82, surrounded by his family. Gene Cernan flew in space three times, including twice to the moon. Cernan was big, brash and gregarious. And if he hadn't been lucky, he could have missed his chance to walk on the moon. Cernan challenged himself his whole life. When he entered the military, he chose to be a naval aviator. Landing on an aircraft carrier is perhaps the hardest thing to do in aviation. Cernan did it because it wasn't easy. He said he was constantly pushing himself to do better and be better. Astronaut Gene Cernan salutes the U.S. flag during his moonwalk in 1972. No one else has been there since Apollo 17 left. NASA hide caption toggle caption NASA Astronaut Gene Cernan salutes the U.S. flag during his moonwalk in 1972. No one else has been there since Apollo 17 left. NASA \"My dad always used to say, 'Just go out and do your best. You're not going to be better than everyone at everything.' And he was right,\" Cernan said, \"I wasn't. But he was also right one other time when he said, 'Someday you're going to surprise yourself. Just do your best and someday you're going to surprise yourself.' \" Article continues after sponsorship Cernan's final trip in space was also the final time NASA sent people to the moon, the Apollo 17 mission , which took off on Dec. 7, 1972. 'Hidden Figures' No More: Meet The Black Women Who Helped Send America To Space Four days later, Cernan landed the lunar module on the moon with astronaut Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt. Cernan couldn't hide his enthusiasm as he exited the spacecraft, saying, \"We'd like to dedicate the first steps of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible. Oh my golly! Unbelievable!\" Decades later, Cernan reflected on that moment in a 2015 NPR interview, no less thrilled to be the last, rather than the first, to go there. \"The first steps had been made by others long before I got there. But those were my first steps.\" Gene Cernan in the Apollo 17 lunar module after one of three moonwalks. NASA hide caption toggle caption Gene Cernan in the Apollo 17 lunar module after one of three moonwalks. NASA Cernan is one of only three people to travel to the moon twice (Jim Lovell and John Young were the others). Before Apollo 17, he flew on Apollo 10, which was the mission just before the first lunar landing. On Gemini 9 in 1966, he conducted the second American spacewalk (which almost ended in disaster). Cernan had trouble controlling his body in the weightlessness of space. He became exhausted. His visor fogged up and he barely had the strength to get back into the capsule and close the hatch. \"Fate played another trick because I might not have come home from that flight. We didn't know much about what we're doing [yet].\" Dreaming big and working hard were two things Cernan always did. He grew up in Chicago. Neither of his parents went to college, but he earned several degrees in engineering.

Matt Sayles/Invision/AP Despite Cernan's technical background, his time on the moon and in space forever altered his life. Cernan said he gained a new perspective, because \"when you leave the Earth, it's not only technologically different \u2014 it's philosophically different and it's spiritually different.\" Many astronauts had difficulty describing what it was actually like to be in space \u2014 not in the technical sense, but in finding the words to share that remarkable experience. He chronicled some of them in his 2016 documentary , Last Man on the Moon. \"Many of the astronauts didn't really know how to describe that because that's not what they were going there for,\" said Francis French of the San Diego Air and Space Museum, who has written many books on the space program. \"Gene Cernan in the decades after his mission really reflected on that and he [very well described] what that's like.\" There's something else about Cernan: He had the opportunity to land on the moon during an earlier mission, Apollo 16, as the pilot. But he turned it down, because he wanted to be commander, in charge of the mission. \"I sort of felt like I'd been an underdog most of my life,\" he recalled. \"[Achieving the command of Apollo 17], I proved to myself that I was good enough. That I could get the job done. That was a big point in my life.\" Cernan spent his post-NASA life trying to inspire young people. He once said, \"Dream the impossible \u2014 and go out and make it happen. I walked on the moon. What can't you do?\" ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 BROWNSVILLE, Texas \u2013 \u00a0Pamela Taylor thought she was living the American dream when she and her husband bought a two-acre plot of land near the Texas border in Brownsville seven decades ago. She would never have predicted her one-story brick home, surrounded by bright pink bougainvillea bushes and mesquite trees, would become a makeshift crash pad and hideout for border crossers, drug smugglers and human traffickers. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life now,\u201d Taylor told FoxNews.com. \u201cThey come every day.\u201d Taylor, whose property is on the front line of the border battle, says illegal immigrants have been using her land to sneak into the U.S. for years. One day, the 90-year-old grandmother recalled, she even walked into her living room to find a border crosser trying to evade capture. \u201cHe had come into my house and was just sitting in my rocking chair watching Border Patrol go by,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d Pamela Taylor's house in Brownsville, Texas. Another time, drug dealers stashed 30 pounds of marijuana under her bougainvillea bush. Taylor is not alone. On a recent tour of border towns in south Texas, FoxNews.com spoke with residents like Taylor as well as business owners and local law enforcement about the daily fears people face as they live and work in what amounts to disputed territory.\u00a0 Many describe a deteriorating situation where illegal immigration is on the rise but few can do anything about it for fear of retaliation by cartels, human traffickers and even some authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who to trust,\u201d Taylor said. She added that while she has a \u201cgood rapport\u201d with local law enforcement on the ground, \u201cIt\u2019s the ones who sit in the office \u2026 they don\u2019t care about us.\u201d Several residents FoxNews.com spoke to near the border say they feel forgotten. \u201cWe live here, we work here and raise our children here but every day we see [border crossers, drug smugglers] and nothing changes,\u201d said McAllen resident Milo, who asked FoxNews.com not to use his last name out of safety concerns. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [drug and human trafficking] scouts on our street with Border Patrol parked down the road. They don\u2019t do anything.\u201d He also said he's seen \"SUVs sitting in front of the house\" after reporting suspicious activity.\u00a0 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, vowing a ramp-up in border and immigration enforcement -- and the construction of a controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall -- the outgoing Obama administration has taken some steps to boost enforcement.\u00a0 U.S. Customs and Border Protection last year dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. But Taylor said her area still is used as a \"funnel\" for people illegally crossing the border.\u00a0 Some paddle across the river while others hide in the field waiting for their \u201ccoyote\u201d or smuggler to pick them up. Some stroll in through a gigantic gap in the border barrier near her house.\u00a0 Taylor says she always calls the authorities to report criminal activity on her property, including when she found the marijuana stash. But she also said she worries she could be putting herself and her family in danger.\u00a0 In south Texas, Mexican and South American cartels have been able to infiltrate law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Several former law enforcement officials from an anti-narcotics force in the Rio Grande Valley are currently serving lengthy prison sentences for drug crimes and corruption. \u00a0 In 2016, Border Patrol agent Joel Luna was charged with capital murder for the March 2015 beheading of an undocumented Honduran immigrant. Luna, a south Texas native and Army combat veteran, allegedly decapitated Palacio Paz and left his headless body floating in the bay. Prosecutors claim Luna was part of a cartel drug trafficking conspiracy with his brothers. Luna has pleaded not guilty. In November, Border Patrol agent Eduardo Bazen Jr., also was arrested after being accused of working with a drug trafficking organization. According to the criminal complaint, Bazen said he was paid $8,000 for falsifying a 2007 drug bust and admitted to lying about suspects being present at the scene. The drug trade \u2013 even more so than human trafficking \u2013 has skyrocketed in recent years along the border. In fiscal 2016, nearly 1.3 million pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines were seized along the southwest border, according to U.S. Border Patrol . Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office Lt. Robert Rodriguez told FoxNews.com the cartels are constantly reinventing ways to smuggle drugs into the U.S. \u201cThey change tactics all the time,\u201d he said, adding that drug runners are now using large makeshift rafts to float trucks, fully loaded with drugs, across the Rio Grande. \u201cThey always seem to be one step ahead.\u201d As for residents living along the border, some have sold their property and moved. For Taylor, that\u2019s not an option. Water coolers outside Pamela Taylor's house. (FoxNews.com/Barnini Chakraborty) \u201cWhy should I move? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\" she said.\u00a0 Instead, she locks her doors but leaves food and water out \u201cfor anyone who needs it.\u201d \u201cI always ask \u2018Are you hungry?\u201d she said. \u201cI will feed them but they know I will also be calling Border Patrol.\u201d Advertisement ",

USA TODAY NETWORK A photo on Jan. 1, 2017 shows a video capture of the gunman entering the Reina nightclub, a popular night club in Istanbul near by the Bosphorus, in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo: EPA) A suspect has been caught in the New Year's Eve nightclub attack in Istanbul, Turkey, that left 39 people dead, the AA.com news website, al Jazeera and CNN Turkey reported. The attack on the club jammed with holiday revelers\u00a0also left 69 people with injuries. The suspect was identified as Abdulkadir Masharipov, an Uzbek national, Hurryiet newspaper, the BBC and other news media reported. Masharipov was captured during a police operation on a terrorist cell at an apartment in Istanbul's Esenyurt district, Anadolu Agency and other media reported. He'd been on the run for two weeks before his capture, according to the news.com.au website. Police were monitoring him for about five days before taking him in, the website reported. The operation was carried out jointly by Turkish police and the country's spy agency, news.com.au reported. Four others also were detained, the news agency reported. Operations against other cells were underway, Anadolu Agency reported. A police officer and\u00a0a number of foreign nationals were\u00a0among those killed in\u00a0the Reina nightclub attack. Earlier in January, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.The organization said in a statement sent to the Aamaq News Agency, with which it has ties, that it was exacting revenge for Turkish involvement in Syria. \"The apostate Turkish government should know that the blood of Muslims shed with airplanes and artillery fire will, with God's permission, ignite a fire in their own land,\" according to a statement translated by Reuters news service. The New Year's Eve melee was among 10 attacks that have taken place in Turkey in the last year. On Dec. 10, two bombs near Erciyes University killed 13 off-duty soldiers; on Dec. 19, a Turkish policeman fatally shot Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at a photo exhibit in Ankara; on June 28, a suicide bomber killed 44 people a Ataturk Airport in Istanbul and injuring about 200 more; on Aug. 20, a suicide bomber killed a least 51 people at a Kurdish wedding in Gaziantep.

American Apparel began laying off 2,400 Southern California workers on Monday. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Shan Li American Apparel began to lay off 2,400 workers in Southern California on Monday \u2014 kicking off its final chapter as the country\u2019s largest garment maker. Layoffs will continue through the rest of the week and affect workers on the manufacturing and production side, American Apparel said. The company has about 3,500 factory workers in the Southland. Canadian clothing maker Gildan Activewear won an auction in bankruptcy court last week to buy the American Apparel brand and some manufacturing equipment for $88 million. The company will not assume American Apparel\u2019s leases on its factories. Until the sale closes in February, some workers are being kept on to operate the factories in downtown Los Angeles and in Garden Grove, as well as the distribution center in La Mirada. Some will also continue working in human resources and other departments to keep the company running. American Apparel\u2019s 110 stores and its website will remain open, until at least April, under a 100-day license with Gildan. On Monday, workers at the company\u2019s headquarters in downtown Los Angeles said they were shocked even though they had been warned in\u00a0December there might be mass layoffs.\u00a0Many said they had hoped Gildan or another company would come in and save jobs. Francesca Cortes, a seamstress who works on the overnight shift, said she was told to come into work on Monday for a possible shift change. Instead of a new schedule, she got her final paycheck and a termination letter. \u201cEverything is over,\u201d said Cortes, 48, who has worked seven years at American Apparel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get severance, like the workers who were laid off before got.\u201d Everything is over. We didn\u2019t even get severance, like the workers who were laid off before got. \u2014 Francesca Cortes, seamstress Still, Cortes said she hopes she can land another job soon. Her husband, a seamster for another local garment maker, is still employed \u2014 so the family is alright financially for now, she said. Some workers, such as Amada Cervantes, are not so lucky. The 66-year-old, who has worked sewing in downtown L.A. for a decade, lives by herself and has no family to lean on. In the last few years, her pay has dropped to about $350 a week from $500 as workers\u2019\u00a0 hours have been cut. \u201cThis is big for me,\u201d Cervantes said. \u201cI\u2019m worried because I am on my own. I\u2019m hoping unemployment will help until I find another job.\u201d American Apparel did find a buyer for its Garden Grove knitting and dyeing facility. Broncs Inc., a Compton textile manufacturer, said it would take over the lease starting March for between $200,000 to $250,000. American Apparel said Monday that the sale could save more than 300 jobs. However, Broncs owner Joel Chun told The Times that he plans to hire about 200 employees. The earliest they could start work is in March, when new machines are delivered, he said. For its part, Gildan said it has yet to decide where to make American Apparel goods. The company makes the bulk of its products in manufacturing hubs in Central America and the Caribbean. Although it has some production sites in the U.S., the only finished goods made here are socks. Gildan spokesman Garry Bell said Monday that the layoffs are a result of the American Apparel bankruptcy. \u201cOur agreement with them was always for assets, including the brand and some manufacturing equipment,\u201d Bell wrote in an email. \u201cIt was never to purchase an ongoing concern.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

    "text": "By David Nakamura January 16 at 5:35 PM Follow @davidnakamura They are some of the biggest names in the Republican national security firmament, veterans of past GOP administrations who say, if called upon by President-elect Donald Trump, they stand ready to serve their country again. But their phones aren\u2019t ringing. Their entreaties to Trump Tower in New York have mostly gone unanswered. In Trump world, these establishment all-stars say they are \u201cPNG\u201d \u2014 personae non gratae. Their transgression was signing one or both of two public \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters during the campaign, declaring they would not vote for Trump and calling his candidacy a danger to the nation. One letter, with 122 names, was published by War on the Rocks , a website devoted to national security commentary, during the primary season in March. The other, with 50 names, including some repeat signatories, was published by the New York Times during the general-election campaign in August. Now, just days before Trump is sworn in as the nation\u2019s 45th president, the letter signers fear they have been added to another document, this one private \u2014 a purported blacklist compiled by Trump\u2019s political advisers. Former Pennsylvania Gov. and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. (Cheryl Senter/AP) \u201cBefore he won, the conversation was, \u2018We really would love for you to change your mind and join us,\u2019 \u201d Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser under President George W. Bush, said of informal talks with Trump aides. Feaver, who signed both letters, added that, \u201cSince he won . . . the conversation is, \u2018There likely will be a blacklist of people who signed the letters who won\u2019t themselves be eligible for a post.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Trump transition aides did not respond to a request for comment for this article. [ From March: Trump \u2018fundamentally dishonest,\u2019 say national security leaders ] The president-elect has virtually no experience in national security and foreign policy, and his transition team could presumably benefit from the broadest pool of applicants for the influential appointive positions in the State Department, Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. But the purportedly blacklisted figures report to their jobs at Washington law firms and think tanks in a state of indefinite limbo as their colleagues, some working in the same offices, are flirting with potential administration jobs. Last week, the Trump transition held a private briefing for secretary-of-state nominee Rex Tillerson to prepare him for his Senate confirmation hearing. One former Bush national security official who works at a Washington think tank said that some of his younger staff assistants were invited to participate but that he was not. He assumes it was because he signed the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s hostile,\u201d said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of further retribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we\u2019re frozen out. . . . I was told they said there was an enemies list.\u201d (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Among those who signed at least one of the letters are Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, the first two secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security; two former U.S. trade ambassadors, Carla Hills and Robert Zoellick; two former heads of U.S. intelligence agencies, John Negroponte and retired Air Force Gen. Michael V. Hayden; a former ambassador to NATO; and several former deputy secretaries of various U.S. government agencies. Not everyone who signed the letters wants a job, and some remain vocal critics of Trump. But many stand ready to serve or offer guidance if asked. The letters were explicit in their denunciations of Trump\u2019s professed support for torture of terrorism suspects, his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico, his anti-Muslim rhetoric and his admiration for Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. The letters also attacked Trump\u2019s character and temperament, asserting that he \u201clacks self-control and acts impetuously,\u201d has demonstrated \u201cerratic behavior\u201d and is \u201cfundamentally dishonest.\u201d Former Bush administration lawyer John Bellinger\u00a0III, who organized the letter published in the Times, said that many have not given up and are trying to help from the outside. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing how it goes and trying to provide advice, counsel, support to our friends who go into the administration,\u201d said Bellinger, who has served as legal counsel at the State Department and the National Security Council. The scenario was set up by Trump\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox candidacy and then his upset victory. The threat the New York business mogul\u2019s populist campaign posed to the establishment of his party caused some of the Republicans\u2019 leading lights to oppose him, even after he had clinched the nomination. The question after Election Day was how quickly Trump loyalists and the onetime GOP resistance would reconcile. In some cases, the process has gone fairly smoothly. Congressional leaders who had been lukewarm toward Trump\u2019s campaign have made nice with the president-elect, and they have vowed to work together on a conservative policy agenda. In other cases, it has been painfully awkward, as with Trump\u2019s flirtation with Mitt Romney for secretary of state. Romney had called Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d last March, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee called to congratulate Trump on his election victory. After a courtship that included a dinner of frog legs and lamb chops in New York, Romney was passed over for Tillerson, the head of ExxonMobil. During a national security forum last week at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, K.T. McFarland, who was named Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, opened her remarks by referring to the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d \u201cMost of the people in this room didn\u2019t support Donald Trump \u2014 maybe not at first or maybe ever,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I suspect most of the people in this room didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win. But he has.\u201d Some of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters signers fear they are at the bottom of the pecking order, below those who expressed verbal opposition to Trump\u2019s campaign but did not sign either of the letters. The conflict was exacerbated shortly after the election when Eliot Cohen, a State Department counselor during the Bush administration who had helped organize the War on the Rocks letter, aired new criticism of the Trump transition. In an opinion column for The Washington Post in November, Cohen said that a friend on the transition team had asked him to provide names of potential job candidates \u2014 with the stipulation that he include no one who signed either of the letters. Cohen wrote that he became convinced there were \u201cpent-up resentments\u201d among members of the Trump team, and he warned young policy experts against working for the administration. Cohen has had no further communications with the transition team. \u201cBelieve me \u2014 my phone is not ringing,\u201d he said in a recent interview. Other letter signers said Cohen had misinterpreted emails from the transition official and overreacted, and some of them expressed a sense of regret. Mary Beth Long, who served as assistant secretary of defense in the Bush administration, signed the War on the Rocks letter. But, she said, her opinion of Trump improved as he began to moderate his rhetoric and selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Long attended a Pence rally in Charlotte in October, during which, she said, a local GOP official announced that a \u201cNever Trump\u201d letter signer in the audience had changed her mind and was now supporting Trump. The crowd cheered. But her about-face hasn\u2019t thawed the ice. Long said her inquiries to the Trump transition team to get clarity on some of his foreign policy positions have gone unanswered. She said that she has spoken with retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s designee for national security adviser, whom she knows from the Pentagon, but that she isn\u2019t expecting a job. \u201cIf I were asked to sign a letter like that again, I would be much more careful about the verbiage that related to the candidate himself,\u201d she said. Some letter signers said the Trump transition might be overwhelmed and could reach out more broadly in the coming weeks. Some hoped that Cabinet nominees, such as retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Pentagon, could potentially have the freedom to hire them. Many jobs below the Cabinet level remain unfilled. But others are resigned to waiting until some of Trump\u2019s initial appointees begin leaving his administration. Frances Townsend, a former Bush homeland security adviser who signed the War on the Rocks letter, is friendly with Flynn. A few weeks after the election, she received an email from the transition team inviting her to meet with the president-elect. Ahead of the meeting, she thought over how to explain her past actions if Trump raised the letter \u2014 but he did not, she said. \u201cI took that as a sign of maturity and graciousness,\u201d said Townsend, who has not taken a job with the administration and declined to say whether she was offered one. \u201cAs I was leaving, I said I was privileged and humbled to come in and speak to him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a veiled reference [to the letter]. Given the circumstances, I didn\u2019t expect to be there.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "[ Read a transcript of the interview with Barack Obama ] The writings of Lincoln, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, Mr. Obama found, were \u201cparticularly helpful\u201d when \u201cwhat you wanted was a sense of solidarity,\u201d adding \u201cduring very difficult moments, this job can be very isolating.\u201d \u201cSo sometimes you have to sort of hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated, and that\u2019s been useful.\u201d There is a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address in the Lincoln Bedroom, and sometimes, in the evening, Mr. Obama says, he would wander over from his home office to read it. Photo President Obama in the Oval Office in 2012. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Like Lincoln, Mr. Obama taught himself how to write, and for him, too, words became a way to define himself, and to communicate his ideas and ideals to the world. In fact, there is a clear, shining line connecting Lincoln and King, and President Obama. In speeches like the ones delivered in Charleston and Selma , he has followed in their footsteps, putting his mastery of language in the service of a sweeping historical vision, which, like theirs, situates our current struggles with race and injustice in a historical continuum that traces how far we\u2019ve come and how far we have yet to go. It\u2019s a vision of America as an unfinished project \u2014 a continuing, more-than-two-century journey to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence real for everyone \u2014 rooted both in Scripture and the possibility of redemption, and a more existential belief that we can continually remake ourselves. And it\u2019s a vision shared by the civil rights movement, which overcame obstacle after obstacle, and persevered in the face of daunting odds. Mr. Obama\u2019s long view of history and the optimism (combined with a stirring reminder of the hard work required by democracy) that he articulated in his farewell speech last week are part of a hard-won faith, grounded in his reading, in his knowledge of history (and its unexpected zigs and zags), and his embrace of artists like Shakespeare who saw the human situation entire: its follies, cruelties and mad blunders, but also its resilience, decencies and acts of grace. The playwright\u2019s tragedies, he says, have been \u201cfoundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Context in Presidential Biographies Presidential biographies also provided context, countering the tendency to think \u201cthat whatever\u2019s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate through World War II.\u201d Even books initially picked up as escape reading like the Hugo Award-winning apocalyptic sci-fi epic \u201c The Three-Body Problem \u201d by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin, he said, could unexpectedly put things in perspective: \u201cThe scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty \u2014 not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade!\u201d In his searching 1995 book \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d Mr. Obama recalls how reading was a crucial tool in sorting out what he believed, dating back to his teenage years, when he immersed himself in works by Baldwin, Ellison, Hughes, Wright, DuBois and Malcolm X in an effort \u201cto raise myself to be a black man in America.\u201d Later, during his last two years in college, he spent a focused period of deep self-reflection and study, methodically reading philosophers from St. Augustine to Nietzsche, Emerson to Sartre to Niebuhr, to strip down and test his own beliefs. To this day, reading has remained an essential part of his daily life. He recently gave his daughter Malia a Kindle filled with books he wanted to share with her (including \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d \u201cThe Golden Notebook\u201d and \u201cThe Woman Warrior\u201d). And most every night in the White House, he would read for an hour or so late at night \u2014 reading that was deep and ecumenical, ranging from contemporary literary fiction (the last novel he read was Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201c The Underground Railroad \u201d) to classic novels to groundbreaking works of nonfiction like Daniel Kahneman\u2019s \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d and Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s \u201c The Sixth Extinction .\u201d Photo \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d by Colson Whitehead. Credit Patricia Wall/The New York Times Such books were a way for the president to shift mental gears from the briefs and policy papers he studied during the day, a way \u201cto get out of my own head,\u201d a way to escape the White House bubble. Some novels helped him to better \u201cimagine what\u2019s going on in the lives of people\u201d across the country \u2014 for instance, he found that Marilynne Robinson\u2019s novels connected him emotionally to the people he was meeting in Iowa during the 2008 campaign, and to his own grandparents, who were from the Midwest, and the small town values of hard work and honesty and humility. Other novels served as a kind of foil \u2014 something to argue with. V. S. Naipaul\u2019s novel \u201cA Bend in the River,\u201d Mr. Obama recalls, \u201cstarts with the line \u2018The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.\u2019 And I always think about that line and I think about his novels when I\u2019m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true.\u201d Writing was key to his thinking process, too: a tool for sorting through \u201ca lot of crosscurrents in my own life \u2014 race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole.\u201d A Writer of Short Stories Mr. Obama taught himself to write as a young man by keeping a journal and writing short stories when he was a community organizer in Chicago \u2014 working on them after he came home from work and drawing upon the stories of the people he met. Many of the tales were about older people, and were informed by a sense of disappointment and loss: \u201cThere is not a lot of Jack Kerouac open-road, young kid on the make discovering stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more melancholy and reflective.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story That experience underscored the power of empathy. An outsider himself \u2014 with a father from Kenya, who left when he was 2, and a mother from Kansas, who took him to live for a time in Indonesia \u2014 he could relate to many of the people he met in the churches and streets of Chicago, who felt dislocated by change and isolation, and he took to heart his boss\u2019s observation that \u201cthe thing that brings people together to share the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issues, it\u2019s that they have shared stories.\u201d This lesson would become a cornerstone of the president\u2019s vision of an America where shared concerns \u2014 simple dreams of a decent job, a secure future for one\u2019s children \u2014 might bridge differences and divisions. After all, many people saw their own stories in his \u2014 an American story, as he said in his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention possible \u201cin no other country on Earth.\u201d Photo President Obama reading \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d to children at the White House in 2014. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times In today\u2019s polarized environment, where the internet has let people increasingly retreat to their own silos (talking only to like-minded folks, who amplify their certainties and biases), the president sees novels and other art (like the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d) as providing a kind of bridge that might span usual divides and \u201ca reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day.\u201d He points out, for instance, that the fiction of Junot D\u00edaz and Jhumpa Lahiri speaks \u201cto a very particular contemporary immigration experience,\u201d but at the same time tell stories about \u201clonging for this better place but also feeling displaced\u201d \u2014 a theme central to much of American literature, and not unlike books by Philip Roth and Saul Bellow that are \u201csteeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what you\u2019re giving up.\u201d Mr. Obama entered office as a writer, and he will soon return to a private life as a writer, planning to work on his memoirs, which will draw on journals he\u2019s kept in the White House (\u201cbut not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for\u201d). He has a writer\u2019s sensibility \u2014 an ability to be in the moment while standing apart as an observer, a novelist\u2019s eye and ear for detail, and a precise but elastic voice capable of moving easily between the lyrical and the vernacular and the profound. He had lunch last week with five novelists he admires \u2014 Dave Eggers, Mr. Whitehead, Zadie Smith, Mr. D\u00edaz and Barbara Kingsolver. He not only talked with them about the political and media landscape, but also talked shop, asking how their book tours were going and remarking that he likes to write first drafts, long hand, on yellow legal pads. Mr. Obama says he is hoping to eventually use his presidential center website \u201cto widen the audience for good books\u201d \u2014 something he\u2019s already done with regular lists of book recommendations \u2014 and then encourage a public \u201cconversation about books.\u201d \u201cAt a time,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration, the role of stories to unify \u2014 as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize \u2014 is more important than ever.\u201d Correction: January 16, 2017 An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated when a photo of President Obama in the Oval Office was taken.
