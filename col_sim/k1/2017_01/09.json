Because of course it does -- and because those last-minute arrivals from the red carpet managed to miss the sit-down dinner. But Sly Stallone was all about the pralines. And the truffle pops? They\u00a0are so people don't get their fancy clothes dirty. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times) Jan. 8, 2017, 5:07 p.m. Big fashion takeaways: Liquid metal, 3-D applique, A-line skirts rule the red carpet at the Golden Globes Marques Harper Regina King, left, Ruth Negga and Priyanka Chopra. (Jordan Strauss / Invision / Associated Presss) While women's suiting was expected to play a major role at the Golden Globes this year -- and there were a few suits spotted on the red carpet (Olivia Spencer, Evan Rachel Wood and Kathryn Hahn , to name a few), the major fashion trends of this awards show were captured through feminine styles and forms including liquid metal, 3-D appliqu\u00e9 and A-line skirts. Stay tuned for our best and worst dressed photo gallery and Times Deputy Fashion Editor Adam Tschorn's recap of the big styles on red carpet at the Golden Globes. Jessica Biel , left, Carrie Underwood and Olivia Culpo. (Getty Images; Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Film TV Jan. 8, 2017, 5:07 p.m. 'This Is Us' Mandy Moore didn't choreograph 'La La Land'; that's a different Mandy Moore Libby Hill Mandy Moore is nominated for her work on NBC's \"This Is Us.\" She is not the other Mandy Moore. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Thanks to the elaborate dance number opening\u00a0tonight's Golden Globes, the ceremony will feature the work of more Mandy Moores than you can shake a stick at. Which is to say, two. Jimmy Fallon's elaborate song and dance number was choreographed by one Moore, while another Moore is waiting in the wings to present. You may remember the Mandy Moore pictured above from her first career as a pop music star in the late '90s/early aughts. Her first album, \"So Real,\" went platinum, and she's sold over 10 million albums worldwide. Since first breaking onto the scene, Moore has transitioned from singing to acting, voicing the lead character in Disney's \"Tangled\" and appearing opposite Anne Hathaway in \"The Princess Diaries.\" In 2016, Moore returned to prominence with her emotional role on NBC's time-jumping family drama \"This Is Us.\" She's nominated tonight for supporting actress in a series, miniseries, or motion picture for TV. Mandy Moore choreographed \"La La Land.\" She is not the other Mandy Moore. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) This Mandy Moore played an integral role in the creation of awards season favorite \"La La Land,\" choreographing the film, including its show-stopping opening number. Choreographer Moore is Emmy-nominated for her work on Fox's \"So You Think You Can Dance\" and is helping to choreograph this evening's ceremony. There is, however, only one Tom Ford. Jan. 8, 2017, 5:10 p.m. 'This Is Us' could be the first network TV show to win the drama series Golden Globe in over 10 years Tracy Brown Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, second from left, and Mandy Moore as Rebecca in \"This Is Us.\" (Ron Batzdorff / NBC) NBC\u2019s freshman hit \"This Is Us\" notched three Golden Globe nominations going into tonight\u2019s awards, including in the coveted drama series category, and is among the top nominated drama shows this year. The series, which jumps between the past and present following family members who share the same birthday, is the only network TV show in a field that includes premium cable favorites \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Westworld,\" as well as streaming hits \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Crown.\" 2016 winner \"Mr. Robot\" is not even in contention this year. In fact, besides \"Game of Thrones,\" all of the shows are first-time nominees. But a win for \"This Is Us\" would be more than just a win for the show or NBC. It would mark the first time the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. recognized a network TV drama in more than a decade. The last time a network TV show won the Golden Globe for drama series was in 2006. The winner was \"Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\" which beat out \"24,\" \"Big Love,\" \"Heroes\" and \"Lost.\" The 2006 awards was also the last time network TV shows outnumbered cable or streaming shows among the drama series nominees. That said, the Golden Globes have continued to recognize network TV shows in the musical or comedy series category. While \"black-ish\" is the sole network show in the running in 2017, \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019s\" surprise win was just in 2013. Granted, the last two comedy series awards have gone to streaming shows: \"Mozart in the Jungle\" and \"Transparent.\" Jan. 8, 2017, 5:00 p.m. The award for nicest actor on the red carpet goes to.... Dev Patel Jen Yamato The red carpet at the Golden Globes is hardly known for its niceties -- except when Dev Patel is involved. The \"Lion\" star and\u00a0supporting actor drama nominee graciously thanked photographers with a smile Sunday evening, breaking with the dog-eat-dog atmosphere of your typical awards show arrival. In the jam-packed scrum\u00a0where\u00a0photographer\u00a0and fans vie for for quick snaps of stars\u00a0on their way down the\u00a0gauntlet, Patel\u00a0was the only celeb who took the time to return the appreciation rather than ambling along, guided by the iron hand of a publicist. Jan. 8, 2017, 4:57 p.m. How many times will Jimmy Fallon break down laughing during the show? Tracy Brown Jimmy Fallon is known for a number of things: \"The Tonight Show,\" \"Saturday Night Live\" and his tendency to break character during his performance. With that in mind, there are a couple of things fans can likely expect from tonight\u2019s Golden Globes telecast, which Fallon will host: no Ricky Gervais-style roasts or controversial comments; a musical skit;\u00a0and Fallon breaking character some point during the night. How many times do\u00a0you think Fallon will break down laughing during the Golden Globes? Fashion Film Red carpet Jan. 8, 2017, 4:55 p.m. The puppet star of 'My Life as a Zucchini' was on the red carpet, in a puppet tux Courgette, the lead character in animated feature nominee\u00a0\"My Life as a Zucchini,\" literally turned his frown upside down on the Golden Globes red carpet Sunday -- with a little help from director Claude Barras. \"Like that, we can change the emotions,\" Barras said after flipping his plus-one's mouth over and adjusting the little guy's eyes. Voila, Courgette went from sad to sassy. We're guessing Gaspard\u00a0Schlatter, the actor who gave him his voice in the film, had to employ a slightly deeper method. Red carpet Jan. 8, 2017, 4:45 p.m. 'Moonlight' has director Barry Jenkins optimistic I see this film's reception as optimism. I see it as a sign that we should tell the truth, our stories, more often and more consistently. They say black films don't travel but look at this. Barry Jenkins, director, 'Moonlight' Jan. 8, 2017, 4:40 p.m. Winter is coming for the 'Stranger Things' kids (Jen Yamato / Los Angeles Times) The young stars of \"Stranger Things\" find themselves red carpet\u00a0photo-bombed by \"Game of Thrones' \" \u00a0Jaime Lannister,\u00a0 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau .

A Golden Globes primer Given this year's television nominees, there's every chance that tonight's red carpet will be overrun with an inordinate number of children. Here's a guide to help you keep track of which kids belong where. \"Stranger Things\" Caleb McLaughlin, left,  Noah Schnapp, Millie Brown and Gaten Matarazzo from Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" (Eric Charbonneau/Invision for Netflix/AP Images) Netflix's throwback to classic '80s films delighted fans and the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. alike. The show is nominated for television series, drama, so don't be surprised to see some of its child stars in their Sunday best. \"black-ish\" Marcus Scribner, left, Miles Brown, Marsai Martin, Yara Shahidi from ABC 's \"black-ish.\" (ABC/Tony Rivetti) Now in its third season on ABC, hit series \"black-ish\" has scored its first Golden Globes nominations, including nods for Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross and the show itself. That the young stars of the show would appear at the ceremony to celebrate seems like a sure thing. \"This Is Us\" Mandy Moore, left, Mackenzie Hancsicsak, Milo Ventimiglia, Parker Bates and Lonnie Chavis in NBC's \"This Is Us.\" (Ron Batzdorff/NBC) NBC's heartwarming freshman drama, which shows characters both in the present and in the past,\u00a0was honored by the HFPA with nominations for supporting actress candidates Mandy Moore and Chrissy Metz, along with a nomination for the series for television series, drama. Though they play less prominent roles than the other young actors on this list, it's entirely possible that the show's child stars will make an appearance at Sunday's ceremony. Poll TV Jan. 8, 2017, 4:31 p.m. What awkward game will Jimmy Fallon have guests play at the Golden Globes? Tracy Brown Fans of \"The Tonight Show\" know that Jimmy Fallon has an endless vault of recurring games he likes to play with his celebrity guests. While hosting the Golden Globes may not be exactly the same as hosting a late-night show, it\u2019s hard to imagine the night not drawing on Fallon\u2019s brand of nice, fun-and-games entertainment. Will Fallon slow-jam his monologue? Probably not, but it\u2019s safe to say that it will be a stark contrast to what Golden Globes viewers have experienced during the years Ricky Gervais served as the host. The Golden Globes are most definitely not a dry affair, so perhaps Fallon will fall back on some classic drinking games like giant beer pong or\u00a0flip cup. What game do you think Fallon will have guests play at the Golden Globes? Jan. 8, 2017, 4:29 p.m. 'Loving' stars Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga continue their reign as fashion blockbusters on the red carpet \"Loving\" co-stars Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton attend the Golden Globes together. They were onscreen favorites portraying Richard and Mildred Loving in last year's bio pic \"Loving.\" And in real life, Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga have been quite fashionable in recent public appearances. With their Golden Globes looks tonight, the first-time nominees are clearly rising fashion stars. (After all, did you see them at the recent Palm Springs Film Festival?) For the Golden Globes, Negga wore a custom futuristic, shiny frock from Louis Vuitton, while Edgerton opted for a Brunello Cucinelli tuxedo with a vest. Jan. 8, 2017, 4:26 p.m. At the Golden Globes, even the Champagne guy is an actor Amy Kaufman (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times) This is Chris, 35, from Arizona. He got this gig through a buddy in his acting class \u2014 yep, he's trying to be an actor \u2014\u00a0who thought he might work well on the red carpet. \"I'm pretty calm under pressure,\" he said. He was hoping to hand out a bottle to Amy Adams, but so far his biggest \"get\" was Bernadette Peters. (Nida, who was handing out water near Chris, said the talent was taking bottles from her tray while while everyone else was grabbing Champagne.) (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times) ",

    "text": "Democrats, Top Ethics Official Urge GOP to Slow Down Confirmation Process By BENJAMIN SIEGEL WASHINGTON, D.C. \u0097 Jan 8, 2017, 6:50 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump's Transition Team Gears up for Senate Confirmation Hearings 0 Shares Email Democrats and the government ethics office are raising concerns about several nominees who haven't completed the standard ethics review process, as at least eight of Donald Trump 's Cabinet nominees prepare for confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill this week. \"The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me,\" Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub said in a letter to top senators released by Sens. Elizabeth Warren , D-Massachusetts, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-New York. \"This schedule has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.\" Shaub added that the delay has left some of the nominees with \"potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues.\" \"I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process,\" he said. According to a Senate Democratic aide, Gen. John Kelly, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security , education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, treasury secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, and Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary nominee Ben Carson have not completed the OGE's review process. A Trump transition official said Kelly's ethics paperwork is complete, and that OGE is transmitting it to the Senate on Monday, while a GOP Senate Judiciary Committee aide says the panel has received all preliminary documents and paperwork from Sen. Jeff Sessions ahead of his hearing. Ten of President Obama\u2019s Cabinet picks were confirmed within the week of his inauguration , while three of his Cabinet selections were pulled from consideration. The Senate held confirmation hearings for four of his nominees on a single day in January 2009, before Obama's inauguration. Republicans have also argued that nominees from previous administrations sat for confirmation hearings before all of their forms had been submitted to the panels of jurisdiction, including Bush administration nominees Roderick Page, for education secretary, and Elaine Chao, nominated for labor secretary, in 2001. According to a HELP committee aide, the committee received Paige's paperwork eight days after the hearing, and Chao's five days after the hearing. The aide also said DeVos's paperwork is still in progress, but that committee precedent requires it to be ready before a vote on her nomination, and not the hearing. Democrats claim Republicans are ramming nominees through the confirmation process too quickly. Republicans have scheduled five confirmation hearings for Wednesday, the same day Trump is scheduled to give his first news conference since being elected president. They are pointing to a 2009 letter from Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky, to then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada, urging him to postpone confirmation hearings until OGE letters were completed and submitted to the committees of jurisdiction. The Senate is also going to have a marathon floor session on the budget this week, adding to the packed schedule. Kelly is scheduled to appear before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday, while the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is planning a hearing for DeVos on Wednesday. Carson is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, and Ross will appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on the same day. The Trump transition team accused Democrats of politicizing the transition process. \"President-elect Trump is putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly. In the midst of a historic election where Americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country,\" a transition official said in a statement. \"This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.\" In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, McConnell said the Senate confirmed seven of President Obama's Cabinet appointments on Inauguration Day in 2009, and said Democrats need to \"grow up\" and \"get past\" the election results. \"The real thing is the vote on the floor, and we want to have all of the records in, all of the papers completed before they are actually confirmed on the Senate floor,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump's Cabinet nominees get their day before Senate, as partisan wrangling intensifies Published               January 08, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Confirmation hearings begin this week on Capitol Hill for Alabama Sen. Jeff Session as U.S. attorney general and other Cabinet picks from President-elect Donald Trump -- amid increasing partisan threats about derailing nominees and calls to keep politics out of the process. The most recent exchange began Saturday when Democrats called for a delay in the hearings -- including at least seven this week -- because several of Trump\u2019s nominees have purportedly failed to complete ethics reviews to avoid conflicts of interest. Democrats called for the delay based on letter this weekend from the Office of Government Ethics to Senate leaders stating that some of the nominees scheduled for hearings have yet to complete their ethics review process. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday the complaints are merely \u201cprocedural\u201d and are being raised by Democrats frustrated about him and fellow Republicans now controlling the House, Senate and White House. \"I understand that. But we need to sort of grow up here and get past that,\u201d the Kentucky senator told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe confirmed seven Cabinet appointments the day President Obama was sworn in. We didn't like most of them either. But he won the election.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the ethics review is to ensuring wealthy Cabinet members work for the American people instead of \"their own bottom line and that they plan to fully comply with the law.\" Republicans are intent on getting as Trump nominees through the arduous confirmation process before the incoming Republican president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. Several of Trump\u2019s picks are wealth Americans with far-reaching business connections -- Republican mega-donor Betsy DeVos, for education secretary; ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, for secretary of state; Billionaire private-equity investor Wilbur Ross, for commerce secretary and former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary. Despite all of the wrangling ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings, Trump\u2019s nominees will almost certainly get enough votes in the chamber's GOP-led committees. However, they could run into delays when both parties cast final votes on the Senate floor, despite needing only 51 \u201cyeahs.\u201d Democrats could use procedural moves to extend the debate on each of the nominees. But they don\u2019t have the power to use the filibuster to block the nominations, because in the last Congress they changed the threshold on such filibusters from 60 to 51 votes. The hearings begin Tuesday with Sessions in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the same panel that in 1986 denied him a federal judgeship, following allegations that he had made racist remarks and called the NAACP \"un-American.\" Still, Session, an immigration hawk and the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump, a fellow Republican, is expected to be confirmed without much delay or fight. Still, civil rights groups are urging a thorough vetting of Sessions. Last week, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks and other group members were arrested after a sit-in protest in Sessions' Mobile, Alabama, office, and could do something similar on Capitol Hill. \u00a0 The two-day hearing includes a day for Sessions to address the committee, and a day for rebuttal witnesses from those opposing his nomination. Session will be followed Tuesday by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, the nominee for the post of Homeland Security secretary. Tillerson\u2019s hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to run the State Department, arguable the most important and high-profile Cabinet post, could be the most contentious. His job leading oil giant ExxonMobile, which included deals with Russia and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is raising concerns, especially after a recent U.S. intelligence report stated both meddled in this year\u2019s presidential election. However, the expected showdown with Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain -- who last week suggested he\u2019d vote for Tillerson when \u201cpigs fly\u201d -- appears less likely. McCain said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that still has questions but that a meeting last week with Tillerson eased concerns. \u201cEvery president should have the benefit of the doubt as to their nominees,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there has to be a compelling reason not\u201d to vote for him. Democrats and others argue that Ross, who founded the private equity firm WL Ross & Co., is the type of Wall Street tycoon that Trump has vowed to keep out of Washington. But Ross' record has so far shown no potentially damaging conflicts of interest. Schumer and other Democrats have purportedly targeted DeVos, Sessions and Tillerson as well as Mnuchin and South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, for the Office of Management -- whose hearings have yet to be scheduled. \u201cIf Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they\u2019re sorely mistaken,\u201d Schumer said last week. One of the committees that hasn't yet received the ethics review forms is the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which will hold the DeVos hearings. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee said it had also not received the forms for Ross, though a spokeswoman said they expect them soon. Committee aides said they have received ethics forms for Sessions, Tillerson, Treasury Secretary nominee and retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis and Elaine Chao, for transportation secretary. The Government Ethics office did not list which of Trump's Cabinet choices hadn't turned in their disclosures. Other confirmation hearings next week include Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Ben Carson for housing secretary. The Associated Press contributed to his report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

(Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Several of the thousands who lined up Jan. 7, 2017, for tickets to President Barack Obama's farewell speech, to be held Jan. 10 in Chicago, share their thoughts on what the presidency meant to them. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Tony Briscoe Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune While President Barack Obama 's farewell address was intended to be a free event for those hoping to hear his final oration as commander in chief, there appears to be no shortage of people looking to make a profit from the historic occasion. Obama, a former U.S. senator turned two-term president, will deliver his last presidential speech Tuesday evening at Chicago's McCormick Place. Free tickets were available on a first-come, first-served basis Saturday morning, prompting several thousand people to withstand single-digit temperatures to wait in line for tickets. By 7 a.m., Chicago police officials were warning hopefuls not already in line not to bother. The crowds had grown so large that all of the available tickets would be scooped up. By Sunday, advertisements to auction dozens of the elusive tickets had sprouted up on secondary market websites like eBay and Craigslist asking for as much as $5,000 apiece. Left unclear, however, was whether those tickets were legitimate or could be legally sold. Steve Bernas, Better Business Bureau of Chicago and Northern Illinois president, strongly warned against buying tickets. Whether its tickets to a Cubs game or the musical \"Hamilton,\" there are invariably reports of counterfeit tickets and other hoaxes, he said. \"Stay away from anyone selling these tickets,\" he said. \"You don't know who these people are. It's different buying a couch on Craigslist. You can see the couch. ... There's no way to verify these tickets.\" Though there were no complaints of fraud related to the Obama farewell as of Sunday, Bernas said generally people won't know they've been scammed until ushers stop them at the door. Bernas said it was unlikely police would pursue scalpers. Thousands lined up early on Jan 7, 2017, in the bitter cold for a shot at a free ticket to President Barack Obama's\u00a0farewell speech, which he will deliver\u00a0Jan. 10 at McCormick Place. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) \"Someone is always looking to make a profit on a situation, disaster or calamity,\" Bernas said. \"I guarantee someone will be turned away on Tuesday.\" Bernas also cautioned those who plan on attending the event against sharing pictures of tickets on social media. Scammers, he said, might be able to duplicate them as a result. Images of the tickets posted in some ads appeared to match those that people snagged Saturday. Those same images also had fine print clearly saying the tickets were \"not for sale or re-sale.\" Spokespeople for the White House and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, which owns and operates McCormick Place, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. John Holden, 55, of Edgewater, booked a hotel near McCormick Place in anticipation of the ticket release. While standing in line for 21/2 hours to get his ticket, he remembers officials telling the crowd that the tickets were not for resale, but he didn't note any precautions to ensure that resales didn't take place.

By John Wagner and Ylan Q. Mui January 8 at 2:49 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @ylanmui Billionaire investor Carl Icahn will have the ear of President-elect Donald Trump as an adviser focused on cutting government regulations. But Icahn also stands to benefit if his advice is taken: It could make the energy companies and others in which he has a stake more profitable. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who\u2019s a major figure in her father\u2019s business, has been present at transition meetings and is expected to continue to counsel him at the White House. So, too, is her husband, Jared Kushner, who has a web of business interests of his own that could be affected by Trump administration policy. And another Trump intimate \u2014 his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 is making no secret of his desire to profit on his continuing closeness to Trump, setting up a new lobbying firm with an office just a block from the White House. With confirmation hearings set to start for Trump\u2019s Cabinet, ethics experts are voicing alarm about several other confidants of the president-elect \u2014 dubbed the \u201cshadow Cabinet\u201d by one \u2014 who might not be subject to such scrutiny and could face a tangle of potential conflicts between their personal interests and those of the public. His lawyer said this weekend that Kushner is preparing to resign from his position overseeing his family\u2019s real estate empire and to divest \u201csubstantial assets\u201d if he takes a role in Trump\u2019s White House. Trump advisers Stephen Bannon and Jared Kushner make their way to Carrier Corporation in Indianapolis, Ind., in December. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) In other cases, it\u2019s unclear whether the usual safeguards of public disclosure and divestment will come into play to prevent those serving the president from profiting personally from their work. The concerns have been amplified by the fact that they will be reporting to a Republican president who has been slow to address the potential conflicts stemming from his own real estate holdings and other business interests. Some of the advisory roles Trump has set up or is openly contemplating fall into \u201cvery murky territory,\u201d said Norman Eisen, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama. Richard W. Painter, who held the same position as Eisen under President George W. Bush and now sits with him on the board of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said \u201cit poses an enormous risk to have a shadow Cabinet.\u201d Trump transition officials did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Icahn said he will \u201cfollow the law as he always has,\u201d while Kushner\u2019s attorney said he is consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take. The appointment of Icahn \u2014 whom Trump praised as \u201csomeone who is innately able to predict the future, especially having to do with finances and economies\u201d \u2014 has drawn the sharpest criticism. Painter said Icahn\u2019s status as an unpaid adviser is \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d The billionaire investor made his name on Wall Street as one of the most successful corporate raiders of the 1980s, including making nearly $500\u00a0million from his stake in Trans World Airlines. As an investor in Trump\u2019s hotels, he has clashed with the president-elect over business deals in the past but also provided financing at critical moments to keep Trump afloat. Icahn ranks among the 50 richest people in the world, according to Forbes. In the wee hours after Election Day, as supporters celebrated Trump\u2019s victory in a ballroom at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan, Icahn ducked out of the festivities. He was tracking the initial plunge in financial markets over Trump\u2019s upset win and decided to make a bet. \u201cI couldn\u2019t put more than $1\u00a0billion to work,\u201d Icahn told Bloomberg TV the day after the election. \u201cThe world was going into a panic for no reason. I think Donald coming in is a good thing for the economy, not a bad thing.\u201d Trump\u2019s presidency also stands to be particularly good for Icahn. He has long railed against regulation from Washington, most recently in the energy sector. Now he is being tasked by Trump to help him slash government regulations in the newly created role of special adviser for regulatory reform. Trump\u2019s transition team emphasized that the title comes with no official duties and no salary \u2014 and is therefore not subject to federal disclosure requirements or conflict of interest laws. In an interview on CNBC, Icahn said that he will simply be \u201ctalking to Donald as I\u2019ve talked before.\u201d The confirmation process is designed in part to air potential conflicts. For example, Trump\u2019s incoming commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who made a fortune in the steel industry, will likely be asked to explain how he will oversee a department that has significant oversight of that sector. While White House staff members do not face confirmation hearings as Cabinet secretaries do, they must file disclosure forms revealing their finances. They also have to divest assets that create conflicts of interest or abide by rules requiring them to recuse themselves from decisions that could affect those assets. Icahn\u2019s role is so nebulous that it is difficult to tell how it should be categorized. The nature of his work could make him a de facto government employee \u2014 subject to disclosure requirements and conflict of interest laws \u2014 even if he is not paid. \u201cIs it in the public interest for him to take that position and for us to not know what he\u2019s doing?\u201d said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. Watchdog groups have raised concerns about how much influence Icahn might wield over rolling back regulations that could benefit him personally. In the CNBC interview, he expounded at length over what he deemed \u201cinsane\u201d rules dictating how much ethanol refineries should blend into gasoline. Shares of CVR Energy, a petroleum refinery in which he holds a significant stake, have almost doubled in price since the election. In addition, it is unclear whether Icahn\u2019s position could provide him special access to political intelligence. Legislation passed in 2012 prohibits members of Congress and certain positions within the executive branch from trading based on nonpublic political information. Democrats are already questioning whether Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, violated that law by trading health-care stocks during the crafting of the Affordable Care Act. Trump\u2019s unusual willingness to intervene in the business decisions of individual companies could also create greater potential for conflicts of interest. On Thursday, Trump criticized Toyota for building cars in Mexico and selling them in the United States, sending the company\u2019s stock plunging. \u201cThe fear would be that he could be privy to knowledge that could affect the market in some ways or different corporations he has a stake in or against,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cHe could make a move before the rest of America knows about it.\u201d In an email, Jesse Lynn, general counsel of Icahn Enterprises, said Icahn\u2019s title was not intended to formalize his role in the new Trump administration but to acknowledge the long-standing relationship among two New York dealmakers. Jan Baran, a campaign and elections lawyer at Wiley Rein, said conflict of interest laws only cover information that has the potential to affect a specific company, not a broad industry. And he said that many presidents often have a coterie of unofficial advisers, many of whom lack real power. \u201cIt kind of reminds me of Peter the Great when he was the czar of Russia\u201d in the late 1600s and early 1700s, Baran said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much in the way of money that he could give to anybody, so he started giving blue ribbons. This might be Trump\u2019s version of a blue ribbon.\u201d Trump has not made formal announcements about the role his daughter and son-in-law will play in the administration. But those around him have suggested that Ivanka Trump could be involved in policies affecting working mothers, while Kushner\u2019s portfolio could include advising the president on foreign policy, particularly the Middle East. What would happen to their business interests remains unclear. Ivanka Trump has played a leading role in her father\u2019s business and has a clothing line. Kushner has a web of business interests of his own, focused heavily on real estate development. Though Kushner\u2019s company is focused primarily on development in New York and New Jersey, it has often relied on foreign investment, and its earnings could be influenced by Trump administration trade and foreign relations policies. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, WilmerHale partner Jamie Gorelick, said Saturday that Kushner would recuse himself from matters that would have a direct impact on his remaining financial interests and abide by other federal ethics rules. A federal anti-nepotism statute enacted in 1967 could also complicate the fate of the couple, who recently purchased a house in Washington. The law, which came about after President John F. Kennedy named his brother as attorney general, forbids public officials from hiring family members in agencies or offices they oversee. There\u2019s some disagreement among lawyers as to whether appointments to White House positions are exempt \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the health-care reform proposal during her husband\u2019s presidency is cited by those who take that view. Gorelick declined to comment on that matter. But both Eisen and Painter say they counseled their respective presidents to avoid appointing relatives to administration positions. Painter argued that the ideal solution \u2014 if Trump wants to put his daughter and son-in-law in positions of influence \u2014 would be to ask Congress to amend the anti-nepotism law and give them formal roles. Lewandowski remains in regular touch with the president-elect and is expected to continue to do so when Trump enters the Oval Office. There is a long tradition in Washington of lobbyists trading on their access to powerful figures, but ethics experts were taken aback by how bluntly Lewandowski pitched his new lobbying shop. A news release issued by the firm, Avenue Strategies, touted its location \u201cjust a block from the White House\u201d on Pennsylvania Avenue and quoted Lewandowski saying, \u201cI will always be President-elect Trump\u2019s biggest supporter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been overly desensitized to shock, but we should be shocked,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cHow did Trump not repudiate that announcement?\u201d Eisen asked. \u201cI think he should repudiate it. I doubt he will.\u201d Chico Harlan contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

JAN. 8, 2017 8:02 PM ET Photo Emma Stone is nominated for her performance in \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Credit Jordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated Press Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:33 PM ET Good evening, everyone! The 2017 awards season begins tonight with the 74th Golden Globes, and we\u2019re here to keep you company, to comment and to commiserate throughout the whole three-hour show. I\u2019m Dave Itzkoff, a culture reporter for The New York Times. I\u2019m joined by Wesley Morris, critic-at-large, and Melena Ryzik, a fellow reporter and awards-season veteran. Melena Ryzik Reporter 7:33 PM ET Thanks Dave and hello all! Happy to be part of this viewing party. Jimmy Fallon is hosting, which means it will likely veer towards silly escapism, instead of the social wit of the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler years or the barbs of the cringy Ricky Gervais era. Expect an opening song-and-dance number in the vein of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle\u2019s musical love letter to Los Angeles. But Fallon also knows his Hollywood audience, so he\u2019ll doubtless riff on the president-elect \u2013 perhaps to atone further for his softball \u201cTonight Show\u201d interview with his fellow NBC personality during the campaign. (He already did some penance, opposite Tina on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d) And given the unusually diverse spate of TV nominees \u2013 including newcomers like Issa Rae of \u201cInsecure\u201d and Riz Ahmed of \u201cThe Night Of\u201d \u2013 expect some potentially political moments, stirring or grandstanding too. Melena Ryzik Here\u2019s a link to that SNL clip. http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-denise-mcdonough-and-doreen-troilo/3112631 Wesley Morris Critic 7:34 PM ET Hello Dave and Melena and everybody else. This is going to be fun \u2013 even when some of what we\u2019re watching threatens to be the opposite of that. The Golden Globes have always been the chillest of these big awards extravaganzas. They\u2019re first up, for one thing. The stakes are lower (or they used to be), the vibe boozier, the winners occasionally more baffling. The top movies, expectations-wise, are \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cMoonlight.\u201d But, you know, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN (especially in the TV categories). But maybe it won\u2019t. Which actually, might be a weird comfort since anything is happening everywhere else. Let\u2019s do it! Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:38 PM ET O.K., Wesley and Melena, I\u2019m going to make you stake out a prediction in advance. \u201cLa La Land\u201d seems a safe bet in the best musical/comedy film category. (Unless \u201cDeadpool\u201d surprises us all.) The real showdown, one assumes, will be between \u201cManchester By the Sea\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d in the best dramatic film category. Who goes home with the trophy? Melena Ryzik Reporter 7:42 PM ET My money\u2019s on \u201cManchester.\u201d With \u201cMoonlight\u201d picking up some acting awards, and maybe a screenplay trophy \u2013 although that\u2019s another category where they\u2019re neck-and-neck. Wesley Morris Critic 7:44 PM ET Yeah it is. I\u2019d say the folks at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (they give these things out) will go with \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Wesley Morris But I\u2019m standing with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d since it stayed with me. Melena Ryzik Reporter 7:52 PM ET Amazon has put major muscle into its campaigning for \u201cManchester.\u201d But you also can\u2019t count out a dark horse action candidate, like \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d from a studio or from players who know how to finesse the game \u2013 in this case, an on-the-rebound Mel Gibson, the director of \u201cHacksaw.\u201d Remember that last year the Hollywood Foreign Press Association drama pick was \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d after a never-ending campaign by Leonardo DiCaprio. Tamara Best 8:08 PM ET Photo Casey Affleck is nominated for his performance in \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Credit Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:53 PM ET Give me your quick pick for Best TV drama: the grizzled veteran \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d or one of the newcomers: \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThis Is Us\u201d or \u201cWestworld\u201d? Wesley Morris \u201cStranger Things\u201d \u2013 because something\u2019s gotta be in the Upside Down tonight. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:56 PM ET I\u2019ll take a chance and make a prediction of my own: 1980s me says \u201cStranger Things,\u201d 2017 me says \u201cThis is Us.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 7:59 PM ET \u201cThis Is Us\u201d? It\u2019s like \u201cParenthood\u201d and \u201cCrash\u201d had a baby in the frozen aisle at Whole Foods. Dave Itzkoff It keeps me warm at nights. Dave Itzkoff Here we go: Show time. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:01 PM ET As was foretold, we\u2019re starting with a pretaped opening - unusual for the Golden Globes - that\u2019s a musical riff on \u201cLa La Land,\u201d with Jimmy Fallon singing his way through red carpet traffic. Tamara Best Jimmy Fallon in an opening sequence. Credit Getty Images Wesley Morris And it\u2019s all being politely sung in the key of Emma Stone. Dave Itzkoff The \u201cStranger Things\u201d kids rapping and singing was all that mattered to me. Wesley Morris Yeah \u2013 the \u201cStranger Things\u201d kids rapping will be worth my annoyance two hours from now. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:04 PM ET \u201cRoomful of stars, they\u2019ve been getting drunk since 3,\u201d Fallon sings. Truth is, the Globes are not the drunkfest they\u2019re made out to be. Dave Itzkoff If, say, one did not actually see \u201cLa La Land,\u201d does this still make sense? Melena Ryzik In West Hollywood. At the Abbey. Dave Itzkoff Also, did you know Jimmy Fallon was friends with Justin Timberlake? Melena Ryzik News to me and everyone else with an Internet connection. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:06 PM ET \u201cAlready the TelePrompTer is down, so this is a great way to start the show.\u201d Jimmy Fallon seems serious about this. Wesley Morris If this goes poorly for Jimmy, there will alway be that: Justin. Dave Itzkoff He\u2019s being amiable about it. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:07 PM ET \u201cThis is one of the few places left, where America still honors the popular vote\u201d \u2013 Fallon takes on Trump right away. Wesley Morris That might be the only election joke he makes. Dave Itzkoff How do we feel about Jimmy Fallon opening with a Chris Rock impression? Melena Ryzik I wonder how Chris Rock feels about it? Wesley Morris He likes it because it was funny. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:09 PM ET Fallon on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: \u201cA lot of people have wondered what it would\u2019ve been like if King Joffrey had lived. Well, in 12 days we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d Wesley Morris Reporter 8:10 PM ET Here\u2019s one more \u2013 Fallon on \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d: \u201cThe character has been dubbed the world\u2019s worst opera singer. And even she turned down Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201d Dave Itzkoff We did get the Trump jokes we were promised. Mekado Murphy 8:11 PM ET The winner for best supporting actor in a motion picture is Aaron Taylor-Johnson for \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Mekado Murphy Aaron Taylor-Johnson, right, with Michael Shannon in \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Credit Merrick Morton/Focus Features Melena Ryzik That\u2019s a surprise to me right out the gate. Melena Ryzik Mahershala Ali (\u201cMoonlight\u201d) was the favorite. Wesley Morris Critic 8:13 PM ET Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays a nasty hick in the scuzzy perfume ad also knows as \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Of him, yes. Of the movie, I don\u2019t know her. Mekado Murphy 8:13 PM ET The winner for best actor in a TV series drama is Billy Bob Thornton for \u201cGoliath.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Another shock to me, I\u2019ll say that. Wesley Morris It is! Are you guys watching \u201cGoliath\u201d? It\u2019s really good. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:15 PM ET Billy Bob says he\u2019s especially surprised he beat Bob Odenkirk, with whom he\u2019s \u201chad a feud since the 1940s when we did a movie with Van Johnson.\u201d Wesley Morris Apparently, the Electoral College is also voting for these awards. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:16 PM ET I like a beef in an awards show thank-you speech. Also, kudos to Billy Bob for sticking to the dark-glasses-indoors look. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:18 PM ET Two awards and two big shocks for me. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association just works differently, I guess. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:19 PM ET Well, how the H.F.P.A. works is anyone\u2019s guess \u2013 although they\u2019ve tried to clean up their act recently. Being schmoozed less openly by the studios and stars, for instance. Wesley Morris Critic 8:19 PM ET I told you guys: The Upside Down, man. But \u201cGoliath,\u201d which I like, is an Amazon show. Wesley Morris Keep your eye on that. Wesley Morris An Amazon sweep or something like that. Melena Ryzik Bezos being in the audience! Wesley Morris Oh snap. The Beez is in the house. Dave Itzkoff Who is fulfilling my Amazon orders right now? Wesley Morris The gang at Seeso, Dave. Dave Itzkoff All right Golden Globes, continue to surprise me. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:21 PM ET Fallon: \u201cI just got off the phone with Mariah Carey and she thinks Dick Clark Productions sabotaged my monologue.\u201d Wesley Morris Mariah: Still winning. Even when she\u2019s lost. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:22 PM ET In a weird way I think it\u2019s lucky Fallon had the TelePrompTer problems. They covered up for a fairly lackluster monologue. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:25 PM ET Guys, BTW: whatever you think about \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d can\u2019t wait for Meryl\u2019s turn on stage (she\u2019s getting an honorary award). Because she\u2019s entered the don\u2019t-give-a-hoot stage of her career (a.k.a. the Mariah stage). Mekado Murphy 8:23 PM ET The winner for best actress in a TV series, musical or comedy, is Tracee Ellis Ross for \u201cblack-ish.\u201d Tamara Best Tracee Ellis Ross Credit Jordan Strauss/Invision Wesley Morris Agreed. He\u2019ll be fine from here on out. Dave Itzkoff That was a crazy competitive category. Can everyone win? Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:25 PM ET It was exactly as mild as any Fallon monologue. The TelePrompTer problem was the most memorable part of it. Wesley Morris Critic 8:25 PM ET I know. But I can go home now, the second-funniest woman on TV FINALLY wins something (sorry, Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Wesley Morris But not sorry. She\u2019s won everything. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:26 PM ET Tracee Ellis Ross: \u201cThis is for all the women, women of color, and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy and valid and important. But I want you to know that I see you, we see you.\u201d Melena Ryzik She also breaks a cardinal rule of Hollywood by revealing her actual age \u2013 44. Mekado Murphy The winner for best TV series, musical or comedy, is \u201cAtlanta\u201d on FX. Mekado Murphy Intense but reserved: Donald Glover in \u201cAtlanta.\u201d Credit Guy D'Alema/FX Dave Itzkoff Another stunner, but one I\u2019m very happy to see. Melena Ryzik This is the first of many awards for \u201cAtlanta.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 8:28 PM ET OK, now we\u2019re black on Earth. I mean, \u201cback.\u201d Of course, yes. I meant \u201cback.\u201c Dave Itzkoff This show is in its first season, beating veterans like \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:28 PM ET Donald Glover: \u201cI really want to thank Atlanta, and all the black folks in Atlanta, for real. Just for being alive and being amazing people.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 8:36 PM ET Vince Vaughn just introduced the clip from drama nominee \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d And I got another surprise-winner chill. Mekado Murphy 8:36 PM ET The winner for best actress in a limited series or TV movie is Sarah Paulson for \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\u201d Dave Itzkoff OK, this one was anticipated. Still satisfying! Dave Itzkoff Did she bring Marcia Clark tonight? Melena Ryzik If so, I hope Kerry Washington (\u201cConfirmation\u201d) brought Anita Hill. Wesley Morris Critic 8:38 PM ET The more I think about it, the more fantastic Sarah P. was on \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson.\u201d Wesley Morris She was the best in that class of people. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:39 PM ET Paulson on Marcia Clark: \u201cIf I could live my life with a fraction of your wit, integrity and your unapologetic fierceness, I would be on the road to doing it right.\u201d Mekado Murphy 8:39 PM ET The winner for best limited series or TV movie is \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d on FX. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:40 PM ET Since this was also expected, I\u2019ll just say that I love seeing people in the second tier of seating taking camera-phone pictures of the people in the first tier of seating. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:41 PM ET Or skulking behind them in the about-to-cut-to-commercial moments. I recognized a few H.F.P.A. members back there. Wesley Morris I love the flair on that producer\u2019s jacket. Wesley Morris Oh yes. Melena, spill the beans. Give us H.F.P.A. gossip? Who snores during screenings? Melena Ryzik None of them. They are all busy cozying up for photos. Melena Ryzik (Award-season screenings often involve meet-and-greets with the stars.) Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:44 PM ET I think I just heard two-time Golden Globe nominee Jason Lee doing the voiceover in an IHOP commercial for all-you-can-eat pancakes. Just to keep things in perspective. Melena Ryzik Dave, good on you for not muting the commercials. Tell me how you do it. Dave Itzkoff You know, it\u2019s all content. Wesley Morris Critic 8:45 PM ET Well, who\u2019s, like, the cozying-uppest? Nevermind. Let just marvel at this latest attempt, courtesy of AT&T, to over-dramatize what it\u2019s like to watch, say, \u201cKnight Rider\u201d on a phone. Wesley Morris Critic 8:47 PM ET So we just got back from commercial and Julia Louis-Dreyfus was on Questlove\u2019s turntable, playing Bruno Mars. That\u2019ll be a nice gag if they keep it up. Melena Ryzik I would 100% go to a party DJ\u2019d by JLD. Dave Itzkoff Mekado Murphy 8:48 PM ET The winner for best supporting actor in a series, limited series or TV movie is Hugh Laurie for \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:49 PM ET Thought Sterling K. Brown (\u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d), who won the Emmy, had this one in the bag too. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:49 PM ET A break in what will likely be a sweep for \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d right? Wesley Morris Critic 8:49 PM ET Wow, indeed \u2013 Hugh Laurie. This is another shock even though, you know, it\u2019s Hugh Laurie, who will now give a Hall of Fame speech. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:50 PM ET \u201cThis is obviously a terrible mix-up,\u201d Hugh Laurie says humbly. He adds: \u201cI\u2019ll be able to say I won this at the last-ever Golden Globes. \u2026 It has the words Hollywood, Foreign and Press in the title. I also think that to some Republicans, even the word Association is slightly sketchy.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Before anyone jumps in, I don\u2019t believe those Sofia Vergara lines were accidental. Wesley Morris \u201cAnal tradition\u201d? I think not. Dave Itzkoff They\u2019ll make great moments on social media, though. Wesley Morris But all award shows are! Mekado Murphy The winner for best original motion picture score is Justin Hurwitz for \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:53 PM ET Any musical win for \u201cLa La Land\u201d is a gimme. Can we talk about the most GIF-able moments so far? The biggest may have come on the red carpet, between Jenna Bush Hager and Pharrell. Dave Itzkoff When she said he was a nominee for \u201cHidden Fences\u201d? Wesley Morris \u201cHidden Fences\u201d had Tracy Jordan\u2019s best acting yet. Dave Itzkoff Works as a GIF, really needs the audio to sell it. Just my 2 cents. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:54 PM ET Dave, there you go being all technical about what makes a Gif. Do you also pronounce it Jif? Mekado Murphy 8:54 PM ET The winner for best original motion picture song is \u201cCity of Stars\u201d from \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:57 PM ET Those are composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. They had this one in the bag, I thought. Still, that\u2019s one award that didn\u2019t go to Lin-Manuel Miranda! Wesley Morris Critic 8:58 PM ET Well, fortunately, it\u2019s the EGOT not the EGGGOT. So hopefully he\u2019ll be OK. (That\u2019s Emmy Grammy Oscar Tony for newbies.) Wesley Morris Critic 8:59 PM ET But yeah, he could lose the Oscar, now, too. But LMM will win all the Oscars for \u201cHamilton the Movie.\u201d Wesley Morris Questlove is killing it. He just went to commercial on a lick of Billy Squire. Wesley Morris John Legend still looks like he\u2019s about to hand 11th-grade me a corsage. Mekado Murphy The winner for best supporting actress in a motion picture is Viola Davis for \u201cFences.\u201d Mekado Murphy Viola Davis with Denzel Washington in \u201cFences.\u201d Credit David Lee/Paramount Pictures Melena Ryzik Viola Davis was the favorite in this category. Dave Itzkoff Actual \u201cFences,\u201d not \u201cHidden Fences.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:03 PM ET I\u2019d wondered if Michelle Williams might sneak off with this one for \u201cManchester By the Sea.\u201d Melena Ryzik Reporter 9:03 PM ET She and Tracee Ellis Ross are going to have some of the strongest speeches of the night. Wesley Morris Viola\u2019s the best supporting actress who didn\u2019t support anybody. SHE\u2019S A LEAD. Wesley Morris Critic 9:04 PM ET But she won and she\u2019s giving a killer speech. So I\u2019ll just let my welled-up eyes speak for me. Melena Ryzik Reporter 9:05 PM ET Ah but that\u2019s the game \u2013 very judicious decision by the powers-that-be to put her in the supporting actress category for the film. She won best actress at the Tony Awards for the same role. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:05 PM ET Viola Davis: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen. It doesn\u2019t scream money-maker, you know. But it does scream art. It does scream heart.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:05 PM ET \u201cTo the original Troy, my father, Dan Davis.

    "text": "Steven was born and raised in Miami, attended college in Israel, and became a freelance journalist, reporting from war zones where information was scarce, like Yemen, Benghazi, Libya and Syria where he went in the summer of 2013.\u00a0 Just before he crossed into Aleppo, he called his dad. \u00a0 \u00a0 Art Sotloff: He contacted me and told me not to worry, and, but if I don\u2019t hear from him within four days, that I should get in touch with one of his colleagues. Lesley Stahl: Oh, that\u2019s ominous. He didn\u2019t hear from his son. Not just for four days. It was four excruciating months. Then, finally they got a ransom letter with demands for the government to free all the Muslims in U.S. custody. Luke Somers in Sanaa, Yemen, July 2013. Close AP Note to readers: In reporting our story on Steven Sotloff, we spoke with, among others, the family of American photojournalist Luke Somers. Just a month after Sotloff was captured by ISIS in Syria in 2013, Somers was seized in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Like Sotloff,\u00a0 Somers tragically died in late 2014 while in captivity . Along with a South African teacher, Somers was shot by his captors during a Navy SEAL rescue attempt. Shirley Sotloff: \u201cThen there is a last option. \u20ac100 million will secure Steven\u2019s release.\u201d Lesley Stahl: --which is something like 100-- Art Sotloff: $137 million. Lesley Stahl: What was your reaction? Shirley Sotloff: Reaction was how the hell are we going to get this money together? They thought the U.S. government would help them, but they were bewildered and then infuriated when they say they met a stone wall, the U.S. policy forbidding the paying of ransom.\u00a0 Lisa Monaco: It\u2019s some of the hardest work that I\u2019ve done. Lisa Monaco, assistant to President Obama for counterterrorism, oversaw the hostage crisis. Lisa Monaco: These are horrible choices. On the one hand, if you don\u2019t pay a ransom, you are putting an innocent life at risk. On the other hand, if you do, you\u2019re fueling the very activity that\u2019s put them at risk in the first place. Lesley Stahl: Did you feel ever that the policy might be wrong? Lisa Monaco: The policy that\u2019s been a decades-old policy of not paying ransom, I think is the right policy. Lesley Stahl: So you didn\u2019t question that.\u00a0 Lisa Monaco: We didn\u2019t. We believed that that was important to maintain. But with the exception of the UK, most European countries do pay ransom -- without publicly admitting it. Steven was held with 22 other hostages, including the three Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller, who were all killed. Once the European governments paid ransom, ISIS released their citizens, one of whom smuggled out this letter from Steven. Steven Sotloff\u2019s letter to his family Close CBS News Art Sotloff: He was speaking how he can\u2019t stand seeing all the captives leave from all different countries. How could the United States just stand by and not do anything?\u00a0 As the European hostages came out and spoke of mock executions and waterboardings, the Sotloffs decided they would try to raise at least some of the money themselves. But then they and the other U.S. families attended a meeting in Washington with officials on the National Security Council. To learn about where to receive support for hostage victims and their families, visit\u00a0 Hostage US , an independent nonprofit that offers guidance during and after a kidnapping. Art Sotloff: All of us were saying, \u201cWell, why can\u2019t we try to save our kids?\u00a0 And they said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s against the law. We do not negotiate with terrorists.\u201d Lesley Stahl: Did they say you would be prosecuted? Art Sotloff: They said, \u201cYou could be prosecuted, and also your donors could be prosecuted.\u201d Lesley Stahl: So if I gave you money, I could be prosecuted? Shirley Sotloff: Yes-- Lesley Stahl: Did anybody say, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Art Sotloff: Yes, they did. Yes, they did. Lesley Stahl: So it was a little bit contentious. Art Sotloff: Oh yeah. We kind of verbally fought back. Lesley Stahl: They were threatened that they could be prosecuted. Is that true? Lisa Monaco: So what\u2019s true is that some families felt threatened. And that was unacceptable. And that should never have happened. Lesley Stahl: Are you suggesting they may not have been threatened? Lisa Monaco: No. What I\u2019m suggesting is, I wasn\u2019t present when any threats were made, but what matters, Lesley, is that these families felt that way as they were going through the most horrific time they will ever encounter. Lesley Stahl: But was that the policy?\u00a0 Was that true?\u00a0 Could they have actually been prosecuted?\u00a0 Could someone who contributed to pay ransom also be prosecuted? Lisa Monaco: So what\u2019s true is that the Justice Department has never prosecuted a family or friends of a family that has paid a ransom. Lesley Stahl: But was it the policy? Lisa Monaco: Well, what\u2019s, the, the policy is the United States Government will not pay ransoms or make concessions to terrorist hostage takers. That policy is based in part on a presumption that paying ransom invites more hostage taking. But that is refuted by a new study that examined the case of every known Western hostage taken since 911. It was co-authored by Peter Bergen, a counterterrorism expert, for the non-partisan New America Foundation. Peter Bergen: They don\u2019t know necessarily you\u2019re American when they take you. It\u2019s sort of a target of opportunity. So some countries are known to pay ransom \u2013 the French, the Germans, the Spanish. Lesley Stahl: Even though, they don\u2019t admit it. Peter Bergen: They don\u2019t admit it, but they do. Their citizens have much better outcomes than Americans.\u00a0 Americans are huge outliers here. You\u2019re twice as likely to have a negative outcome compared to every other Western hostage. Lesley Stahl: You say negative outcome. You mean murdered. Peter Bergen: Murdered, die in captivity or just remain in captivity. Fourteen of the European hostages held with Steven made it home. Those from countries that don\u2019t pay ransom didn\u2019t: four Americans and two Brits died. Lesley Stahl: I keep playing in my own head this horrible situation where the American hostages watched the other ones be set free. And I wonder if it wouldn\u2019t have been better if, if our government did what the European governments did, which was pay ransom but then deny it in order to save their citizens. Why couldn\u2019t we have done that? Lisa Monaco: We\u2019d still be fueling their terror activity. Whether it\u2019s hostage taking or whether it\u2019s terrorist plots, to kill Americans here in the homeland or elsewhere, is not activity that the United States government should be in the business of funding. Lesley Stahl: What do you say to critics of the policy of not paying ransom? That the beheadings of the Americans ended up having more value to ISIS than any money would have been. That\u2019s really what put them on the international map. These beheading videos were a gold mine for ISIS. Do you, do you see it that way? Lisa Monaco: I don\u2019t. And-- I think it\u2019s giving brutal, murderous thugs too much credit. Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that if you pay ransom you\u2019re just encouraging them to kidnap more? But also that the money is going to go toward terrorism. And so what\u2019s the come back to that? It\u2019s a hard thing. Art Sotloff: Going back to what President Obama said to us in person that he would do anything in his power to save his children if he was in the same situation. And I say that he should put himself in the same situation. And I think that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens in whatever way that they can. Lesley Stahl: What do you say when you hear people argue that Steven knew he was putting his life at risk by going into Syria at that point and, you know, kinda the burden\u2019s on him? Art Sotloff: Steven was driven by truth. That he had to report the truth. He saw that there wasn\u2019t information coming out of these areas. And that\u2019s really what drove him. In the summer of 2014, nearly a year after Steven was abducted, President Obama ordered a military operation to rescue the hostages. Lisa Monaco: This involved a number of, a large number of military service members and special operators who\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Putting their lives on the line. Lisa Monaco: Putting their lives on the line. Going into the heart of ISIL territory in Syria. And as we were monitoring the operation, word came back, some very devastating words: \u201cIt\u2019s a dry hole,\u201d which meant that they weren\u2019t there. [Jihadi John: This is James Wright Foley.] About seven weeks later, James Foley became the first of three American hostages beheaded. Steven appears at the end of the video. [Jihadi John points knife at camera: The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.] The Sotloffs then received an audio message that sounds like Steven was forced to record, designed to pressure the U.S. government.\u00a0 It was given to them by the FBI. Surviving the death of a child Art Sotloff: This is always tough for me, because it\u2019s actually his voice. And it just makes me feel like he\u2019s still in the room with us. \u201cTo Mom, I do not have much time and will probably not get this opportunity again so I would like to get straight to the point. My life depends on Obama\u2019s next decision. Mom, please don\u2019t let Obama kill me. Mom you can still save my life just like the families of my previous cellmates whom I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met. Fight for me, I love you.\u201d Shirley Sotloff: Powerful. Art Sotloff: I gotta blow my nose. I\u2019m sorry. If I could excuse myself. Lesley Stahl: It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s cruel. Shirley Sotloff: Very. I don\u2019t know what they wanted us to do. Lesley Stahl: And always saying \u201cmom\u201d like that. Shirley Sotloff: Mom. ",

The matter could have been settled for what amounts to pocket change for a billionaire, but the Trump Organization decided to take its chances in court. Now Trump stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if he wins, it could force a small businessman \u2014 one of hundreds who say they were stiffed by Trump over the years \u2014 possibly into bankruptcy. That businessman, Juan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, won the first round of the legal skirmish last summer when a judge found a lien he slapped on the Trump National Doral golf resort was valid. Play Senate Democrats Prepare for Marathon Week of Confirmation Hearings 1:33 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170109000453if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/850367555884\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The court ordered Trump to pay for $32,000 worth of paint, plus nearly $300,000 in legal fees. Trump's company appealed, and barring a last-minute resolution, the case will be pending when he takes office; the deadline for final briefs is two days before he becomes the most powerful person in America. Enriquez's lawyer, Daniel Vega, said he is not surprised it has gone this far. \"The Trump litigation team litigated this case from day one like lions on fresh meat and continue to do so now on appeal,\" he told NBC News. The matter dates back to the fall of 2013 when Enriquez, who owns three Miami paint stores, was tapped by a subcontractor to supply paint for a major remodeling project at the Doral resort, owned and operated by a Trump company called Trump Endeavor. The Trump National Doral clubhouse March 7, 2016 in Doral, Florida. Wilfredo Lee / AP There is no dispute that the paint was delivered and used on the property, according to court records. But after the subcontractor walked off the job weeks before completion, Enriquez didn't get a final payment. In a deposition, a project manager for general contractor Straticon testified that he failed to get the Trump Organization to pay the balance. \"Were you trying to pay him,\" Vega asked the manager, Jamie Gram, during the sessions. \"I was,\" Gram replied. \"Somebody chose not to,\" Gram said. \"Who?\" the lawyer asked. \"The Trump Organization,\" Gram said. \"Who at Trump?\" \"I don't know,\" Gram said. \"Mr. Trump. Donald Trump.\" In October 2014, Enriquez filed a lien \u2014 a legal tool that can be used to recover a debt by tying up a piece of property \u2014 against Doral. Eight months later, Enriquez filed a lawsuit against Trump Endeavor, seeking to foreclose on the 800-acre resort. Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drives himself around the golf course on March 6, 2016, in Doral, Florida. Luis M. Alvarez / AP The Trump team's defense was largely technical. It turned out that when Enriquez took the job he submitted paperwork called a Notice to Owner, which would allow him to file a lien against the property if a bill wasn't paid. A Trump official gave him a form to work off \u2014 but it listed the general contractor for a different part of the project, and Enriquez repeated the mistake on his notice. Gram later noticed and flagged the error. Enriquez said he would fix it but never did, court documents show. At trial, though, Gram testified that the decision not to pay Enriquez \"had nothing to do with a defective notice to owner.\" He went on to explain that the bill went unpaid because the Trump Organization had already paid \"a decent amount of money\" to the subcontractor, M&P, before it abandoned the job. The resort used any money left over, plus additional funds, to complete the unfinished paint job, he said. Gram's testimony appeared to distress Trump's legal team, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Jorge Cueto noted in his June 2016 ruling. \"When Mr. Gram made that admission, Trump's trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily and attempted to make eye contact with him,\" the judge wrote. The judge found that Enriquez had made \"diligent efforts\" to comply with the lien law and that being given the wrong paperwork by the Trump official was the root of the mistake. He also dismissed Trump clams that the bill was fraudulent, subtracting only $76.39 for a stepladder from the bottom line. Cueto then dealt the Trump team a bigger blow, ruling that they had to pay Enriquez's legal costs. Because Vega had taken the case on contingency, meaning he would not get paid if they lost, the judge tacked on a multiplier to compensate him for the risk he took, nearly doubling the award to $283,949.91. \"Trump elected to fight this case 'tooth and nail' instead of resolving it for a reasonable amount, driving up Paint Spot's litigation fees and costs,\" the judge explained.

    "text": "\"A dispute, discussion, something breaks out at that meeting. We haven't even come in yet,\" said Austan Goolsbee, a professor at the University of Chicago, who was a top economic adviser in the early years of the Obama presidency. Goolsbee said there were two schools of thought about how to proceed. \"Doing something on the order of magnitude of the problem, which everyone understood is going to be a collection of a whole bunch of things and you're going to have a hard time explaining it,\" Goolsbee said was one option. Or, he said, others argued, \" 'Couldn't we just pick one thing and just do that one thing?' And that would be really easy to explain.\" The economy was hemorrhaging jobs, and Obama's economic team was afraid the country was on the brink of another Great Depression. The president chose to go big. Article continues after sponsorship Michelle Obama's Emotional Farewell: 'The Power Of Hope' Has 'Allowed Us To Rise' Obama came into the White House eight years ago, hailed as the \"Great Communicator\" because of his lofty speeches, but as he leaves office \u2014 and delivers a farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago \u2014 by his own admission, Obama hasn't always been so adept at communicating his policies and achievements. He struggled to make the sell on the Recovery Act (known as the stimulus), the auto bailout and the Affordable Care Act. The man who will succeed him has chosen a decidedly different path. President-elect Donald Trump has on multiple occasions hyped up announcements by companies that they will add a few thousand or even fewer jobs, declaring victory and getting lots of attention for relatively small wins, as compared to the size of the U.S. economy. Obama has overseen 75 straight months of job growth. Employers added millions of jobs during the course of his presidency, but Obama hasn't been able to capitalize on that politically as well as his allies would have hoped. Biden To Democrats Objecting To Electoral College Results: 'It Is Over' Obama signed the Recovery Act in February 2009. And, in the speech he made that day, the challenges of explaining the behemoth $780 billion package were clear. \"Today does mark the beginning of the end,\" Obama said, \"the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs.\" He talked about the millions of jobs it would \"save or create,\" a metric so squishy it proved hard for Obama to claim credit for it later and made it easy for opponents to criticize the stimulus as a failure. He spent most of the speech talking about \"investments.\" \"Rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America,\" Obama said in what was a long list of projects. \"Upgrading mass transit.\" But Frank Luntz, who has advised Republicans on messaging, said in an interview with NPR, the word \"investment\" can sound, for some, like code for big-government spending. On Intelligence And Russian Hacking, Are Trump And His Team Missing The Point? \"There was real hostility early on,\" Luntz said, \"a feeling that it's just an expansion of Washington and nobody was going to benefit and everyone was going to get stuck with the tab.\" Obama's team overestimated Americans' appetite for stimulus spending, Luntz argued. Republicans in Congress, who never supported the Recovery Act, repeatedly derided it as a \"failed trillion-dollar stimulus.\" In reality, a big chunk of it went to tax cuts \u2014 and it helped pull the country out of the biggest recession since the Great Depression. In Obama's bill-signing speech, the mention of those tax cuts came near the end. \"About a third of this package comes in the forms of tax cuts \u2014 by the way, the most progressive in our history,\" said Obama to applause, arguing it would not only spur job creation, but put \"money in the pockets of 95 percent of hard-working families in America.\" Working 3 Jobs In A Time Of Recovery The way the tax cuts were distributed also limited any public relations benefit. The money just appeared in people's paychecks as a smaller payroll tax deduction. \"Nobody realized, nobody understood and, so, nobody celebrated it,\" Luntz said. \"There's a simple rule in politics: if you don't talk about it, no one knows you did it, and you get no credit for it. And that was the problem with the tax-cut component of Obama's stimulus package.\" The tax cut was carefully designed by the Obama administration to target low- and middle-income Americans. But it ultimately had little traction with the public \u2014 or with Republicans whom it was intended to help sway. \"At one point in the first year,\" Goolsbee said, remembering a moment of great frustration, \"there's a poll that comes out in which something like 60 percent of the country said that they were sick of the tax increases that had come from the stimulus, when, in fact, 95 percent had gone down.\" Goolsbee said that is when he began to realize that reality was relative \u2014 something that has truly taken hold in American politics now. \"And at that point, you know the president was basically asking the economic team, 'What is wrong with you people?' and I just felt like punching myself,\" said Goolsbee with a laugh. Economists widely view the stimulus as having helped the economy avoid disaster. But politically, Obama got none of the credit for the tax cuts and a whole lot of grief for the spending. This was a pattern that would repeat itself throughout his presidency. As Trump prepares to enter the White House, his communications strategy is one of mass saturation, including rapid-fire tweets on multiple topics. Will that work out better than Obama's cool focus on facts and figures when trying to persuade the public? Or as he works to repeal some of Obama's policy achievements, will he have to adopt a different tactic to sell his proposals? ",
