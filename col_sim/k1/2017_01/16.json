Video provided by AFP Newslook Attorney General Loretta Lynch speaks at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Jan. 15, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. (Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) BIRMINGHAM, Ala.\u2014 The explosions of violence that have marked a broken trust between U.S. law enforcement and communities of color across the country\u00a0echo the painful clashes that marked the early struggles of the American civil rights movement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in an interview with USA TODAY Sunday. \u201cI really think the world is watching how we deal with these issues,\u2019\u2019 Lynch said in the wide-ranging interview here where she had traveled to commemorate Martin Luther King weekend events. Lynch is preparing to leave office following a tumultuous 20-month tenure, also punctuated by a string of deadly mass shootings, a disputed investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and ongoing concerns about the extent of Russia's interference in the U.S. elections. But her legacy will likely be\u00a0defined by the Justice Department\u2019s aggressive oversight of more than two dozen police agencies across the country. Lynch said technology, specifically the speed of digital media and video-enabled smart phones, accelerated the recent scrutiny of police operations in ways that many had not anticipated.\u00a0\"Policing became front and center, because technology put it front and center,\u2019\u2019 Lynch said. In much of the country where encounters between police and the public have not been in the forefront, \"it's been a real eye opener.\" \"We have broadened the debate and engaged on the issues in a more meaningful and real way.\" The \"incredibly violent and fatal (past) year for law enforcement, Lynch said, referring to the ambush killings of five Dallas officers and three others in Baton Rouge, also highlighted the current threat to law enforcement.\u00a0\"Everyone just wants to get home safe,\" she said. Of this weekend's feud between President-elect Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who said he would not attend the inauguration and questioned the legitimacy of the election, Lynch chose her words carefully.\u00a0Describing Lewis as \"a piece of living history,\" \u00a0Lynch said that the Georgia congressman is \"entitled to his views.\" \"He has earned the right to speak for himself,\" she said. On the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Attorney General Loretta Lynch speaks at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. \u00a0(Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) Later, she spoke from the sanctuary of the 16th Street Baptist Church, a \u00a0monument to the early civil rights movement where four young black girls were killed in a bombing carried by white supremacists in 1963. Lynch offered\u00a0a counterpoint to the divisive rhetoric of the recently-ended political campaigns that she said threaten the very gains made by King and the movements other foot soldiers. \u201cI know that we are in difficult days now,\u2019\u2019 Lynch told a packed congregation. \u201cMany worry that Dr. King\u2019s dream \u2014\u00a0and all that has flowed from it \u2014\u00a0is at risk like never before. I have seen the disconnect between the forces of our government and the communities we serve; I have seen the concerns that the voting booth will be moved out of reach, that our hearts will close along with our borders, that a prayer in a different tongue or posture will place one at risk. \u201cI have seen the fear that once again we will let a distinction without a difference govern our view of our fellow Americans, rather than what is in their hearts,\u2019\u2019 the attorney general said. \u201cAnd I have seen the fear that, with the turn of the electoral wheel, so many of us will be seen as children of a lesser God. \u00a0I have seen all that.\u2019\u2019 Without uttering a name, the attorney general\u2019s words tracked the most severe anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment to those expressed by incoming Republican administration.\u00a0Despite those fears, Lynch said she was boosted by the resolve of \u201cthe men and women of goodwill who love this country, who believe in its promise and who are working to fulfill its founding creed.\u2019\u2019 \u201cAnd if it comes to pass that we do enter a period of darkness, let us remember \u2014\u00a0that is when dreams are best made. \u00a0So let us see \u2014\u00a0what shall become of Dr. King\u2019s dream? \u00a0The Lord has already wrought a miracle by bringing us this far.\u2019\u2019 The venue for Lynch\u2019s final speech as attorney general was\u00a0steeped in symbolism.

    "text": "What Michelle Obama Wore and Why It Mattered By VANESSA FRIEDMAN Credit It began with Jay Leno. It began, to be more specific, in October 2008, when Mr. Leno, the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d at the time, turned to his guest, Michelle Obama , the wife of the Democratic nominee for president, and said \u2014 with glee, with gotcha expectation, because it had just been revealed that the campaign clothes budget for Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, was $150,000 \u2014 \u201cI want to ask you about your wardrobe. I\u2019m guessing about 60 grand? Sixty, 70 thousand for that outfit?\u201d \u201c J. Crew ,\u201d Mrs. Obama said of her silk blouse, gold skirt and cardigan fastened with a big rhinestone brooch. \u201cLadies, we know J. Crew. You can get some good stuff online!\u201d And thus was an eight-year obsession born. Not to mention a new approach to the story of dress and power. When Mrs. Obama understood the impact of that early answer \u2014 when she saw the public response to her outfit (which had been chosen specifically as a riposte to the Palin news) \u2014 it set in motion a strategic rethink about the use of clothes that not only helped define her tenure as first lady, but also started a conversation that went far beyond the label or look that she wore and that is only now, maybe, reaching its end. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though amid discussion of legacy and historical change fashion may seem the least of the matter, consider the number of words devoted to what both the first lady and President Obama wore since the original campaign began. Consider that for five and a half years there was a blog chronicling Mrs. Obama\u2019s wardrobe choices, arguably the first devoted to the clothes of a political figure, and that when Mr. Obama wore a tan suit to a news conference it practically broke the internet (ditto when he eschewed a tie ). Consider that Mrs. Obama\u2019s effect on fashion brands was the subject of a study by a New York University professor in the Harvard Business Review entitled \u201cHow This First Lady Moves Markets.\u201d Consider all that, and there is simply no ignoring the fact that during these two terms, clothing played a role unlike any it had ever played before in a presidential administration. Photo On Mrs. Obama\u2019s first visit to London, in April 2009, she wore a J. Crew cardigan. Here, with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, visiting the Maggie\u2019s Cancer Caring Centre. Credit Pool photo by Leon Neal A noncomprehensive litany of some of the designers whose clothes the first lady wore during her husband\u2019s two terms in office includes: Carolina Herrera, Narciso Rodriguez, Michael Kors, Maria Cornejo, Thom Browne, Isabel Toledo, Jason Wu, Prabal Gurung, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Marchesa, Tom Ford, Vera Wang, Tadashi Shoji, Cushnie et Ochs, Tory Burch, Naeem Khan, Brandon Maxwell, Rodarte, Bibhu Mohapatra, Zac Posen, Barbara Tfank, Alexander Wang, Rag & Bone, Joseph Altuzarra, Tracy Reese, Monique Lhuillier, Thakoon, Christian Siriano, Calvin Klein, Sophie Theallet, Reed Krakoff, Diane von Furstenberg, Derek Lam, Proenza Schouler and Alice & Olivia. Also Talbots. And Target. And Ann Taylor. Sheesh. Plus, of course: Gucci, Versace, Givenchy, Ala\u00efa, Junya Watanabe, Christopher Kane, Roksanda, Moschino, Lanvin (those controversial expensive sneakers), Dries Van Noten, Alexander McQueen, Duro Olowu, Lanvin and Kenzo. To name a few. Photo Wearing a Gucci gown to honor recipients of the 2016 Kennedy Center Honors on Dec. 4, 2016. Credit Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press It is, by any measure, an unprecedented list. The twin conditions of the historic nature of this presidency and the fact it occurred alongside the rise of social media, which turned every public second into a shareable, comment-worthy moment, combined to create a new reality where every appearance mattered. Not everyone listened to all of the speeches or read the analysis or considered the context. But everyone paused for a moment to assess the visual. And a couple who had spent their entire lives being scrutinized as pioneers understood what that meant, and instead of bridling at it, leveraged it. If you know everyone is going to see what you wear and judge it, then what you wear becomes fraught with meaning. Certainly Mrs. Obama\u2019s significance as a contemporary role model goes far beyond her image, but no one understood the role of fashion, and the potential uses of that, better than the first lady. \u201cShe realized very early on that everything she did had ramifications,\u201d said Thom Browne, who made the tailored coat and dress Mrs. Obama wore for the inaugural parade in 2013, as well as a dress she wore to the 2012 Democratic National Convention and also during the final debate that year. And she understood, he went on, \u201cthat people did not just want to know how she looked, but what she was about,\u201d and that she could plant subliminal cues to the latter with her clothes. Photo Mrs. Obama wearing a Thom Browne tailored coat and dress at the inaugural parade in 2013. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Change was the promise, and change was the look \u2014 far beyond the amount of upper arm on display, or the riot of color and prints. Or the cardigans. Just because something appears trivial does not mean it is any less powerful as a means of persuasion and outreach. In some ways its very triviality \u2014 the fact that everyone could talk about it, dissect it, imitate it \u2014 makes fashion the most potentially viral item in the subliminal political toolbox. Talking heads complained early on in the second term about Mrs. Obama\u2019s allowing the clothes conversation to dominate the substance conversation, but in fact she made the two inextricable. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There have been a lot of words since the 2016 election devoted to how Mrs. Obama loved fashion and fashion loved her in return, and that is true; to listen to designers who have dressed her is to hear a chorus of \u201cit was the privilege of my career.\u201d That the first lady, a Princeton-and-Harvard-educated lawyer and hospital power player, was publicly able to enjoy clothes allowed a swath of smart women to stop being so neurotic about dress (as she said to Vogue in her third cover story, the most of any first lady, one of the factors in choosing a garment always has to be, \u201cIs it cute?\u201d). But her real contribution went far beyond giving women a license to like clothes and use them to celebrate their own strength and femininity. Just as, despite the attention paid to the study on how much the first lady was worth to a brand \u2014 \u201cI have been publishing for 25 years,\u201d said David Yermack, the author of the study and a professor of finance at the N.Y.U. Stern School of Business, \u201cand nothing has compared to the interest in this\u201d \u2014 it wasn\u2019t ultimately about revenue generation. Indeed, despite Mrs. Obama\u2019s patronage, a number of labels she wore have struggled financially, including J. Crew ; Maria Pinto , which closed; and Bibhu Mohapatra, which filed for bankruptcy last week. Rather, like first ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy to Nancy Reagan, Mrs. Obama understood that fashion was a means to create an identity for an administration. But unlike any other first lady, instead of seeing it as part of a uniform to which she had to conform, with the attendant rules and strictures that implies, she saw it as a way to frame her own independence and points of difference, add to her portfolio and amplify her husband\u2019s agenda. \u201cOur glorious diversity \u2014 our diversities of faiths and colors and creeds \u2014 that is not a threat to who we are; it makes us who we are,\u201d she said during her final speech, and the proof was, literally, on her back. While most first ladies turned to a small number of trusted designers to help them create their look (Oleg Cassini with Mrs. Kennedy; Adolfo and James Galanos with Mrs. Reagan; Oscar de la Renta with Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush) Mrs. Obama seemed to work with them all. That is not a situation that, as any woman would know, happens by accident. We all tend to gravitate toward certain designers in part because of sheer laziness: We know what suits us, what we like, and so we go there first. To have been so, well, evenhanded in her choices could have happened only with careful calculation. \u201cI am not sure people really realized the extent of what she was doing,\u201d said Tracy Reese, whose custom-made pink and gold silk dress, worn by Mrs. Obama for her speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, became her best-selling dress when remade for sale, and whose black dress with big red poppies, worn by the first lady for the 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on Washington, is now on display at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. \u201cIt was really about us all.\u201d Photo On Sept. 4, 2012, at the Democratic National Convention, the first lady wore a custom-made pink and gold silk dress by Tracey Reese. Credit Alex Wong/Getty Images Especially because Mrs. Obama not only wore their clothes, she also took their business seriously, framing fashion as a credible, covetable job choice during her education initiatives. She put fashion on a par with the movies by hosting a Fashion Education workshop at the White House, just as she had held a Careers in Film Symposium. She invited students to witness Jason Wu donating his first inaugural gown to the Smithsonian, and designers were occasionally included on the guest list for state dinners alongside officials, artists and executives \u2014 though no designer ever attended twice. \u201cShe came in at a time when the economy was particularly tough and really shone a light on fashion in the broadest sense,\u201d said Narciso Rodriguez, whose dress she wore on the night in 2008 that ushered in the Obama era, and recently at the National School Counselor of the Year event when she gave her last speech as first lady. If you think that was an accident, there\u2019s a bridge I can sell you \u2014 just as the fact she wore Jason Wu to her husband\u2019s farewell address in Chicago, a designer she also wore at both inaugural balls, was no coincidence. It was closure. Photo On Jan. 20, 2009, she wore a one-shouldered white gown by designer Jason Wu at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball in Washington. Credit Alex Brandon/Associated Press Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress choices were often labeled \u201c sartorial diplomacy \u201d and \u201cdemocratic,\u201d and they were that; she made something of an art out of pairing designers with countries during state dinners or trips, wearing, for example, Mr. Khan, an Indian-American designer, to the India state dinner, and Mr. Ford, an American designer then based in London, when she dined with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. Especially in her husband\u2019s second term, Mrs. Obama used her leverage and visibility not only to raise the profile of a host of local designers (the biggest struggle for a young designer, Mr. Wu said, is attention; she solved that), but also as argument against isolationism and in support of allies across the world. It was not happenstance that she wore a Gucci gown to the Kennedy Center Honors the same day Italy went to the polls to vote on a referendum widely viewed as a verdict on Matteo Renzi, the country\u2019s now former reformist prime minister.

John Lewis ' criticism of Trump was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and called on President Obama to \u201cstep up\u201d by telling Democrats to accept the election loss and stop questioning \"the legitimacy of the next United States president.\" In an interview on \u201cThis Week,\u201d ABC News' George Stephanopoulos asked Priebus if the president-elect was right to pick a fight this weekend over remarks by Congressman and civil rights icon Lewis. \u201cJohn Lewis stood up in an interview and said that Donald Trump was not a 'legitimate president,'\" Priebus said, referring to an NBC interview on Friday. \"That\u2019s insanity, and it\u2019s wrong.\u201d \"We need folks like John Lewis and others who I think have been champions of voter rights to actually recognize the fact that Donald Trump was duly elected. He's going to put his hand on the Bible in five days,\" Priebus said. \"I think it\u2019s incredibly disappointing \u2013- and I think it\u2019s irresponsible -- for people like [Lewis] to question the legitimacy of the next United States president,\u201d he added. \u201cI think putting the United States down across the world is not something a responsible person does.\" The incoming White House chief of staff added that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said \u201cmany, many times\u201d there\u2019s no evidence that Russia's interference in the presidential election affected the outcome. Clapper has said that the intelligence community can't gauge how voters' choices in the election might have been affected by the disclosure of private information stolen by hackers. \"President Obama should step up,\u201d Priebus said. \"We've had a great relationship with the White House, George ... I think the administration can do a lot of good by telling folks that are on the Republican side of the aisle, 'Look, we may have lost the election on the Democratic side, but it's time to come together.'\" 0 Shares ",

By Janell Ross and Vanessa Williams January 15 at 7:30 PM Follow @janellross Follow @wapovanessa The eruption of hostilities between President-elect Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, may be recorded as just one more example of what has become standard Twitter retaliation for Trump. But coming on the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend, it also reignited the passions around Trump\u2019s difficult history with African Americans, the group of voters from whom he might be most alienated as he prepares to move into the White House this week. In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d on Friday, Lewis said he did not consider Trump to be \u201ca legitimate president\u201d because of allegations that \u00adhigh-level Russian operatives interfered in the election on Trump\u2019s behalf. Trump lobbed back with a tweet in the early hours Saturday that disparaged both the congressman and his district, which includes some of Atlanta\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201c(Not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump continued his taunts in another tweet Saturday evening, saying that Lewis should \u201cfinally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d (Claritza Jimenez,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s attack on Lewis drew\u00a0widespread condemnation\u00a0across party lines, particularly given Lewis\u2019s role in the fight for voting rights for African Americans. \u201cJohn Lewis is beyond a doubt the conscience of the country, and that\u2019s why his people [constituents] send him to Congress,\u201d said Kwame Lillard, an activist who helped to organize the civil-rights-era Freedom Rides and has known Lewis for more than 60 years. Lewis also was one of the leaders of the legendary Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march in 1965, in which Alabama state troopers attacked marchers, leaving many of them, including Lewis, badly injured. The march entered the American lexicon as \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d and the stark images of the police beatings helped build support for the civil rights movement. Shamed Dogan, a Republican member of Missouri\u2019s House of Representatives, said that the state\u2019s new governor, Eric Greitens (R), attended the Missouri Legislative Black Caucus\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. celebration two days after taking office. \u201cI would like to see Donald Trump take the same approach to the Congressional Black Caucus and find common ground with them instead of feuding with heroes like Congressman Lewis,\u201d Dogan said. Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric about Hispanics, Muslims and women was one of the hallmarks of his campaign, and while he emerged from the election with a solid majority of electoral college votes, he trailed Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million popular votes. In national exit polling , 91 percent of black voters had an unfavorable view of Trump, while 83 percent regarded Clinton favorably. In their vote preference, the exit polling found that black voters favored Clinton over Trump by a margin of 89 percent to 8 percent. Since Election Day, Trump has said that, in an effort to bring the country together, he would reach out to voters who did not support him. During the transition, Trump has been frequently photographed at his New York headquarters with black celebrities, including the rapper Kanye West, retired football great Ray Lewis and boxing promoter Don King. On Friday, he was visited by Steve Harvey, a comedian, game-show host and dating-advice guru. Harvey supported Clinton and had been critical of Trump during the campaign, but after their meeting he said the president-elect was \u201ccongenial and sincere.\u201d The attack on John Lewis, however, underscores Trump\u2019s tense relationship with black voters and seemed to echo some of his past confrontations with African Americans. Trump started his presidential campaign with huge disadvantages among African Americans, in part because of his years-long questioning of whether President Obama was born in the United States. Trump also drew criticism for taking out a full-page ad in New York newspapers in 1989 urging the death penalty for five black and Hispanic teenagers accused of raping a woman in Central Park. Even after the young men were exonerated, Trump criticized the city for awarding them damages for the years they had spent in prison and continued to argue that they were \u201cguilty of something.\u201d In the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump began appealing to black voters to give him a chance. Speaking at rallies, to overwhelmingly white audiences, Trump described black people as living \u201cin hell,\u201d stuck in crumbling, crime-ridden neighborhoods and failing schools. \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he asked. For some people, Trump\u2019s attack on Lewis \u2014 as well as his inaccurate description of Atlanta, a longtime haven for middle- and upper-middle-class African Americans \u2014 brought it all back. Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, said that if Trump was serious about reaching out to the black community, he would have to take responsibility for a campaign whose tone was \u201cdivisive at best, seriously offensive at worst\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d with reports of an increase in racist behavior and actions directed at minorities by some whites. She said he will have to meet with and apologize to the civil rights community and young activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThe burden of proof is on you. It\u2019s not on everybody else to warm up to you because you\u2019re the president,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cBecause the rhetoric came out of his mouth, the burden of proof is on him to show that he\u2019s changed, he\u2019s sensitive and he cares about those issues.\u201d D.L. Hughley, a comedian and political commentator, put it more bluntly in a Facebook video in which he blasted Trump for \u201chaving a comedian and a rapper and a football player out to talk about the concerns of the community.\u201d \u201cIf Donald Trump cared about black people, he wouldn\u2019t have denigrated the president with those claims of birtherism ,\u201d he said. Hughley, who in the late 1990s toured with Harvey as part of the popular \u201cKings of Comedy,\u201d said Trump was more comfortable with black entertainers. \u201cYou\u2019d rather see us run the football than run the country.\u201d So far Trump has nominated only one African American for a Cabinet position: retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson, as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Harvey told reporters that Trump asked him to work with Carson on inner-city issues. Some political observers say Carson\u2019s appointment is an indication that Trump is not serious about improving the lives of people in struggling communities. Michael Eric Dyson, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said that in touting Carson and Harvey as his urban policy team, Trump is practicing \u201caffirmative action in the worst sense of that term.\u201d \u201cSteve Harvey is a talented comedian but he is not a politician, a policy maker. He nor Carson have any expertise in the issues they will oversee,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cThis is really nothing more than an attempted end run around serious engagement and an example of the kind of visionary bankruptcy of President-elect Trump.\u201d Scott Clement contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Chicago Police Department) \u00a0 Eugene Ciardullo, 51, a Chicago police officer, was charged with criminal sexual assault Jan. 14, 2017. (Chicago Police Department) \u00a0 Tony Briscoe Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A Chicago police officer has been charged with felony criminal sexual assault, according to police and Cook County state's attorney officials. Officer Eugene Ciardullo, 51, was arrested by fellow officers at his home Saturday afternoon, department spokesman Officer Jose Estrada said. Ciardullo was booked into Cook County Jail on Sunday, according to online records. Ciardullo is expected to appear in Cook County bond court Sunday afternoon. Ciardullo, of the Scottsdale neighborhood, is assigned to the department's Deering District on the South Side, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Police officials said the victim identified Ciardullo as the person who had a \"sexual relationship\" with her starting when she was 17 years old. The Tribune is not publishing additional details about the victim to avoid identifying her. The felony charge against Ciardullo, a 21-year veteran of the force, was approved Saturday. The internal affairs division is also investigating the case, Guglielmi said, and will present its findings to the Chicago Police Board to determine what discipline should be ordered. \"The Chicago Police Department is currently also investigating this incident internally and administratively,\" Guglielmi said in a statement. \"We remain committed to the highest levels of accountability for our officers and members and will not tolerate any activity or actions that undermine the integrity of the hard working men and women of our Department.\" Ciardullo has been a Chicago police officer since August 1995, according to city records. Throughout his career with the Police Department, Ciardullo has amassed about 40 complaints on allegations ranging from minor personnel violations to excessive force but has only been found to have committed wrongdoing on two occasions. He was given a 10-day suspension in 2001 stemming from an excessive force allegation and a two-day suspension in 2008 for a violation related to \"weapon/ammunition/uniform deviation,\" the records show. It's unclear in the records if Ciardullo served those suspensions or fought the penalties. Details of the actual allegations within those complaints were not available. Check back for more details.

    "text": "Paul previews ObamaCare replacement plan focusing on lower cost policies Published               January 15, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on Sunday previewed his ObamaCare replacement plan -- in an apparent effort to take the lead in the growing GOP effort to simultaneously repeal and replace the 2010 health care law. Paul, who was a 2016 presidential candidate, said the bill that he and other congressional Republicans have crafted attempts to \u201cinsure the most amount of people, give access to the most amount of people, at the least amount of cost.\" Paul, a physician, has emerged in recent weeks as a leader in the repeal-replace effort, amid Republican concerns that fulfilling campaign vows to dismantle ObamaCare at the start of the 115th Congress could leave tens of millions of Americans uninsured. Incoming Republican President Donald Trump has expressed similar concerns, despite campaigning on a winning repeal-replace agenda. Paul tweeted on Jan. 6: \"I just spoke to (Trump) and he fully supports my plan to replace ObamaCare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now.\" The Republican-led Congress has already taken votes toward repealing ObamaCare under a process known as budget reconciliation, which effectively keeps Democrats from blocking the effort and requires only a simple majority for passage. Among the other Senate Republicans trying slow the repeal process, to synch with a replacement plan, are Susan Collins, Maine; Bob Corker, Tennessee; Rob Portman, Ohio; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Paul suggested Sunday that the replacement plan will include more low-cost insurance plans \"One of the key reforms that we will do is, we're going to legalize the sale of inexpensive insurance,\" he told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\" \u201cThat means getting rid of the ObamaCare mandates on what you can buy.\u201d Paul last week announced some of the early details of the plan on Fox News' \"Special Report\" with Bret Baier. Paul said his plan borrows from previous GOP replacement plans and appears to have consensus among congressional Republicans. \"The ideas that we've taken for the replacement bill come from other Republicans' bills,\" he told Fox.\u00a0 Paul said Sunday the plan also will include health saving accounts and tax credits to help customers save money. He also suggested the plan will allow people and small businesses to create their own markets. \"There's no reason why (a business owner) with four employees shouldn't be able to join with hundreds and hundreds of other businesses that are small to become a large entity to get leverage to bring your prices down,\" Paul said. However, he acknowledged rolling back Medicaid expansion as part of the ObamaCare repeal remains a \u201cbig question.\u201d Many Americans got coverage under Medicare expansion in states. On the issue of Rex Tillerson\u2019s effort to become the next secretary of state, Paul said he\u2019ll support the former ExxonMobil CEO\u2019s bid. \"Yes, I will vote for Rex Tillerson,\" said Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holding the confirmation hearings. \u201cI was very impressed.\" Advertisement ",

In a joint interview published Sunday in The Times of London and Germany's Bild , Trump said that he planned to make Britain's departure from the European Union \"a great thing\" and that he would meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May shortly after he is sworn in Friday. \"We're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly,\" he told the papers, adding: \"I love the UK.\" Related: Brexit, What Brexit? Londoners Upbeat Despite Uncertainty The comments come as Britain wrestles with an uncertain future under Brexit, the referendum under which it voted to leave the European Union. Since the vote June 23, the country has seen its currency plummet and its AAA credit rating wiped out. It also faces the prospect of tariffs and trade restrictions from the EU, The Times reported \u2014 a possibility that made Trump's comments that much more significant, because a possible trade deal with the United States could be a powerful negotiating tool. In the interview, Trump attributed Brexit to an influx of refugees, saying: \"If they [EU countries] hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it .. . entails, I think that you wouldn't have a Brexit,\" he said. \"I think people want ... their own identity, so if you ask me ...

Steve Kroft: What else does he make besides tuna fish? Malia Obama: Chili, and that\u2019s it. His wife was a working mom, a hospital executive and major breadwinner in the family. She wasn\u2019t crazy about her husband being in politics. Steve Kroft: Has it put strains on the marriage from time to time? Michelle Obama: Oh, no. Sen. Obama: Absolutely, it has. Steve Kroft: But you\u2019d let him go ahead and do this? Michelle Obama: I think if I weren\u2019t married to him, I\u2019d want him to be in there. So I don\u2019t want to stand in the way of that because we have to work out a few things. We\u2019ve had those arguments and\u2026 Sen. Obama: And I\u2019ve lost them all. 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft and President Barack Obama CBS News It all seems like a long time ago. Steve Kroft: So what\u2019s the difference between this guy and the guy you are now? How much smarter are you than this guy standing on the street corner? President Barack Obama: Well, let\u2019s see. Obviously I\u2019m grayer, a few more wrinkles. You know I\u2019ll be honest with you, Steve. One of the things I\u2019m proud about is that I think my basic character and outlook actually have not changed much. And people who are closest to me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who\u2019s leaving. And the reason I take pride for that is one of the things you worry about when you\u2019re in the bubble, and there\u2019s all this pomp and circumstance and hail to the chief is, do you lose touch with what you thought was important and what brought you here? And I\u2019m proud that I don\u2019t think I have lost touch. Steve Kroft: If you had to write a brief description of this job beginning with wanted-- how would you describe the position? And what are the tasks? And what skills do you think you need? President Barack Obama: Thick skin helps. Steve Kroft: Thick skin, stamina. \u201cPeople who are closest to  me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who\u2019s  leaving.\u201d President Obama President Barack Obama: Stamina. There is a greater physical element to this job than you would think, just being able to grind it out. And I think your ability to not just mentally and emotionally, but physically be able to say, \u201cWe got this. We\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d Steve Kroft: Did you learn the executive stuff on the job? Because when we first talked, I must have asked you 100 times. Your only executive experience was running the Harvard Law Review and running your own campaign. Did you have to learn a lot of this on the job? President Barack Obama and 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News President Barack Obama: The campaign was a more significant training ground than I think people give it credit for. By the time I got here, I think I had a pretty good sense of what was required. But the circumstances in which I came in were different than most executives, right? The enterprise was in the midst of a major crisis. And so, those first six months were a fire drill. Beside the two wars he inherited in Iraq and Afghanistan, and promised to end, a financial crisis at home had pushed the United States to the brink of another Great Depression. When we spoke with the new president in March of 2009 , the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month, the government was throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at failing banks, and the auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Politically pummeled from all sides, Obama did his best to keep a sense of humor. President Obama: I just want to say that the only thing less popular than putting money into banks is putting money into the auto industry. So-- Steve Kroft: But 18 percent are in favor, 76 percent against. President Obama: It\u2019s not a high number. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re sitting here and you\u2019re-- you are laughing about some of these problems. Are people going to look at this and say, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s sitting there just making jokes about money--\u201d How do you deal with that? President Obama: No, no, no. Steve Kroft: I mean, wha-- explain the-- the-- the-- President Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: The mood in your laughter. President Obama: Yeah, I mean, there\u2019s gotta be-- Steve Kroft: Are you punch-drunk? President Obama: No, no, there\u2019s gotta be a little gallows humor to get you through the day. President Barack Obama participates in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft in the State Dining Room of the White House, Jan. 9, 2017. Chuck Kennedy, The White House A political candidacy built around hope and change and compromise would eventually become a presidency of crisis and confrontation. Steve Kroft: Is there anything that surprised you about this job? President Barack Obama: I was surprised and continue to be surprised by the severity of partisanship in this town. And I think that I\u2019d been warned about it. You\u2019ll remember, in the campaign back in 2007, 2008, people would say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s being na\u00efve. He thinks that there\u2019s no red states and blue states. And wait \u2018til he gets here.\u201d And I will confess that, I didn\u2019t fully appreciate the ways in which individual senators or members of Congress now are pushed to the extremes by their voter bases. I did not expect, particularly in the midst of crisis, just how severe that partisanship would be. Steve Kroft: You came into this office trying to unify the country. You said that many times during the campaign. You wanted to bring people together. You wanted to change Washington. You talked about transformative change. And you became the focal point for some of the division. \u201cI\u2019m the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever.\u201d President Obama President Barack Obama: I became a lightning rod for some partisan battles. I could not be prouder of the track record we\u2019ve put together. By almost every measure, the country is significantly better off than when I came in. If you can look back and say, \u201cThe economy\u2019s better. Our security\u2019s better. The environment\u2019s better. Our kids\u2019 education is better,\u201d if you can say that you\u2019ve made things better, then considering all the challenges out there, you should feel good. But I\u2019m the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever. Steve Kroft: You didn\u2019t change Washington. President Barack Obama: You know, I changed those things that were in direct-- my direct control. I mean, I-- look, I\u2019m proud of the fact that, with two weeks to go, we\u2019re probably the first administration in modern history that hasn\u2019t had a major scandal in the White House. In that sense, we changed some things. I would\u2019ve liked to have gotten that one last Supreme Court justice in there. I\u2019d like the Supreme Court to take a look at-- Steve Kroft: You couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. President Barack Obama participates in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft in the Oval Office of the White House, Jan. 9, 2017. Pete Souza, The White House President Barack Obama: But we couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. Trying to get the other side of the aisle to work with us on issues, in some cases, that they professed, originally, an interest in, and saying to them, \u201cHold on a second. You guys used to think this was a good idea. Now, just because I\u2019m supporting it, you can\u2019t change your mind.\u201d But they did. And what that did, I think, made me appreciate. And I\u2019ve said this before. But it\u2019s worth repeating. Because this is on me. Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns. But there were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren\u2019t able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us. And there were times during my presidency where I lost the PR battle. And losing the PR battles, particularly about healthcare, translated into losing his Democratic majorities in Congress, beginning with a Republican landslide in the midterm election of 2010 . Steve Kroft: There is this feeling in-- particularly among people who are among your hardened supporters\u2014 President Obama: Right. Steve Kroft: --who feel a little disappointed that they think that you\u2019ve lost your mojo. That you\u2019ve lost your ability, that touch you had during the campaign to inspire\u2014 President Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: -- and lead that-- you know, everybody in Washington writes about the sort of aloofness that you have and I`m sure that drives you crazy. That you\u2019ve let other people define you, that you haven`t sold your successes well enough? President Obama: I think it`s a fair argument, you know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know leadership isn\u2019t just legislation, that it\u2019s a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence, and bringing them together and setting a tone. For the next six years, there would be legislative gridlock, and by 2016, the people who had looked to Obama for change were looking somewhere else. Steve Kroft: Donald Trump, if you take away the particulars, was elected to the office , basically, on the same program that you were, of change. He wants to change Washington. President Barack Obama: Well, I mean that\u2019s a lot of particulars you\u2019re taking away. Fair enough. Steve Kroft: But do you think-- President Barack Obama: He was a change candidate. Steve Kroft: Do you think anybody can change Washington? President Barack Obama: I think the American people can change Washington. But I think that it is not going to change, because somebody from on high directs that change. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, are motivated by all kinds of issues. They\u2019re sincerely interested in the economy, in terrorism, in social issues. But the one overriding thing they\u2019re interested in is getting reelected. And if they think that it\u2019s harder for them to get reelected by cooperating with each other, then they won\u2019t cooperate. Steve Kroft: A lot of people think the system is broken, that the system, the political system is broken. That seemed to be the message that you heard throughout this campaign. President Barack Obama: Well -- Steve Kroft: And you seem to be saying, in some ways, maybe it is broken. President Barack Obama and 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News President Barack Obama: In the first two years, when I had a strong majority in the House and the Senate, we were as productive as any administration has been since the \u201860s. I mean, we got a lot done. And so you can get a lot of stuff done through this system. But to sustain a governing majority, that requires an ability for Republicans and Democrats to find some common ground. And right now, the structure of the system is such where it makes it really hard for people to work together. And we mentioned, an example earlier, the Supreme Court nominations. I mean, the fact that Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans, was able to just stop a nomination almost a year before the next election and really not pay a political price for it, that\u2019s a sign that the incentives for politicians in this town to be so sharply partisan have gotten so outta hand that we\u2019re weakening ourselves. Steve Kroft: How serious do you think this is? I mean, how stable do you think that the political system, the democratic system, is? President Barack Obama: Look, I think it\u2019s stable, because the framers, in their wisdom, designed the system so that power\u2019s pretty disbursed. You know, we have states. And we have cities. And we have counties. And we have the private sector. And-- and so the country still works even when Washington\u2019s dysfunctional. But the problem is that, over time, big pieces of business that have to get done without leadership from Washington, don\u2019t get done. Steve Kroft: I want to go back just briefly on this. But I think, look, this last election, you had a political system. Well, first of all the people elected somebody who went around saying that the system was rigged. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: You had two of the most unpopular presidential candidates selected by the two parties in history. Doesn\u2019t that say something\u2019s wrong, something serious is wrong? President Barack Obama: It indicates that there is a lot of cynicism out there. It indicates that the corrosive nature of everything from talk radio to fake news to negative advertising has made people lack confidence in a lot of our existing institutions. I think it indicates, at least on the Democratic side, that we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen our grassroots networks. In some ways, the Democratic Party hadn\u2019t constructed itself to get that message out to the places it needed to get to. The Tea Party I have huge disagreements with, obviously. But I give them credit for having activated themselves. And they made a difference in terms of moving the Republican Party, in terms of moving the country in a particular direction. It\u2019s a direction I disagreed with. But it showed that, in fact, you get involved, if your voice is heard it has an impact. Steve Kroft: Do you feel the same way about Donald Trump? President Barack Obama: Well I think that he clearly was able to tap into a lot of grievances. And he has a talent for making a connection with his supporters that overrode some of the traditional benchmarks of how you\u2019d run a campaign or conduct yourself as a presidential candidate. What will be interesting to see is how that plays out during the course of his presidency. We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and sound bites and some headline that comes over their phone. And I think that there\u2019s a power in that. There\u2019s also a danger, what generates a headline or stirs up a controversy and gets attention isn\u2019t the same as the process required to actually solve the problem. Steve Kroft: You said you don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to do when he governs, but we\u2019re in this transition period and one of the first things that he has done in this transition period is to pick a fight with the intelligence agencies. Do you think that that\u2019s a smart move? President Barack Obama CBS News President Barack Obama: You\u2019re not going to be able to make good decisions without building some relationship of trust between yourself and that community. Steve Kroft: Do you see that happening? President Barack Obama: Not yet, but, you know, again, he hasn\u2019t gotten sworn into office yet. When we come back, President Obama talks about one of the strangest transitions in White House history -- and he acknowledges some mistakes. At the White House on Monday, crates and boxes lined the hallways and cluttered the East Room. Some carpets had been rolled up. Outside, there are bleachers on Pennsylvania Avenue and moving vans in the driveway \u2013 visual evidence that there\u2019s a transition underway. This ritual of democracy, this peaceful transfer of power can be awkward under the best of circumstances. And these are not the best of circumstances for either the outgoing or incoming president. Steve Kroft: You have to admit that this is one of the strangest transitions in history. President Barack Obama: It\u2019s unusual. I\u2019ll agree with that. Well, I-- Steve Kroft: I mean, he-- President Barack Obama: --and I suspect-- I suspect the president-elect would agree with that. Look-- Steve Kroft: No, I-- President Barack Obama: --he is an unconventional candidate. Steve Kroft: Right. President Barack Obama: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s run a campaign like his successfully in modern history, not that I can think of. And, as a consequence because he didn\u2019t have the supports of many of the establishment in his own party, because he ran sort of an improvisational campaign-- Steve Kroft: Can you run an improvisational presidency? President Barack Obama: I don\u2019t think so. And so now he\u2019s in the process of building up an organization. And well, we\u2019ll have to see how that works. And it\u2019ll be a test, I think, for him and the people that he\u2019s designated to be able to execute on his vision. \u201cFirst of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don\u2019t underestimate the guy, because he\u2019s going to be 45th president of the United States.\u201d President Obama\u00a0 Steve Kroft: Look, I think that the country deeply appreciates the fact that you have not spoken clearly, I think, probably what\u2019s on your mind in relation to the president-elect. But as you said earlier it\u2019s unusual. He seems to have spent a good deal of his time sending out tweets that, you know, that the United States must strengthen and expand its nuclear ability. That Meryl Streep is an overrated Hillary flunky. You\u2019re watching this like everybody else. I mean what\u2019s going on? President Barack Obama: You know, you\u2019re going to have to talk to him. But here\u2019s what I-- here\u2019s what I think. First of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don\u2019t underestimate the guy, because he\u2019s going to be 45th president of the United States. The one thing I\u2019ve said to him directly, and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country, is just make sure that, as we go forward certain norms, certain institutional traditions don\u2019t get eroded, because there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re in place. One thing both men have in common is a love of golf and a shared knowledge of the word \u201cmulligan,\u201d which means a do-over to replace a lousy shot. Steve Kroft: I mean you play golf. President Barack Obama: I do. Steve Kroft: Do you ever wish you had a mulligan? I mean in the eight years that you\u2019ve had, if-- if you had-- if you had three or four mulligans would you use \u2018em? President Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, there\u2019s no doubt that probably at least once a week, maybe once a day, I said, \u201cAh, I should have done that better.\u201d I bet at the end of this interview I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s-- that would have been a really good answer for that or this.\u201d I think we\u2019ve done the big stuff right. I think that there are some big, obvious fumbles-- Steve Kroft: Like? President Barack Obama: --or shanks if you are using the-- Steve Kroft: Right. President Barack Obama: --golf analogy. Well, Healthcare.gov is a good example. Steve Kroft: \u00a0Right. President Barack Obama: You know, if you know you got a controversial program, and you\u2019re setting up a really big, complicated website, website better work on the first day or first week or first month. The fact that it didn\u2019t obviously lost a little momentum. That was clearly a management failure. Critics of the administration would cite what they see as larger failures in the area of foreign policy particularly in the Middle East, which we grilled him about in an interview 15 months ago. Steve Kroft: There is a perception in the Middle East that the United States is in retreat, that we\u2019ve pulled our troops out of Iraq and ISIS has moved in and taken over much of that territory. The situation in Afghanistan is very precarious and the Taliban is on the march again. President Obama: I think it\u2019s fair to say, Steve, that if-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0It\u2019s -- Let me just finish the thought. President Obama: OK. Steve Kroft: \u00a0They say you\u2019re projecting weakness, not strength-- President Obama: You\u2019re-- you\u2019re-- you\u2019re-- you\u2019re saying \u201cthey\u201d-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0I\u2019m talking about-- President Obama: You\u2019re-- you\u2019re not-- you\u2019re not citing too many folks, but-- but-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0No, I\u2019ll cite folks if you want me to. President Obama: But here\u2019s-- Steve Kroft: I\u2019d say the Saudis, I\u2019d say the Israelis, I\u2019d say a lot of our friends in the Middle East. President Obama: I-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0I\u2019d say everybody-- President Obama: Steve-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0Everybody in your-- everybody in the Republican Party. You want me to keep going? President Obama: Yeah, if you are\u2014if you\u2019re citing the Republican Party, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is nothing I\u2019ve done right over the last seven and half years. But even former members of his administration criticized the president for talking tough and not following through. In 2012, Obama told the Syrian government that the use of chemical weapons would cross a red line\u2026 Obama: That, that\u2019s a red line for us. That could provoke us military involvement. When they were used, the president responded not with force, but diplomacy, raising questions about his credibility. Steve Kroft: \u00a0I want to go back to, like, 2012. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: I want to-- to two words. Red line. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: You didn\u2019t have to say that. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: And there have been reports that it wasn\u2019t in your speech. President Barack Obama: No, it wasn\u2019t. Steve Kroft: That you just sort of ad-libbed it. If you could pull \u2013 and it created \u2013 it created problems for you with the military people. Would you take those words back? You didn\u2019t have to say them. President Barack Obama: Yeah, look, if you\u2019re putting all the weight on that particular phrase, then in terms of how it was interpreted in Washington, I think you make a legitimate point. I\u2019ve got to tell you, though, I don\u2019t regret at all saying that if I saw Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons on his people that that would change my assessments in terms of what we were or were not willing to do in Syria. Steve Kroft: \u00a0But you didn\u2019t say that. President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0You said you drew the red line. President Barack Obama: I-- look, I-- Steve Kroft: I don\u2019t want to make too big a deal out of it, but-- President Barack Obama: I understand-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--I think that-- but I-- President Barack Obama: I-- but that-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--you think that that was-- President Barack Obama: --well-- Steve Kroft: Would you take it back? If you had-- President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--the opportunity to take it back? President Barack Obama: The reason I\u2019m hesitating is not to be defensive. It-- it\u2019s simply, Steve, that I would have I think made a bigger mistake if I had said, \u201cEh, chemical weapons. That doesn\u2019t really change my calculus.\u201d I think it was important for me as president of the United States to send a message that in fact there is something different about chemical weapons. And, regardless of how it ended up playing, I think-- in the Beltway, what is true is Assad got rid of his chemical weapons. And the reason he got rid of \u2018em is-- Steve Kroft: For a while. President Barack Obama: --because-- well, look-- if 90 percent or 95 percent of those-- chemical stockpiles were eliminated, that\u2019s a lot of chemical weapons that are not right now in the hands of ISIL or Nusra or, for that matter, the regime. Steve Kroft: Israel. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: \u00a0A few weeks ago you allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank. It caused a major fallout between the United States and Israel. Was it your decision to abstain? President Barack Obama: Yes, ultimately. Steve Kroft: \u00a0Why did you feel like you had to do that? President Barack Obama: Well, first of all, Steve, I don\u2019t think it caused a major rupture in relations between the United States and Israel. If you\u2019re saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu \u00a0got fired up, he\u2019s been fired up repeatedly during the course of my presidency, around the Iran deal and around our consistent objection to settlements. So that part of it wasn\u2019t new. And despite all the noise and hullabaloo-- military cooperation, intelligence cooperation, all of that has continued. We have defended them consistently in every imaginable way. But I also believe that both for our national interests and Israel\u2019s national interests that allowing an ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that could get worse and worse over time is a problem. And that settlements contribute. They\u2019re not the sole reason for it, but they\u2019re a contributing factor to the inability to solve that problem. And-- Steve Kroft: And you wanted to make that point? President Barack Obama: Not only did I want to make that point. We are reaching a tipping where the pace of settlements, during the course of my presidency has gotten so substantial that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to imagine an effective, contiguous Palestinian state. And I think it would have long-term consequences for peace and security in the region, and the United States, because of our investment in the region, and because we care so deeply about Israel, I think has a legitimate interest in saying to a friend, \u201cThis is a problem.\u201d And we\u2019ve said it-- look, it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t been saying it from Day One. We\u2019ve been saying it for eight years now. It\u2019s just that nothing seemed to get a lot of attention. When we return: the president discusses eight years in the Oval Office and life with his family in the White House. After our interview in the State Dining Room, President Obama invited us to the Oval Office where he had some things he wanted to show us, and some thoughts about his family\u2019s eight years in the Executive Mansion.\u00a0 Steve Kroft: What are you going to miss most about this place? 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft and President Barack Obama CBS News President Barack Obama: This walk is one of them. On the way, he told us that his family life had thrived living and working under the White House roof, but that his wife and daughters didn\u2019t feel the same way about life in what Harry Truman called \u201cthe finest prison in the world.\u201d Steve Kroft: How do they feel? President Barack Obama: Ah, they\u2019re ready to go. I mean, the girls, obviously, you know, they are now of an age in which the constraints of Secret Service and bubbles and all that stuff has gotten pretty old. Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny. I mean, she\u2019s thrived as a first lady, but it\u2019s not her preference. And so-- Steve Kroft: She was the hardest sell. President Barack Obama: She was the hardest sell. And she never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic, given how good she is. Having said that she would acknowledge, and I certainly feel that we-- we just have a lot of memories here. You know, our kids grew up here. Some of our best friends have been made here in this place. There have been moments that were highlights for us-- that-- you know, are going to be hard to duplicate. So-- Steve Kroft: She\u2019s glad you did it though? President Barack Obama: She is now. Ahhh, I think I\u2019ve said this story before. You know, she used to say to our friends, \u201cBarack\u2019s exactly the kind of guy I want to be president. I just wish he didn\u2019t want to do it when I was married to him.\u201d So-- so now that we\u2019re-- Steve Kroft: But you\u2019re still all right? I mean, everything\u2019s OK? President Barack Obama: So far, as far as I know. I better check later. Yeah. Steve Kroft: You have said you\u2019re going to take a big vacation. You\u2019re going to write your book. You\u2019re going to work on your library. You\u2019re going to set up a foundation. I mean, that sounds very professorial compared to what you\u2019ve been doing, like the ivory tower equivalent of puttering around the garden. Are you going to be happy doing this? President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: Are you-- President Barack Obama: --look, I\u2019m going to try to get some sleep. And do a little puttering. Because I haven\u2019t had a lot of chance to reflect and absorb all this. I do not expect to be behind a desk a lot. I look forward to teaching the occasional class, \u2018cause I was a professor. And I had fun doing it. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re not going to go to Wall Street, make a lot of money? President Barack Obama: I\u2019m not going to Wall Street. The amount of time that I\u2019ll be investing in issues is going to be high. But it\u2019ll be necessarily in a different capacity. \u00a0 Steve Kroft: Roosevelt\u2019s remembered for Social Security. Eisenhower is remembered for a speech about the military industrial complex. Ten years from now, what are they going to say about you? What are they going to remember you for? President Barack Obama: You know, I don\u2019t think you know now. I think you\u2019re not going to know until 10 years from now. I do think that, you know, saving the economy was a pretty big deal. We did a lot of stuff early that ended up having an impact. I believe that the work we\u2019ve done in moving our energy future in a cleaner direction is going to stick even if some of the individual steps that we took are reversed by future administrations. I think that it\u2019s embedded itself in the economy. And we\u2019ve been able to organize the international community around it in ways that aren\u2019t going to go back. I think we\u2019ve set the bar with respect to the notion that it is possible to provide health care for people. Now I know that the incoming Congress and administration talks about repealing it. But we\u2019ve set a bar that shows that this can be done. And that core principle is one that the majority of Americans, including supporters of Donald Trump believe in. Steve Kroft: What are your memories of this office? What\u2019s going to stick in your mind? What are you going to remember from here? President Barack Obama: Well I think the number of decisions that you make just with your advisers sitting here-- we\u2019ve had some big powwows around, is the banking system about to collapse and what do we do about it? To questions of war and peace. So you remember the decisions that were made in this room. The objects in this room-- only a few of \u2018em I really attach to. I think that I\u2019ll always remember the bust of Dr. King. I thought having an American here who represented rhat civic spirit that got me into this office was useful. Over there I\u2019ve got the original program for the March on Washington that was framed and given to me by a friend. You know, I\u2019ll remember the view out this window, because this is where we had our-- the playground that we put in when Malia and Sasha came in. \u00a0Being able every once in awhile to look out the window and see your daughters during the summer, swinging on that swing set, that made the presidency a little bit sweeter. When Sasha and Malia Obama arrived at the White House in 2009, they were age 7 and 10.\u00a0 Their parents -- for the most part \u2013 were successful in keeping them out of the limelight, except in the rarest circumstances. In the fall, Malia begins at Harvard after a gap year. Sasha is a sophomore at her private school in Washington. This month, the swing set was dismantled and given away. Steve Kroft: You feel older? President Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s interesting. Physically, I feel probably as good as I\u2019ve ever felt. And I\u2019ve got as much energy as I ever did. But what you feel after eight years -- and I think you\u2019d feel this no matter what, but anytime you have a big transition, it gets magnified \u2013 is time passes. Your kids grow up. I think they more than anything are making me feel as if, you know, you want to squeeze everything you got every single day out of this thing. Because it passes quick. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re having trouble letting go? President Barack Obama: No. I am looking forward to getting out of the bubble. I am glad that I\u2019m leaving this place at a relatively young age, at 55. So I have the opportunity for a second maybe even a third act in a way that I think would be tougher if I were, you know, the age of some presidents when they left. There\u2019s some bittersweet feelings about leaving the people here. \u2018Cause even though all the team you assemble, you know, you\u2019re going to stay in touch with \u2018em, it\u2019s not the same, you know? The band kind of breaks up. And, I think I\u2019m the best president I\u2019ve ever been right now. And I think the team that is operating right now functions as well as any team that I\u2019ve had. And so, you know, there is a part of you that thinks, \u201cMan, we\u2019re pretty good at this stuff right now.\u201d And you hate to see that talent disperse. Steve Kroft: You going to have reunions? President Barack Obama: Well, not I don\u2019t think we\u2019re go have, like, T-shirts and, you know, all that stuff. That sounds kind of sad. And so my-- so many of my staff is young enough that they\u2019re going to do amazing things. And I\u2019m going to be helping them try to do them. So overall though, I have a deep appreciation for the wisdom of this guy right there, George Washington. It\u2019s good to get fresh legs in here. I think that it refreshes our democracy. It-- I think sustaining the pace over more than eight years is pretty tough. Steve Kroft: What are you going to do on the 21st when you wake up? I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to be when you wake up, but you\u2019re going to wake up someplace where you\u2019re not president. President Barack Obama: Well, here\u2019s one thing is I\u2019m not setting my alarm. That, I\u2019m certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I\u2019m going to spend time with Michelle. And, you know, we got some catching up to do. We\u2019ve both been busy. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re going to be spending your own money, right? President Barack Obama: Abs-- well, you know, the truth though is that we\u2019ve been-- Steve Kroft: Have you been spending your own-- when was the last time you-- President Barack Obama: I-- Steve Kroft: --spent your own money? President Barack Obama: Well, I will say this. You know, I mentioned how I\u2019ve got a pretty thick skin in this job. You\u2019ve got to have it. One thing that did kind of get under my craw sometimes was people talking as if when we went on vacation or-- Steve Kroft: Right, right, right, right. President Barack Obama: --you know, that people\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, spending taxpayer money.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, I actually I\u2019m paying for all of this. The only thing I don\u2019t pay for is Secret Service and an airplane.\u201d Steve Kroft: And communications. President Barack Obama: And communications, \u2018cause I don\u2019t have any choice. But, you know, we buy our own toilet paper even here in the White House. Steve Kroft: Really? President Barack Obama: You know, we-- it\u2019s not free. I\u2019m-- I\u2019ve got a grocery bill at the end of every month. You know, our toothpaste, our, you know, our orange juice, that all gets paid. But I-- it is true that I don\u2019t carry my wallet that often. So I\u2019m going to have some catching up to do in terms of how day-to-day things operate.\u00a0 \u00a0 Steve Kroft: It\u2019s not unusual for a president to issue an observation, \u201cBeware of this. Be wary of that.\u201d What is the thing that concerns you most right now, leaving office, about the country? President Barack Obama: Making sure that our democracy stays healthy. And making sure that we maintain that sense of solidarity. Um, the thing that has disturbed me most about the Russian hacking episode is-- and the thing that surprised me most has not been the fact of Russian hacking, because Chinese, Russians, Iranians-- a lot of-- Steve Kroft: The United States-- President Barack Obama: The United-- well, the cyber world is full of information gathering, you know, propaganda, et cetera. I have been concerned about the degree to which, in some circles, you\u2019ve seen people suggest that Vladimir Putin has more credibility than the U.S. government. I think that\u2019s something new. And I think it\u2019s a measure of how the partisan divide has gotten so severe that people forget we\u2019re on the same team. President Barack Obama: We go into the hallway here\u2026 The president led us through a side door from the Oval Office into a short hallway and into his small private dining room. Here, the mementos were personal, far less formal. Steve Kroft: All this stuff is coming with you? President Barack Obama: Absolutely. Well, not all of it. It-- I think-- Steve Kroft: Hard packing up? President Barack Obama: I think, this famous-- Steve Kroft: This is going to stay there, right? President Barack Obama: --painting of The Peacemakers, that goes with the territory. Steve Kroft: How much stuff are you going to take with you? President Barack Obama: Not that much. I mean, you know, we got-- I got books, I got clothes, I got mementos like-- these that, you know, I cherish. We got some furniture that we purchased that, you know, we\u2019ll try to use in the new place. Steve Kroft: Do you like it, the new house? President Barack Obama: It\u2019s a nice-- it\u2019s a nice home. I mean-- Steve Kroft: You\u2019ve been there--? President Barack Obama: Yeah. It\u2019ll-- it\u2019s temporary. And-- Steve Kroft: Two years? President Barack Obama: Yeah. But it feels like a home. You know, it\u2019s not crazy big but there\u2019s enough room for, you know, a treadmill and some workout equipment in the basement. \u201cMy fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won\u2019t stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days.\u201d President Obama The next day President Obama was back in Chicago where it all began to deliver his farewell address. Obama in farewell address: My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won\u2019t stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. Thank you. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. President Obama, in all the times we were with him, seemed to savor the challenge of an interview. For him, it was an intellectual workout, something on par with a pickup basketball game, complete with a little trash talk. There were never any restrictions on questions. No taboo topics. A year and half ago, there was a particularly contentious line of questioning about America\u2019s role in Syria. After it, we took a short break for a few sips of water.\u00a0 And when the cameras rolled again, the president was ready for more. President Obama: What else you got? Tonight, at last, we have no more questions. I\u2019m Steve Kroft. Next Sunday, here on CBS, the AFC Championship game. And we\u2019ll be back in two weeks with a brand new edition of 60 Minutes. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "We Asked People What They Know About Obamacare. See If You Know The Answers Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and whose populist candidacy in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary was boosted by a strong online following and small-dollar donations, headlined the day. He was recently named to a leadership post among Senate Democrats as chairman of outreach. Sanders used his vast email list from the campaign to help organize support for Sundays rallies in support of Obamacare, which stretched from an event led by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco to one featuring Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Boston. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley even led a sing-a-long at the Utah State Capitol. \u2014 David Komatar (@davidkomatar) January 15, 2017 Warren told an energized crowd outside Faneuil Hall in Boston, \"We knew these fights were coming, and now the first one is here.\" In San Francisco, Pelosi insisted, \"We're not going back.\" Sanders and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer went to Warren, Mich., and although Schumer will soon be the most powerful Democrat in Washington, it was Sanders who was the star. Signs like, \"Don't blame me - I voted for Bernie\" dotted the crowd, and Schumer had to pause his speech for a chorus of \"Bernie, Bernie\" cheers when Sanders walked on stage in the middle of the New York senator's remarks. It's no accident that Sanders and Schumer chose to hold their event in Warren. Surrounding Macomb County tells the story of Democrats' 2016 woes. It went narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, but last year Donald Trump carried Macomb County by more than 10 points over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump's raw vote total in the largely white, working-class county - about 48,000 votes - was more than four times his margin of victory in the once-reliably Democratic state. Article continues after sponsorship Both Sanders and Schumer believe Democrats can recapture economy-focused working class voters, and holding a rally in Macomb County to defend a healthcare program is one way to show voters who supported Trump that the Democratic Party is attentive to their concerns. Sanders told NPR last week that he could have gone to a lot of places: \"But Michigan is a great state. It's a state where I did well in the Democratic primary. And is a state where Trump won.\" He beat Clinton in the state's 2016 primary. At Sunday's rally, Schumer challenged Trump to keep a campaign promise not to cut entitlement programs as he fired up the crowd in support of the ACA. \"We're gonna win this fight together \u2014 the American people and the Democrats in the Congress,\" Schumer said. In reality, Republicans have enough votes to dismantle large parts of the Affordable Care Act, particularly elements that help fund the law, through a process that allows the Senate to pass budget measures with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster on most legislation. The GOP has 52 seats in the Senate. Democrats can play a bigger role in an attempt to repeal and replace the law full-scale, which would require 60 votes. That's a dynamic Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow admitted when she spoke at the rally. \"They've got the U.S. House, they've got the U.S. Senate, they're going to have the presidency. If they want to rip health care apart, rip Medicare and Medicaid apart, they can do that,\" Stabenow said. Republicans point to big increases in health care premiums since the law was enacted, and the fact that many insurers are pulling out of healthcare exchanges created as part of the Affordable Care Act in some states. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also spoken in objection to the mandates on individuals and employers, as well as the taxes enacted to enforce and pay for the law, as evidence of \"bad policy that does not accomplish what it was designed to do.\" Republican leaders, including Ryan and Trump, say they will not repeal Obamacare without a replacement at hand. So far, there is no clear plan from Republicans for how to replace the law, but Ryan insists that will be hashed out at the end of January when congressional Republicans hold a retreat in Philadelphia. Stabenow pointed to the face that Democrats' best hope is to generate enough public support for Obamacare \u2014 or enough public concern about fully repealing it \u2014 for Republican lawmakers to see a repeal as politically dangerous. While Democrats point to the good the law has done, it's clear they have struggled on the messaging front. A poll released by NPR and Ipsos last week showed that less than half of Americans \u2014 including just 54% of Democrats \u2014 knew that the law reduced the number of people without health insurance. But, while they would rather control the agenda, Democrats are beginning to discover something Republicans have known for the entirety of the Obama administration: It's often easier to generate public support around a simplified voice of opposition, than it is to find the votes to create and pass a complicated piece of legislation.

    "text": "Trump's market: bear, bull or lamb? Trump's market: bear, bull or lamb? Chris Whetzel / For The Times Trump's market: bear, bull or lamb? Trump's market: bear, bull or lamb? (Chris Whetzel / For The Times) Tom Petruno When Donald Trump takes the oath of office later this week, he will inherit the second-longest stock bull run in history, and a market valued at a record $26\u00a0trillion. From Wall Street\u2019s point of view, it doesn\u2019t often get much better than this. And that\u2019s a big challenge for the new president. The longevity of the current bull, and stocks\u2019\u00a0high prices relative to company sales\u00a0and earnings, have raised the stakes for what\u2019s next. The Dow Jones industrial average, at 19,885, is up 8.9% just since election day \u2014\u00a0a sign of investors\u2019\u00a0lofty expectations for the economy under Trump. If he disappoints, or his tax, trade and spending policies trigger unexpected or dangerous consequences, stocks could react violently. A new bear market \u2014\u00a0meaning a drop of 20% or more in the Dow and other indexes \u2014\u00a0could in turn quickly undermine the business confidence and spending crucial for Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u00a0agenda. It also would erode the retirement savings of the roughly half of U.S. households that own stocks\u00a0and stoke distressing memories of the 2008-2009 market crash. But even though another big market downturn is inevitable, it doesn\u2019t have to occur in 2017, or even in the next few years. Continued investor excitement over Trump could drive stocks to new highs this year in a rally that could feed on itself. There\u2019s another possibility\u00a0too: Rather than a bull or a bear, the market could temporarily morph into something much gentler \u2014\u00a0a patient, lamb-like market that isn\u2019t exciting but also does no great harm. Even in hot bull markets, stocks can go quiet\u00a0for extended periods. Here\u2019s a look at four potential scenarios for stocks in 2017:\u00a0 A market \u2018melt-up.\u2019\u00a0 Some market pros see the possibility of 2017 replaying 1987: a surge in share prices stoked by optimism about the economy. Coming out of the early-1980s recession, U.S. economic growth exploded higher in 1983 and 1984. The pace then decelerated in 1985 and 1986. By the start of 1987, however, a plunge in oil prices set the stage for a new growth wave. Even though stocks had been rallying strongly since August 1982, they rocketed in 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 44% from the start of the year to a then-record 2,722 in August 1987. A weakening dollar helped boost expectations for U.S. export growth. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, sees the jump in consumer and business confidence since Trump\u2019s election as a potentially powerful driver of share prices in the near-term \u2014\u00a0if that mood can be sustained. In December, a U.S. small-business confidence index leaped to its highest level since 2004. Although the economy has grown since 2009, the slow expansion has left many consumers and investors doubtful that better times can last, Paulsen said. \u201cFor eight years, we just haven\u2019t had confidence,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cWe've had fear.\u201d\u00a0A reversal could be huge for spending and investing. A 2017 market \u201cmelt-up\u201d is the official forecast of Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He sees a 10% jump in U.S. stocks in the first half, in what he terms the \u201cIcarus Trade\u201d \u2014\u00a0for the Greek mythical character who flew too close to the sun on wings of wax and feathers. As Hartnett alludes, the problem with market melt-ups is that they often are followed by meltdowns. That\u2019s what happened in 1987: The infamous Oct. 19, 1987, crash slashed 22.6% off the Dow in a sell-off driven partly by computerized trading gone awry. Despite that collapse, the Dow still posted a net gain of 2.3% for the year \u2014\u00a0and resumed climbing in 1988. The 1987 bear market was one of the shortest in history, lasting just 3.3 months. Another market crash like 2008-09. An obvious danger Wall Street faces is wild-eyed optimism about what Trump can do to quickly bolster the economy.\u00a0 \u201cThe market is looking forward to a combination of corporate tax cuts, a reduction in individual tax rates,\u00a0fiscal stimulus and deregulation,\u201d said\u00a0Russ Koesterich, co-manager of investment giant BlackRock Inc.'s $41-billion Global Allocation Fund. \u201cBut this is a lot, probably more than any administration can realistically achieve in one year.\u201d Still, the expectation of a longer timetable for reforms probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause a sudden dramatic exodus from stocks. The greater risk may be that Trump ignites a global economic crisis with trade policies aimed at punishing major exporters including Mexico and China. Last September, a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that Trump\u2019s anti-import trade proposals \u2014\u00a0including a 35% tariff on Mexican goods \u2014\u00a0would likely trigger immediate retaliation by exporting nations against American goods and services. The result could be \u201ca trade war that would plunge the U.S.\u00a0economy into recession and cost more than 4 million private-sector American jobs,\u201d\u00a0 the study said . Absent a sudden economic or geopolitical calamity, however, the market lacks many of the necessary ingredients for another crash, some analysts say. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist\u00a0at brokerage Charles Schwab , said that although\u00a0many investors live in fear of a 2008 replay, \u201cthe\u00a0conditions that existed then don't exist now.\u201d Financial crises and crashes often follow periods of extreme market excesses, such as intense\u00a0speculative behavior. In 2008, the U.S. housing bubble was the most obviously inflated market. But 2007-2008 also marked the peak in zooming prices for crude oil and other commodities, for stocks in emerging markets such as China and Brazil, and for European stocks and the euro currency, among other assets. Today, there\u2019s little argument that U.S. stocks are at risky levels relative to earnings. But commodities, emerging markets, many European shares and most currencies remain well below their all-time highs. What\u2019s more, the U.S. banking system is vastly healthier than it was in 2008. Weak banks were allowed to fail and the survivors were forced to substantially boost their capital cushions against loan losses. A new financial crisis is highly unlikely to be centered in U.S. banks. That doesn\u2019t do much to mollify bearish analysts who note, correctly, that overall global debt levels have mushroomed since 2008. Much of it was piled on by governments and central banks in their efforts to support their economies during and after the recession. But some types of consumer debt also have ballooned, notably car loans and education loans in the U.S. Albert Edwards, global strategist at French bank Societe Generale and a notorious market bear, believes that record high corporate debt will be the \u201cvortex\u201d of trouble leading to the next recession. Still, debt poses the greatest risk when economies are slowing \u2014\u00a0not when they're accelerating.\u00a0 The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week said its latest data point to a pickup in growth this year not just in the U.S. but also in most of the rest of the world. A \u2018typical\u2019\u00a0bear market. Forecasting a bear market drop of 20% or more in 2017 might seem the logical call to anyone who has bet on red or black in roulette. The blue-chip Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has recorded positive total returns (including dividends) every year since 2009. If you think of that as landing on black eight straight times in roulette, the odds of red in 2017 would seem high. Besides that, the current bull run now is 94 months old. Only the 1990s\u2019 advance was longer , at 113 months. But history has demonstrated that bull markets don\u2019t simply die of old age. Something has to kill them. And often the killer is the onset of a recession that slashes consumer and business spending.\u00a0 This time, though, few of the classic early-warning signs of recession are present. Just the opposite. \u201cFor the first time in nine years it can be said that the economy is hitting on all cylinders ,\u201d\u00a0said James Stack, a market historian who heads InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Mont. An index of so-called leading economic indicators tracked by the Conference Board research group continued to edge higher in 2016. By contrast, that index was plummeting well before the starts of the last two recessions, in 2001 and 2008-2009. Another argument against a bear market taking hold: U.S. corporate earnings began to rebound in the third quarter of 2016 after five straight weak quarters. Analyst estimates now forecast a 12% jump in S&P 500 profit in 2017, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at research firm CFRA in New York. Analysts often are overly optimistic, Stovall concedes. \u201cYet the new Trump administration is promising tax cuts and economic stimulus from an increase in infrastructure spending, which may justify leaving the 2017 estimate at 12%, or push it even higher,\u201d\u00a0he said. Given how high stock prices are compared with earnings, a profit surge may be essential for keeping the bull market alive. The average blue chip stock is priced at about 23 times per-share earnings over the last 12 months, according to market data firm Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. InvesTech\u2019s Stack calculates that price-to-earnings ratios have been in this nosebleed\u00a0range\u00a0less than 11% of the time since 1928.\u00a0He also notes that bear markets can occur in the absence of recessions. That was the case in 1987.\u00a0 With or without recessions, high stock valuations are \u201calmost inevitably resolved by a new bear market,\u201d\u00a0Stack said. He thinks the odds increasingly favor a market peak this year, and a bear market to follow. How bad? Every bear is unique, but they typically take back about half of the previous bull market\u2019s gains, Stack said. If that holds true this time, the market could drop about 40% before bottoming. That would be much less than the financial-crisis plunge of 57%, though\u00a0still quite painful. But for long-term investors, bear markets should be viewed as opportunities\u00a0\u2014 the chance to buy low. Neither bull nor bear\u00a0 A final possibility is that stocks\u00a0could simply stall out for a lengthy period, as many investors wait to see what happens with the economy under Trump. There could be intermittent rallies and sell-offs, but nothing dramatic for the market overall. A \u201clamb market\u201d\u00a0is one animal analogy. Wells Capital\u2019s Paulsen offers another: \u201cA \u2018bunny market.\u2019\u00a0Because it\u2019s hoppy but it doesn\u2019t go very far.\u201d Admittedly, the idea of a sustained benign market at current record share prices will sound to some like famed economist Irving Fisher\u2019s declaration, just before the 1929 market crash, that stocks had reached \u201ca permanently high plateau .\u201d Yet there have been\u00a0plenty of times when the market has temporarily run\u00a0out of gas. In the current bull, it happened in 2011 and again in 2015. The stars would\u00a0have to align perfectly this time, analysts concede. The U.S. and global economies must avoid massive shocks. Corporate earnings must continue to rise, even as worker wages pick up . And the Federal Reserve\u2019s program of raising interest rates must remain on a slow track. Some market pros say the most important underpinning for stocks worldwide today is the belief that the risk of a global deflationary depression has passed. The long-term bullish case is that governments, particularly the U.S., are embracing growth policies again.\u00a0 The jargony term is \u201creflation\u201d : growth with a mild pickup in inflation, but not a rabid inflation. \u201cInflation is toxic to stocks. Reflation is not,\u201d\u00a0said Schwab\u2019s Sonders. Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis, said his firm\u2019s research supports the idea that the bull market that began in 2009 is a \u201csecular\u201d\u00a0one \u2014\u00a0meaning the long-term trend points up, even though bear markets will periodically interrupt it. The last two secular bulls ran from 1982 to 2000 and from 1942 to 1966, both periods of healthy economic growth. If investors believe in the secular trend, Clissold said, then \u201cthe buy-the-dip mentality still makes sense.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .
