The market, an early voting site, stayed open until 10 p.m. Friday night, with many of the mostly Latino voters there waiting in line two hours to vote. By the time the grocery store closed, over 57,000 people had cast ballots in Clark County, a record-breaking turnout for single-day early voting in the county, according to ABC affiliate KTNV . Polling hours extended to accommodate massive turnout at Cardenas Market on Nevada's last day of early voting: https://t.co/Uxu0rJSolp pic.twitter.com/zxXKouOs4z \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 The big turnout of early voters in Nevada from communities with large Latino populations could bode well for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , whose Republican rival Donald Trump may have alienated many voters of Hispanic origin with his comments about immigrants and plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. More than 30 percent of Clark County residents are Hispanic, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau . \"Looks like Trump got his wall after all. A wall of beautiful voters,\" Yvanna Cancela, political director of the Culinary Union in Las Vegas, wrote on Twitter . . @ClarkCountyNV early voting update for Friday: 57,097 as of 10 p.m. https://t.co/bltkpBNaah pic.twitter.com/IJAPbbNRww \u2014 Tim Hogan (@timjhogan) November 5, 2016 Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign event in downtown Reno on Saturday night, but KTNV political analyst Jon Ralston said the Republican \u201calmost certainly lost Nevada on Friday.\u201d According to Ralston, Clinton has essentially locked up the state thanks to Hispanic voters . \u201cTrump has almost no path to the presidency without Nevada. He can say whatever he wants in Reno on Saturday and boost rural turnout a lot, but he made his own bed when he announced his candidacy,\u201d Ralston wrote in an article on Saturday, referring to remarks Trump made about Mexican immigrants being rapists and criminals when announcing his presidential bid in June last year. They just extended voting hours at a Mexican supermarket to 10 PM. Close to 1,000 voters in line.

Sixty-six percent were Democrats, 9 percent Republican and 25 percent had no party affiliation. \"So Cardenas was responsible for adding 1,000 to the Democratic lead,\" Ralston wrote.

    "text": "Updated Nov. 6, 2016Sun., Nov.  6 at 1:01 AM ET Mr. Trump also stopped on Saturday in North Carolina, and took advantage of the time-zone differences by flying west for evening rallies in Colorado and Nevada. In Reno, Nev., he was rushed offstage by Secret Service agents after someone shouted that a member of the crowd had a gun, a reminder of the charged atmosphere at many of his events. No weapon was found, and Mr. Trump returned to finish his speech after a few minutes. By holding events in those four increasingly diverse states, he was signaling a refusal to concede any ground to Mrs. Clinton and rejecting the strategy of past presidential candidates who have fought within the confines of a narrower electoral map in the campaign\u2019s final hours. He even announced Saturday morning that he planned to add a stop in Minnesota, long a Democratic bulwark and a state he had not been even contesting. But the evidence from polling and the early voting turnout seemed to indicate he was facing the possibility of sweeping losses in states with sizable Hispanic populations, most likely affected by the racially tinged language he has used since beginning his campaign over 16 months ago, when he claimed the ranks of Mexican migrants were filled with rapists and drug dealers. Photo A crowd listened to Hillary Clinton at a rally in Tempe, Ariz., on Wednesday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times \u201cThe story of this election may be the mobilization of the Hispanic vote,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an anti-Trump Republican who has pleaded with his party to do more to win over Latinos. \u201cSo Trump deserves the award for Hispanic turnout. He did more to get them out than any Democrat has ever done.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The question for Republicans, just 12 years after President George W. Bush carried at least a third of the Hispanic vote, is how long the Trump-inflicted damage with Latinos will haunt them. Raising the specter of how difficult it has been for California Republicans since former Gov. Pete Wilson\u2019s hard line toward illegal immigrants there, Mr. Graham said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t come to grips with the demographic challenges we have with Hispanics in presidential politics, we\u2019ll never right the ship.\u201d In Florida, at least 200,000 more Hispanics had voted early as of Friday than did during the entire early voting period four years ago, according to an analysis by Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who helped run President Obama\u2019s two campaigns here. The turnout has been particularly explosive in South Florida and Central Florida, where thousands from Puerto Rico and other regions of Latin America have migrated in recent years. And 24 percent of the Hispanics casting early ballots were first-time voters, the analysis showed. Graphic: Voting Early, and in Droves: Over 22 Million Ballots Are Already In \u201cIt\u2019s the demographics that are bailing her out,\u201d Mr. Schale said. In Orlando, voters waited up to 90 minutes on Saturday at one early voting location at a library, some spending the time taking pictures of one another in front of candidates\u2019 signs. Parking lots for a quarter-mile surrounding the area were packed. Mrs. Clinton clearly carried the day there. Jon-Carlos Perez, 30, an independent voter and a concrete laborer originally from Puerto Rico, said he cast his vote for Mrs. Clinton in part because \u201cshe\u2019s not an idiot like Trump.\u201d Alyssa Perez, 23, a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida who voted at another busy location in Orlando, said she considered Mr. Trump to be \u201canti-women, anti-Hispanic, anti-Muslim\u201d and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where there is a president who has those kinds of views.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Canvassing on Saturday morning in North Miami, Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, and a handful of local members focused on households, many of them Haitian or Hispanic, with an infrequent voting history. But nearly every resident who answered their door assured her they had already voted. \u201cThe word is out,\u201d said Ms. Henry, as roosters scooted between yards. But it was not just Florida where Hispanics were poised to send a powerful message. In Nevada, which has the fastest-growing Latino population in the West, Democrats appeared to have built a fearsome advantage in Las Vegas\u2019s Clark County at the end of early voting Friday, largely because of a surge of votes from Mexican-Americans. The early voting period was extended until 10 p.m. at one Hispanic grocery store in Las Vegas, where the images of hundreds of voters waiting in line ricocheted across the internet. (On Saturday, Mr. Trump claimed, without any evidence, that the hours had been extended so Democrats could be bused in.) ",

Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \"Dream Big.\" Mr. Cub wrote those words on an autographed photo of him and Anthony Rizzo , who attached it to the wall of his locker in the spring of 2015. Ernie Banks , the Cubs icon, and Rizzo, the young first baseman, had bonded after Rizzo's arrival from the Padres in 2012. After Banks died in January 2015, Rizzo paid tribute to his friend by posting the photo in his locker, a daily affirmation from a man synonymous with sunshine. It wasn't one of the catchy slogans the Cubs would make famous in 2016 \u2014 \"Embrace the Target\" or \"Try Not to Suck\" \u2014 and it wasn't particularly poetic. Just a friendly reminder from someone who never made it to a World Series that it all starts with a dream. Now Rizzo and the Cubs finally had made it to the World Series, ending a 71-year wait that spawned the \"lovable losers\" epithet and made the franchise a late-night TV punchline from Johnny Carson to Stephen Colbert. All they needed to do was beat the Indians to end the 107-year championship drought and kick off the party of the century in Chicago. Rizzo and Travis Wood were the last of the 2012 Cubs that lost 101 games in the first year of The Plan. On the eve of Game 1 of the Series, Rizzo reminisced about the winter of 2014, when Joe Maddon arrived and Jon Lester signed. At last, the dream finally began to look real. The Weight: Paul Sullivan chronicles the Cubs' 2016 season Read more stories \"It was a turning point,\" Rizzo said. \"I remember saying to my parents 'I should be on a contending team the rest of my career.' The first four years of it weren't like that. It's a good feeling to come in knowing we're going to play this game and next year we're going to go into spring training expecting to win the World Series again, just like we did this year, expecting to win the World Series. \"It's exciting stuff.\" It was, and the Cubs not only were ready, they had an October Surprise in their back pocket \u2014 the return of Kyle Schwarber, who had missed more than six months rehabbing from knee surgery after an outfield collision with Dexter Fowler in the third game of the season. A couple of days earlier, Schwarber had been playing in front of 100 people in an Arizona Fall League game, preparing to launch a made-for-\"30-for-30\"-style comeback. Now he was on baseball's biggest stage, trying to help end an epic drought, with millions of Cubs fans dreaming big. The weight of the past was heavier than ever, but the time had arrived. Here they were. Now they were here. Caption Theo Epstein ahead of Game 1 of the World Series Theo Epstein ahead of Game 1 of the World Series.

(Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune) The Cubs work out at Cleveland's Progressive Field on Oct. 24, 2016, before the World Series begins. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune) Digging deep The Rev. Burke Masters, a Cubs chaplain, celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in the Wrigley Field stands before Game 5 of the World Series, as the participants hoped to restore faith that had been shattered in the blink of an eye. After Indians ace Corey Kluber shut down the Cubs in a 6-0 victory in Game 1, Schwarber's Hollywood comeback and Jake Arrieta 's dominance led them to a 5-1 triumph in Game 2 that knotted the Series for the much-anticipated return to Chicago. The pregame scene for the first World Series game at Wrigley Field since 1945 resembled a Norman Rockwell painting, warm and fuzzy and visually perfect. But the game itself was Stephen King-like, a horrific 1-0 Cubs loss that gave the Indians home-field advantage again. John Lackey, who ripped the Chicago media for pointing out the Cubs' postseason swings during the National League Championship Series , saying \"you guys dramatize everything,\" was overdramatic during a Game 4 meltdown. Lackey repeatedly lost his cool after Kris Bryant made his second error during a two-run second inning, sending the Indians to a 7-2 victory and commanding 3-1 series lead. World Series , and Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts has to get along with both of them. Ricketts needs Mayor Rahm Emanuel for city approval on many of the changes at Wrigley, and he needs John Lackey to... Two of the more polarizing figures in Chicago were on the same field Saturday night at Game 4 of the World Series , and Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts has to get along with both of them. Ricketts needs Mayor Rahm Emanuel for city approval on many of the changes at Wrigley, and he needs John Lackey to... (Paul Sullivan) The Cubs' high hopes of ending the drought seemingly were dashed, and the only thing left for the Indians to do to clinch their first championship in 68 years was to win one of three games, starting with beating Lester in Game 5. That was not happening. Lester struck out the side in the first to keep hope alive but served up a home run to Jose Ramirez in the second to quiet the home crowd. The Cubs were in the midst of another offensive funk, just like the one in the NLCS, and couldn't find an escape hatch. Bryant had been 1-for-15 in the Series, making his decision to film a commercial with a billy goat for an energy drink look ominous. Damn, that old goat had won again. But the kid with the never-ending grin stepped to the plate to start the bottom of the fourth inning and calmly cranked a home run into the left-field bleachers, tying the game and starting the Sigh Heard 'Round Chicago. The situation: With the crowd at Wrigley Field subdued after Jose Ramirez's second-inning home run gave the Indians a 1-0 lead, the Cubs were in need of a spark with their season on the line. Upped stepped Kris Bryant to lead off the bottom of the fourth. What happened next: On a 1-1 count, Bryant...

Upped stepped Kris Bryant to lead off the bottom of the fourth. What happened next: On a 1-1 count, Bryant... (Chris Kuc) Rizzo then doubled off the ivy in right, and suddenly the ballpark was alive again. Addison Russell's infield hit brought in the go-ahead run, and David Ross' sacrifice fly made it 3-1. Lester was not going to give up this lead. No chance. But he told Maddon after six innings and 90 pitches that he was done, turning the season over to the Cubs' shaky bullpen. Carl Edwards Jr. came on with a one-run lead in the seventh, but after a single and flyout, Maddon had an October Surprise of his own. Edwards was yanked for closer Aroldis Chapman , who was being asked to do the unthinkable \u2014 get the final eight outs and get the Cubs to Game 6. Chapman delivered \u2014 but only after scaring the daylights out of Cubs Nation, neglecting to cover first on Rajai Davis ' infield hit to Rizzo with one out in the eighth. Would the lack of hustle with the season on the line ultimately turn Chapman into the goat of the century? Chapman let Davis steal second and third with ease, greasing the skids for his demise, before Francisco Lindor was called out on strikes to end the suspense. Crisis averted. Photos from Game 5 of the World Series at Wrigley Field on Oct. 30, 2016. After the Game 5 victory, Maddon gave the players a timeout for Halloween instead of having them fly to Cleveland for the off day. This was the genius of Maddon, the reason he had been able to get the most of his players. Let them be dads first and Cubs employees second. There was no way to quantify its affect, but the players appreciated the chance to breathe. Lester and Ross took their kids trick-or-treating, getting their first taste of a Wrigleyville Halloween. \"It was a little nuts,\" Ross said. \"Some lady, had to be about 60, was something. She was sprinting down the street because she didn't answer the door and then saw it was me and Jon Lester walking around. It was crazy, but fun crazy. People were excited.\" Another mood swing in the city that couldn't sleep was well underway. Bryant's home run got them off the mat, the tag-team performance of Lester and Chapman saved the season and they had Arrieta and Kyle Hendricks going in Games 6 and 7, respectively. \"What could go wrong?\" fans said to themselves, knowing perfectly well what could \u2014 and perhaps would.

(Chris Kuc/Chicago Tribune) Rolling the dice The real curse of the Cubs was not the billy goat or the black cat or the foul ball. It was having to flash back to an awful moment or poor decision-making at a crucial juncture of a potential history-changing game. In 1984, it was manager Jim Frey going with Scott Sanderson in Game 4 of the NLCS in San Diego with a 2-1 series lead over the Padres. Rick Sutcliffe, the major leagues' best pitcher, was ready to go, and Game 2 winner Steve Trout was ready for Game 5 if necessary. Thirty-two years later, it still rankled the '84 Cubs. \"We've visited that area many times,\" said Ron Cey, the team's third baseman known as 'the Penguin' for his inimitable waddle. \"Yeah, it kind of grinds at me once in a while. I didn't discuss it with (Frey), but I discussed it with a lot of people.\" Cubs managers, even the most successful ones, had contributed to the weight. ",

Joshua Gonzalez, left, confronts Trump supporter Jake Towe, right, outside the Anaheim Convention Center during a Trump rally. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Steve Lopez Contact Reporter Almost. We don\u2019t know what awaits us  Wednesday morning and beyond. But we know that the most hostile, vulgar, sensational, depressing, divisive, racially charged and\u00a0humiliating mud bath many of us have ever witnessed is about to leave a permanent stain on the history books. The next president of the United States of America will either be someone under a constant cloud of inquiry or someone who, during nationally televised debate spectacles, boasted about the size of his manhood and said he doesn\u2019t pay taxes because he\u2019s smart. It\u2019ll be a woman, or it\u2019ll be a man who has bragged about groping women. Civility has been hit by a truck. A child at a Trump rally yelled \u201ctake the bitch down!\u201d when Trump mentioned Clinton. In a dangerous world with complicated challenges, substantive debate has been virtually nonexistent, and constant cable coverage has illuminated nothing but our inability to look away from a spectacular wreck. And let\u2019s be fair. It\u2019s not just the presidential election that hangs over the republic like a toxic cloud. Money is poison, and there\u2019s hemlock everywhere you look, thanks in part to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s support for the unlimited corrupting influence of cash. California\u2019s billion and one ballot measures float on a rising tide of greenbacks. A crack team of muckraking L.A. Times reporters \u2014 or scum of the earth, as Trump calls journalists \u2014 has just exposed what smells like a monstrous pay-to-play operation in Los Angeles. And no one\u00a0is particularly surprised, because Chinatown is everywhere you look. In the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been clipping headlines and circling statistics that jumped out at me for one reason or another.\u00a0I\u2019d like to borrow from the Harper\u2019s magazine model and share some of them with you. Here now, my Democracy in Action index: * Amount of money spent on California ballot measures this campaign season: Nearly half a billion dollars, a record. * Amount spent by pharmaceutical companies on Proposition\u00a061, which would cap what the state pays for prescription drugs: $126 million. * Amount spent by tobacco companies to oppose Proposition\u00a056, a proposal to add a $2 tax increase to the price of a pack of cigarettes: $55 million. * Amount of National Rifle Assn.\u00a0spending on presidential and Senate races: a record $36 million, including $21 million to aid Donald Trump and $12.6 million to attack Hillary Clinton. * Number of gun violence deaths so far this year in the U.S:\u00a012,416, including 2,632 teenagers and 568 children 11 and under. * Biggest spender on California legislative races by outside (independent expenditure groups): $17 million by charter school proponents. * Annual shortfall of money needed to repair the nation\u2019s deteriorating schools: $46 billion. * Number of times Clinton and Trump were asked questions about education policy in three nationally televised debates: 0. * Dollar amount of donations between 2008 and 2013 from people with a link to the developer of a $72-million housing development near the Port of Los Angeles: More than $600,000. * Number of such donors who told Times reporters David\u00a0Zahniser and Emily Alpert Reyes they did not write checks or could not remember doing so: 11. * Percentage of voters who say this presidential election is more important than most: 71%. * Unfavorable rating for Trump in latest Gallup poll: 63%. * Unfavorable rating for Clinton in latest Gallup poll: 55%. * Melania Trump \u2019s plea for more civility online: \u201cOur culture has become too mean and too rough.\u201d * Number of people, places and things insulted by Donald Trump in Tweets, according to a New York Times tally: 282. * Number of Trump tweets calling someone a liar: 42. * Percentage of Trump statements judged half true, mostly false, false or \u201cpants on fire false\u201d by Politifact: 85%. * Percentage of Clinton statements judged half true, mostly false, false or \u201cpants on fire false\u201d by Politifact: 50%. * Number of emails deleted by Clinton from her personal server: More than 30,000 (she said they were personal or non-work-related). * Number of those emails the FBI said were indeed work-related : Thousands . * Average tax cut to the top 1%  of earners under Trump\u2019s tax plan according to Tax Policy Center: $215,000. * Average tax increase to the\u00a0top 1%  of earners under Clinton tax plan: $118,000. * Politifact analysis of Bernie Sanders\u2019 claim that the top 1% of Americans with the highest income have as much wealth as the other 99%: Mostly true. * Percentage of Trump supporters who say the economy is very important to their support for him: 90%. * Number of Nobel laureates in economics, including the World Bank \u2019s chief economist, who signed a letter lamenting Trump for \u201cfake and misleading\u201d statistics, \u201creckless threats to start trade wars,\u201d and exaggerations on the negative effects of immigration: 19. * Impact of Clinton economic plan over 10 years, according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget:\u00a0a $200-billion increase in the national debt. * Impact of Trump economic plan over 10 years, according to the same group: a $5.3-trillion increase in the national debt. * I could go on, but I\u2019m running out of space and we\u2019re running out of time. What you need to know, dear readers, is that wherever you stand, and however optimistic or frightened you might be, you\u2019re not powerless. You can scream. ",

By Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz November 6 at 1:39 AM Follow @ktumulty Follow @danbalz In this Nov. 4, 2016, photo, voters wait in line to cast ballots at an early polling site in San Antonio. Your parents were right: Math really does matter. After all of the tumult and tedium of a long, ugly presidential campaign, Election Day is all about which candidate can win enough states to get to 270 electoral votes.(AP Photo/Eric Gay) (Eric Gay/AP) With hours until Election Day, the wildest U.S. presidential race in memory has grown more competitive in most of the battleground states, although Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton continues to hold a broader path to victory than Republican Donald Trump. The political map suggests that Clinton can lose several key states long assumed to be in her column and still reach the 270 electoral votes she needs to win. Trump, meanwhile, has a new reason for optimism, as a growing number of states appear potentially within his grasp . But to win, he would have to take nearly all of them. The 11th-hour fluidity of the race had the two campaigns scrambling the travel plans of the candidates and their top surrogates. In Trump\u2019s case, it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line; in Clinton\u2019s, as insurance against surprises Tuesday in territory she has considered hers. Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win View Graphic Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win Trump said Saturday that he and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will hold campaign events in Minnesota , a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972. A Trump campaign official insisted that the move was not a feint and that internal polling showed the Republican only three points behind Clinton there. In a sign that Democrats are suddenly anxious about Michigan , on Monday, Clinton will be in Grand Rapids and President Obama will campaign in Ann Arbor. Trump and Pence will also be in Michigan in the next two days. At a rally Saturday in Tampa, which is a bellwether of crucial Florida , Trump said his campaign is moving aggressively to seize upon openings it sees across the country. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined what he sees as his path to victory, predicting wins in big swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida, during a campaign rally on Nov. 5 in Reno, Nev. (The Washington Post) \u201cWe\u2019re going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds where we are now tied or leading,\u201d the billionaire real estate developer said. He predicted that he will win Florida and Pennsylvania \u2014 which both voted for Obama in the past two elections \u2014 and said that he is \u201cdoing phenomenally well in North Carolina ,\u201d where both candidates have invested significant time and resources over the past few weeks. Later Saturday evening, Trump was rushed off the stage by security officials at a rally in Reno, Nev., as some kind of disturbance was taking place in the front of the room where he was speaking. People in the crowd scattered as U.S. Secret Service and uniformed officers jumped the barricades to apprehend an unidentified man and lead him out of the room. Local reports said the man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident. Trump later concluded his rally without further incident. The Secret Service said in a statement that no weapon was found. Crites said he was holding \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d sign when he was tackled by people around him. Clinton held a rally in south Florida that was cut short by rain. She was set to hold an event Saturday night in Philadelphia that would feature a performance by pop star Katy Perry, whose song \u201cRoar\u201d is featured in Clinton\u2019s closing ad running in 11 battleground states. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay\u00a0Z headlined a concert for Clinton on Friday night in Cleveland. View Graphic Also on the line Tuesday is control of the Senate , where Republicans are defending 24 seats, compared with 10 for the Democrats. Trump\u2019s performance at the top of the ticket could determine whether Democrats pick up the five seats they need to regain the majority \u2014 or four, if Clinton wins and her vice president, Tim Kaine, has a tiebreaking vote. \u201cThe tightening of the race in many of these battleground states is providing a little bit of lift to our Senate races, and in some of these cases, it is going to be decisive,\u201d said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u201cI think we\u2019re really on the razor\u2019s edge,\u201d Law said of his party\u2019s prospects of holding the Senate. \u201cTrump\u2019s final position in all of this is uncertain. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s close enough to the pin yet to lift most of these races into the win column.\u201d On Thursday, the Cook Political Report predicted that Democrats will pick up four to six Senate seats, enough to gain control if Clinton is elected, but less than its earlier forecast of a five- to seven-seat gain. Republicans also are bracing to lose seats in the House, which would diminish the largest majority they have held there since 1928. Neither side, however, expects a wave large enough to restore control to Democrats, who lost it in the 2010 midterm elections. Clinton began the final weekend of campaigning with a narrow lead over Trump in the ongoing Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. Through Friday night, the rolling survey showed Clinton at 48\u00a0percent and Trump at 43\u00a0percent, among likely voters. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson was at 4 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein was at 2 percent. That\u2019s the largest margin between the two major-party candidates this past week \u2014 and a sign that Clinton may be starting to recover from a fresh round of attention to her use of a private email account and server while she was secretary of state. Clinton\u2019s decision to ignore a directive that official business be conducted where possible on a government email account has dogged her since it became public last year. It reinforced the public\u2019s long-standing doubts about her honesty and judgment, and sparked an FBI investigation of whether national security might have been compromised. A new chapter in that saga opened on Oct. 28, when FBI Director James B. Comey informed Congress that new emails , possibly pertaining to the investigation of Clinton\u2019s private account, had surfaced during a separate inquiry involving disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Before that development, Clinton appeared in control of enough states to put her well over the 270 electoral-vote mark. The tightening of the polls since then has left enough states in doubt this weekend to force a modification of those earlier predictions. A quartet of battlegrounds has dominated the Clinton campaign\u2019s calculation throughout the fall campaign: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012. Until recently, it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clinton\u2019s and the Democrats\u2019 electoral-map advantage. But as the race has tightened, Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column, and other states outside those four have potentially come into play. The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin to make up a potential deficit, should he not win Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. One force that is factoring into both sides\u2019 assessments is that more Americans are voting before Election Day, either by mail or in person. Upward of 37 million voters have already cast ballots. In key states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina, it is likely that over half the electorate will have done so before Tuesday. Those votes have not been counted, but strategists from both parties are poring over the data about who has voted and to get a preview of the contours of the 2016 electorate. The figures also give them a sense of possible trouble spots. In past years, more Democrats have participated in early voting. This year, however, it appears as though Republicans are closing the early-voting gap in many key states . But it is not clear whether this reflects greater enthusiasm and better organization on their part, or just a shift in the behavior of people who would have shown up anyway on Tuesday. Polling and early-voting data suggest a number of electoral cross currents as the race heads into its final two days. Clinton has struggled to reassemble some version of the coalition that twice elected Obama, the combination of African Americans, Hispanics, single women and young voters. Hispanic turnout appears strong, based on early-voting data. That is a major reason Democrats think Nevada will be an easy win for Clinton , although the polls are close and Trump scheduled a stop there Saturday. Clinton also has a double-digit advantage among female voters, who in 2012 accounted for 53\u00a0percent of the electorate. But the Clinton campaign is worried about turnout among African Americans. The Democratic nominee and her top surrogates have made repeated visits to major cities in an effort to stoke enthusiasm among those voters, and she will end her campaign with a big rally in Philadelphia. \u201cBased on early vote returns, we know that strong get-out-the-vote efforts in the African American communities in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and North Carolina will be needed to win on Tuesday,\u201d AFL-CIO political director Michael Podhorzer said. For Trump, one challenge is a socioeconomic split in the white vote. He has strong support among white voters without college degrees, but has seen an erosion in the traditional support for Republican nominees among white voters with college degrees. This has been a central dynamic of the campaign, and Clinton campaign officials view it as a potentially decisive factor in an electoral map that has shifted since the last election. In less than a week, the United States will have a new president-elect. These are the pivotal points in Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns that led to this moment. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The split between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters has moved states such as Colorado and Virginia toward the Democrats, while giving Trump more hope of capturing industrial states in the Midwest such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where there is a higher concentration of non-college-educated voters. Democrats remain skeptical that Trump, who boasts of his ability to bring new Republican voters to the polls, can crack what in recent cycles has been a \u201cblue wall\u201d in the upper Midwest. \u201cTrump is making a last bet on white, non-college-educated men in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d Podhorzer said. \u201cThat\u2019s been tried by Republican candidates before, and it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d Entering the final days of campaigning, Clinton maintains her advantage over Trump in voters\u2019 perceptions of their qualifications and readiness to serve as president. By 55 percent to 36 percent, likely voters say she is more qualified, and by 58 percent to 32 percent they say she has a better temperament and personality to serve as president. Clinton also is considered the candidate who better understands \u201cthe problems of people like you\u201d and has \u201cthe stronger moral character.\u201d In both cases, her advantage over Trump is in the single digits. However, on the question of who is more honest and trustworthy, voters are more evenly divided, with 44\u00a0percent citing Trump and 40\u00a0percent naming Clinton. Perceptions of Clinton\u2019s honesty have deteriorated in the final 10 days of the campaign, particularly when there was intense focus on renewed attention to her email problems.

New satellite images show that Islamic State militants in Mosul have set up daunting defenses designed to bog down advancing forces. The images taken Monday and made public by Saturday by Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor, show rows of concrete barricades, earthen berms and rubble blocking key routes leading to the core of the city. (Courtesy of Stratfor.com | Airbus via AP) \u00a0(The Associated Press) Map shows military advance into Mosul, Iraq.; 2c x 4 inches; 96.3 mm x 101 mm; \u00a0(The Associated Press) BAGHDAD \u2013 \u00a0Iraqi special forces cleared buildings on Saturday in neighborhoods they entered in eastern Mosul a day earlier, losing some ground in counterattacks after pushing out Islamic State militants in their drive to take back the city. Here is a look at the main developments on the 19th day of the Mosul Offensive: COUNTERATTACK Islamic State group fighters launched counterattacks in the thin strip of territory Iraqi special forces have recaptured, emerging from populated areas deeper in the city to target the troops with mortars and suicide car bombs. The extremists also attacked farther into territory Iraqi forces claim to control, pushing back some gains along the southern edge of the Gogjali district that Iraqi forces declared \"liberated\" on Wednesday. Fighting continued in the morning, with both sides firing mortars and automatic weapons on each other's positions, while the Iraqi troops also responded with artillery. Clashes were most intense in the al-Bakr neighborhood. Sniper duels played out from rooftops in the mostly residential areas, where the majority of buildings are two stories high. SOUTHERN APPROACHES FORTIFIED More evidence of the daunting fortifications emerged on Saturday, with satellite images showing that IS has set up defenses to bog down advancing forces, including rows of concrete barricades, earth berms and rubble blocking key routes leading to the center of the city. The images taken Monday and made public by Stratfor, a private intelligence firm based in Austin, Texas, also showed that IS fighters have cleared terrain and leveled buildings around Mosul airport and a nearby former military base on the west bank of the Tigris. The defenses \"will pose a substantial tactical challenge\" to advancing Iraqi troops as they make their way toward central Mosul, the firm said. NORTHWARD SLOG Advances toward Mosul have been slower from the south, with government troops still some 20 miles (35 kilometers) away, yet some advances are being made. Iraqi forces assaulted IS positions in the town of Hamam al-Alil on Saturday, which lies along the Tigris river about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the southernmost parts of Mosul. Kurdish television channel Rudaw broadcast live footage of Iraqi troops and armored vehicles amassing outside the city as an attack helicopter fired rockets into the city. Truckloads full of as many as 1,600 civilians may have been forcibly moved from Hamam al-Alil to Tal Afar earlier this week and may be transferred onward into Syria for possible use as human shields, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights warned Friday. Another 150 families from the town were moved to Mosul itself, the U.N. said. Advertisement ",

Sky Schaudt/KJZZ hide caption toggle caption Sky Schaudt/KJZZ Democrats argued that the ban on what critics call \"ballot harvesting\" would suppress the vote, particularly among minorities. Sky Schaudt/KJZZ Reversing a one-day-old appeals court ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court says Arizona can enforce its law banning the collection of early-voting ballots by political campaigners. The ruling means that in Arizona, the practice that critics call \"ballot harvesting\" will be a felony in Tuesday's election. The law was enacted earlier this year; since then, it's been in a tug-of-war between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 as on Friday, when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 6-5 to block the law. Today's ruling changes that. Here's how member station KJZZ in Phoenix explained it Friday: \"Critics, mostly Republicans, call the practice \"ballot harvesting\" and say it invites voter fraud. Republican lawmakers tried to halt it by passing a state law that made it a felony to turn in someone else's ballot, with an exception for relatives, caregivers and roommates. \"Democrats sued, saying ballot collection is key way to get out the vote, especially from minority households. They argued the law violated the Voting Rights Act.\" The state of Arizona immediately sought a stay on the 9th Circuit's ruling that blocked the law, H.B. 2023 , Friday. Article continues after sponsorship \"The state's stay application went to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is responsible for the geographic area that includes Arizona,\" SCOTUSblog reports . The site's Amy Howe adds that Kennedy then took two steps: He told Democrats to get their response to him by 9 a.m. ET Saturday, and he referred the stay request to the entire court. The Supreme Court issued its stay on the block shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday, \"in a brief two-sentence order,\" SCOTUSblog says. It did not provide details about how individual justices viewed the case. The full 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court is slated to review Arizona's law in January; the Supreme Court says that the challenge to the law will have to wait until then. Saturday's reversal came one day after several federal courts, including the 9th Circuit, ruled in Democrats' favor Friday, in what has become a state-by-state legal battle over voting standards and rules. As Barbara Campbell wrote for the Two-Way last night , in addition to Arizona, federal judges in North Carolina, Ohio, and Kansas respectively moved to: reinstate voters whose registration had been stripped; order all parties to refrain from any voter intimidation; and block a proof-of-citizenship requirement.

    "text": "Politics Capitol Journal Need guidance at the ballot box Tuesday? Here are four final takeaways to help you cast your vote California ballot Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press Heather Tilson deposits her ballot at the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters office on Oct. 24. Heather Tilson deposits her ballot at the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters office on Oct. 24. (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press) Here are some final mumblings before this distressing election is mercifully concluded. Yes, practically everything to be said already has been repeatedly. But not quite everything. 1. Gov. Jerry Brown has been out there in TV ads, robo-calls and campaign appearances fibbing about a ballot measure that has him panicked. It\u2019s Proposition 53, which would require statewide voter approval of any government project financed with more than $2 billion in state revenue bonds. They\u2019re bonds repaid by a project\u2019s users, such as water bill payers in the case of Brown\u2019s proposed monster twin tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. That\u2019s a $15.5-billion project. Brown is worried that Proposition 53 would collapse the water tunnels and also his sorely underfunded, $64-billion Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train project. It\u2019s tens of millions of dollars short and a potential revenue bond is the only savior in sight. So what\u2019s the fib? Brown has been telling voters \u201c53 takes away local control\u201d and also \u201cincreases the cost of roads, bridges and hospitals.\u201d The \u201clocal control\u201d pitch is just bunkum. There never has been much, if any, local control over such a massive project. Local projects just aren\u2019t that expensive. Anyway, Proposition 53 is about state \u2014 not local \u2014 bonds. The measure defines the affected projects as those \u201cfinanced, owned, operated or managed by the state.\u201d \u201c\u2018State\u2019 means the State of California,\u201d the measure spells out plainly, although the state could partner with a local entity. State,\u00a0the proposal\u2019s text continues, \u201cdoes not include a city, county \u2026 school district, community college district or special district.\u201d The University of California also isn\u2019t affected. In the Brown-financed opposition TV ads, there\u2019s a guy dressed in a firefighter\u2019s uniform. What\u2019s that about? Nobody\u2019s going to need a statewide vote to douse a brush or house fire. When there\u2019s a major natural disaster, repairs are mostly paid for by the federal government. Highway construction? It\u2019s usually funded through general obligation bonds \u2014 which long have required voter approval \u2014 and are repaid with gasoline taxes. Updates from Sacramento \u00bb When Brown warns about 53 jacking up the tab for roads, bridges and hospitals,\u00a0it\u2019s hyperbole. The state doesn\u2019t even build hospitals, except for prisons. One more thing: Brown must be listening to Donald Trump too much. Last week he told a high-powered San Francisco breakfast crowd that his corgi dog had told him to \u201cpee on 53.\u201d Cute. At least the governor is getting off Latin. 2. Just as I was about to vote against Proposition 61, which would lower the state\u2019s cost for prescription drugs, I noticed that pharmaceutical companies were spending an astronomical $109 million fighting it. If the drug companies are spending this much money, that indicates they\u2019re very worried about their future profits. And that means Proposition 61 could ultimately help us consumers. The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is being heavily outgunned. The \u201cyes\u201d campaign has spent about $17 million. Proposition 61 would forbid state agencies from paying more for a drug than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which traditionally gets the best deals. The state buys pharmaceuticals for current and retired state employees, for prisons and for poor people. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is a big booster of 61. Opponents, including many veterans, contend the drug companies would merely make up for their state revenue loss by boosting prices for everyone else. They\u2019d undoubtedly try. But that argument is reminiscent of businesses always claiming that any tax increases on them would just be passed on to consumers. The truth is it\u2019s not that easy. That\u2019s why there are hordes of lobbyists in Sacramento and Washington fighting business tax hikes. Proposition 61 might just be a tool to start forcing down prescription drug prices for everyone. And that\u2019s why the pharmaceutical companies are spending obscenely to scuttle it. 3. It seems counterintuitive and cockeyed that Californians are on the verge of discouraging cigarette smoking by dramatically raising the tobacco tax while encouraging pot smoking by legalizing it. Proposition 56 would raise the cigarette tax by $2 per pack in an effort to make smoking unaffordable for the poorest. Smoking does cause cancer. Proposition 64 would legalize marijuana just for getting high and set off a stampede of weed marketers. Studies have shown that too much pot is bad for brain cells, especially among young people. Don\u2019t bother reminding me that you\u2019d have to be 21 to legally buy cannabis. More and more kids are going to toke up. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper made sense last week when he advised other states to \u201cgo slowly and probably wait a couple of years\u201d to see how legalization goes in his state. Find out, he urged, whether there\u2019s a dramatic rise in teen toking and stoned driving. 4. It was eye-opening to read a Field poll last week on the presidential race in California. Hillary Clinton led by a whopping 20 points. But Donald Trump was favored by 16 points among born-again Christians. What? Trump\u2019s demeanor is far from the Christian-like behavior I was taught in Sunday school. Actually, Trump has been reminding me of fictional gubernatorial candidate Willie Stark \u2014 a Louisiana Huey Long knockoff \u2014 in the novel and movie \u201cAll the King\u2019s Men.\u201d Demagogue Stark pledges to do this to his political enemies once elected: \u201cNail \u2019em up.\u201d Trump vows to arrest Clinton, drawing chants from supporters of\u00a0\u201cLock her up.\u201d But Stark was right about this: \u201cIf ya don\u2019t vote, ya don\u2019t matter.\u201d` Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty.

    "text": "Privacy Policy People close to Mr. Comey say his move could actually help Mrs. Clinton if she wins. Only an independent-minded F.B.I. director, one who has shown no loyalty to Mrs. Clinton and a fierce commitment to transparency, their argument goes, will have the credibility to handle what are sure to be years of accusations of Clinton wrongdoing from Republican lawmakers. Then there is the matter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s family foundation. Keeping accusations about the foundation in the news has been a key Republican strategy to weaken Mrs. Clinton, and the F.B.I. office in New York began a preliminary investigation into it over the summer . Some agents there believe strongly that there is evidence to move forward with subpoenas, a move that has been on hold as part of longstanding policy to not do anything that could influence an election \u2014 a policy officials say Mr. Comey violated. After the election, however, authorities will most likely revisit that decision. Senior F.B.I. and Justice Department officials, including Mr. Comey, have characterized the evidence \u2014 and the investigation \u2014 as weak, according to several law enforcement officials familiar with the case. They see the case as based on little more than information from \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d a book by Peter Schweizer that asserted that foreign entities gave money to former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, and in return received favors from the State Department. F.B.I. agents, like many law enforcement officers, are often conservative-leaning. And many of today\u2019s agents came up in the bureau during the 1990s, an era of special prosecutors and mutual distrust between the Clinton White House and the F.B.I. Institutionally, though, the F.B.I. prides itself on nonpartisanship. It investigates public corruption in both parties with equal zeal and has rules and traditions that protect against partisan meddling. Mr. Comey\u2019s move, and the series of news stories that followed about politically charged investigations, have led to accusations that those rules and traditions had been cast aside. When the F.B.I. last week published 15-year-old documents about, among other things, President Clinton\u2019s pardon of the financier Marc Rich, the redacted records offered little information but renewed discussion of long-ago Clinton-related controversies, F.B.I. officials said the timing was a coincidence; the requests for the documents had been filed months ago. But it seemed to confirm the suspicions among Democrats that the F.B.I. was out to hurt Mrs. Clinton, a suggestion F.B.I. agents bristle at. Mr. Comey has sought to position himself as a fiercely independent director who is willing to speak his mind on issues of race, policing and encryption, even when his views are not shared at the Justice Department or the White House. The result has been a much higher profile for Mr. Comey than that of his predecessor, Robert Mueller, as well as for his more low-key boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many current and former Justice Department officials expressed dismay that Ms. Lynch did not personally call Mr. Comey and order him, on principle, not to disclose the latest investigative steps in the email case so close to the election. There has been some speculation that Mr. Comey would feel compelled to provide details on the status of the investigation into the new cache of emails before Election Day. But that move, which would have been controversial within the F.B.I., is now unlikely. \u201cDamn the election,\u201d said James McJunkin, a former F.B.I. assistant director, echoing the feeling of other agents. \u201cHe has to conduct the investigation without the politics. That\u2019s the important piece. That is something he already knows. That\u2019s not lost on James Comey.\u201d Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

Argus Leader 7:57 p.m. EDT November 5, 2016 x Share A small group of concerned citizens have established a small camping area in Shirley Gerjets' yard at her Rockwell City farm walking distance from the site of the Dakota Access pipeline. Bryon Houlgrave/The Register Members of the clergy join protesters against the Dakota Access crude-oil pipeline Nov. 3, 2016, in southern North Dakota near Cannon Ball. (Photo: James MacPherson, AP) Many saw the Dakota Access Pipeline's completion as a foregone conclusion before the company applied for a single permit. In South Dakota, the company behind the project obtained voluntary easements from every landowner in its path\u00a0with even vocal opponents choosing to take the deals over what were considered fruitless and expensive eminent-domain battles. Now, with most of the work complete, many still see the pipeline\u2019s operation as a matter of when, not if. But the massive groundswell of support for the anti-pipeline efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has thrown the pipeline\u2019s future into uncertainty. President Barack Obama delayed granting the company\u2019s final easement last month and said last week that a re-route around areas sensitive to the tribe\u2019s ancestral lands is a possibility. Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman David Archambault sees a re-route as a major victory, but many protesters have vowed to continue the fight until the $3.8 billion project is shut down. Rubber bullet strikes camerawoman at Dakota pipeline protest Could that happen in any realistic scenarios? Pipeline owner Energy Transfer Partners and its backers don\u2019t think so \u2014 \u00a0four states and the Army Corps of Engineers granted permits for\u00a0the pipeline, and construction is more than 75% complete \u2014 but opponents are hopeful. Here are a few of the areas opponents are focusing on as paths to a possible shutdown. 1. Standing Rock wins in court The tribe filed a federal lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers during the summer\u00a0shortly after the agency signaled its intent to approve an easement for drilling under Lake Oahe, a more than 200-mile-long reservoir on the Missouri River that extends from South Dakota into North Dakota. The tribe asked for an immediate injunction on two grounds: That the Corps failed to adequately consult with the tribe\u00a0to identify historically significant sites along the pipeline route. That granting the easement would do irreparable harm to tribal history; parts of the Standing Rock Reservation already were flooded with the creation of the lake in the 1960s. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected both arguments Sept. 9, saying the tribe was offered the chance to consult but refused until the process neared an end, and that it had no proof the current route would cause irreparable harm. That doesn\u2019t mean the case is over. The ruling was restricted to the tribe\u2019s claims on alleged violations of the National Historic Preservation Act. Authorities dismantle N.D. pipeline protesters' bridge The underlying lawsuit also argues that the Corps\u2019 permitting process violated the Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. None of those claims has been fully litigated. Archambault said Thursday during a Facebook Live stream that while he feels \u201cthe deck is stacked\u201d against indigenous people, the tribe intends to continue battling construction in court. \u201cIf there is an easement granted, we will sue,\u201d Archambault said. \u201cIf their easement is not granted, of course they\u2019ll sue.\u201d 2. The federal government delays or stops the project President Obama\u2019s announcement that a re-route of the pipeline is on the table points to another avenue for opponents. The statement this week wasn\u2019t the first time the Obama administration has pushed back against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Sorry, your Facebook check-ins at Dakota pipeline aren't confusing police Immediately following Boasberg\u2019s ruling in September, the departments of Justice, Army and Interior issued a joint statement that said the Army would not authorize construction beneath Lake Oahe, a moved that pipeline supporters fiercely criticized. Delays and re-routes add financial strain to pipeline projects and create more openings for opposition, according to Jane Fleming Kleeb of Bold Nebraska. Kleeb\u2019s group helped push for a re-route of the Keystone XL Pipeline around Nebraska\u2019s Sandhills and the Oglala Aquifer in 2011. That forced that pipeline\u2019s owner, TransCanada, to further study environmental impacts and effects on natural resources and to negotiate with more landowners, she said. Why people are checking in to Standing Rock on Facebook \u201cWhenever a re-route happens, it re-opens all those discussions,\u201d Kleeb said. The continued delays of Keystone XL forced a review hearing at the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in 2015. Ultimately, President Barack Obama chose to deny a permit for KeystoneXL, and TransCanada has filed a lawsuit. Energy Transfer Partners told The Associated Press earlier this week that it was unaware of plans for a new route in North Dakota for the Dakota Access Pipeline and remains \u201cconfident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\u201d Dakota Access pipeline protests draw contrasts to Bundy Even if the company gets its easement, it would be subject to congressional review, and Kleeb sees the potential for elected officials like Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. and a pipeline opponent, to call for more delays. Josh Nelson, policy director for the progressive protest group Credo Action, hopes to see President Obama or the next president shutter Dakota Access altogether. More than 378,000 people have signed a petition asking the White House to take executive action and shut down construction its construction. \u201cThe only resolution that we\u2019re going to accept is shutting it down entirely,\u201d Nelson said. 3. Re-routes or delays could endanger the project\u2019s financial feasibility Delays alone could do major financial damage to Energy Transfer Partners. The company indicated as much in court filings in the Standing Rock lawsuit. In an Aug. 18 declaration to the court, Joey Mahmoud,\u00a0Dakota Access vice president, wrote that the company had committed to completing the pipeline by Jan. 1, less than two months from now. Shailene Woodley faces January trial in pipeline protest \u201cThe long-term transportation contracts give shippers a right to terminate their commitments if (Dakota Access Pipeline) is not in full service per the contract deadline,\u201d Mahmoud wrote. A delay in the start of operations would cost about $913 million, Mahmoud wrote, rising to more than $1 billion by 2018. Stopping work would cause \u201cgrave and irreparable impacts to DAPL (the Dakota Access Pipeline), its workers, the landowners, economy, both the state and federal government\u00a0and the environment.\u201d Opponents now speculate that financial harm from protest-related delays alone could be enough to stop the pipeline\u2019s completion. Shailene Woodley pleads not guilty in Dakota Access Pipeline protest \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear they\u2019re not going to have oil flowing on Jan. 1,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, research director of the nonprofit outfit Oil Change International. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen. They\u2019re going to have to renegotiate those contracts.\u201d When the project was announced in 2014, the price of oil was $70 to $80 a barrel. The long-term contracts common in the pipeline industry might be more difficult to lock in with oil at $45 a barrel, Stockman said. The embrace of natural gas and the ramp-up of U.S. energy production have played into the extended price slump, and energy analysts are concerned about long-term lows. On Tuesday, the chief financial officer of Royal Dutch Shell, Simon Henry, said the world will hit peak oil demand within five to 15 years. Wisconsin guard, tribal member Koenig joins pipeline protest \u201cThe world in which they would renegotiate those contracts is not the world in which they negotiated the original contracts,\u201d Stockman said. However, on Friday, company spokeswoman Vicki Granado said the January date would not affect shipping volumes or the project as a whole. \u201cThere is no Jan. 1 deadline,\u201d Granado wrote in email. 4. Iowa landowners win in court Most of the attention focused on the Dakota Access Pipeline is aimed at protest camps in North Dakota, where thousands have visited and hundreds have been arrested in clashes with law enforcement. But opponents have another front line in their battle against the pipeline: the corn fields and courtrooms of Iowa. Bernie Sanders, Native Americans say oil pipeline will poison drinking water The state has had its own protests and arrests as well, said a former state lawmaker and radio host\u00a0who opposes the pipeline, Ed Fallon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more people arrested in Iowa over this than we\u2019ve ever seen, even going back to the Vietnam War,\u201d Fallon said. Pipeline opponents now are using an eminent-domain law that Fallon championed in 2006 in hopes of booting Dakota Access from the state. The law says eminent domain can be used only\u00a0to take property for defined public purposes. Army Corps halts work at lake near Sioux tribe despite judge's order Water, electricity, and natural gas delivery are explicitly included in the statute. Crude oil is not. Des Moines lawyer Bill Hanigan represents 14 landowners in a half dozen Iowa counties where land was taken for pipeline construction through eminent domain. Hanigan\u2019s clients argue that both Iowa law and the U.S. Constitution bar the use of eminent domain to condemn property for a crude-oil project. Q&A: The 4-state, $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline \u201cCrude oil has no value unless it\u2019s refined. It\u2019s a raw material,\u201d Hanigan said. \u201cWe need lumber to build homes, so would we condemn farms to build someone a private highway to haul lumber?\u201d Hanigan believes the already built pipeline beneath his clients\u2019 property and every barrel of oil that flows through it are considered trespassing. Next month, Hanigan and lawyers for Dakota Access will appear before a judge. The losing side of the judge\u2019s subsequent opinion likely will\u00a0appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court, he said. ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Ms. Ayotte has struggled mightily with the candidacy of Mr. Trump, at first giving him lukewarm support. And when asked during a debate if she saw Mr. Trump as a role model for youths , she replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She then put out a statement contradicting the remark, which became a bludgeon for Ms. Hassan. Ms. Ayotte finally dumped Mr. Trump, a dizzying ride that may have tainted her brand of independence. Ms. Hassan has had her own troubles with Mrs. Clinton. The New Hampshire race has been staggeringly expensive, with over $100 million spent on behalf of the two candidates, the majority of which has supported an all-out assault of television advertising. \u201cI should be embarrassed to have either of you as my senator,\u201d Larry Gray, a doctor in Portsmouth, groused during a Rotary Club meeting where Ms. Hassan spoke. Only the Senate race in Pennsylvania, which has nearly 10 times the population of New Hampshire, has attracted more outside money. Outside spending on Senate races nationally has passed half a billion dollars this cycle, a record. Photo Democratic prospects for regaining a majority in the Senate depend on the outcome of close races in states like New Hampshire. Credit Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist for The New York Times As in other states, there are messy battles outside the Senate contest. Representative Frank C. Guinta, Republican of New Hampshire, is embroiled in a campaign finance scandal that caused Ms. Ayotte to call for his resignation. His opponent, for the fourth time , is former Representative Carol Shea-Porter. \u201cThe Republicans are not helping themselves down ballot,\u201d said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cWhen you have a party that is not unified, it makes it difficult for them to win, especially when they are not the majority party.\u201d Ms. Hassan hopes to be aided by an elaborate turnout operation conducted by the Clinton campaign. But Ms. Ayotte is unlikely to get any corollary benefit from Mr. Trump, who Republicans complain has a limited get-out-the-vote operation. \u201cI have no confidence in the Trump ground game,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party , noting the swarms of volunteers for groups like Planned Parenthood and other Clinton supporters he has seen in the state, and the bumbling efforts of Trump volunteers, a complaint that has been echoed in many other states. \u201cThe idea that there is this team of Republicans working together is just not true.\u201d Still, Ms. Ayotte is clearly competitive in a race where both sides believe they have a slight advantage, with scant real-time proof either way. \u201cBoth candidates are both under 50 percent,\u201d said Rich Killion, a Republican strategist here. \u201cBut the weight of the stuff that has been thrown on Ayotte has not had the marginal effect Democrats want to open up the gap.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The story is largely the same in North Carolina, where the Republican incumbent, Senator Richard M. Burr, started late; and in Indiana and Missouri, where the Democratic challenger, former Senator Evan Bayh , and the Republican incumbent, Roy Blunt, have taken a beating for their lobbying ties . In Nevada, where Democrats are desperate to hold onto the seat of the retiring Harry Reid, Mr. Trump has been seen as a drag on the efforts of Representative Joe Heck to defeat the Democrat, Catherine Cortez Masto. There are also clear signs of a tightening race in Wisconsin, where the Republican incumbent, Ron Johnson, has been aided by an enormous cash infusion from outside groups in his race against former Senator Russ Feingold, who held a double-digit lead for much of the year. In Pennsylvania, Senator Patrick J. Toomey may also be vulnerable to a negative Trump effect in the race against Katie McGinty. Few know where the election is heading, even as so many are deeply invested in the outcome. \u201cI have two bumper stickers on my car,\u201d Mr. Cullen said, one for Ayotte and one for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a former Republican candidate for president, \u201cwhich is another way of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t blame me.\u2019\u201d Mr. Cullen added, \u201cI feel like I have never had an election in which I have had less confidence to say how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington.

    "text": "In final weekend, Clinton focuses on her 'firewall' while Trump hits battleground states Donald Trump Campaigns In Key States During Weekend Ahead Of General Presidential Election Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Donald and Melania Trump arrive for a campaign rally at Wilmington International Airport Donald and Melania Trump arrive for a campaign rally at Wilmington International Airport (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Noah Bierman , Chris Megerian and Michael Finnegan Contact Reporters Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump distilled the campaign styles they\u2019ve showcased for more than a year into a final blitz of intense campaigning as they wrapped up\u00a0their pitches for the White House . Clinton, true\u00a0to type, chose a tightly disciplined path, holding rallies and events in Florida and Pennsylvania on Saturday\u00a0in hopes of building a traditional electoral firewall by appealing to women, minorities and millennials. Trump, who made it this far largely\u00a0on improvisation, zigzagged across the country, including a few states where he trails, part of his campaign\u2019s plan to reshape the political map\u00a0with a come-from-behind victory. \u201cWe're going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds,\u201d Trump said in Tampa, Fla., beginning a day that also took him to\u00a0North Carolina, Nevada and Colorado. Trump vowed he would also go to Minnesota, a state he added to a frenetic Sunday schedule that \u00a0already includes stops in Iowa, Michigan,\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0and Virginia. Polls show him\u00a0trailing by about five percentage points\u00a0in Minnesota, a state that has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1972, a longer streak\u00a0than any other state. But Trump, whose path to victory is more narrow than Clinton\u2019s, has shown a willingness to upend conventional thinking throughout the campaign \u2014\u00a0to the frustration of mainstream Republican strategists and the delight of his enthusiastic supporters. His communications director, Jason Miller, told reporters in a conference\u00a0call Saturday that internal polls show many states, including Michigan, Minnesota\u00a0and New Mexico, are closer than public polls suggest, thanks to a late surge of excitement combined with tough headlines for Clinton related to the\u00a0ongoing FBI email investigation. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, insisted that scheduled visits from Clinton and President Obama to Michigan in the campaign\u2019s final days are not a sign of concern that Democrats are losing ground in the traditionally blue state. Instead, he told reporters, it\u2019s a matter of ending in states where voters cast more of their ballots on election day, rather than early voting.\u00a0 \u201cTrump is basically going everywhere,\u201d Mook told reporters. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the more time he spends in Minnesota and Nevada the better. We have tried to calibrate our schedule to be in states at the peak time for voting.\u201d\u00a0 Clinton, hoarse yet energetic, rallied supporters Saturday in\u00a0Pembroke Pines, Fla., one of the most important Democratic strongholds in the country, as a downpour cut short her first big speech of the day. She stopped at Miami\u2019s Haitian and Cuban American neighborhoods, hoping to boost crucial minority turnout, and she publicized a phone call with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , trying to close the sale with liberal and millennial holdouts.\u00a0 \"Let's make it happen,\" she told supporters at a field office in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti. \u00a0 \"Knock on doors!\" people chanted. She continued to rely on the large stable of celebrities on her side, including\u00a0a planned concert with pop star Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Saturday night, the day after appearing\u00a0in Cleveland with\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. Wins in Florida and Pennsylvania, where Clinton holds narrow leads in polls, would make a Trump victory nearly impossible.\u00a0 Unlike Florida, where nearly 6 million voters\u00a0had already cast ballots by Saturday morning, Pennsylvania does not have early voting, so Clinton is focusing more attention there in the closing days of the campaign. Democrats, who trailed Republicans in mail-in\u00a0balloting in Florida, made up ground with in-person early voting, holding an overall\u00a0lead among early voters of about 7,000 by early Saturday. That was less than their lead of about 100,000 votes at the same point \u00a0in 2012, indicating the state remains up for grabs. Veteran Nevada journalist Jon Ralston reported Saturday that a surge of early voting by Democrats in Clark County has all but killed Trump\u2019s chances in the state. But\u00a0 Bill Dunn , director of early and absentee voting for the Republican National Committee, said Trump can make up ground in rural counties and with strong turnout from Republicans on election day. As polls have tightened, Trump has tried to minimize the risk of any last-minute mistakes by sticking to scripted remarks on blocking Syrian refugees from entering the U.S., building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and other staples of his campaign, including scathing rhetorical assaults on Clinton\u2019s integrity. \u201cIf she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests would rob this country blind,\u201d he said in North Carolina. But he veered off script\u00a0a bit more at his Tampa rally, where he\u00a0could not resist cracking a lewd joke as he reveled in the FBI\u2019s search of a \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of new emails\u00a0for links to Clinton's private server, messages that were found on the computer of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner . \u201cAnthony Weiner has probably every classified email ever sent,\u201d Trump told a few thousand supporters in Tampa. \u201cAnd knowing this guy, he probably studied every single one, in between using his machine for other purposes.\u201d Trump also took a shot at profanity used by Jay Z at\u00a0the\u00a0Clinton concert. \u201cI actually like Jay Z, but you know the language last night \u2013 oooooohhhh. Oooooohhhhh,\u201d said Trump, whose own foul language is featured in Clinton\u2019s advertising. \u201cCan you imagine if I said that? He used every word in the book.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never said what he said in my life, but that shows you the phoniness of politicians, and the phoniness of the whole system,\u201d Trump said, connecting the riff with his core anti-establishment message. Clinton has had the luxury of a much larger cast of high-powered campaign surrogates on her side, including\u00a0her husband Bill, who spoke in Florida on Saturday; Sanders, who was in Iowa and Colorado, and\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden in Pennsylvania with his wife, Jill. Obama spoke in North Carolina on Friday. Trump has tried to counter with his family. Melania Trump made another rare appearance on the trail Saturday, standing beside her husband in North Carolina, two days after she gave her first solo speech of the general election in Pennsylvania. The appearance came a day after the\u00a0Associated Press, citing newly obtained documents, reported that Melania Trump, who was born in Slovenia,\u00a0earned $20,056\u00a0for\u00a010 U.S. modeling jobs\u00a0before she obtained a work visa. Melania\u00a0Trump moved to New York in 1996, obtaining a work visa about seven weeks after her arrival according to the AP,\u00a0and became a citizen in 2006. Trump would not allow it to interfere with his immigration message.\u00a0When the the crowd chanted, \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d Trump goaded them on. \u201cYou know what? The harder they fight us, the higher it goes,\u201d he responded.\u00a0 Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty. Gen.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 5, 2016, 12:35 PM Supreme Court OKs Arizona ballot collection ban Email Last Updated Nov 5, 2016 4:12 PM EDT PHOENIX -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, dealing a blow to Democratic get out the vote efforts just days before the presidential election. The order from the nation\u2019s highest court overturns an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law. Democratic groups had already geared up to begin helping voters deliver their ballots to the polls, and the Supreme Court decision calls into question what happens to ballots they have already legally collected from voters in the approximately 20 hours that the law was blocked. Collecting early ballots is especially effective among minority communities. Democrats allege the law hurts minorities\u2019 ability to vote. Audience members listen as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign rally at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, Nov. 2, 2016. Reuters/Brian Snyder The decision comes just days ahead of a presidential election that has Arizona Democrats hoping to win the traditionally Republican state. But polls show Republican Sen. John McCain has a solid double-digit lead over his Democratic opponent, Ann Kirkpatrick, CBS News correspondent John Blackstone reports. Even she acknowledged McCain\u2019s iconic status in the state. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Kirkpatrick told Blackstone last month. \u201cI have voted for John McCain in the past, and he\u2019s changed.\u201d Arizona filed an emergency appeal hours after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the law Friday. Justice Anthony Kennedy referred the case to the entire Supreme Court, and the court issued a brief order overturning the appeals court. The 9th Circuit will now consider the law in a January session that it set when it blocked the law. Republican lawmakers approved the law earlier this year over the objection of minority Democrats. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey called it a common-sense effort to protect the integrity of elections and eliminate voter fraud. A split 9th U.S. Circuit panel had said that by blocking the law it was preserving the status quo for Tuesday\u2019s election, which could come down to the wire in Arizona as Democrats spend heavily to get out the vote from Latinos and others angered by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant comments. Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote that the decision will not add or remove any valid votes. He said the law criminalized delivering someone else\u2019s early ballot, which would still be counted. Both parties have used ballot collection to boost turnout during elections by going door to door and asking voters if they have completed their mail-in ballots. Voters who have not are urged to do so, and the volunteers offer to take the ballots to election offices. Democrats, however, use it more effectively. The law does not prevent voters\u2019 family members or caregivers from turning in ballots. Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham called Saturday\u2019s decision a smart one since the law has been in effect since before the August primary. Leaving the 9th Circuit decision in place \u201cdoes nothing more than confuse the voters.\u201d He criticized Democratic groups for rushing to collect ballots on Friday, saying they compromised people who may trust them to deliver their vote to the polls. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Republican presidential candidate was making a campaign speech at a Reno convention center when there was some kind of scuffle in the crowd in front of the podium and two Secret Service agents came and quickly brought Trump offstage. A man in a blue sweater was tackled before being escorted out by law enforcement before being held in a bathroom inside the venue. Evan Vucci/AP Photo A man, at center with blue sweater, is escorted by law enforcement officers moments after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was rushed offstage by Secret Service agents during a campaign rally in Reno, Nev., on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. When Trump returned to the stage, he thanked the Secret Service. \"Nobody said it was going to be easy for us. But we will never be stopped. Never ever be stopped. I want to thank the secret service. These guys are fantastic. They don\u2019t get enough credit,\" Trump said. The Secret Service released a statement saying that the commotion started when someone in the rally shouted \"Gun,\" but said that no gun was found. \"Immediately in front of the stage, an unidentified individual shouted 'gun.' Secret Service agents and Reno Police Officers immediately apprehended the subject. Upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found,\" the statement said. The Secret Service and the Reno Police Department were investigating the incident, the statement said. When contacted by ABC News, Reno Police Department said that they had little detail, only that they had initially been informed that there was a \"medical incident\" that precipitated the commotion. In a statement, Trump said, \"\"I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response. I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us - we will make America great again!\" Trump now heads to Denver, Colorado, where he was scheduled to host his fourth rally of the day.

    "text": "Phil Rosenthal Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A trio of Cubs playing themselves -- David Ross, Dexter Fowler and Anthony Rizzo \u2013 were exotic dancers for a dead grandmother live from New York on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d the first stop on their post-World Series tour of late-night television. Later in the program, joined by \u201cSNL\u201d alumnus and longtime Cubs fan Bill Murray, they returned in matching straw hats and Cubs sweaters to (sort of) sing the fan anthem \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d in the guise of having won a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d version of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d \u201cThis is the best thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Fowler said flatly to little studio audience response. If both bits seemed awkwardly tacked on, it\u2019s understandable \u201cSNL\u201d would run a \u201cW\u201d flag up the pole in a bid to catch a bit of the national buzz the Cubs have generated with their first World Series championship in 108 years. After all, the decisive Game 7 on Wednesday averaged 40 million viewers on Fox, 5.6 million more people than this year\u2019s Academy Awards. The \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d bit, at least, was innocuous. As for the exotic dancer sketch, well, for fans keeping score at home, what might have been a wild pitch should probably go down as an error. The premise: A grandmother (played by Aidy Bryant who\u2019s remarrying is treated to a surprise bachelorette party. The shock of the unexpected celebration kills her instantly, but this goes unnoticed by both the guests and a pair of dancers (one played by guest host Benedict Cumberbatch). The dancers rubbed up against dead grandma, sprayed her with whipped cream to be licked off her. Then they announced that, as a special reward, actual Cubs players would perform. Fowler asked who wanted a \u201cgranny slam.\u201d Ross said not to worry because\u00a0 \u201cGrampa Ross\" would \"take real good care.\u201d Rizzo said something about \u201ca triple-header.\u201d Then they (sort of) danced. Even within the pantheon of sports stars on \u201cSNL,\u201d it wasn\u2019t quite was more Derek Jeter in drag than Peyton Manning nailing a hapless kid with a bullet pass. No one will confuse any of it with Nancy Kerrigan skating with Chris Farley, O.J. Simpson as a Conehead, Joe Montana as an extremely sincere roommate or Michael Jordan plagued by self doubts and telling himself: \u201cI'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!\" The Cubs are going to get more practice in the days to come. Just to start, on Monday night, Rizzo, Fowler and Ben Zobrist reportedly are scheduled to visit Jimmy Fallon on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show,\" while Kris Bryant is penciled in for ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d But even if it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019re going to quit their day jobs. philrosenthal@chicagotribune.com ",

Got it A man was led away by security personnel after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was rushed offstage at a rally on Nov. 5 in Reno, Nev. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) By Jose A. DelReal , Anne Gearan and Ed O'Keefe November 6 at 1:30 AM Follow jdelreal Follow @agearan Follow @edatpost RENO \u2014 Donald Trump was rushed off stage Saturday night during a campaign rally here as security officials swarmed, but the candidate emerged back on stage after a few minutes and finished his speech. The U.S. Secret Service later said in a statement that it took action after \u201can unidentified individual shouted \u2018gun\u2019\u201d in front of the stage. Agents apprehended the person, but found no gun, the statement said, adding that an investigation into the incident continues. The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident, according to reports. He said he was holding a \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d sign. \u201cWhen I pulled out the sign, people around me were trying to grab the sign,\u201d Crites told reporters, according to reports on the local Fox and NBC affiliate websites. \u201cAnd so all that was occurring was booing, of course. That\u2019s what you would expect.\u201d People from the surrounding crowd tackled him, Crites said. They started \u201ckicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me,\u201d Crites said. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Trump concluded his rally without further incident. The GOP presidential nominee later released a statement thanking the Secret Service and local law enforcement for their \u201cfast and professional response,\u201d adding that \u201cnothing will stop us \u2014 we will make America great again!\u201d Meanwhile, a press bus carrying reporters covering Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen Tim Kaine\u2019s stops in Florida was hit at high speed, according to reporters traveling with the senator. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus, according to reporters in his motorcade. Earlier in the day, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign announced she will campaign in Michigan on Monday, as polls show her once-comfortable lead in the state eroding and as Trump eyes it as a potential way to come from behind in the hunt for electoral votes. That announcement from the Clinton campaign came as Trump also rejiggered his itinerary, making plans for last-minute stops in Virginia, where Clinton has led but Republicans are catching up. The GOP nominee spent Saturday hopscotching the country, rallying with supporters in North Carolina , as well as Florida , Colorado and Nevada \u2014 and he announced plans to visit Minnesota , a traditionally Democratic state where polls showing him trailing by about five points. In his speech in Nevada late Saturday, Trump attacked elections officials for allowing a predominantly Hispanic early voting site in the Las Vegas area to stay open for \u201chours and hours.\u201d President Obama will also campaign in Michigan on Monday, suggesting that Democrats see danger signs there. Clinton will be in Grand Rapids, Obama in Ann Arbor. Former president Bill Clinton will make a stop in Lansing on Sunday. [ Clinton maintains narrow four-point edge, pushing past concerns about honesty ] \u201cThere are just three days left in this most consequential election,\u201d Clinton told a cheering crowd of about 10,000 an open-air rally and concert in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Clinton noted the millions of people of have voted early and urged Pennsylvania voters to help \u201csend a message\u201d about American values and ideals. \u201cI believe they are standing up for a hopeful, inclusive vision of America and I\u2019m asking you to stand up for that same vision,\u201d Clinton said. Over the last two weeks much of Clinton\u2019s focus has been on Florida and North Carolina, as well as Nevada, where early voting is now winding down. But her campaign manager Robby Mook, conceded to reporters on Saturday that \u201cwe have seen tightening in the Midwest generally this cycle, and we are taking that seriously.\u201d Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters Saturday that in addition to a previously announced stop in Manchester, N.H., on Sunday night, Clinton will add a rally in Cleveland earlier Sunday. On Monday in addition to Michigan, Clinton will add a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Another large evening rally had also been announced for Philadelphia that night. Palmieri said that Khizr Khan will speak at the New Hampshire rally. Khan is the father of fallen soldier Humayun Khan, whose challenge to Trump over the Republican\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration was among the most memorable moments of the Democratic convention. Trump\u2019s focus on Saturday night was Nevada, where polls show the race tied. Campaigning in Reno, Trump denounced a decision by elections officials to keep open an early voting site \u201cfor hours and hours.\u201d Early voting totals in Clark County, Nev. , which encompasses Las Vegas, topped 57,000, according to local officials. A supermarket doubling as an early-voting site in the county was allowed to stay open for two additional hours on Friday night as thousands of people remained in line to vote. It is customary for state elections officials across the country to authorize keeping a polling site open later if there are long lines at closing time. Regardless, Trump claimed that officials allowed Clinton supporters to \u201cbus and bring Democratic voters in. Folks, it\u2019s a rigged system. It\u2019s a rigged system and we\u2019re going to beat it. We\u2019re going to beat it. I\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s a rigged system.\u201d [ An early sign Trump is being out-organized: A big Democratic advantage in Nevada voting ] Trump continued his emphasis on Clinton\u2019s emails controversy throughout the day Saturday, citing the FBI\u2019s announcement last week that it would revive an inquiry into her use of a private email server at the State Department. In Reno, he said that if Clinton were elected, her presidency would lead to \u201can unprecedented constitutional crisis.\u201d \u201cWe could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt, of course that\u2019s what we have right now under Obama anyway,\u201d he told the crowd in Reno. \u201cWe need a government that can work, and work well from day one for the American people. That would be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a far-reaching criminal investigation.\u201d In the aftermath of the event\u2019s disruption, when security officers removed Trump from the stage and later said they found no weapon, Trump campaign aides and the candidate\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted a supporter who credited Trump for returning to the stage after an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d and noted that Clinton had cut an event short earlier Saturday in Florida because of rain. Trump, Pence and key campaign surrogates also will swing through Virginia this weekend and into Monday. Trump will hold a 10 p.m. rally Sunday at a fairgrounds in the Northern Virginia swing territory of Loudoun County, his campaign announced on Saturday. Pence was scheduled to appear at a suburban Richmond Saturday afternoon and at a rally at George Mason University at 8 p.m. Saturday. Two of Trump\u2019s children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump \u2014 are planning stops in Northern Virginia on Sunday and Monday, respectively. In the closing days of the campaign, polling averages compiled by The Washington Post continue to show a close contest in several battleground states. In Michigan, Clinton now holds just a two-point edge over Trump, 43 to 41 percent. She also holds a slim lead in New Hampshire (43-41), which accounts for the renewed attention there in the closing days. In Colorado, Clinton is up 43 percent to 41 percent. In Arizona, Trump leads by three points (46-43). Clinton is ahead by six points in New Mexico (40-34) and five points in North Carolina (48-43), Pennsylvania (47-42) and Wisconsin (45-40). She\u2019s up by four points in Virginia (45-41). Trump holds a five-point lead in Ohio (46-41), where Clinton held a star-studded campaign rally on Friday night with rapper Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, his wife. The race remains tick-tock tight in Nevada, where the candidates are tied at 44 percent each. In Florida, Clinton has a one-point, 47 to 46 percent advantage. Trump leads in Georgia (47-45); Iowa (46-41); and Utah (35-28) where third-party candidate Evan McMullin has been polling well. Poll averages calculated by The Washington Post for Clinton and Trump reflect recent polls that also include McMullin, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein where they are on the ballot and where results are available. As the race enters its final stretch, the Clinton campaign continues to push back aggressively against the FBI\u2019s decision to revive the inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email. Campaigning in Florida on Saturday, Kaine (D-Va.), the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, sharply criticized the FBI and its director, James Comey, for the development. In an interview with the Fusion television network, Kaine faulted Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election. Comey\u2019s decision to alert Congress about his review of the Clinton case \u201csuggests that it\u2019s probably more likely explained that [Comey] knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve but there were people within the FBI actively working \u2014 actively working \u2014 to try to help the Trump campaign,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cThis just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of [the FBI].\u201d John Wagner, Katie Zezima, Robert Barnes, Sarah Parnass and Sean Sullivan in Washington and Laura Vozzella in Richmond contributed to this report.

He has also called upon former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to hit the trail for him in the closing days of the campaign. \"We don't need Jay Z to fill up arenas. We do it the old-fashioned way. We do it the old-fashioned way, folks. We fill them up because we love what we're saying and you want to make America great again,\" Trump said during his Tampa rally, a sentiment he has reiterated. Clinton has been able to roll out a robust roster of Democratic supporters, ranging from lawmakers to celebrities. Vice President Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Chelsea Clinton all hit the trail to stump for her on Saturday. Recent polls have shown a tightening race just three days before the election. Clinton on Friday made a stop in Michigan \u2014 a state once thought to be solidly blue but surveys suggest is now a tossup state. The Democrat has largely bypassed Michigan in favor of states with early voting. Vaughn Hillyard ",

    "text": "Growing Up In Protected Americana, Hillary Clinton Looked Outside The Cocoon It was clear that was the general election challenge Clinton and her team were anticipating when she gave the big speech at her official campaign kickoff event on Roosevelt Island in New York. \"Now there may some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song,\" Clinton told a crowd estimated at 5,000. \"A song called, 'Yesterday.' You know the one. All our troubles look as though they're here to stay. And we need a place to hide away. They believe in yesterday. And you're lucky I didn't try singing that, I'll tell you.\" According to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, behind the scenes, senior advisers were especially concerned about Rubio, the Florida senator. \"I'm beginning to worry more about Rubio than the others,\" Joel Benenson, the campaign's pollster and chief strategist wrote in February 2015. \"He has stronger right wing cred than Jeb and he's finding a way to the middle enough for now and he will be the most exciting choice to Republicans. Could pose a real threat with Latinos etc.\" But in the end, Trump outlasted the entire Republican field, leaving Clinton to face an opponent with well-known shortcomings and an opposition research file bigger than Trump Tower. Hillary Clinton won the opponent lottery. Not just in the primary, when Warren and Biden stayed out, but in the general election as well. There were certainly risks in facing Trump: his ability to dominate news coverage, the difficulty in pinning him down on policy. Trump's taxes, business dealings, treatment of women and tendency to say and tweet things that hurt him with voters were a constant throughout the general election campaign. But many Republicans and even some Democrats believe, with a more disciplined opponent, Clinton would easily have been facing defeat on Election Day. A Team Of (Former) Rivals For the first time in at least 100 years, a sitting U.S. president has campaigned vigorously for his chosen successor. In the closing weeks of the campaign, President Barack Obama has been a regular fixture on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton, pitching her to voters more effectively than she could pitch herself.

Steve Pope/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Steve Pope/Getty Images Hillary and Bill Clinton attend the 37th Harkin Steak Fry on Sept. 14, 2014, in Indianola, Iowa. Steve Pope/Getty Images With an approval rating solidly above 50 percent and his natural ease on the stump, Obama essentially doubled Clinton's firepower in swing states. But he wasn't the only one. First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders campaigned hard for Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine. Clinton won Sanders over by agreeing to modify her debt-free public college proposal to more closely track with Sanders' free college plan. He started slowly, but by the end of the race Sanders was traversing the country trying to convince his young supporters to go to the polls and not vote for a third-party candidate or Trump. The ally Clinton always had making the case on her behalf was her husband, former President Bill Clinton. By contrast, Trump's surrogate operation was thin. There were no former presidents or even former Republican presidential nominees, save Bob Dole, who appeared at the Republican National Convention. Mitt Romney actively opposed Trump and relatives said both former presidents Bush would likely vote for Clinton. Clinton's 'Damn Emails' (And Wall Street Speeches) From before Hillary Clinton even entered the race for president, her campaign faced headwinds of her own making. There was the private email server she used for official business while secretary of state and there were the lucrative speaking engagements during the time after she left the State Department and before her campaign officially began. Enlarge this image Hillary Clinton speaks to the media after keynoting a Women's Empowerment Event at the United Nations March 10, 2015 in New York City, just days after it was revealed she used a private email server while secretary of state.

Yana Paskova/Getty Images When the news of Clinton's server broke, top officials in the campaign were seemingly blindsided. In hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, campaign chairman-in-waiting John Podesta emailed campaign manager-in-waiting Robby Mook asking if he knew the extent of the email issue in advance. \"Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of,\" Mook wrote at the time. Clinton's campaign has refused to verify the authenticity of emails released by WikiLeaks and has also avoided commenting on any of the content. Clinton's campaign says the release of emails hacked from Podesta's personal Gmail account is part of a Russian effort to interfere with the U.S. election. In one chain, Podesta and Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton ally, complain about the email story coming out so late in the game. \"Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,\" she asked. In a later email, Tanden answered her own question: \"They wanted to get away with it.\" Bernie Sanders gave Clinton a gift when he took the email server off the table as an issue in the Democratic primary during the first debate. \"Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,\" said Sanders. Clinton jumped in, \"Thank you, thank you,\" she said. \"Me, too!\" Right after that came the 11-hour hearing of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Clinton maintained a calm, somber demeanor throughout and left with House Republicans revealing no new bombshells. Enlarge this image Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22, 2015. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22, 2015. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images That October was one of the best months of her campaign. But Clinton's email troubles were far from over. Just as she was launching into the general election, only hours before Clinton was to campaign with President Obama for the first time, FBI Director James Comey held a press conference. On the face of it, his announcement was good news. The FBI had been investigating whether Clinton's use of a private email server violated the law, whether she and her aides had improperly handled classified material. He said no reasonable prosecutor would pursue the case and he was recommending against charging Clinton or her aides with a crime. \"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" Comey said. His statement raised more questions than it answered and brought the email saga back into focus for voters. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, delegates began chanting \"lock her up!\" That chant became a regular feature of Trump rallies. ",

    "text": "US Supreme Court Reinstates Arizona Ballot Collection Ban By bob christie, associated press PHOENIX \u0097 Nov 5, 2016, 8:04 PM ET 0 Shares Email The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, stepping into a contentious political issue days before the presidential election and dealing a blow to Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts. The unsigned order from the nation's highest court overturns an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law and drew celebration from Democrats. Groups immediately launched renewed efforts to help voters deliver their ballots to the polls, then stopped after the high-court ruling. The Supreme Court decision called into question what happens to ballots that were legally collected from voters in the 20 hours that the law was blocked. Arizona filed an emergency appeal hours after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the law Friday. Justice Anthony Kennedy referred the case to the entire Supreme Court, and the court issued a brief order overturning the appeals court. The 9th Circuit will now consider the law in a January session that it set when it blocked the law. The high court decision is unusual because it takes at least five votes to issue such an order and the court is split 4-4 along conservative-liberal lines after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia this year. That means at least one of the court's liberals agreed to allow the law to go back into effect, and no dissents were noted in the order. The case is one of a slew of election-related challenges filed by Democrats across the nation in the lead-up to Tuesday's election. Democrats in six states asked federal judges to block what they alleged were voter intimidation tactics planned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, his backers or the state and national GOP. A judge in Ohio issued an injunction blocking the tactics Friday, but judges in Arizona and Nevada refused to do so. Lawsuits in Michigan and Pennsylvania are awaiting hearings, while a federal judge in New Jersey refused to sanction the Republican National Committee for violating terms of a more than three-decade old agreement blocking voter intimidation there. Republicans deny the allegations. In Arizona, Democratic efforts to extend voter registration by a day because the deadline fell on a holiday were rejected this week. And an effort to force ballots cast by voters in the wrong precinct to be counted was denied by the 9th Circuit. Regarding ballots collected during the time the law was blocked, the Arizona Secretary of State's office urged groups to turn them in Monday. County elections officials have said they lack authority to enforce the law and any valid ballot they receive through any means would be counted. \"All of those ballots, regardless of whether or not they were collected as a part of a lot of ballots, they were all going to be counted anyway. There was never any danger to voters,\" said Matt Roberts, spokesman for Secretary of State Michele Reagan. But state Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham said the Democratic groups should return the ballots to voters. The party has trained poll watchers to observe people who return multiple ballots and report them to election officials. \"Because now it's up to the voter to bring it into the polling place\" Graham said. He also criticized Democrats for rushing to collect ballots knowing the Supreme Court was poised to act. Democratic state Rep. Martin Quezada, who represents a heavily minority metro-Phoenix district, said there should be no legal liability for collecting during the window when the law was blocked. Backers of his campaign collected some ballots after the 9th Circuit ruling. \"We made a concerted effort to ensure that we documented the time when we collected these ballots, so there's proof that we collected them during that time,\" Quezada said. \"Now we just have to go turn them in first thing Monday morning and we don't expect there to be any problems with that.\" The Arizona Attorney General's Office said it would review all elections-based complaints on a case-by-case basis and declined further comment. Collecting early ballots is especially effective in minority communities, and Democrats alleged the law hurts minorities' ability to vote. The last week before an election is the most critical time for their get-out-the-vote efforts, because it is too late to mail back an early ballot. They must be dropped off at an election office if they are to be counted. Arizona has more than 3.5 million registered voters, and 2.3 million of them signed up to get a mail-in ballot. As of Friday, the Secretary of State said 1.56 million ballots have already been returned. It's the remaining early ballots that parties target in the final week before an election. The decision comes just days ahead of a presidential election that has Arizona Democrats hoping Hillary Clinton will win the traditionally Republican state. Arizona's majority Republican lawmakers approved the law earlier this year over the objection of Democrats. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey called it a common-sense effort to protect the integrity of elections and eliminate voter fraud. A split 9th U.S. Circuit panel had said that by blocking the law it was preserving the status quo for Tuesday's election, which could come down to the wire in Arizona as Democrats spend heavily to get out the vote from Latinos and others angered by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's anti-immigrant comments. Both parties have used ballot collection to boost turnout during elections by going door-to-door and asking voters if they have completed their mail-in ballots. Voters who have not are urged to do so, and the volunteers offer to take the ballots to election offices. Democrats, however, use it more effectively. The law does not prevent voters' family members or caregivers from turning in ballots. 0 Shares ",

Bernie Sanders narrowly finished second this winter in the state\u2019s Democratic caucuses, then left Iowa in a February snowstorm as a contender.\u00a0He returned Saturday on a warm autumn day to Iowa State University as a surrogate, offering his young, fervent supporters a more difficult pitch -- vote for Hillary Clinton. Some of his devotees remain unconvinced, even those the Clinton campaign selected to speak at this Clinton campaign event. \u201cShe doesn't care about us. Voting for a lesser of two evils, there's no point,\u201d Kaleb Van Fosson, a sophomore and Sanders supporter, said to the small crowd. After drawing light applause, Clinton campaign staff quickly escorted Van Fosson from the stage, as he criticized Clinton for her ties to financial institutions. \u201cI got a call the other day asking me if I wanted to speak for Hillary, basically they wanted to use me like a puppet,\u201d Van Fosson told Fox News. \u201cTrump\u2019s not any better, but Hillary Clinton is still terrible.\u201d Others in attendance agreed with Van Fosson, though most in the crowd appeared supportive of the Democratic nominee.

You like yourselves. I hope so, if that means taking a hard look at the issues the candidates stand for. We\u2019re not running here for class president of the local high school.

We are electing the most powerful individual in the world.\u201d Yet many still see Clinton\u2019s positions as too centrist and her remarks to Wall Street firms, provided by WikiLeaks, too deferential to financial firms\u2019 interests. \u201cThis is home of rural populism and it manifests in very different ways on theft and the right,\u201d said Rachel Caufield, an associate professor of political science at Drake University in Des Moines.\u00a0 \u201cOn the left if manifests as a distrust of corporations and economic power.\u00a0And Hillary Clinton\u2019s message isn\u2019t resonating with those folks in the same way that say Barack Obama\u2019s did.\u00a0 You still have a lot of those folks who were diehard Bernie supporters who will continue to be Bernie supporters and they\u2019re not sure that Hillary Clinton embraces some of the ideological positions that they want to see in their Democratic Party.\u201d Clinton trails Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in Iowa by less than 3percentage points, according to an average of polls provided by Real Clear Politics. The latest state-provided returns show Iowa Democrats and Republicans have submitted fewer absentee ballots than they did by the same point in 2012.\u00a0Thus far, Republicans have returned a larger share of ballots, and Democrats a smaller percentage than they did in the last presidential election year.\u00a0 As of Friday, 238,029 Democrats and 196,611 Republicans had submitted ballots, according to the Iowa secretary of state.\u00a0 While the\u00a0Clinton campaign\u00a0relies on surrogates such as Sanders and the Obamas to coax their supporters to the polls, Clinton herself maintains a stead attack on her opponent. \u201cAmong most Democrats, the strongest case she\u2019s making right now is that she\u2019s not Donald Trump,\u201d Caufield said. Nor is she Sanders.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been to eight of his last 12 events, and the Bernie merchandise sells a lot better than the Hillary,\u201d said Daniel Richards, a campaign merchandise salesman from Springfield Illinois, as he unloaded a stack of Sanders T-shirts from his van.\u00a0 \u201cThis was the number one seller at the Democratic convention,\u201d Richards also said as he presented a green \u201cIt\u2019s always Bernie in Philadelphia\u201d shirt. \u00a0 Rich Edson is a Washington correspondent for Fox News Channel. Prior to that, he served as Fox Business Network's Washington correspondent. Advertisement ",

(Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 A\u00a0 man with a firearm walking Saturday afternoon near the White House led authorities to briefly lock down the property as a precaution, according to Secret Service officials. A uniformed Secret Service officer confronted the unidentified man Saturday afternoon as he walked along Pennsylvania Avenue near Madison Place\u00a0on the east side of Lafayette Park.\u00a0The man, whose name was not released, was placed under arrest after a brief struggle and turned over to District of Columbia police. He faces several charges, including carrying a firearm without a license, carrying unregistered ammunition and resisting arrest. President Barack Obama was not at the White House at the time. He was in Maryland, playing golf at Andrews Air Force Base. London police arrest 33 at masked-marcher event Earlier Saturday about three blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue, District of Columbia police arrested Eric Roberts, 27, of Florida and Danny Hamilton, 35, of Louisiana in connection with graffiti on sidewalks and buildings in the area of Saturday's Million Mask March, which organizers describe on their Facebook page as a march against government and corporate corruption. It was not immediately known whether the arrests were related. Police photographs of the morning incident appear to show the word \u201ccorrupt\u201d and images of English anti-hero Guy Fawkes spray painted at the FBI building and graffiti at the newly opened Trump International Hotel. Officers confiscated several cans of spray paint and stencils. Police warn of violence at London Million Mask March A police cruiser also\u00a0was damaged, D.C. police said. Roberts was charged with defacing the FBI building. Hamilton was charged with destruction of government property\u00a0\u2014 the police cruiser\u00a0\u2014 and resisting arrest.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist November 5 at 3:59 PM Follow @sulliview In the tabloid business, the practice is called \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d That phrase was circulating on Saturday after the Wall Street Journal\u2019s solidly reported story that the National Enquirer \u2014 no stranger to checkbook journalism \u2014 had laid out $150,000 in August to a former Playboy magazine Playmate, who says she had a lengthy adulterous affair with Donald Trump a decade ago. The paper paid for exclusive rights to Karen McDougal\u2019s story but never published it, the Journal reported. Thus: catch and kill, otherwise known as trapping a story to keep it out of the public eye, for one reason or another . The tabloid, run by Trump pal David Pecker, is one of a tiny handful of papers to endorse Trump for president. (The Enquirer\u2019s parent company claims that it paid McDougal not only for rights to an unspecified personal story, but also to write a fitness column.) Trump, through a spokeswoman, has denied the affair. And of course, such a story would not have revealed anything new about Trump\u2019s character, nor would it have been disqualifying to his candidacy. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron and Post reporter David Fahrenthold tell Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan how the revelation of Donald Trump\u2019s 2005 lewd comments about women came about. (The Washington Post) The Enquirer, which Trump has repeatedly said deserves to win a Pulitzer Prize for its revealing of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards\u2019s \u201clove child,\u201d also published an evidence-free story on Saturday that Hillary Clinton is addicted to narcotics. Combine this with the debunked reporting by Fox News of a likely Clinton indictment after the election, and then add in the much-tweeted photo of CNN\u2019s paid pundit Corey Lewandowski shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump\u2019s campaign brass, labeled \u201cteamwork,\u201d and the conclusion is obvious: We\u2019re ending this campaign deep in the journalistic gutter. The worst of the media is on full display, as if someone had set out to show just how terrible we hacks could look in these last moments before Election Day. To be sure, some great journalism has been published over the course of the campaign. But it largely has been drowned out by the unsavory. \u201cYes, there has been terrific reporting by The Washington Post and others, but it\u2019s been like one of those beautiful houses that survives in a blighted neighborhood,\u201d Micheline Maynard, a business journalist and educator, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe big picture is that the neighborhood is blighted,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get people to move back in.\u201d She\u2019s right. The media, never well loved, is less trusted than ever. It\u2019s under attack \u2014 often for valid reasons, but not always. And the good actors, an ever-smaller core, get drowned out by the bad. Consider: Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier had to apologize last week after reporting that an indictment could be expected to result from an FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation. [Fox News apologizes for falsely reporting that Clinton faces indictment] But the indictment stories, based on next to nothing, had already been blasted out into the political ecosystem \u2014 exaggerated beyond recognition and taken as duly reported fact. Over at CNN, head honcho Jeff Zucker has been in high dudgeon about Donna Brazile\u2019s ethical blunder, which caused her to be summarily (and properly) dismissed as a network pundit, after she leaked a debate question to the Clinton campaign. But he has expressed no qualms about Lewandowski\u2019s continued presence on the network, even as Twitter featured the compromising photo from Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway: Lewandowski, herself and spokeswoman Hope Hicks, showing them all working together toward the same end. Lewandowski\u2019s hiring at CNN after leaving the Trump campaign is one of the worst embarrassments in a campaign season in which the competition for such a dubious prize is fierce indeed. Not only had Lewandowski carried out Trump\u2019s blacklisting of news organizations, including The Post, but he also had signed a nondisclosure agreement, which meant his on-air commentary was by definition tainted. Meanwhile, fake news is everywhere. The Drudge Report, in one of the most bizarre examples, has been promoting a story about Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta drinking bodily fluids at a secret Satanist dinner. Though absurdly false, the tale had plenty of believers, inspiring hundreds of thousands of related tweets and plenty of \u201cnews stories\u201d on right-wing sites. You could chalk a lot of this up to the \u201csilly season\u201d that always precedes a big election. And you could hope the hysteria and disinformation dies along with the weirdest campaign in memory. But even as the worst of media grows exponentially, the best is deeply threatened. The Wall Street Journal \u2014 whose journalistic standards are historically top-notch \u2014 is laying off reporters this month to reduce costs. And as print advertising revenue slips into something perilously close to free fall, much more of that is sure to come. In this case, the Journal let us know what the Enquirer had done. That takes time, money, skill and reporting talent. When those wither, journalism will be in worse trouble. Yes, that\u2019s possible.

Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 24 x Share The FBI and NYPD are assessing the credibility of a terror threat against the U.S. on the eve of Election Day. Officials said Friday that they are reviewing the information that mentioned New York, Texas and Virginia as potential targets. (Nov. 4) AP In this Oct. 22, 2016, file photo, a volunteer hands out stickers during early voting in Las Vegas. (Photo: AP Photo/John Locher) 8550 CONNECT TWEET 53 LINKEDIN 24 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Law enforcement officials,\u00a0government\u00a0workers and cyber-security professionals are preparing to swoop in, track and hopefully block anyone attempting a cyberattack aimed at\u00a0destabilizing the U.S. presidential election. The possibility is slight, with risks lessened by the fractured, mostly non-digital  nature of the national voting apparatus. Still, fears that hackers \u2014 perhaps from Russia \u2014 \u00a0could instill\u00a0doubts about the voting process\u00a0via attacks on the Internet infrastructure have put the cyber-security community on guard. In a way, they are girding for\u00a0war,\u00a0but\u00a0the fronts are multiple and\u00a0decentralized. Although many are keeping low profiles, we know about some. \u2022 The Department of Homeland Security has been conducting cyber audits of state and local election systems since August, responding to requests from\u00a046 states and 32 local election officials. \u2022 Indiana is setting up an election cyber-war room. \u2022 In Washington, D.C., and on the ground in 26 states, the non-partisan Election Protection coalition will staff hotlines for voters and have an election geek squad ready for questions from jurisdictions. \u2022 The Election Verification Network has assembled an elite\u00a0\"A-Team\" of cryptographers, analysts and security experts who will make themselves available to any jurisdictions needing help on Election Day and in the vote counts that follow. Not surprisingly, many details of these \"SWAT\"\u00a0teams' plans are kept under wraps. \u201cBest practices for cyber security means we don\u2019t tell people what they are,\u201d said the Pennsylvania secretary of State's press secretary, Wanda Murren. 'Getting twitchy': election threats have cyber experts worried HEIGHTENED CONCERN Federal authorities say the\u00a0decentralized and antiquated nature of the country\u2019s vote tabulation systems would be difficult to penetrate. The worry, instead, is focused on other disruptions. Two federal officials told USA TODAY there is concern systems unrelated to the country's vote-tabulation system\u00a0could be targeted to raise anxiety as voters go to the polls Tuesday. The officials, who are not authorized to comment publicly, said breaches could take the form of what are\u00a0known as distributed\u00a0denial of service (DDoS) attacks, similar to last month\u2019s rolling operation that knocked a number of popular websites offline for hours. There was no specific or credible information, however, that such operations are being planned to disrupt the election. Could the U.S. election be hacked? \"We have these concerns around every election, but I have to say that I think there is more of a concern this time than I've seen in the past,\" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN. Of the cyber threat posed by Russia, Schiff said that the Russian government had \u201cprepared the field if they wanted to escalate.\" PREPARING FOR THE WORST, HOPING FOR THE BEST It's those concerns that have created an unprecedented level of preparation, both by government and civil society groups. The Department of Homeland Security is working with state and local election officials to protect against cyber vulnerabilities, Secretary of Homeland Security\u00a0Jeh Johnson\u00a0said in a recent interview. The cyber scans found some vulnerabilities, \u201can open door here or there, which are being addressed after doing these assessments,\u201d he said. Some states have received a more in-depth, on-site assessment from Homeland Security. \"There are fewer states that have gone to that extent. And I would expect and hope and expect that after the election more would do the same thing,\" Johnson said. Pennsylvania is one of the states that took advantage of the federal security check, which found its safety security measures were working well. In Indiana, a public-private partnership of\u00a0cyber-security\u00a0experts from local universities, the state\u2019s cyber-security firms and state government and law enforcement\u00a0has come together to support the state should anything occur. A\u00a0\u201cwar room\u201d will be set up at the security operations center of Rook Security in Indianapolis, where the group\u2019s 30 or so members will spend Election Day, said Rook CEO J.J. Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019ll be available in real time, so the fastest possible remediation can take place,\u201d he said. Doug Rapp,\u00a0an adviser\u00a0for cybersecurity and national security initiatives for the Indiana Secretary of Commerce, will be among those in the war room on Tuesday. The level of collaboration between the public and private sector on this issue is something that stands out about Indiana, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a collective risk that requires a collective response,\u201d he said. CRYPTOGRAPHERS AND HACKERS If all else fails, a\u00a0rapid-response team\u00a0composed of some of the best-known names in cyber security, cryptography and computer network security will stand at the\u00a0ready beginning on Tuesday to assist authorities if cyber issues arise during or after the election. The group is spread out across the country and represents multiple disciplines and some of the top names in the admittedly obscure field of election cyber verification and security. Among others, the group includes Andrew Appel, a Princeton University computer scientist known for his work on how voting machines can be hacked; Josh Benoloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft\u00a0Research;\u00a0\u00a0Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer scientist for whom the \"Hursti Hack\" of voting machines was named; Walter Mebane, a University of Michigan\u00a0\u00a0expert on detecting electoral fraud;\u00a0and Ron Rivest, an MIT professor\u00a0and the R in RSA, a ground-breaking cryptographic algorithm. INFORMATION OUTREACH Reaching out to voters, Election Protection , a non-partisan coalition with more than 100 local, state and national partners, will staff a multilingual hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE, beginning Monday night to track issues and aid voters. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re likely to hear very quickly if a cyber problem occurs\u00a0because we\u2019ll be getting calls from around the country,\u201d said Marcia Johnson-Blanco,\u00a0co-director of the Lawyers' Committee's Voting Rights Project, a member of the coalition. The group will alert officials if calls begin to come from any one area that could potentially indicate a problem. Should Internet access go down making it hard for voters to find their polling places, its hotline will be a source available with information nationally\u00a0in English, Spanish, multiple Asian languages and Arabic. 8550 CONNECT TWEET 53 LINKEDIN 24 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f4OPFy ",

While sales for \"long term food\" typically see an increase around natural disasters and elections, \"this is more intense than what we saw in 2012,\" said Keith Bansemer, VP of marketing for My Patriot Supply, a manufacturer and seller of survival food. During the previous election his company saw sales double. This time it's triple. \"We have everyone we can on the phones,\" he said. \"We are overwhelmed.\" A handout image showing a one-year supply of food for four people. My Patriot Supply Purchases at other long term food supply companies are up as well. Emergency preparedness online store TheEpicenter reports a 6 percent uptick in year over year sales. Another company, Legacy Foods, predicts they'll see a 1-2 week spike in sales after the election -- if Hillary Clinton wins, said owner Phil Cox. The meals, sold by the plastic bucket or tote bin, are typically dehydrated or freeze-dried food in sealed military-grade Mylar packs. Menu items include pasta primavera, Hawaiian Style Sweet n' Sour, cheesy broccoli and rice soup, orange energy drink mix and chocolate pudding. They're sold in bundles based on how long they'll feed you. For $2,000 spent at Legacy Foods, you could eat three square meals a day for an entire year. That's 1,080 servings. TheEpicenter has a 14-day supply kit for $235 that's recently been \"selling really well,\" said owner Bryan Nelson. The most popular entry-level seller at My Patriot Supply is a 3-month supply for $497. It comes a in nondescript gray slim line totes bin designed to be easy to stack in the back of a closet or slip under your bed. Big name retailers are in on the game. Costco sells a 1-month supply of 390 servings in plastic gallon buckets for $114.99. Wal-Mart has a bucket deal, too. What's feeding this new urgency? Survivalist consumers says they're preparing for post-election unrest that could involve everything from massive riots, to power grid outages, to the total collapse of the financial system where a can of food becomes currency. And it's not just guys digging a hole on their farm and filling it with MRE's who are driving sales, companies say, but schoolteachers, moms, and successful financial planners. Nor is it limited to just rural areas. A sampling of freeze-dried foods sold by Wise. Wise \"Frederick Reddie,\" a 41-year-old \"urban prepper\" from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is stocking up on staples like rice and peanut butter and working on expanding his 6-month supply of emergency food to two years. He has to use a pseudonym to protect his supply from any future hungry neighbors, he told NBC News. Reddie predicts a Trump win that has the urban poor revolting across the nation and the imposition of martial law to quell riots and the burning of businesses. But he's also getting ready for the possibility of a Clinton victory that he says could lead to conflict with Russia and \"World War 3 in 2017.\" Either way, Freddy's ready - with both supplies and a word of advice. \"At minimum stock up your cabinets as if you knew a hurricane was coming,\" he said. \"It'll be like a hurricane that could touch every city in America.\" The companies take pains to point out that they sell food not just for the collapse of civilization but also for camping, outdoor recreation, and natural disaster preparedness, like Ebola or volcanoes. Their customers are careful, self-sufficient and pragmatic types, they say, students of history who know things like stock market bubbles and crashes go in cycles and are taking small, meaningful steps, to reassert control over a toxic election. They're always thinking ahead. Cans of food that last 25 years are \"better than money in the bank,\" said Nelson. \"If you think the value of money is going to go down, then you could convert dollars into something tangible that you can use later\" for either eating or barter. Bansemer said that his customers don't necessarily fear a specific election outcome, but change itself. \"You hear them saying, no matter who wins, I know I could take a positive step myself and secure what's important,\" he said. \"They're securing their food supply.\" Ben Popken ",

An Istanbul court has ordered nine of the paper's journalists to be held in prison pending trial. Basin Foto Ajansi/LightRocket via Getty Images It's one of Turkey's oldest and most-respected newspapers \u2014 and that description comes from a rival. But on Saturday, the editor-in-chief, a cartoonist, and seven board members of daily newspaper Cumhuriyet were sent to prison pending trial. Prosecutors initially ordered the nine journalists detained on Monday, as part of an anti-terrorism investigation linked to a failed coup attempt in Turkey earlier this year. Four others with ties to the newspaper, including two columnists, were released on bail Saturday. From Istanbul, journalist Dalia Mortada reports for our Newscast unit: \"The daily is one of the last remaining independent voices that is critical of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the government. Since the failed coup, the government has shut down more than 150 media outlets and reclaimed its place as the world's leading jailer of journalists. \"This is not the first time Cumhurriyet has been targeted by prosecutors. In May, the paper's former editor-in-chief was sentenced to five years in jail for espionage after he published evidence of Turkish intelligence trucks delivering weapons into Syria. \" Article continues after sponsorship State-run Anadolu Agency lists the arrested journalists as editor-in-chief Murat Sabuncu and cartoonist Haci Musa Kart, along with board members Ahmet Kadri Gursel, Guray Tekin Oz, Mustafa Kemal Gungor, Turhan Gunay, Hakan Karasinir, Onder Celik and Bulent Utku. According to Anadolu, an Istanbul court ordered the nine remanded in custody pending trial after prosecutors accused them of being linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and the Fetullah Terrorist Organization. These are complicated times in Turkey. Consider that the Hurriyet Daily News \u2014 which today called Cumhuriyet \"one of Turkey's oldest and most-respected newspapers\" \u2014 is reporting that \"the original prosecutor of the investigation is currently under trial over links to the G\u00fclen movement [FET\u00d6], widely believed to be behind July 15 coup attempt.\" ",

Obama responded Saturday to Toomey's campaign airing a TV ad that shows Obama speaking outside the White House in 2013 and thanking Toomey for his courage, despite the bill's failure. The ad is running in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In a statement to The Associated Press, Obama says courage is telling voters \"where you stand on the tough issues.\" Obama also criticized Toomey for refusing to say whether he'll vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 5, 2016, 6:17 PM Republican senator touts Obama praise in campaign ad YouTube/Pat Toomey ad Email HARRISBURG, Pa.\u00a0-- Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey is turning to the target of some of his toughest criticism to help him in his life-or-death re-election bid in Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania : President Barack Obama. A new Toomey campaign TV ad running Friday shows Mr. Obama praising Toomey for working with Democrats on legislation to expand background checks on firearms purchases. It shows Mr. Obama speaking outside the White House in 2013 and thanking Toomey for his courage, despite the bill\u2019s failure. The ad is running on cable in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. You can watch the ad here:\u00a0 on YouTube It\u2019s perhaps the most eye-opening way in which Toomey is working to win over moderate voters in his neck-and-neck race against Democrat Katie McGinty. A Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman calls the ad disingenuous and says Toomey is trying to make voters think he didn\u2019t help obstruct the Obama administration. President Obama also pushed back against Republican Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s use of his wods in a campaign ad for his Senate race. In a statement to The Associated Press, Mr. Obama says courage is telling voters \u201cwhere you stand on the tough issues.\u201d Mr. Obama also criticized Toomey for refusing to say whether he\u2019ll vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. President Obama, in his 2012 general election contest against then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney, won by about five percent of the vote in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 The Real Clear Politics average of the most recent polls in the state puts McGinty in the lead over Toomey by two points.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
