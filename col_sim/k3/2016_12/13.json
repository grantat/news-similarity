Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Sunday in an interview on Fox News. Some top Republican congressmen have said the same, although with less bombastic language, arguing that there is no clear proof that the Russians tried to rig the election for Mr. Trump. Yet there is a loud chorus of bipartisan voices, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, going public to accuse the Russians of election interference. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the public evidence alone made it clear that Moscow had intervened to help the \u201cmost ostentatiously pro-Russian candidate in history.\u201d \u201cIf the Russians were going to interfere, why on earth would they do it to the detriment of the candidate that was pro-Russian?\u201d Mr. Schiff asked. The dispute cuts to core realities of intelligence analysis. Judgments are often made in a fog of uncertainty, are sometimes based on putting together shards of a mosaic that do not reveal a full picture, and can always be affected by human biases. Video Donald Trump\u2019s Russian Connections Donald J. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin have exchanged many compliments over the past year. We looked at the basis of the mutual respect between the two men who have never met. By NATALIA V. OSIPOVA and STEVEN LEE MYERS on Publish Date July 27, 2016. Photo by From left; Todd Heisler/The New York Times, Yury Kochetkov/European Pressphoto Agency. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cThis is why I hate the term \u2018we speak truth to power,\u2019\u201d said Mark M. Lowenthal, a former senior C.I.A. analyst. \u201cWe don\u2019t have truth. We have really good ideas.\u201d Mr. Lowenthal said that determining the motives of foreign leaders \u2014 in this case, what drove President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to order the hacking \u2014 was one of the most important missions for C.I.A. analysts. In 2002, one of the critical failures of American spy agencies was their inability to understand Saddam Hussein\u2019s goals and motives. At the same time, Mr. Lowenthal said, intelligence agencies have always been loath to be seen as taking sides in disputes about American politics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis is the one place you don\u2019t want to be as an intelligence officer: the meat in someone\u2019s partisan sandwich,\u201d he said. Both intelligence and law enforcement officials agree that there is a mountain of circumstantial evidence suggesting that the Russian hacking was primarily aimed at helping Mr. Trump and damaging his opponent, Hillary Clinton . In July, the infiltration of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers produced embarrassing emails and other internal party documents, the publication of which caused a backlash that led to the resignation of the committee\u2019s chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and her top staff. Just weeks before the election, hacked emails from the account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top campaign manager, were made public and produced numerous stories about the internal dynamics of the campaign. That hack also produced the text of speeches Mrs. Clinton had given to Wall Street banks. American intelligence officials believe that Russia also penetrated databases housing Republican National Committee data, but chose to release documents only on the Democrats. The committee has denied that it was hacked. Beyond the specific targets of the hacks, American officials cite broad evidence that Mr. Putin and the Russian government favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton. After demonstrators marched through Moscow in 2011 chanting \u201cPutin is a thief\u201d and \u201cRussia without Putin,\u201d Mr. Putin publicly accused Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, of instigating the protests. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d he said. More generally, the Russian government has blamed Mrs. Clinton, along with the C.I.A. and other American officials, for encouraging anti-Russian revolts during the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. What Americans saw as legitimate democracy promotion, Mr. Putin saw as an unwarranted intrusion into Russia\u2019s geographic sphere of interest, as the United States once saw Soviet meddling in Cuba. By contrast, Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have had a very public mutual admiration society. In December 2015, the Russian president called Mr. Trump \u201cvery colorful\u201d \u2014 using a Russian word that Mr. Trump and some news outlets mistranslated as \u201cbrilliant\u201d \u2014 as well as \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201cabsolutely the leader in the presidential race.\u201d Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin \u201ca strong leader\u201d and further pleased him by questioning whether the United States should defend NATO members that did not spend enough on their militaries.

Whether it was the city of Zion or Waukegan , or challenging the state's Silent Reflection and Student Prayer Act of 2007, he was unafraid to file suit when he thought government had crossed the line... Rob Sherman was known as the \"atheist activist\" from Buffalo Grove , where he lived for many years. Whether it was the city of Zion or Waukegan , or challenging the state's Silent Reflection and Student Prayer Act of 2007, he was unafraid to file suit when he thought government had crossed the line... (Frank Abderholden) On Saturday morning, a passer-by spotted the wreckage of Sherman's plane in a field in rural Marengo. McHenry County authorities were unable to positively identify the remains until Monday. Sherman, who just this fall ran as the Green Party candidate for Illinois' 5th Congressional District, was 63. Sherman's plane \u2014 a fixed-wing, light sport aircraft of a type the National Transportation Safety Board once sought to ground amid safety concerns \u2014 is sold both ready-to-fly and in kits for home builders. Authorities said Sherman's plane, Zenair Zodiac CH-601 XL, was manufactured, despite an earlier report that it was home-built. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash and a preliminary report is expected by next week. Between 2006 and April 2009, there were six instances, four in the United States and two in Europe, in which a Zodiac CH-601 XL broke apart in midair, killing a total of 10 people, according to NTSB news releases from 2009. A\u00a0pilot, the sole occupant, died in a single-engine plane crash discovered early on Dec. 10, 2016,\u00a0in Marengo. (Joe Shuman / for the Chicago Tribune) The rash of fatal incidents led the NTSB to issue an \"urgent safety recommendation\" to the Federal Aviation Administration , asking the agency to ground the style of plane until the flight control issue was resolved. The FAA determined that it lacked \"adequate justification to take immediate certificate action to ground the entire fleet,\" according to the NTSB. After another fatal incident in 2009, the FAA issued a bulletin strongly recommending that all owners and operators of Zodiac CH-601XL and CH-650 aircraft comply with a safety directive from the manufacturer. The directive involved making structural modifications to the airplane and adding counterbalances to address suspected aerodynamic flutter. Manufactured planes that didn't get the safety fix were effectively prohibited from flight. Several friends and associates spoke of Sherman's enthusiasm for aviation. At Poplar Grove Airport, about 17 miles from where the plane went down, Sherman operated a \"builder assist center,\" called Rob Sherman Airplanes, where he offered use of his builder facilities and tools to those interested in building Zenith Aircraft Co. kits in exchange for a \"modest fee,\" according to his website. Sherman was active on an Experimental Aircraft Association's local chapter board and had worked with Young Eagles programs for youth interested in aviation. \"The interesting thing is that for him to be such a (well-known) activist politically and in atheism, I never knew about that,\" said Bob Meyers, a fellow EAA board member. \"He never discussed any of that. \u2026 He was a passionate aviator and that seemed to be another area of his life.\" Indeed, for decades, Sherman was mainly known for his political activism, mainly through legal challenges against school districts, libraries and other public institutions. David Silverman, president of American Atheists Inc., said the movement has lost an asset, and the country has lost a fighter for good. Sherman was a past state director and board member of the group. \"I've known Rob for all my 20 years as an activist. He was a proud fighter for religious freedom and the separation of church and state. He was a great activist and a great person,\" Silverman said in an email. \"I've flown with him in that very plane when he gave me a tour of Chicago. He loved that plane and loved flying it.\" Sherman ran for Congress for the Green Party on a platform appealing to secular voters, vowing to eliminate the words \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance and remove \"In God We Trust\" from U.S. currency. In a photo on his website, in an example of his often witty approach to issues, Sherman is pictured next to Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and is wearing an airbrushed T-shirt with his likeness on a penny inscribed \"In Rob We Trust.\" George Milkowski, 50th Ward committeeman for the Illinois Green Party, said Sherman will be remembered as an \"intensely passionate person who was not afraid\" to speak his mind. Sherman, who once described himself as \"175 pounds of walking, talking disbelief\" in a 1993 Chicago Tribune interview, was regarded as \"famous or infamous\" depending on people's viewpoints, Milkowski said. \"I think a lot of people felt his belief, or I should say lack of belief, really pushed him forward,\" Milkowski said. The office supply dealer turned atheist advocate sparked controversy in 1987 when he challenged the city of Zion over its seal, which contained Christian symbols of a cross, dove and crown and a banner reading \"God Reigns.\" Sherman assisted Clint Harris, a Zion resident and fellow atheist, with the litigation, which later involved Rolling Meadows as well. His exploits and bumper-sticker candor earned him appearances on numerous talk shows including \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" In 1992, the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed the lower court ruling to stand, and the towns were ordered to drop the religious symbols. Twenty-four years after the original suit, in 2011, the matter was brought back before a federal judge when Sherman and Harris claimed a city commissioner had paid for a newspaper ad using the old seal. Sherman's children were no strangers to his advocacy efforts and legal ventures. In 1997, Sherman's son Richard, who was 15 at the time, sued the Boy Scouts of America for denying him membership because he refused to pledge allegiance to God. The following year, Sherman was convicted of misdemeanor battery after he was accused of slapping his son. The elder Sherman was sentenced to two years of conditional discharge, a form of court supervision that included counseling. In 2007, Sherman and his daughter Dawn, then a 14-year-old freshman at Buffalo Grove High School, sued Township High School District 214 over the state's new law mandating a moment of \"silent prayer or silent reflection\" at the start of classes. Two years later, a federal judge overturned the law when he ruled that it amounted to an unconstitutional endorsement of religion intended to bring prayer into public schools. That victory for the Shermans was short-lived, however. A federal appeals court eventually revived the matter, opining that there is no harm in silence, which could be implemented for a practical purpose in calming students at the start of classes. Cooper, the District 214 board member, recalled that Sherman had talked about being born and raised in the Jewish faith and could speak some Yiddish. According to his website, Sherman also hosted a morning drive talk show on WJJG-1530 AM where topics ranged from politics to religion to pop culture. He chronicled every show on his website. In a 1986 Tribune profile of Sherman, he said, \"Life is getting involved.\" He complained that he was frequently called a Communist, when he considered himself a \"Constitution-thumping\" capitalist. Though his own son and daughter supported his causes when they were young, he conceded that even some of his own family members were not comfortable with his public battles, asking him to leave them out of it, saying he insulted their Jewish heritage. To protect his family, he kept an elaborate security system in his home and car. He said he evolved to his adult skepticism over years during adolescence, which he spent in the Highland Park area. Around 1970, he said, at the behest of his parents he spent much of a year in the psychiatric wards of two hospitals, which he blamed on his atheist beliefs. Ultimately, though, despite conceding it made him a \"social pariah,\" he stuck to his conclusion that God is \"make-believe.\" Freelance reporter Amanda Marrazzo contributed. ",

    "text": "By James Hohmann December 12 at 9:46 AM Follow @JamesHohmann ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson speaks at the World Gas Conference in Paris. (Eric Piermonteric/AFP/Getty Images) THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0If just three Senate Republicans defect, Rex Tillerson\u2019s expected nomination as secretary of state would be dead. Since he has not officially announced his selection, blowback from leading hawks on the right over the ExxonMobil CEO\u2019s ties to Vladimir Putin could prompt Donald Trump to go another direction. -- Three Republicans who have themselves run for president fired shots across the bow on Sunday: Marco Rubio: \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State.\u201d Lindsey Graham: \u201cI don\u2019t know the man much at all, but let\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, \u2018the order of friendship,\u2019 then we\u2019re gonna have to do some talkin\u2019. We\u2019ll have some questions. I don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy, but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d John McCain: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\u201d -- A longtime confidant to the Arizona senator added this on Twitter: Tillerson would sell out NATO for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad. Should be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor. https://t.co/cZmA3swddK \u2014 Mark Salter (@MarkSalter55) December 9, 2016 -- From one of our congressional reporters who spent the weekend working the phones: That sound I'm hearing right now is balloon deflating for Tillerson. This is gonna be a tough vote for many Senate Rs. \u2014 Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) December 12, 2016 -- Terrible timing for Tillerson: NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell scooped Saturday that the 64-year-old had won \u201cThe Apprentice: Foggy Bottom edition,\u201d just hours after The Post revealed that the CIA had concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency , rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. Three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday afternoon to The Post that Trump is expected to name Tillerson. Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson attend a ceremony together to celebrate a joint development deal. (Mikhail Klimetev/EPA) -- In case you missed it, here is some background on his ties to Putin and his cronies: \u201cIn the 1990s, Tillerson oversaw an Exxon project on Russia\u2019s Sakhalin island and developed a working relationship with Putin. In 2011, Exxon signed an agreement with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to work jointly on oil exploration and development in the Arctic and Siberia. After inking the deal in New York, Tillerson and Rosneft chairman and Putin confidant Igor Sechin dined on caviar at the luxury Manhattan restaurant Per Se,\u201d Steven Mufson and Philip Rucker report . \u201cThe next day, they gave oil analysts black pens with the date of the agreement engraved in gold. Two years later, the Kremlin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, an honor reserved for foreigners.\u201d -- This confirmation fight would become the proxy for a broader debate about Russian interference in the American election. That is a debate Trump does not want to have. -- Reinforcing this, Trump even cited Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Putin as an asset. \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia,\u201d the president-elect said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d adding that Rex is \u201ca world-class player.\u201d In the same interview, he argued that the CIA\u2019s conclusion is \u201cridiculous\u201d and he does not \u201cbelieve it at all.\u201d -- But Trump, during that Fox interview and then on Twitter, spoke as if Tillerson is not a done deal, giving himself an out and easy way to save face: Whether I choose him or not for \"State\"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2016 -- Similarly, no Senate Republican has come out as a hard \u201cno\u201d yet. Even McCain is leaving himself some wiggle room to capitulate. -- Right now Trump is testing congressional Republicans to see if they are really as big of push overs as he kept telling voters throughout the primaries. That\u2019s plainly what he was doing with his talk about tariffs last week, gauging the response carefully. He will keep pushing the boundaries further and further until conservatives get the backbone to oppose him. If the GOP ultimately falls in line on Tillerson, Trump\u2019s takeaway will be that he doesn\u2019t need to worry about being constrained by his adopted party. This is how he thinks about the world. -- Republicans are testing Trump too. Does he back off at the first sign of pressure or double down? Marco Rubio and John McCain arrive for a meeting last month. (Andrew Harnik/AP) -- Rubio\u2019s skeptical tweet is especially significant because he is one of 10 GOP members on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must clear Tillerson before he can get an up-or-down vote on the floor. Republicans only have one more member on that committee than the Democrats, so Rubio could singlehandedly torpedo Tillerson if he chose to. A \u201cno\u201d vote would be a good way for Rubio, who wants to run again for president in 2024, to show movement conservatives that he\u2019s still principled. He constantly promised to be a check on Trump as he sought reelection in Florida this year. Recall that, back in October, the senator also warned Republicans not to talk about John Podesta\u2019s hacked emails. \"I will not discuss any issue that has become public solely on the basis of Wikileaks,\" Rubio said at the time . \"As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process and I will not indulge it. I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks. Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.\u201d -- Rand Paul is also on Foreign Relations, and Tillerson is the kind of globalist that libertarians are so uncomfortable with. -- Jeff Flake, another member of the committee, is up for reelection in 2018 in Arizona. If McCain broke against Tillerson, it is hard to see him not following suit. -- What about the other seven Republicans on the committee? Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, who was himself a finalist to be secretary of state, responded favorably: If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very impressive individual. \u2014 Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) December 11, 2016 The rest are party loyalists with safe seats who can pretty reliably be counted on to do whatever they are told by Mitch McConnell: Wyoming\u2019s John Barrasso (who is number four in party leadership), Idaho\u2019s James Risch, Georgia\u2019s Johnny Isakson and David Perdue and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson (who just got reelected). Similarly, Cory Gardner will be reluctant to upset the energy industry, not just because he\u2019s from Colorado but because as NRSC chairman he\u2019ll need to aggressively hit up oil executives for money the next two years. -- In the full Senate, also watch someone like Susan Collins, who could use a no vote to bolster her independent credentials if she runs for governor of Maine in 2018. -- Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, is not heeding calls to recuse himself from voting for his potential cabinet colleagues, as would be customary, because the margin of error is so small. -- Democratic leadership aides feel pretty good about keeping their members in line. They\u2019re always going to have to worry about someone like Joe Manchin caving, especially now that he\u2019s in cycle (he\u2019s meeting with Trump in New York today), but the liberal base badly wants at least one scalp for cathartic reasons. Jim Mattis was theoretically the best Trump pick to target because of his need for a waiver to become Defense secretary, but a lot of Democrats respect him and think he\u2019s independent enough to stand up to Trump. He\u2019s also publicly against torture, which works bigly in his favor as he tries to avoid a confirmation battle. Bob Menendez\u00a0is introduced at a news conference after the death of Cuba's Fidel Castro. (Julio Cortez/AP) -- The Dems on Foreign Relations are coalescing in opposition to Tillerson. Ben Cardin, the ranking member, said on CNN that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about his \u201crelationship with Russia\u201d and wants to make sure the nation\u2019s chief diplomat puts U.S. interests first. Bob Menendez went much further, called Tillerson\u2019s nomination \u201calarming and absurd\u201d in a much harsher statement. \u201cWith Rex Tillerson as our Secretary of State, the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President\u2019s Cabinet guiding our nation\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cThe term \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the web of dubious business interests and bank accounts that Tillerson and his company Exxon shares with Vladimir Putin and Russian oil companies. Having no practical experience in diplomacy, Mr. Tillerson has no proven knowledge or regard for the norms and necessities that so much of our modern diplomatic and security efforts depend upon.\u201d -- As a consequence of Harry Reid\u2019s short-sighted decision to invoke the nuclear option in 2014, Tillerson only needs 50 votes, instead of 60, to take over Foggy Bottom. The GOP has 52 seats, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence would provide the tie-breaking vote. -- But even if he ultimately made it through, Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearings at the very least would be brutal. All of Exxon\u2019s deals would come under the microscope, especially the ones that have been adversely affected by the U.S. sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its illegal invasion of Crimea. Exxon claims these sanctions cost it $1 billion a year. \u201cExxon discovered oil in a well it drilled in the Kara Sea, but the joint partnership was put on ice after Russian intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea led to international economic sanctions,\u201d Mufson and Rucker note . \u201cAs secretary of state, Tillerson, who has been critical of the sanctions, would be in a position to argue for easing them, which could allow Exxon to resume operations. And for a company the size of Exxon, few countries outside of Russia hold sufficient potential to bolster the oil giant\u2019s reserves. In addition to the Arctic, Exxon wants to drill in the deep waters of the Black Sea and search for shale oil in West Siberia. In each case, the company would be providing expertise and technology that Russia lacks. \u2018Russia is critical for Exxon,\u2019 said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co.\u201d -- Tillerson\u2019s personal stake in Exxon is more than $150 million. Because much of this is via stock options that do not mature for a while, he cannot easily divest or put everything in a blind trust. How will he not think of his company\u2019s interests in 50 countries and on six continents as he negotiates on behalf of the U.S.? -- The bigger issue, though, would be questions about where Tillerson\u2019s true loyalties lie. The CEO is a major character in Steve Coll\u2019s excellent 2012 book on Exxon, \u201cPrivate Empire.\u201d Coll, the dean of the Columbia Journalism School, describes Tillerson\u2019s selection as \u201castonishing on many levels\u201d in a new piece for the New Yorker . \u201cAs an exercise of public diplomacy, it will certainly confirm the assumption of many people around the world that American power is best understood as a raw, neocolonial exercise in securing resources,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is hard to imagine, after four decades at ExxonMobil and a decade leading the corporation, how Tillerson will suddenly develop respect and affection for the American diplomatic service he will now lead, or embrace a vision of America\u2019s place in the world that promotes ideals for their own sake, emphatically privileging national interests over private ones.\u201d The main theme of Steve\u2019s book is that ExxonMobil sees itself as an independent, transnational corporate sovereign, with power independent of the American government, and devoted firmly to shareholder interests. \u201cExxon\u2019s foreign policy sometimes had more impact on the countries where it operated than did the State Department,\u201d he explains. \u201cTake, for example, Chad, one of the poorest countries in Africa. During the mid-two-thousands, the entirety of U.S. aid and military spending in the country directed through the U.S. Embassy in the capital, N\u2019Djamena, amounted to less than twenty million dollars annually, whereas the royalty payments Exxon made to the government as part of an oil-production agreement were north of five hundred million dollars. Idriss D\u00e9by, the authoritarian President of Chad, did not need a calculator to understand that Rex Tillerson was more important to his future than the U.S. Secretary of State.\u201d \u201cIn Kurdistan, during the Obama Administration, Tillerson defied State Department policy and cut an independent oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government, undermining the national Iraqi government in Baghdad. ExxonMobil did not ask permission. After the fact, Tillerson arranged a conference call with State Department officials and explained his actions, according to my sources, by saying, \u2018I had to do what was best for my shareholders.\u2019\u201d Because oil projects require huge amounts of capital and only pay off fully over decades, Tillerson has favored doing business in countries that offer political stability, even if this stability was achieved through authoritarian rule: \u201cThe right kinds of dictators can be more predictable and profitable than democracies. ExxonMobil has had more luck making money in Equatorial Guinea, a small, oil-rich West African dictatorship that has been ruled for decades by a single family, than in Alaska, where raucous electoral politics has made it hard for Exxon to nail down stable deal terms.\u201d \u201cAlthough ExxonMobil hires former State Department, Pentagon, and C.I.A. officials from time to time in order to bolster its political analysis and negotiations, some of the Exxon executives I interviewed spoke about Washington with disdain, if not contempt,\u201d Coll writes. \u201cThey regarded the State Department as generally unhelpful, a bureaucracy of liberal career diplomats who were biased against oil and incompetent when it came to sensitive and complex oil-deal negotiations. They managed Congress defensively, and as just one capital among many in the world, a place more likely to produce trouble for Exxon than benefits.\u201d ( Read the full piece here. ) As a political scientist at Columbia puts it: Tillerman is impressive businessman, but would Exxon shareholders hire a CEO without industry experience? Y wld voters do the same at State? \u2014 Timothy Frye (@timothymfrye) December 11, 2016 -- The New York Times says Trump is attracted to him because he is very aggressive: \u201cTwenty years ago, as [Tillerson] was rising through the ranks at Exxon, he was charged with negotiating with the government of Yemen to build a natural gas export plant. The talks got bogged down over Yemen\u2019s insistence that it have veto power over important business decisions. Mr. Tillerson, at one point, flew into a rage, throwing a five-inch-thick book across the room and storming out, perhaps for dramatic effect. Yemeni negotiators and other representatives of other oil companies partnering with Exxon in the international consortium looked on in bewilderment. In the end, Yemen got at least some of its demands.\u201d -- Recommended holiday reading: One of my favorite novels is Allen Drury\u2019s \u201cAdvise and Consent,\u201d which is about the confirmation fight for a controversial secretary of state nominee. Ironically, the president\u2019s nominee in that 1959 book is soft on Russia and would rather accommodate than confront Moscow. The movie is pretty good, too, but not as good as the book.

The hawkish former ambassador to the United Nations is really at odds with the foreign policy views that Trump espoused during the campaign. On Fox News yesterday, Bolton questioned the CIA\u2019s report of Russian election interference, suggesting that it was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation possibly perpetrated by the Obama administration. \u201cIt is not at all clear to me, just viewing this from the outside, that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC was not a false flag operation,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know.\u201d ( The Hill ) -- Rand Paul said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he\u2019s \u201can automatic no\u201d on Bolton. \u201cHe still believes in regime change.

Odysseus Patrick in Sydney: \u201cTrump's election has triggered an uncomfortable debate in one of America's most loyal allies, Australia, over the future of its alliance with the United States, which has been the foundation of its national security since 1941. Foreign policy experts, political commentators and the Labor opposition are questioning if [Trump's] apparent ambivalence about foreign alliances \u2014 he questioned the worth of NATO during the campaign \u2014 means Australia should adopt a more independent foreign policy. Such a move would be a seismic shift for this country of 25 million people, which has relied on the United States for its security ever since the Japanese threatened to invade during World War II. \u2018We should not be naive in this period of uncertainty,\u2019 said Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong. \u2018Trump's campaign rhetoric expressed views that run counter to what are core values for most Australians.

Omarosa Manigault attends the MGM National Harbor Grand Opening Gala last week in National Harbor. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for MGM National Harbor) -- Reality TV star Omarosa Manigault is playing a significant role in Trump\u2019s transition, and some say she may get a White House role similar to the one now held by Valerie Jarrett (!). From Abby Phillip and Lisa Rein : \u201cManigault has emerged as Trump\u2019s emissary to a broad array of interest groups inside and outside Washington on issues of diversity, political outreach and hiring for his nascent administration. \u2026 Last weekend, she flew to Atlanta to address an annual meeting of presidents of the country\u2019s historically black colleges. At the events, she signaled her growing role in Trump\u2019s transition as a senior adviser leading the Office of Nationwide Engagement. She is said to have an open line of communication with the president-elect, with whom she developed a close relationship after becoming the breakout star of the first season of \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\" Manigault\u2019s presence in transition meetings has raised eyebrows:\u00a0\u201cSome advocates who attended a recent meeting with veterans groups said privately that they were surprised to see her there, given that she does not have expertise in veterans health care, benefits or the complexities of the sprawling Veterans Affairs agency.\u201d Her last stint in D.C. was a disaster: In the 1990s, Manigault worked in a series of jobs in the Clinton administration in the White House and briefly in the Commerce Department. \u201cShe was asked to leave as quickly as possible, she was so disruptive,\u201d Cheryl Shavers, the former undersecretary for technology at the Commerce Department, said of Manigault in a 2004 People magazine story. \u201cOne woman wanted to slug her.\u201d K. T. McFarland, President-elect Trump's choice for deputy national security advisor, walks in the lobby at Trump Tower last week. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) -- Out of her depth? There are deep fears in the foreign policy establishment that the soon-to-be Deputy National Security Adviser, K.T. McFarland, is more theatrical than substantive. From Politico\u2019s Michael Crowley : \u201cAt a political rally in June 2009, K.T. McFarland offered a jarring prediction. China might cancel the Fourth of July, she said. \u2018They\u2019re going to want something for their money. They\u2019re not our sugar daddy,\u2019 McFarland [said], referring to America\u2019s more than $1 trillion in debt to Beijing. Unless voters \u2018throw the bums out\u2019 McFarland said, \u2018we can all start learning Chinese.\u2019 She then read aloud Mandarin phrases from an index card. \u2026 McFarland\u2019s theatrical performance might have been lighthearted, but its breezy and simplistic tone underscores why national security experts in both parties worry she is unqualified for what national security veterans say is among the hardest\u2014and most important\u2014jobs at the White House. McFarland, 65, last worked in government three decades ago.\u201d -- Trump White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, a former FEC member, has always been an \u201ciconoclast bent on shaking things up,\u201d the\u00a0 New York Times\u2019 Eric Lichtblau writes in a profile:\u00a0\u201cStill, it was an audacious move even for Mr. McGahn when he signed on in early 2015 as the lawyer for Mr. Trump\u2019s long-shot presidential bid. At the time, few other Washington insiders would get behind Mr. Trump, and some were skeptical of Mr. McGahn\u2019s decision, even openly scornful. Now, Mr. McGahn stands to become one of the most powerful, if least known, figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle. The Atlantic City-born lawyer, a guitarist in a rock band who has a personality to match Mr. Trump\u2019s, will be the legal arbiter for the enormously complicated thicket of ethical issues awaiting a president-elect who has built a vast business empire. One key question, however, is how strongly he will push back if Mr. Trump, a man who has defied many norms, seeks to cross into murky legal terrain. If his record is any guide, Mr. McGahn will be a fierce proponent of the president\u2019s executive authority to operate independently on a wide range of issues.\u201d TWO TAKES\u00a0ON TRUMP'S PROCESS: -- The simple truth is that Trump\u2019s transition process has been a logical continuation of the campaign he ran: a total disregard for the established methods and the rules governing those methods,\u201d says The Fix\u2019s Chris Cilizza . Now, he says, a major question remains: \u201cIs Trump\u2019s ability to innovate in the political campaign space \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what he has done, whether you like it or not \u2014 something that can carry over to his time in the White House? Do voters want something different in a president than they want in a presidential candidate? If so, Trump\u2019s unwillingness to change could badly damage his presidency.\u201d -- \u201cTo Trump, all the world is baubles, and he reaches reflexively for the shiniest one,\u201d writes\u00a0 New York Times columnist Frank Bruni . \u201cHe surely sits back and grins as he watches aspirants vie for his favor. Before Trump, the way to land a top spot under a new president was to be discreet, but discreet does nothing to fortify his ego. He wants the whole world to see how many important people hanker to work for him. So they show the world, posing for pictures with him and fanning out on TV to proclaim their ardor and aptitude. Decades from now we\u2019ll still be talking about Trump\u2019s version [of Cabinet-vetting], which presented a crystalline window into the man himself, revealing the titanic whole of his tortured psyche: the bloated ego, the boundless need, the capriciousness, the obsession with appearances. It was a fitting coda to his campaign and, I fear, a harbinger of his presidency.\u201d CONGRESS: -- \u201c New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions,\u201d by Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell: \u201cRepublicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before [Trump] is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law\u2019s insurance would go away. Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible \u2026 But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast.\"\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,\u201d said Sen.

Maduro called the new system \u2018CLAPs\u2019 (Local Committees of Supply and Production). The name might be fitting, because those who don\u2019t applaud his government haven\u2019t been getting anything to eat. Maduro told Venezuelans that the CLAP system would alleviate chronic scarcities and the \u2018economic war\u2019 against his government he says is being waged by opposition leaders, business owners and the street-level black market vendors \u2026. Instead, critics say the system has devolved into a kind of \u2018food apartheid\u2019 meant to punish those who oppose Maduro.\u201d -- \u201c An unexpected result of Yemen\u2019s war: More men are cooking and cleaning ,\u201d by Sudarsan Raghavan: \u201cThe women in this village never earned money, never left home without the permission of their husbands. It had been that way for as long as anyone could remember. Then the war arrived. Now before dawn each day, mothers and daughters walk to the mountainous scrub to gather wood, which they turn into charcoal and sell. The men stay home and care for the children, and sometimes do the cooking and the cleaning. Yemen has consistently ranked among the worst countries for women and girls, and the war has only made life harder. But in pockets of the Middle East\u2019s poorest country, an unexpected social recalibration appears to be underway \u2026 As the war destroys jobs and countless men join the fight, a growing number of women are providing income for their families. Often, they are working in areas that had been considered the purview of men or culturally unacceptable for women in Yemen\u2019s ultraconservative tribal society.

Hunts Point in the Bronx is dangerous; stay away, friends said, when Arnade began walking all over New York City with his camera. That was when Arnade, now 51, was still a Wall Street bond trader, years before he would find himself documenting what he thinks of as [Trump\u2019s] America: the poor or working-class people left behind by the economic recovery. Back in May, when many were still pooh-poohing Trump\u2019s chances, Arnade wrote a notable series of tweets: If Trump didn\u2019t win this time around, it would only be because he was such a deeply flawed candidate; but some Trumplike figure soon would capitalize on people\u2019s anger and disenfranchisement. [Clinton], he said, \u2018represented the front row\u2019 \u2014 the smartest students in class, destined to enjoy the money and status that came with silver-spoon success. For what Arnade calls the \u2018back-row kids,\u2019 the frustration, anger and, yes, humiliation had become overwhelming. Arnade has little confidence that Trump will actually address the economic and cultural inequality that helped to power his appeal. But Arnade saw the emotions up close: \u2018You have to put people\u2019s decisions in context \u2014 how distant they are from the money.\u2019\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Ann Telnaes re-imagines the Time cover. \"The president-elect\u2019s use of red meat and political dog whistles earned him this distinction,\" she writes: Trump\u2019s tax simplification couldn\u2019t be simpler to understand, adds cartoonist Tom Toles: Graham and McCain joined Democrats in calling for a bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking: Don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what Russia is up to -- they're trying to undermine democracies all over the world. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2016 Russia is trying to break the backs of democracies \u2013 and democratic movements \u2013 all over the world. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2016 I'm not challenging the outcome of the election, but very concerned about Russian interference/actions at home & throughout the world. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2016 Sen.

One man asking for protection; another man charged with deciding his fate. Asylum systems in countries like Italy are overwhelmed, and some nations are tightening their requirements. Simply being from a poor or war-torn place is generally not enough. For the moment, a hierarchy of human misery prevails: People fleeing well-defined conflicts, like the civil war in Syria, or oppressive states, like Eritrea, have a far higher chance of success, while the fate of many others can hinge on their individual stories. Mr. De Francesco\u2019s job amounts to parsing the misery, picking winners and losers from a pool of applicants who had lost so much already. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have only one person deciding the life of someone else,\u201d [said an Interior Ministry official.] Yet for now, that is close to the reality \u2014 as well as Mr. Francesco\u2019s burden.\u201d -- NBC News, \u201c Fake News: How a Partying Macedonian Teen Earns Thousands Publishing Lies ,\u201d by Alexander Smith: Dimitri points to a picture on his Instagram showing a bar table decked with expensive champagne and sparklers.

Dillon apologized to Hagen at the event for online posts critical of Hagen\u2019s decision to hold the rally in February despite not having security. The New York Times reports that the alleged stabbing took place just before the KKK\u2019s North Carolina \u2018victory parade\u2019 held to celebrate the election of Trump. Dillon told the Times he quit the organization, but plans to join another white supremacist group.\u201d \u00a0 HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cIn France, a Defeat for Free Speech and the Right to Life,\u201d from National Review : \u201cThe French Parliament this week approved an abominable measure criminalizing pro-life speech on the Internet, in the name of women\u2019s freedom to choose abortion without remorse. If the measure is formally enacted, which seems likely, the punishment for anyone who violates its proscriptions will be over $30,000 in fines and up to two years of jail time. Supporters of the law have attempted to fend off well-deserved criticism by noting that the measure punishes only \u2018misinformation\u2019 about abortion \u2026 But the bill\u2019s language undeniably criminalizes nearly all pro-life speech \u2014 or, at the very least, allows most types of anti-abortion speech to be judicially interpreted as \u2018misinformation\u2019 when viewed from a progressive perspective.\u201d \u00a0 In Trump's world: Trump meets with Carly Fiorina, Joe Manchin, Raul Labrador and Rick Santorum.

(Andrew Harnik/AP) -- \u201c Is the D.C. mayor losing control of her city ?,\u201d by Peter Jamison: \u201cMayor Muriel E. Bowser is struggling to stand up to an aggressively liberal D.C. Council, which in the past six weeks alone has legalized assisted suicide in the nation\u2019s capital and guaranteed new parents two months of paid time off. A moderate Democrat whose roots are in the middle-class African American neighborhoods of Northeast Washington, Bowser increasingly finds herself at odds with a council infused with the leftist tendencies of the District\u2019s millennial newcomers. Heading into her third year in office, the mayor appears to be losing ground, sidelined as lawmakers advance a wish list of progressive policies without her cooperation, and sometimes despite her opposition. The outcome could determine whether the city focuses on the national priorities of the political left \u2014 such as social-welfare programs and business regulation \u2014 or Bowser\u2019s more conventional urban agenda of schools, crime and homelessness \u2026\u201d -- \u201c How a murder convict facing a life sentence became a D.C. mayoral appointee ,\u201d by Justin Wm.

Ferguson is the director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Returning Citizen Affairs, tasked with helping D.C. residents released from prison get back on their feet. Ferguson faces a tough road. In 2015, the D.C. inspector general found the office to be understaffed, underbudgeted and not fulfilling its mission. Ferguson\u2019s personal story, meanwhile, is worthy of a Charles Dickens novel. He was a 20-year-old college student in West Virginia when he was accused in 2002 of fatally shooting a fellow classmate \u2014 a crime he says he didn\u2019t commit. [Eleven years later], he found himself in a changed world, surrounded by unfamiliar technology in a changed city, and looking for a job with a murder conviction. \u2018What it taught me was the importance of reaching back and helping everyone you can possibly help,\u2019 he said. \u2018I dislike the term \u2018reaching down.\u2019 It\u2019s not a \u2018down\u2019 thing.\u2019\u201d -- More than 100 children and parents gathered in front of Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington this weekend for a \u201crally for kindness,\u201d calling on the president-elect to remember what they say are critical lessons when he takes office: \u201cBe nice.

After getting pelted with waves of snow over the weekend, the Chicago area could see the season's first subzero temperatures this week, followed by more snow and even freezing rain this weekend.

    "text": "Trump digs in on Russia, setting up conflict with his own party's Washington leaders Donald Trump Associated Press The president-elect appeared last week before a crowd of supporters in Grand Rapids, Mich. The president-elect appeared last week before a crowd of supporters in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Associated Press) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Donald Trump dug in deeply Monday\u00a0against growing concerns over Russian efforts to influence the presidential election, setting up a conflict with his own party\u2019s leaders even before he is inaugurated. Trump sought to blame Hillary Clinton and the CIA for a renewed\u00a0controversy over the hacking of Democratic\u00a0emails during the\u00a0campaign. The nation\u2019s\u00a0intelligence agencies jointly\u00a0have blamed the hacking\u00a0on Russia, and the CIA separately has reportedly concluded that the Russian effort was done with the specific intention of helping Trump win. Trump persistently has refused to accept\u00a0either of those\u00a0conclusions; this weekend he sharply criticized the CIA and\u00a0termed \u201cridiculous\u201d any thought that Russia had tried\u00a0to aid him. On Monday,\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u00a0defended the CIA. He and other Republicans announced their support for a congressional\u00a0investigation of the foreign government\u2019s actions. As Trump and leading Republican senators head in opposite directions on the issue, concerns over\u00a0Russia seem\u00a0likely to dominate the\u00a0weeks before Trump is inaugurated and could continue\u00a0into the confirmation\u00a0hearings for his senior advisors. That is particularly true if he nominates the current front-runner for secretary of State,  Exxon Mobile Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who has a close relationship with Russian  President Vladimir Putin . The\u00a0tension between the president-elect and GOP senators\u00a0escalated Monday\u00a0after a common Trump tactic: a series of early-morning tweets, this time aimed at the\u00a0CIA analysis, which was first reported over the\u00a0weekend by the Washington Post. \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning. \u201cUnless you catch \u2018hackers\u2019\u00a0in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?\u201d he asked. In fact, Russian involvement in the hacking was brought up before the election, and Trump even talked about the topic during the presidential debates. The nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, in a rare public step, announced on Oct. 7, one month before the election, that Russia was interfering in the election.\u00a0 After Trump\u2019s tweets were published, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said concerns about Russian election interference were an attempt to deny Trump his rightful win by \u201csome people who are bitter that their candidate lost in November.\u201d He lumped the intelligence reports together with Democratic emphasis on\u00a0Clinton\u2019s popular vote victory and Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s attempted recounts in three key states as\u00a0part of an\u00a0effort to \u201cde-legitimize President-elect Trump\u2019s win.\u201d The Russia debate has opened a rift between Trump and his party in Congress in a way that other issues have not.\u00a0During the campaign, Republican leaders gave Trump a wide berth as he upended\u00a0decades of GOP ideology during the campaign \u2014 on trade, spending and entitlements, among other issues. Their strategy\u00a0appeared\u00a0driven by fear of political retaliation by his fervent supporters as well as by\u00a0confidence that, in the sausage-making of federal Washington, more conventional Republicans could substitute their goals for his proposals. The issues upon which they disagreed also were unlikely to become main topics\u00a0early in his presidency, Republican leaders believed, and would not disturb\u00a0a honeymoon period focused on shared objectives. But unlike Trump, whose political alliances are situational and driven in part by his business background, most Washington Republicans rose in a party steeped in fierce opposition to Russia and its communist precursor, the Soviet Union. In little more than a generation, the party has moved\u00a0from President Reagan, who challenged\u00a0Moscow\u2019s\u00a0hold on satellite states, to President-elect Trump, who has talked of weakening\u00a0the military alliance that kept the Soviet Union in check. For Republicans, Monday made for a delicate dance: to push back at Trump\u2019s views on Russia\u00a0without undercutting his\u00a0presidency. Without specifically criticizing the president-elect, McConnell went out of his way to praise\u00a0the CIA, which Trump on Friday had mocked for asserting more than a decade ago that Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. That assessment contributed to the 2003\u00a0Iraq war, during which no such weapons were found. \u201cI have the highest confidence in the intelligence community and especially the Central Intelligence Agency,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cThe CIA is filled with many selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people.\" \u201cThe Russians are not our friends,\u201d McConnell added,\u00a0tersely contradicting Trump\u2019s rosier hopes to work more closely with Moscow. He also differed with Trump\u2019s campaign statements on NATO, calling it\u00a0\u201cone of the most if not the most successful military alliance in world history.\u201d \u201cAnd I think we ought to approach all of these issues on the assumption that the Russians do not wish us well,\u201d McConnell said. A wide range of Republican senators have supported an investigation into Russian interference in the campaign. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who had already signaled his intent to buck any Trump effort to soften relations with Russia, said in a CNN interview that he believes both parties were targeted by the foreign intervention. Republican Party leaders have strenuously\u00a0denied that their computer systems were hacked. If they were, the fact that no GOP files were released\u00a0would suggest Russia\u00a0had decided to avoid disclosures that might embarrass the GOP, and raise suspicions that Moscow has stockpiled Republican files that might be used later in an effort to\u00a0influence Trump. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), in a less forceful written statement Monday, also expressed his support for an investigation. The potential nomination of Tillerson, the Exxon chief, has been ensnarled in the fight over Russian hacking, heightening concerns about a Trump administration tilt toward Russian.\u00a0Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who sits on the committee that will consider the nomination, already has joined McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in indicating discomfort with Tillerson\u2019s friendship with Putin. Democrats heightened their effort Monday to investigate\u00a0Russia\u2019s actions.\u00a0Ten members of the electoral college, led by Christine Pelosi , the daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco,\u00a0demanded an intelligence briefing before their vote on Dec. 19. \u201cTrump\u2019s willingness to disregard conclusions made by the intelligence community and his continuing defense of Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin demand close scrutiny and deliberation from the electoral college,\u201d read the letter, which also mentioned Trump\u2019s public request in a July news conference that Russia seek out Clinton\u2019s emails. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta , whose emails were hacked during the campaign, asked the Senate to publicly release information pertaining to Russia. Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House  Intelligence Committee, also insisted that Congress conduct public hearings into \u201cthe length and breadth of Russian interference in our elections.\u201d The goal, he said, was \u201cdeterring the Russians from further malign cyber action and inoculating the public against such manipulation in the future.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

'Moonlight' David Bornfriend / A24 The diverse slate of film acting nominees included two from \"Moonlight\" -- Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris. The diverse slate of film acting nominees included two from \"Moonlight\" -- Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris. (David Bornfriend / A24) Glenn Whipp With really good marketing and sheer force of will, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. \u00a0has, over the last decade, turned the Golden Globes from a scandal-riven booze fest into a highly rated, influential awards ceremony, a metamorphosis\u00a0that has never been clearer than this year.\u00a0 The diverse slate of film acting nominees it announced on Monday sent a clear, early message to Oscar voters dogged by the #OscarsSoWhite label: There can be no excuses this year. Last year, when faced with criticism for yet another\u00a0all-white slate of acting nominees, some members of the Academy of Motion Picture\u00a0Arts and Sciences argued that there simply had been too few nonwhite choices.\u00a0 With \u201cSully\u201d and \u201cSilence,\u201d they also have a couple of the most buzzed-about movies of the year. Yet when the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. announced its annual nominations Monday morning, both films were... Between the two of them, Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese have 23 Golden Globe nominations. With \u201cSully\u201d and \u201cSilence,\u201d they also have a couple of the most buzzed-about movies of the year. Yet when the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. announced its annual nominations Monday morning, both films were... (Steven Zeitchik) This year, the\u00a085 voting members of the HFPA identified an array of possibilities that included\u00a0nominating\u00a0six black actors \u2014\u00a0 Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for \u201cFences,\u201d Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Ruth Negga for \u201cLoving\u201d and Octavia Spencer for \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d\u00a0Also nominated: \u201cLion\u2019s\u201d Dev Patel, British-born to Indian parents. Beyond that, Globes voters also took the opportunity to recognize a wide range of stories,\u00a0\u00a0saluting movies driven by women, such as \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d\u00a0which tells the true story of a New York socialite whose inability to sing didn\u2019t stop her from trying, and \u201c20th Century Women,\u201d a poignant look at a free-thinking, independent mother raising her son beyond the bounds of convention. \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d a drama about the black women mathematicians who helped launch John Glenn into space, scored two nominations, including a nod for supporting actress  Spencer. \u201cIt is nice to have more inclusion \u2014\u00a0and inclusion across the board,\u201d said \u201cMoonlight\u201d writer-director Barry Jenkins, whose coming-of-age drama received six nominations. \u201cLooking at the types of movies nominated in the best picture categories, especially in this post-election world, it\u2019s really this beautiful snapshot of what America is right now. And it\u2019s not just a monolith. I think that\u2019s the biggest statement.\u201d Full coverage: 2017 Golden Globes Awards \u00bb By casting its net wide, the Globes continued a trend.\u00a0 In the wake of January\u2019s Oscars So White controversy,\u00a0.  the SAG Awards and Emmy Awards ceremonies practically flaunted their inclusive sets of winners and nominees. \u201cHere in Hollywood, the only thing that we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity,\u201d Emmys host Jimmy Kimmel joked in his opening monologue at the September show. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, the Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are now telling people we\u2019re one of their closest friends.\u201d Now\u00a0the question is: Will film academy members\u00a0follow suit?\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not like voters are going to have to go out of their way to look for worthy names,\u201d said veteran awards consultant Tony Angelotti. \u201cThere are a lot of\u00a0 bona fide candidates, not just fringe people who, if you vote for them, it might look like you\u2019re just responding to the controversy. Every one of these people are great actors delivering strong performances.\u201d The Jan. 24 Oscar nominations will also be the first since the academy invited its largest and most diverse set of new members ever \u2014\u00a0 683 industry professionals, 46% of them female and 41% people of color. What effect\u00a0those newcomers might have on this year\u2019s nominees remains to be seen, though many new members think that a shift in sensibility is inevitable. \u201cThere\u2019s a real art-house sensibility to this new class,\u201d says German director Maren Ade, who joined this year. \u201cThey invited a lot of European filmmakers, as well as Asians too, people who see things and value things a bit differently, simply because they come from a different life experience.\u201d Sharing \u2014 and illuminating \u2014\u00a0 that distinct life experience was the impetus for such films as \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the drama depicting three periods in the life of a young black man as he struggles\u00a0with, and\u00a0ultimately\u00a0learns\u00a0to accept, his gay identity. Made for a pittance, the film has grossed nearly $11 million, a figure that will likely balloon with the Globes and (potential) Oscars nominations.\u00a0 I do think it\u2019s one of these movies that has the ability to change the way people look at life and each other.\" \u2014 Naomie Harris \u201cI do think it\u2019s one of these movies that has the ability to change the way people look at life and each other,\u201d said \u201cMoonlight\u201d actress  Harris, Golden Globe-nominated for playing the film\u2019s drug addict mother. Her \u201cMoonlight\u201d castmate,  Ali, also a Globe nominee, added: \u201cI just hope that that\u2019s something that is the norm moving forward, where there are people from all walks of life and different cultures and communities in some way, shape or form being represented on screen, and their work being appreciated and recognized.\u201d The academy\u2019s diversity push also heightened\u00a0the way that movies like \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cFences\u201d and \u201cLoving\u201d were marketed and discussed. \u201cI feel like there is a stronger interest in our movie\u2019s subject matter right now,\u201d said director Jeff Nichols of his movie \u201cLoving,\u201d which tells the story of Mildred and Richard Loving, the couple who fought the state of Virginia to recognize their interracial marriage. \u201cThere\u2019s a hunger for stories about another kind of hero.\u201d Whether this year\u2019s inclusiveness, which has yet to appreciably extend to Latino, Asian and other minority filmmakers, becomes the new normal or is a one-and-done aberration is open to debate. The 2017 release schedule is littered with traditional, older-white-male-friendly titles like Christopher Nolan \u2019s World War II epic, \u201cDunkirk,\u201d and Joe Wright\u2019s Winston Churchill drama, \u201cDarkest Hour.\u201d But there\u2019s also a drama about the 1967 Detroit riot directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who won the Oscar for \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d And there are likely a handful of smaller movies, like \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d \u2014 the high-profile Sundance sensation about Nat Turner\u2019s slave revolt that flamed out early \u2014 that are currently hidden in plain sight. Having spoken to his indie filmmaker friends since the release of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and its subsequent success, Jenkins said he has heard whispers that studios and financiers might be increasingly open to distinct, diverse stories. \u201cI think that there\u2019s an informal mandate that everyone is feeling right now,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAnd I think great work \u2014 work that is needed -- is going to come out of it.\u201d Times staff writer Tre\u2019vell Anderson contributed to this story.\u00a0 See the most-read stories this hour \u00bb Caption 'La La Land' is a lovely and lovingly crafted tribute to classic musicals Jusin Chang reviews 'La La Land,' directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.

Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35 is the most expensive weapons program ever, and is intended to replace four aircraft. James F. Peltz, Samantha Masunaga Memo to Corporate America: Be ready to be Donald Trump \u2019s next target. Defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp. found that out Monday when the president-elect again used Twitter to blast the F-35 fighter-jet program for costs he termed \u201cout of control.\u201d The stock prices of Lockheed Martin, the project\u2019s prime contractor, and of one of its suppliers\u00a0quickly dropped. It was the same scenario that hit Boeing Co. last week when Trump tweeted that the development of new Air Force One jets was too expensive. Never mind that Trump championed building up U.S. defense as part of his presidential bid. The F-35 contractors learned that any company can suddenly find itself on Trump\u2019s bad side, especially those that do business with Uncle Sam. \u201cThe clear message that\u2019s being sent is that the president-elect is going to fight to save taxpayer money at every turn,\u201d said Trump spokesman Jason Miller. \u201cI would expect this to be wide reaching and impact all of government as we look to come up with better deals.\u201d Presidents have leaned on big companies in the past in hopes of enacting change. But what\u2019s happening with Trump is novel, public-relations experts and business analysts said, because he\u2019s using the lightning-fast communication tool of social media to spread his complaints to millions of people, with no prior warning. And he\u2019s yet to take office. \u201cIt\u2019s a PR nightmare for the companies involved because you don\u2019t want the president of the United States shining a spotlight on a practice that the public might find dubious,\u201d said David Shulman, senior economist for the forecasting program at UCLA\u2019s Anderson School of Management. \u201cWhat\u2019s really unprecedented is that he\u2019s not even president yet,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cIf this becomes a weekly event, it\u2019s going to have a negative impact on the business climate\u201d even if Trump correctly points a finger \u201cat the legitimate issue of the high cost of [defense] procurement,\u201d he said. Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands. The aircraft used by President Obama , built by Chicago-based Boeing Co.,\u00a0have\u00a0been... President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands. The aircraft used by President Obama , built by Chicago-based Boeing Co.,\u00a0have\u00a0been... (W.J. Hennigan) Trump\u2019s habit of identifying companies and programs that displease him has corporate PR departments trying to figure how best to respond, if at all. Companies often settle for an initial \u201cno comment,\u201d then perhaps a carefully worded press release days after being criticized. That might no longer suffice, analysts said. \u201cImagine if he suggests boycotting a company\u2019s products,\u201d Stan Steinreich, president of the public relations firm Steinreich Communications Group, wrote Monday on Fortune.com. \u201cWhat if he casts aspersions about an executive\u2019s comments? \u201cWith Trump as president, corporations are going to have to move with the times and join the social media discussion much more rapidly than they generally have,\u201d Steinreich wrote. Or at least respond in some way quickly, as Lockheed Martin did Monday. Jeff Babione, executive vice president and general manager of the\u00a0F-35 program at Lockheed Martin, said the company and its partners \u201cunderstand the importance of affordability for the F-35 program.\u201d \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,\u201d he said during remarks at Nevatim Air Base in Israel before an F-35 delivery ceremony there. In his tweet, Trump did not identify Lockheed Martin or the other defense firms by name. \u201cThe F-35 program and cost is out of control,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBillions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\u201d Lockheed Martin stock fell $6.42, or 2.5%, to close at $253.11 a share. Northrop Grumman, a big subcontractor on the F-35, fell $6.36, or 2.7%, to $232.07 a share. Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35 is designed to be largely invisible to radar, fly faster than the speed of sound and incorporate advanced sensors, linking data with ships, planes and drones. The new fighter would replace four aircraft, with three design variations to meet the unique requirements of the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy. More than 3,000 planes eventually would be built for the U.S. and 11 other countries. The program has been repeatedly criticized over the years for cost overruns and lengthy delays, though its cost has been declining recently. With a total estimated cost of $379 billion, it is considered the most expensive weapons program ever.\u00a0 Although companies will keep feeling the pressure to respond to Trump, they shouldn\u2019t always feel compelled to answer his complaints directly while remaining neutral and open to discussion, said Eileen Koch, chief executive of the public relations firm EKC PR in Los Angeles. \u201cIf he\u2019s just making a comment, sometimes it\u2019s better not to get into a war of words with him;\u00a0it\u2019s better to take the high road,\u201d Koch said. \u201cYou might be getting a minute of his thoughts and then he\u2019s on to something else.\u201d Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst for the research firm Teal Group, said Trump\u2019s tweets about companies and programs are an appeal to his base. \u201cHe\u2019s got this real contradiction, which is he\u2019s throwing money at defense\u00a0but he\u2019s told his base he\u2019s draining the swamp,\u201d he said. Defense stocks had been on a tear before Monday; the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF, which tracks the industry, was up nearly 12% from just before the election through Friday. \u201cOne of his very top promises is to \u2018rebuild\u2019 the military and everyone\u2019s talking about more money, and the upward trajectory in their share prices reflects that in anticipation,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough to institute reforms and go after very big programs in this kind of upward budget environment.\u201d In the meantime, what should contractors do if they\u2019re called out by Trump on Twitter? \u201cIt\u2019s best not to respond,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election , the Ghost Ship fire has brought scrutiny to warehouses and unconventional living spaces , a massive office, residential and hotel development is being proposed for L.A.'s Arts District , and the Golden Globes nominations are in .

    "text": "Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images WATCH War of Words Over Russian Hacking Claims 0 Shares Email In an unprecedented public display of acrimony, President-elect Donald Trump and the CIA are engaged in a war of words over the extent and details of Russian efforts to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. \u201cThere must be big smiles this morning at the Kremlin,\u201d said former White House cybersecurity official Richard Clarke, now an ABC News consultant. \u201cIt's unprecedented that a president-elect should be denigrating CIA, refusing to read their intelligence and disagreeing with them on a major substantive issue even before he is inaugurated.\u201d Trump used his Twitter account this morning to continue his effort over the weekend to discredit the CIA and its reported conclusion that the Russians hacked into Democratic Party computers in an effort to help elect Trump. Trump tweeted, \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d His Twitter rant followed a statement issued by a U.S. intelligence official this morning denouncing the pushback against the intelligence community\u2019s assessment. Responding to Trump\u2019s comments over the weekend, an intelligence official told Reuters , \u201cIt is concerning that intelligence on Russian actions related to the U.S. election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan.\u201d \u201cThe inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country,\u201d the official said. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images PHOTO:The seal of the Central Intelligence Agency is displayed in the foyer of the original headquarters building in Langley, Va., Sept. 18, 2009. Weekend of Words The dispute between the incoming administration and the intelligence community began in earnest last week. On Friday, the presidential transition team released a short statement saying, \u201cthese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d It was not clear which agency the statement was referring to. However, one senior career U.S. official told ABC News today that Trump\u2019s \u201cnot just taking a shot at an old CIA assessment from 14 years ago, he\u2019s disparaging and insulting every analyst currently in the intelligence community working hard to protect the United States.\u201d \"Who is the President-Elect going to trust and rely on?\" the official asked rhetorically. And by today, the anger and frustration within the intelligence community was apparent. Speaking to ABC News, former CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the war of words was a \u201creally ugly situation\u201d and noted that it was \u201cunprecedented to have a president so frontally assault\u201d the intelligence community. \u201cI would advise that he find a way to turn down the rhetoric and focus on hearing from them [the intelligence community], what they believe and why they believe it,\u201d Harlow said. Harlow\u2019s sentiments were echoed by John Cohen, an ABC News consultant and former acting under secretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWhat is laughable and ridiculous is that you have individuals with no law enforcement, national security or intelligence experience calling into question the credibility and integrity of career intelligence professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cCreating a dispute and undermining the trust between the incoming administration and these intelligence officials is problematic because this administration will rely on these professionals as they seek to make critical decisions in the future.\u201d Clarke agreed, adding that as Trump takes power, \u201cthere's the potential here for a great deal of tension on on-going basis between the career CIA intelligence officers and the president.\u201d Hackers Cast a Wide Net U.S. intelligence officials have maintained since October that Russian hackers targeted both Republicans and Democrats. But the hackers were far more successful in their cyberattacks on the Democrats \u2014 stealing thousands of emails between party officials and other data \u2014 than they were with Republicans, whose official party systems had better defenses against cyberattacks. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security said in October , \u201cThe U.S. intelligence community (USIC) is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\u201d In selecting their targets, the hackers cast a wide net. Among those attacked was a former Republican Party employee whose computer was not connected to the Republican National Committee \u2019s computer system. Over the weekend, Reince Priebus , who is the RNC chairman and has been selected to be White House chief of staff in the Trump administration, told ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d that the RNC\u2019s systems were \u201cabsolutely not hacked.\u201d \u201cWe contacted the FBI months ago when the [hacking of the Democratic National Committee ] issue came about. They reviewed all of our systems. We have hacking detection systems in place, and the conclusion was then, as it was again two days ago when we went back to the FBI to ask them about this, that the RNC was not hacked,\u201d he said. Officials conceded that the committee was a target of the Russians. Disagreement Within the Intelligence Community The news of the attack on the former RNC employee\u2019s computer comes amid widespread disagreement within the intelligence community over the broader extent of Russia\u2019s election-related hacking. Sources said that the agencies are deeply split over the CIA\u2019s conclusion that the hacking was done with the intent to get Trump elected. The agency declined to comment for this story. While the CIA has championed this view, other agencies believe that the Russians expected Hillary Clinton would win and therefore their cyber efforts were made with the hope to weaken her when she was in office. On Sunday, Trump flatly rejected reports that the CIA has concluded the Russian hacking was done with the aim of getting him elected. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told Fox News on Sunday. Rejecting the notion that the CIA might be trying to overturn the election, Trump said, \u201cOnce they hack, if you don\u2019t catch them in the act, you\u2019re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it\u2019s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea.\u201d He called into question media reports about the CIA\u2019s conclusion and alleged that the stories were floated by his political opponents. \u201cI\u2019m not sure [the CIA] put it out. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,\u201d he said. Speaking broadly about the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the Russians were involved in hacking related to the election, Trump said, \u201cTake a look. They\u2019re not sure. They\u2019re fighting among themselves. They\u2019re not sure.\u201d His comments stood in contrast to statements made by some in his party. Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., told CBS that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking \u2026 The question is about the intention,\u201d but that he did not have information on whether the RNC was hacked. And on ABC News\u2019 \u201cGood Morning America\u201d today, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said he did not want \u201cinterference into our politics\u201d or for \u201cpolitics [to] interfere with our intelligence.\u201d \u201cPeople are trying to politicize our intelligence because they do not like the election result,\u201d she said. And on Monday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) appeared to denounce Trump\u2019s handling of the situation, saying in a statement, \u201cexploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes our national security.\u201d But, Ryan added: \u201cAs we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\u201d Vasily Maximov//AP Photo Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks at a joint news conference with Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan after their meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Aug. 10, 2016. Russian Denial Whatever the hackers' motives, there is no doubt among U.S. officials that the Russians\u2019 goal was to interfere with the U.S. election. Responding to this accusation, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for the Russian government, said, \u201cIt looks [like an] absolutely unfounded, unprofessional, unqualified statement and accusation that has nothing to do with reality.\u201d And while there is broad consensus on this point, officials said that, as of the beginning of this month, Barack Obama\u2019s administration has not been able to agree on what \u2014 if any \u2014 retaliatory action to take to show that there will be consequences for the interference.

By Greg Miller and Adam Entous December 12 at 6:55 PM Follow @gregpmiller The CIA assessment that Russia waged a cyber-campaign to help elect Donald Trump is based in part on intelligence suggesting that Moscow\u2019s hacking efforts were disproportionately aimed at targets tied to the Democratic Party and its nominee Hillary Clinton, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials said that both parties were repeatedly targeted as part of a months-long cyber-operation linked to Moscow, but that Democratic institutions and operatives came under a more sustained and determined online assault. U.S. officials said the Republican National Committee\u2019s computer systems were also probed and possibly penetrated by hackers tied to Russian intelligence services, but that it remains unclear how much material \u2014 if any \u2014 was taken from the RNC. The lack of a corresponding Republican trove has contributed to the CIA assessment, reported by The Washington Post, that Russia was seeking to elect Trump and not merely to disrupt last month\u2019s presidential election. The disclosure of that CIA finding has roiled Washington, prompting calls for a broad congressional probe, compounding tensions between the president-elect and U.S. spy agencies, and extending the turmoil of a turbulent campaign. CIA officials told senators it is now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Donald Trump was Russia\u2019s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Clinton officials on Monday joined calls for U.S. intelligence agencies to share their findings with members of the electoral college before they formally cast their votes, a step that would represent an extraordinary departure from a process that is typically an overlooked formality in the U.S. election process. [ FBI and CIA give differing accounts on Russia\u2019s motives in 2016 hacks ] Trump has denounced the CIA conclusion as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Republican operatives have vehemently disputed that their party\u2019s computer systems were hacked or, by implication, that Russia possessed but \u201csat\u201d on a secret trove of emails or other materials that might have undermined the GOP nominee. U.S. intelligence officials said that the Russian government appears to have succeeded in penetrating computer systems associated with both parties, but \u201cprioritized\u201d Democratic institutions in a campaign that culminated with the posting of thousands of sensitive emails on the WikiLeaks website. The CIA briefed the administration that it thinks the Russians \u201cbreached\u201d the RNC systems, according to a senior U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cObviously there haven\u2019t been the same sort of leaks and pilfered documents spread about from this intrusion as there were from the various DNC and related incursions.\u201d Other officials familiar with the CIA\u2019s assessment said there is \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the RNC was targeted but less certainty that the Russians got inside the committee and stole material. The explanation for the lack of damaging Republican leaks remains a source of debate across the U.S. intelligence community, but officials think it may reflect in part an allocation of resources and effort by Russian-backed actors who have been tied to the hacking campaign. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) There are other possible explanations still being explored, with some officials noting that Republican Party computers may simply have been better protected from intrusion. That theory is viewed with skepticism, however, by security officials and experts who describe Russia as a highly capable cyber-adversary, and see it as unlikely that a concerted campaign orchestrated by Moscow would fail to extract material. [ Trump, CIA on collision course over Russia\u2019s role in U.S. election ] \u201cIf the Russians want to get into an unclassified network, one that has young staffers, it\u2019s not going to be that hard,\u201d said a U.S. official who has reviewed intelligence on the intrusions. The official said that the intelligence gathered so far indicates a more \u201csustained effort\u201d was aimed at Democratic targets. The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. U.S. officials emphasized that intelligence agencies are continuing to gather and examine intelligence in an effort to reconstruct the alleged Russian intervention in a U.S. election, and that there are disagreements among agencies over how to interpret what they have assembled so far. The FBI has been more cautious in assessing Russian intentions, and has so far stopped short of endorsing the CIA position that Russia \u201cquite clearly\u201d favored Trump. Some have attributed the competing positions to cultural differences between the bureau, accustomed to courtroom standards of proof, vs. the agency, whose mission is to help policymakers understand global events. A senior FBI counterintelligence official was equivocal during a briefing with congressional officials last week \u2014 confirming that Republican systems had been targeted and acknowledging the apparent imbalance in damage done to Democrats, but refraining from assigning a pro-Trump motive to the Kremlin. The RNC has vigorously disputed reports that its systems were hacked, let alone that Russia made off with a trove of material that it protected as part of an effort to elevate Trump\u2019s election chances. \u201cThe RNC was not \u2018hacked,\u2019\u00a0\u201d GOP spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday evening in response to a New York Times report. He said the report was \u201cexhibit #1 in the fake news.\u201d U.S. officials said the competing claims may reflect disagreement over terminology. \u201cThere is no definition of \u2018hack,\u2019\u00a0\u201d a U.S. official said. \u201cIf you\u2019re probed are you hacked? If a low level staffer is breached are you hacked? Or do you have to get a massive release of documents?\u201d The DNC \u201cwas hacked by the common understanding of the word \u2014 the data was exfilled,\u201d the official said, referring to the exfiltration of files. \u201cWhether the data in the RNC was exfilled, maybe not. But if not, why not?\u201d Republicans contributed to the confusion surrounding the issue with contradictory statements before the election. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex,) the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in September during a CNN interview that Russian operatives had \u201cnot only hacked into the DNC but also into the RNC.\u201d He subsequently said that he had misspoken, and that the targets had been \u201cRepublican political operatives.\u201d The material turned over to WikiLeaks included not just emails stolen from the DNC, but a separate trove taken from top Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta. U.S. intelligence officials said the CIA has identified the \u201cactors\u201d who took possession of those stolen files and delivered them to WikiLeaks. The individuals are known for their affiliations to Russian intelligence services, but \u201cone step\u201d removed from the Russian government. A senior administration official said that the CIA did not have \u201chigh confidence\u201d about Russia\u2019s motives until after the election, and that White House officials had engaged in numerous deliberations about how much to disclose before Election Day. \u201cThere was an honest and ethical determination among the senior leadership not to undermine the election,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe political sensitivity was extremely important to take into account.\u201d After failing to get bipartisan backing from senior members of Congress for a joint statement condemning Russian interference, the White House released language from National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson accusing Russia of interfering in the election. Last week, President Obama ordered all U.S. spy agencies to cooperate on a fuller investigation and to deliver a consensus report on Russian interference before Trump is inaugurated.

Got it At a news conference, Dec. 12, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) slammed Republican lawmakers who \"are reluctant to either review Russian tactics or ignore them.\" \"The Russians are not our friends,\" McConnell told reporters. (The Washington Post) By Karoun Demirjian , Paul Kane and Ed O'Keefe December 12 at 6:18 PM Follow @karoun Follow @pkcapitol Follow @edatpost Republican lawmakers are increasingly at odds with Donald\u00a0Trump across a range of \u00adhigh-profile domestic and national security issues, an early sign that the GOP-led Congress might resist some elements of the \u00adpresident-elect\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox agenda. Although Trump maintains enthusiastic backing in many corners of the party, key members of the Senate and House have been outspoken in challenging his views of Russia and its interference in the U.S. election, warning of potential conflicts of interest arising from Trump\u2019s far-flung business interests if he does not fully divest from his company, and criticizing the tough approach that he has taken to some companies, including his threat to impose a stiff tariff on firms that move jobs overseas. There is also friction over Trump\u2019s consideration of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state \u2014 with GOP advisers warning that a growing number of Republican senators may be unwilling to vote to confirm Tillerson because of his ties to Russia. Trump tweeted Monday evening that he would announce his choice for secretary of state on Tuesday morning. No issue has so clearly divided Trump and top Republicans lawmakers as much as his dismissal of U.S. intelligence agencies that attributed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political targets to Russian operatives. The tensions were exposed over the weekend, as Trump belittled the CIA following a Washington Post report that the agency believed that Moscow favored Trump in the election while several Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), joined with Democrats to call for an investigation into the matter. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cThe Russians are not our friends,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Monday, voicing his support for an inquiry. McConnell stopped short of endorsing a special select committee investigation, as some lawmakers have suggested, but said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is equipped to take on the matter. \u201cThis simply cannot be a partisan issue,\u201d he said. McConnell also appeared to break with Trump in his assessment of the CIA, saying that he has \u201cthe highest confidence\u201d in the intelligence community and that the CIA is \u201cfilled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people.\u201d McConnell, meanwhile, declined to defend Tillerson against accusations that he is too close with Russia, telling reporters that he would not comment on a hypothetical \u201cphantom nominee.\u201d McConnell\u2019s reluctance to engage on Tillerson came after some of his allies on national security issues, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), raised doubts about the ExxonMobil chief\u2019s background. Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013, two years after ExxonMobil won a contract to explore for oil in a Russian-controlled area of the Arctic Ocean. The agreement has been frozen since the United States imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia\u2019s 2014 incursion into Ukraine. Some senior GOP advisers fear that the Tillerson-Putin relationship will make Republicans reluctant to support the nomination. One adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said as many as seven might now be unwilling to vote to confirm him as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. McCain said he would give Tillerson a fair hearing if the oil executive is nominated, but on Monday the senator questioned his judgment for being close to the Russian president. Putin \u201cis a thug and a murderer,\u201d McCain said on CNN, \u201cand I don\u2019t see how anybody could be a friend of this old-time KGB agent.\u201d D.J. Jordan, a spokesman for Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), said Monday that the lawmaker \u201chas a lot of questions about Mr. Tillerson and his ties to Russia,\u201d though he added that Lankford is \u201chopeful that those questions will be addressed in the days ahead.\u201d A big test for Republicans Taken together, the tensions between the president-elect and fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill reflect a major test for how the GOP congressional majorities will handle the unusual circumstances of the Trump era. Republicans, many of whom opposed Trump during the presidential primaries, want to work with him in many areas and avoid alienating his enthusiastic voter base. Yet some in the GOP are also assessing how to fulfill their constitutional duties as a check on a businessman-president who is unaccustomed to the public scrutiny inherent to a democratic system and unconcerned with past traditions of transparency, particularly when it comes to his personal finances. They also must prepare for the potential that Trump, who has effectively harnessed Twitter to skewer his critics, could turn his ire toward them. Democrats, for their part, have little power to investigate Trump or thwart his nominations. In 2013, Democrats \u2014 angered by what they described as years of Republican obstruction \u2014 voted to scrap the rule requiring at least 60 senators to overcome a procedural hurdle and move to a final confirmation vote. Now, all of Trump\u2019s nominees for the executive and judicial branches, with the exception of picks for the Supreme Court, can be confirmed on a simple majority vote. With 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats in that chamber need to win over only a handful of Republicans to block a nominee, though doing so requires a degree of Democratic unity. That could be difficult, with 10 of the party\u2019s senators facing reelection in two years in states that Trump won. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his leadership team have urged senators set to serve as ranking Democrats on top national security, financial and \u00addomestic-policy committees to focus on hiring professional investigators able to quickly dive into the personal and financial backgrounds of Trump\u2019s nominees, according to a senior Democratic aide. The hope is that Democrats will be able to dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s nominees just as Republicans did to some of President Obama\u2019s high-profile nominees in the early days of his administration. The larger drama is likely to take place among congressional Republicans, who will face pressure to help Trump. So far, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) has demonstrated a reluctance to challenge the \u00adpresident-elect on some of the issues that have animated his GOP colleagues. On Monday, Ryan dismissed calls for a probe into Russian meddling in the election, saying the House Intelligence Committee is \u201cworking diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations.\u201d He also appeared to criticize suggestions that Russia favored Trump, saying in a statement that \u201cexploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes national security,\u201d and \u201cwe should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\u201d Ryan also has waved off concerns about Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest related to his global real estate and branding empire. Asked last week by a CNBC interviewer how he hoped the president-elect would handle his business after he takes office, Ryan said, \u201cHowever he wants to.\u201d \u201cThis is not what I\u2019m concerned about in Congress,\u201d he said. Trump had planned a news conference Thursday to reveal how he will handle the business while he is in office, but his transition team said Monday that he will do it next month. Trump has hinted that he will retain an ownership stake while putting his adult children in charge of the company\u2019s operations, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \u201cessentially I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the management.\u201d Ethics experts and lawmakers in both parties have warned that if Trump retains his stake, he will face congressional hearings and, potentially, investigations into whether he has a direct and personal financial stake in the decisions he is supposed to be making in the public interest. They say that Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns has left the public largely in the dark about the full extent of the potential conflicts. \u201cTurning it over to his family and him still being a recipient of fruits of their labor does create conflicts in my mind,\u201d said Graham, the GOP senator from South Carolina. \u201cIt will cloud his presidency if he doesn\u2019t find a solution that puts it behind him.\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the House Oversight Committee and the new chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, told The Post last week that he expects Trump to divorce himself from the business \u201cas much as you can have a blind trust and fully divest.\u201d \u201cHe has more counselors around him, with plenty of law degrees, that will give him great counsel on how to stay out of trouble,\u201d Meadows said. He added that he expected Trump to build the proper firewall, but that \u201cwe have an oversight function that would be appropriate, and from my standpoint I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the Oversight Committee to look at everything without a partisan lens.\u201d \u2018Vigorous oversight\u2019 The chairman of the oversight panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), said it was premature to consider any sort of investigation, but he said the committee would provide \u201cvigorous oversight\u201d of the new president. \u201cHe\u2019s still a private citizen at this point, though he needs to get his affairs in order,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cGive him a little breathing space, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Ethics experts have called for Trump to appoint an independent trustee, unconnected to his family, to lead an effort to sell his assets and reinvest the proceeds without his knowledge. Trump has appeared to brush off concerns about conflicts, noting that there is no legal requirement that he separate. \u201cWhen I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace in an interview that aired Sunday. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. You know, when you sell real estate that\u2019s not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time. . . . I\u2019m going to have nothing to with it. And I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2014 I don\u2019t care about it anymore.\u201d Trump said he was \u201cturning down billions of dollars of deals\u201d as he prepares to take office. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be doing deals at all,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that would be \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a conflict. I mean, I have the right to do it. You know, under the law, I have the right to do it. I just don\u2019t want to do it. I don\u2019t want to do deals, because I want to focus on this.\u201d Several lawmakers who would be responsible for probing potential conflicts of interest said in recent interviews they are willing to give the incoming president time and space to figure out how he will deal with the situation. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started the next Congress and we haven\u2019t seen exactly how President-elect Trump is going to handle all this,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who leads the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over investigations. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him and his administration time to figure out what, quite honestly, is a very difficult situation.\u201d In other corners of the GOP, lawmakers say the calls to investigate Trump are coming primarily from his political opponents. \u201cThere are going to be detractors from Trump [who] are going to try to make it sound like all the conflict of interest and all of that, and I don\u2019t think people are really concerned about that except just the activists you run into on the Hill,\u201d said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be those who just hate Trump and are looking for something to do him in or lessen his effectiveness \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he added.

Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed,\" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Monday, responding to a request for briefings by a group of electors. Related: CIA Concludes Russia Mounted Operation to Help Trump Win: Source Podesta's strongly worded statement signals a clear shift in strategy from Clinton and her team, who have until now shown no interest in questioning the legitimacy of last month's election.

Trump defeated Clinton in the general election by an electoral vote margin of 306-232. Since then, Clinton has pulled ahead of Trump by a popular vote margin of nearly 3 million. Experts say electors' ability to reverse the November 8 results remains virtually impossible, but mainstream Democrats have felt emboldened to raise doubts about the outcome following news this weekend that the CIA formally concluded the Russian government worked covertly not just to disrupt the election, but to help Trump win. Four powerful senators \u2014 two Democrats, two Republicans \u2014 released a statement calling for a joint probe into Russia's actions. \"We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American. Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. This is not a partisan issue and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia's role,\" Podesta said in his statement. Related: McConnell Backs Senate Investigations of Russian Hacking Trump and his campaign have vehemently denied any Russian intervention on their behalf, accusing the intelligence agencies he will soon head of being politicized and misinformed. Some allies, including John Bolton, a potential senior Trump State Department nominee, have even accused the Obama Administration without evidence of hacking the Democratic National Committee and Podesta's personal Gmail account in a \"false flag\" operation. Earlier Monday, a group of 10 Electors, including some well known Democrats and one Republican, sent an open letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, requesting briefings on alleged Russian meddling in the election. \"The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election,\" their letter reads. \"We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States.\" The signatories include Christine Pelosi, a California Democratic strategist and daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, New Hampshire Representative-elect Carol Shea Porter, Washington, D.C. Councilwoman Anita Bonds, along with other respected Democrats, all of whom are members of the Electoral College. The Democratic signatories were joined by Republican Chris Suprun of Texas, who wrote an op-ed explaining why he won't cast his Electoral College vote for Trump. Play ",

McConnell's pronouncement puts him at odds with President-elect Donald Trump, who has denounced any suggestion that Russia attempted to steer the outcome of the presidential election . \"I agree with Senator Schumer, Chairman McCain, (Sen.) Burr and others, this simply cannot be a partisan issue,\" McConnell said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. He rejected the idea of an investigation done by a special committee set up specifically for the issue, a move that would elevate the issue to a higher priority and significance. Instead he said the committees with jurisdiction should have oversight. McConnell said the Senate intelligence committee, chaired by Sen.

And on Monday he suggested that it is a conspiracy theory in a tweet. Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 McConnell, who was reportedly briefed on the breach before the November 8 election, refused to discuss his role during those briefings, but joined his fellow senators in condemning any Russian interference and defending U.S. intelligence agencies. \"Obviously any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts,\" he said, adding that he has the \"highest confidence in the intelligence community.\" Related: U.S. Publicly Blames Russia for Hacking McCain said that the purpose of the congressional investigations should be to determine if breaches were done to influence the outcome of the election. \"The question is, of course, what was the intention and that's why we need an investigation,\" McCain said on Fox News Monday. The Armed Services Committee plans to create a new subcommittee to address cyberattacks. While both the DNC and the RNC systems were broken into, only the emails of the DNC were released to the public. Incoming Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said \"we welcome\" McConnell's support of a Senate investigation \"so that we can find out how this happened, and how we can stop it from happening ever again.\" McConnell refused to comment on if the breach impacted Trump's win. And he also refused to comment on Trump's defense of Russia, saying he would only give his own view: \"The Russians are not our friends.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan echoed that sentiment on Monday and underscored that congressional intelligence committee efforts to examine state-sponsored cyberattacks and the impact on the democratic process have his full support. However, he also sounded a note of caution about any partisan attempts to use intelligence gathered on hacks to interfere in the election's outcome. \"Any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests,\" Ryan said Monday in a statement. \"At the same time, exploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes our national security. As we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\" A member of House Democratic leadership, Rep, Linda Sanchez of California, said Monday that Congress should stop funding the GOP-spearheaded investigation into the deadly 2012 attacks by militants on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Sanchez said Congress should redirect that money to investigate the Russian hacks instead, adding in a statement that \"ensuring the legitimacy of our electoral system must be our main concern.\" Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid doubled down on his criticism of FBI Director James Comey on Saturday and accused the agency head of withholding information about Russia's alleged attempts to meddle in the 2016 election. Reid, who is retiring, told MSNBC Comey should be investigated. \"The FBI had this material for a long time but \u2026 Comey, who's of course a Republican, refused to divulge this information,\" Reid told MSNBC. \"\u2026 He has let the country down for partisan purposes.\" McConnell also refused to comment on the pending appointment of Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, a candidate who has close ties to Russia through the oil and gas business. McConnell said he hopes all in the new administration \"share my view\" but won't comment on a \"phantom nominee.\" Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Donald Trump 2308 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 68 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Donald Trump is postponing a news conference designed to announce\u00a0plans on how to handle his business interests amid concerns that they pose conflict of interest problems for his presidency, Trump transition officials said Monday. While Trump had said he would speak to the matter on Thursday, aides said he will now wait until January to outline how he would pass control of his company to others. \"The announcement has been rescheduled for next month,\" transition spokesman Hope Hicks said. Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump has been focused on putting together his Cabinet and staff, \"With so many iconic properties and successful entities, moving the announcement to January, ensures the legal team has ample time to ensure the proper protocols are put in place so his sole focus will remain on the country and achieving his ambitious agenda with the help of the world-class cabinet he has built,\" Spicer said in a statement. Over the weekend, Trump said he would hand over his business interests to executive and family members. \"My executives will run it with my children,\" Trump said on Fox News Sunday. \"It's a big company, it's a great company.\u00a0 But I'm going to have nothing to do with management.\" Office of Government Ethics gushes over Trump in tweetstorm Ethics watchdogs have repeatedly called on Trump to divest his interests in his far-flung real-estate and branding empire to avoid potential conflicts with his presidency. \u201cLet's hope he takes the additional time to do the right thing, follow every president for the past four decades, and divest into a blind trust or the equivalent,\u201d said Norm Eisen, who served as President Obama\u2019s top ethics lawyer and has been among the leading voices calling for Trump to divest. Eisen has argued repeatedly that Trump\u2019s web of companies with interests from Turkey to India could ensnare the Trump administration in scandal. Last week, he and 28 other organizations and individuals,\u00a0including several Republicans, issued an open letter to the incoming president, renewing calls for him to stash his assets in a blind trust. Meredith McGehee, an ethics watchdog at the non-profit group Issue One, said she viewed Trump\u2019s delay as a \u201chopeful sign.\u201d \u201cIf he wanted to simply announce that \u2018my kids are taking over,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t require a lot of time and effort,\u201d said McGehee, whose organization has called on Trump to divest his holdings and allow an independent trustee to manage his assets. \u201cI would hope that this would indicate that he\u2019s going to actually work through this in a meaningful way,\u201d McGehee said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty complicated process.\u201d ",

    "text": "Trump postpones announcement about severing his business ties Published               December 12, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump will postpone until January a planned announcement about severing ties with his businesses, a transition source told Fox News late Monday.\u00a0 Trump had been scheduled to give a press conference Thursday at which he would discuss his financial holdings. However, the source told Fox that the president-elect was too busy filling his Cabinet to squeeze the press conference in. \"We were trying to get it all done, but we bit off more than we can chew,\" the source admitted. \"Delaying it is not a big deal. We'll get it done.\" A specific date for the rescheduled press conference was not immediately known. A Democratic operative involved in the 2016 presidential campaign noted to Fox News that the press conference would now take place after electors formally choose the new president Dec. 19. The transition team has faced a number of\u00a0questions about potential conflicts of interest between Trump's expansive financial holdings and the decisions that will reach his desk as president. Some details of Trump's finances are unknown given that he never released his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent. In an interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" this week, Trump said he would\u00a0not manage the Trump Organization but left open the question of whether he would retain his ownership stake.\u00a0 \"My executives will run it with my children,\" Trump told host Chris Wallace. For decades, presidents have sold their stocks and other personal holdings and put the cash into a blind trust overseen by an investment manager. Trump has ownership stakes in residential towers, hotels, resorts and golf clubs in the U.S., and has struck licensing and property management deals for similar properties around the world. In a financial disclosure he was required to file during the campaign, he listed stakes in about 500 companies in at least 25 countries. Only by selling to an uninterested third party can Trump assuage critics who suggest that otherwise he could shape regulatory, tax or foreign policies to enrich himself. A sale would also prevent people from trying to influence policies by helping -- or threatening to hurt -- his business. Few are expecting Trump to make a clean break. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a vice chairman of Trump's transition team, has said voters knew Trump was a billionaire businessman when they elected him and he shouldn't have to sell. Instead, Gingrich said he recommended to transition officials that Trump appoint a panel of five ethics \"jurists\" to vet potential conflicts. The government agency charged with monitoring ethics is pushing for far more. The Office of Government Ethics tweeted recently about Trump, \"We can't repeat enough how good this total divesture will be.\" The office clarified later that it did not know if that was indeed his plan.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said, \"On November 17, 2016 you told the Committee during an open hearing that the IC (Intelligence Community) lacked strong evidence connecting Russian government Cyber-attacks and Wikileaks disclosures.\" In response to a question from ranking Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, Clapper had said, \u201cAs far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there is not as strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases or when the data may have been provided. We don't have as good insight into that.\u201d The Nunes letter continued, \u201cAccording to new press reports, this is no longer the CIA\u2019s position\u2026I was dismayed that we did not learn earlier, from you directly about the reported conflicting assessments and the CIA\u2019s reported revision of information previously conveyed to this Committee.\u201d Nunes is requesting a briefing from the CIA and FBI on the current assessment of alleged Russian involvement related to the U.S. election no later than Dec. 16. The Washington Post reported Friday that the CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia interfered in the race to boost Trump, not just undermine confidence in the system. Intelligence agencies reportedly found individuals connected to the Russian government gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, as well as from Hillary Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta \u2013 though the agencies did not have \u201cspecific intelligence\u201d showing Kremlin officials directed the activity. Trump has challenged the report, calling the assessment \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u00a0 Some Republican senators, though, have sought a bipartisan congressional probe to investigate further. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., endorsed those calls Monday morning, saying: \u201cThe Russians are not our friends.\u201d\u00a0 In a statement earlier Monday, Nunes said his committee will \u201cclosely oversee the production \u00a0of the report on these attacks requested by President Obama to ensure its analytical integrity\u201d \u2013 but he does \u201cnot see any benefit in opening further investigations, which would duplicate current committee oversight efforts and Intelligence Community inquiries.\u201d The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Trump and his allies for calling the intelligence community\u2019s work into question.\u00a0 \u201cEvery day the President-elect and his team continue to denigrate the work of the intelligence community, to the detriment of the agencies' important work and the success of his own presidency,\u201d he said in a statement.\u00a0 Fox News sent the letter to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and will update when a response is available.\u00a0 Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C. She covers intelligence, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security. Herridge joined FNC in 1996 as a London-based correspondent. Advertisement ",

The team hosted seven players for tryouts at Halas Hall. Five of them were wide receivers and five of them played this past season in the Canadian Football League. Derel Walker, the CFL\u2019s most outstanding rookie in 2015 and an all-star for the last two seasons for the Edmonton Eskimos, was part of the workout. The 25-year-old Walker (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) played at Texas A&M and is looking to get a shot in the NFL. He was second in the CFL\u00a0this season with 1,589 yards. Walker had a tryout for the Vikings last week and is expected to visit multiple teams. Other CFL standouts on hand were Greg Ellingson , a postseason star for the Ottawa Redblacks, who won the Grey Cup. Ellingson, 27, made 76 receptions for 1,260 yards this season. He\u2019s spent time previously with the Jaguars and Buccaneers . Kenny Shaw and Diontae Spencer, who both played for the Toronto Argonauts, got a look. Shaw made 77 receptions for 1,004 yards this year. He\u2019s spent time with the Browns , Jaguars and Raiders . Spencer, 5-8, 163 pounds, is a slot receiver and returner. He had 71 receptions for 706 yards this season and has spent time previously with the Rams. Guard Derek Dennis was also at the tryout. He spent time with the Bears in 2012 and 2013 and played this past season for the Calgary Stampeders. The Bears also looked at an indoor league standout, former Eastern Kentucky receiver Orlandus Harris. He has played for the Spokane Empire and Bloomington Edge. Fullback Malcolm Johnson, a sixth-round pick of the Browns in 2015 from Mississippi State, was also at the workout. Johnson was released by the Browns earlier this season and had a brief stay on the practice squad of the Seahawks . The Bears have signed a handful of CFL players over the years without a lot of success. However, linebacker Jerrell Freeman starred in Canada before signing with the Colts . ",

They previously had assessed that Russia was trying to undermine the U.S. presidential election, but after Nov. 8 they came to believe that Russian interference was ultimately designed to help Trump win. Related: CIA Concludes Russia Mounted Hacks to Help Trump Win This latest finding fed an already blazing public dispute between the U.S. intelligence agencies and the president-elect over Russian interference in the election. \"I don't believe it,\" Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday on Fox News, disputing the notion that the Russians wanted to help him. \"I think it's ridiculous.\" Play Donald Trump dismisses claims that Russia interfered in 2016 election 3:33 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161213013853if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/829781571807\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump and his aides reject not just the CIA's updated assessment about Russian intentions, but the earlier consensus reached by all 17 agencies, and released in a rare joint public statement by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and DHS head Jeh Johnson, that Russia was meddling in the election in the first place. The seriousness of the gulf can hardly be overstated: many foreign policy experts and lawmakers believe Russia's behavior was an attack on the nation. One former CIA leader, Hillary Clinton supporter Michael Morell, likened Russia's intrusion into U.S. politics Friday to \"the political equivalent of 9/11.\" Related: U.S. Intel Agencies Prepping Dossier to Prove Russian Hacks In fact, the CIA's latest take is not the unanimous view of the intelligence community. Clapper, who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, had enough confidence to relay the CIA's assessment to Congress in a secret briefing last week. But no similar assessment has leaked from any of the other 16 intelligence agencies. The FBI, for its part, assesses that Russia's main goal was to sow chaos and undermine American democracy, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News. Helping Trump served that purpose, the official said, but Russia didn't expect Trump to win the election.

Instead, it was the result of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial evidence more detailed than anything the public has seen. Human sources, communications intercepts and other intelligence have allowed analysts to piece together the identities of some of the players, and the steps they took to hurt Clinton's candidacy while boosting Trump's, officials said. The CIA also noted that while Russian hackers gathered information on Republicans, they didn't release any of it, the way they did with Democratic emails leaked to WikiLeaks. The Republican National Committee denies its systems were hacked, but the emails of individual Republicans were collected\u2014something NBC News reported in October. Related: Trump Was Told Russia to Blame for Hacks Long Before First Debate The FBI believes the Russians didn't find anything explosive in the Republican material they obtained, the official said, although it's not clear whether any U.S. agency knows the full extent of what data Russian hackers were able to steal. The CIA also tracked a campaign of anti-Clinton news stories amplified by social media, some of which originated with Russian state media outlets, officials told NBC News.

Other intelligence agencies have not endorsed the CIA view, but no entity is known to oppose it. However, the question of motive\u2014why the Russians allegedly meddled in the election \u2014 is entirely separate from the more basic question of whether the U.S. has strong evidence that the Russian government sponsored the covert campaign. On that score, every intelligence agency in the government agrees: The Russians did it. Related: Mitch McConnell Condemns Russian Breaches of U.S. Political Organizations In October, DNI Clapper and Homeland security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued an extraordinary joint statement that \"the U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\" One source familiar with the intelligence said it included profiles of some of the suspects with pictures, and could lead to eventual indictments of specific Russian actors, if the Justice Department decides to pursue them. The evidence on that score simply doesn't support Trump's recent comments that \"It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" That is why the two Trump supporters who lead the Congressional intelligence committees, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California, have each issued statements in recent days expressing concern about Russian hacking.

Nunes said Friday: \"Russia's cyber attacks are no surprise to the House Intelligence Committee, which has been closely monitoring Russia's belligerence for years.\" On Monday, the top Republicans in Congress \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 each issued statements pledging to investigate Russian meddling in the election. Related: Intelligence Agencies Distressed by Trump's Rejection of Findings on Russia Ryan called Russia \"an aggressor,\" and McConnell made a point of saying he has \"the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially the Central Intelligence Agency.\" On Monday, Sen. John McCain of Arizona renewed his call for a bipartisan hearing, but said he didn't believe Russians were trying to engineer a Trump victory: \"That's the reason we need a full investigation, but I have seen no evidence of that.\" It's unclear whether Trump has been briefed on the same evidence top Republicans have seen, because he has had only a handful of intelligence briefings since the election. Trump not only said he didn't believe the intelligence community's assessment \u2014 he suggested that the CIA was not to be believed in general, issuing a statement Friday night noting that \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Related: U.S. Publicly Blames Russia for Hacking Several intelligence officials told NBC News they were deeply disturbed by that statement. There is no historical precedent for a president-elect publicly maligning the intelligence agencies he is about to lead. One big question now is how Trump's pick as CIA director, Mike Pompeo, will bridge the acrimonious gap between his boss and the agency he leads. President Barack Obama does not intend to make it easy on Trump: He has ordered that a dossier be assembled on the evidence about the Russian covert operation. A senior Obama administration official told NBC News that portions of that will be made public before January 20th. Related: Hackers Target Election Systems in 20 States Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC News that can't happen soon enough. The way to thwart Russian information campaigns is to publicize them, he said. He warned, though, is that the U.S. Is not going to be able offer the sort of proof many skeptics are demanding. \"If you provide proof, you provide a roadmap to show the Russians how we caught them,\" he said, \"including intelligence sources and methods.\" Ken Dilanian ",

    "text": "Enlarge this image An abortion rights activist holds a sign outside the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year before the court struck down a Texas law placing restrictions on abortions. Now abortion rights supporters are suing the state again over a new rule. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images An abortion rights activist holds a sign outside the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year before the court struck down a Texas law placing restrictions on abortions. Now abortion rights supporters are suing the state again over a new rule. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Abortion rights groups filed suit Monday to stop the state of Texas from enacting a rule on Dec. 19 that requires fetal remains to be buried or cremated after miscarriages or abortions. The lawsuit calls the rule \"politically motivated\" and says it aims to shame women. The Texas Department of Health went ahead with the measure despite objections from medical groups. Supporters, however, say its purpose is to provide dignity for \"unborn infants.\" \"What we're saying is, it needs to be humane, and the mother needs to be given the opportunity to have a say and be informed with what's happening,\" says Kristi Hamrick of Americans United for Life. The group has created model legislation intended for other state, similar to the Texas regulation. But the Center for Reproductive Rights says it would be costly to require burials or cremation \u2014 a cost that may be passed on to women \u2014 and would provide no health benefit. \"These regulations are an insult to Texas women, the rule of law and the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared less than six months ago that medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion access are unconstitutional,\" says Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the center. Article continues after sponsorship The Texas regulation is part of a wave of such laws that followed last year's undercover videos targeting Planned Parenthood . The maker of the videos, an anti-abortion activist, accused the women's health organization of unlawfully selling fetal tissue. Ohio Legislature Moves To Ban Abortion As Early As 6 Weeks After Conception The deceptively edited videos sparked congressional hearings and a dozen state investigations. None found any evidence of wrongdoing. But Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine called a news conference to announce something else he had found. \"Fetuses from abortions are being cooked and then put into landfills and mixed in with all other garbage that's out there,\" he said. \"I think it's just wrong.\" By \"cooking,\" he meant sterilized with steam. It turned out there was no legal violation there, either. But it helped spark a different kind of protest against abortion providers \u2014 this time behind clinics, where medical waste is picked up. Mark Harrington, of Created Equal , helps organize these protests. He wants to pressure disposal companies into canceling their contracts, and \"shut down abortion clinics around the country.\" But as long as abortions happen, Harrington supports mandating burial or cremation. He pushed Ohio lawmakers to do that this year. The bill didn't pass, but Harrington thinks it would have had a big impact on women. \"It goes without saying, if she's given the option to cremate or bury she's going to maybe wonder that this isn't just some kind of blob of tissue,\" he says. \"That this actually may be a child and she may choose not to abort.\" ",

Romney McDaniel is a niece of Mitt Romney , the former Republican nominee who was in the running to be Trump's secretary of state. Trump's support will almost surely clear the path for Romney McDaniel, but she still has to run for the position. A decision will be made by the RNC's 168-member executive committee in January. Romney McDaniel was long-favored for the position, with sources telling ABC News that she engendered strong support among her fellow RNC members and was a favorite of RNC Chair Reince Priebus , who has been tapped to be Trump's chief of staff. Romney McDaniel appeared at Trump's rally on Friday in Grand Rapids, Mich. She became a public backer of Trump's after he won the Michigan primary , urging Michigan Republicans to unite around him after he clinched the Republican nomination. 0 Shares ",

(Nov. 29) AP Women participate in a self-dense class at the Muslim Community Network in New York on Dec. 3, 2016. (Photo: Religion News Service) 44 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE Melissa Grajek was subjected to all kinds of taunts for wearing the hijab, but an incident at\u00a0\u00a0Discovery Lake in San Marcos, Calif., sealed the deal. Her 1-year-old son was playing with another boy when an irate father saw her and whisked his son away, telling Grajek: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until Trump is president because he\u2019ll send you back to where you came from.\u201d The man then scooped up a handful of wood chips and threw them at Grajek\u2019s son. At that moment, Grajek thought, enough was enough. She decided to take off her head covering. \u201cI had been on the fence regarding hijab, but that incident made it clear my religious choices could be putting my son at risk,\u201d she said. Grajek\u2019s decision to doff the hijab follows reports of assaults against Muslim women. Last week, Ilhan Omar, a\u00a0newly elected Minneapolis state representative, was leaving the White House, where she discussed\u00a0policy initiatives, when a cab driver\u00a0threatened to yank her hijab while shouting expletives and calling her \u201cISIS.\u201d A day earlier, a man pushed a New York City transit worker down a staircase at\u00a0Grand Central Terminal, yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist, go back to your own country!\u201d And two weeks ago in Brooklyn, another man threatened an off-duty police officer with his pit bull, telling her and her son to \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d All three women were wearing hijabs. Assaults or intimidation of Muslims had been steadily rising well before the election, but they became more common during the divisive campaign of President-elect Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and proposed a registry for U.S. Muslims. A Pew Research Center analysis of\u00a0 hate crimes statistics from the FBI shows that the number of physical assaults against Muslims reached 9/11-era levels last year. The number of anti-Muslim intimidation crimes \u2014 defined as threatening bodily harm \u2014 also rose. Now some imams across the country are saying it\u2019s OK to take\u00a0the hijab off, at least temporarily. Imam Abdullah Antepli recently asked a group of women at the Islamic Association of Raleigh (N.C.) how many of them felt unsafe in public. Dozens of hands shot up. He then told them the extraordinary circumstances under which Muslim Americans now live may require extraordinary measures \u2014 including taking off\u00a0the hijab, at least for a while. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be alarmist,\u201d said Antepli, the chief representative of Muslim affairs at Duke University. \u201cBut the nation is being sucked into a combustible mix. We have to think unconventionally.\u201d Antepli\u2019s call to remove the hijab, which he repeated at a mosque in Cary and in home gatherings of Muslims in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, is rare but not unheard of. In Texas, Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and resident scholar\u00a0at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, said women\u2019s fears should be taken seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s important to give our women support and validate the fear they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Suleiman said.\u00a0 \u201cFear isn\u2019t quantifiable; it\u2019s to the person\u2019s own experience.\u201d While Suleiman doesn\u2019t foresee a blanket call to abandon the head scarf, he advises women to consider practical measures, such as wearing a hoodie instead of a hijab if they feel like they may be in danger. For many Muslim women, the head covering is a quintessential mark of their identity\u00a0\u2014\u00a0much as the kippah or yarmulke is a customary requirement for Orthodox and some Conservative Jewish men. While often understood as a symbol of modesty and\u00a0privacy, the hijab is much more for those Muslim women who choose to wear it. They view it alternately as a sign of religious devotion, discipline, freedom from Western expectations\u00a0or simply a way to be in a continuous state of prayer. Many Muslim women would never think of giving it up, even if it means being targeted. \u201cThis is a difficult time,\u201d acknowledged Khalilah Sabra, a Raleigh Muslim activist who works for the Muslim American Society\u2019s Immigrant Justice Center. Just last month, a man spit in her face as she descended the stairs of the Garfield, N.J., Municipal Court, where she was testifying in a domestic violence dispute.\u00a0 \u201cI had to pause and decide do I fight or let it go?\u201d Sabra decided to buck up and carry on. \u201cWe have to stand up for our religious rights and encourage women to stand their ground,\u201d she said. Others, however, are taking security measures. On Nov. 9, when New York\u2019s Muslim Community Network posted a notice on Facebook about a self-defense workshop, leaders expected 50 or 60 women would respond. Within hours, 2,700 women had signed up. Some\u00a0Muslim women are buying pepper spray, taking firearms training or applying for concealed carry permits. And quietly, some Muslim women are uncovering their hair. \u201cOne of the reasons women are encouraged to dress modestly is for their protection,\u201d said Engy Abdelkader, senior fellow and adjunct professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Walsh School of Foreign Service. \u201cOnce that purpose is no longer served there\u2019s an argument that it becomes a matter of necessity to remove it.\u201d 44 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hxibhO ",

    "text": "Electors Call for Intelligence Briefing on Russian Hacking Allegations By MaryAlice Parks Dec 12, 2016, 5:44 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Reports Say CIA Believes Russia Sought to Help Trump in Election 0 Shares Email Ten members of the Electoral College have signed a letter urging the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to provide them with classified briefings on Russia\u2019s hacking and cyber involvement in the U.S. elections. Christine Pelosi, Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2019s daughter, who serves as an elector from California, spearheaded drafting the letter and referred to the request as a \u201cday pass\u201d so that electors could be fully read-in before they cast their votes next week. Nine of the ten signatories come from states that Hillary Clinton won, though Pelosi said the news media should \u201cstay tuned\u201d for additional backers. \"We further emphasize Alexander Hamilton\u2019s assertion in Federalist Paper #68 that a core purpose of the Electoral College was to prevent a 'desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.' The United States intelligence community has now concluded with 'high confidence' that a foreign power, namely Russia, acted covertly to interfere in the presidential campaign with the intent of promoting Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy,\" the letter states. \"The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,\" it reads. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta released a statement today saying that the letter \"raises very grave issues\" about the election. Christine Pelosi told ABC News that the information would be helpful for members of Congress ahead of cabinet confirmation hearings. \"Was this all just happenstance, happening around Donald Trump without any of his agents encouraging it, other than the statements he himself made, or whether there is in fact more information?\" she told ABC News. Podesta stressed that the intelligence community had made it known that they were \"confident\" that the Russian government played a role in the hacking as early as Oct. 7 but \"this matter did not receive the attention it deserved.\" \"We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American,\" Podesta wrote in the statement obtained by ABC News. \"Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.\" Electoral College expert George C. Edwards III, a political science professor at Texas A&M; University, told ABC News that Podesta's public call for electors to be briefed is \"certainly not typical, that's for sure.\" \"The further action would be for electors to become faithless,\" Edwards said, meaning that the electors wouldn't vote for the candidate who won their state, as they are bound to do by state laws. Bev Hollingworth, a retired hotel owner and New Hampshire state elector who also signed the letter, said that she believed her role as an elector was \u201cnot just a ceremonial thing.\u201d \u201cThere is also a constitutional duty that we have to carry out and that is why I signed onto this letter,\u201d she added. \u201cI think this goes beyond politics. ... It should put us on guard for future elections.\" Hollingworth said she was also alarmed by President-elect Trump\u2019s favored pick for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2019s perceived close ties to Russia. She said the connection deserved \u201cserious consideration.\u201d \u201cI am overwhelmed in what has transpired in the last day or so and what I have read about that connection,\u201d she said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Joe Sheahan is in the fight of his life to save his family\u2019s\u00a0Nevada mine from being swallowed up by the federal government's mysterious Area\u00a051 .\u00a0 Technically, Sheahan\u2019s family no longer even holds title to\u00a0Groom Mine, which it owned for 130 years. The federal government took the deed\u00a0through eminent domain after first offering the Sheahans $333,300, a price\u00a0family lawyer James Leavitt called \u201cembarrassingly low.\u201d The family is\u00a0fighting back in federal court, but if the Sheahans and Uncle Sam can\u2019t agree\u00a0on a value, it could wind up before a jury. Possibly more interesting is what the federal government wants with a parched stretch of rural Nevada desert and an old mine that hasn\u2019t been active in decades. The area is known for two of the feds\u2019 most closely guarded secrets: nuclear testing and UFOs. So far, the family has not been paid for the land. Initially, the family was sued by the federal government in September of 2015 in a complaint case of eminent domain. A few days later the government then filed a motion to take the over the property.\u00a0 Now, Appraisal reports are being exchanged in the discovery phase of the litigation. If the parties cannot reach a sufficient value for the land, the Sheahans are prepared to fight it in a jury trial. The mine hasn\u2019t been in full operation since 1954, but until fall of 2015 family members went out from time to time to blast for minerals.\u00a0 The 400 acres of land sits almost 6,000 feet above sea level with panoramic views of the surrounding Groom Mountain Range and borders the Nevada Test and Training Range, which includes Area 51. According to Sheahan, his family\u2019s land had always been highly sought after by the U.S. Air Force base looking to expand its flight-testing range, \u201cThey told me the land was like a suit hemmed in too tight that needed to breathe, that\u2019s why they want our land\u201c Sheahan said. REAL-LIFE 'X-FILES'? CIA POSTS TROVE OF UFO DOCUMENTS Sheahan told Fox News that Air Force officials started showing up unannounced on the property in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, intimidating his grandparents.\u00a0 He said his family complained to the Air Force, but nothing happened. Then nuclear tests came without warning. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal archives, on Jan. 27, 1951, the Air Force detonated the first above-ground test on land next to the Groom Mine. Sheahan says his family wasn\u2019t told about the test.\u00a0 \u201cThis bomb goes off, who do you call, who do you Google, there\u2019s no one \u2026 those blasts did significant damage to the property, not only in radiation,\u201d he said. Sheahan claims family members and mine workers suffered long-term radiation effects and says some livestock died from beta burns. In the winter of 2014, government officials from the Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force approached the Sheahan family about purchasing the property.\u00a0 At that time, Sheahan and other family members had never had the property appraised but he says the family thought offers of $2.4 million, $5.2 million, and $1.5 million from the Air Force were too low and so they rejected them. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit down with those numbers at the table.\u201d said Sheahan. The Air Force confiscated the property on Sept. 16, 2015 through a federal court ruling in US District Court in Nevada. The family had three outside experts appraise the property after the seizure. Due to its proximity to Area 51 and the mineral rights to the land, each appraiser recognized the \u201cunique value\u201d of the property and came to the conclusion that the real value of the land was worth upwards of $44 million to $116 million dollars, Leavitt told Fox News. AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE JOINS $100 MILLION SEARCH FOR ALIEN LIFE In a statement on Nov. 9, 2016 obtained by Fox News, a prior commander at Nellis Air Force Base, Col. Thomas E. Dempsey explained the reason for seizing the land; \u201cOver the years, technology has increased demand for the test and training range assets and the Air Force has developed infrastructure that directly supports range activities that cannot be replicated elsewhere.\u201d Leavitt is fighting to get the family just compensation, which real estate expert and Fox News Legal Analyst Bob Massi explains as \u201can objective understanding of the value of that property.\u201d Fox News reached out for a comment from Justice Department, which is representing the Air Force but was told by deputy press secretary Wyn Hornbuckle the department will not comment on pending litigation. 'IT WAS NOT FROM THIS WORLD': WITNESS TO 'BRITAIN'S ROSWELL' UFO INCIDENT BREAKS 36-YEAR SILENCE Freelance local investigative reporter Glen Meek has been researching the Sheahan case since the government seized the land and is making a documentary about the land dispute. He noted government\u2019s unwillingness to provide answers and boiled it down to two major fundamental issues - individual rights and national security, saying \u201cthe government\u2019s position is pretty much, the testing that\u2019s going on there now is incompatible with civilians having private land in that area.\u201d The case is currently in discovery. Sheahan says he is a God-loving American and does not want to be portrayed as unpatriotic but wants his family to receive just compensation.\u00a0 Sheahan and Leavitt expect a late spring or early summer court date where a jury will\u00a0decide on the matter of just compensation.\u00a0 Trending in Science ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats have used the latest intelligence findings to renew their calls for an urgent inquiry. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, demanded on Monday that all information about Russia\u2019s meddling be declassified, and that the Obama administration explain what it knows about the hacking and when it knew it. \u201cWe now know that the C.I.A. has determined Russia\u2019s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. \u201cThis should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d Three Senate Democrats \u2014 Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont \u2014 called on Monday for the creation of an independent, nonpartisan commission to comprehensively investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of calling for a special select committee, saying that the Senate intelligence committee was \u201cmore than capable of conducting a complete review\u201d of the matter. While he stopped short of saying whether he agreed that Russia had interfered in the election in support of Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said, \u201cWe need to approach all these on the assumption the Russians do not wish us well.\u201d Mr. McCain was less equivocal, saying Monday that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking\u201d by Russian intelligence services. He called the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and related accounts \u201canother form of warfare\u201d in an appearance on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. For his part, Mr. Trump was dismissive of the intelligence findings and suggested that Democrats were simply stirring controversy. \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that the administration would support a congressional review. He also rejected the notion that the administration had failed to adequately highlight the Russian efforts before the election, and said that the administration had extensively briefed Congress all year about Russian electoral meddling. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere has been intensive cooperation between the intelligence community and other national security agencies, and members of Congress in both parties, both before and after the election,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThe briefings have been provided in a variety of settings, both classified and unclassified.\u201d Even beyond the conclusions of the intelligence community, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had widely known and extensive ties to the Russian government, including a campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who had worked for the Russian-backed government in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who had consulted for a Russian-backed media group, Mr. Earnest noted. Mr. Earnest said that Congress had a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, because those connections were widely known before the election, adding that, for Capitol Hill Republicans, how to \u201creconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is something they\u2019re going to have to explain.\u201d Gardiner Harris and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.

Time Donald Trump (Photo: Ralph Freso) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Cybersecurity professionals respectfully disagree, President-elect Trump:\u00a0You can catch hackers even when they're not in the act. In tweets sent Monday morning discounting U.S. intelligence agencies' assertion that Russia was behind attempts to interfere with the U.S. presidential election,  Trump said it was almost impossible to determine who was actually behind a hack unless they were caught in the act. Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 Unless you catch \"hackers\" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 That's not a view embraced by the thousands who have made their job ferreting out hackers. \"Cyber criminals always leave evidence behind and forensic cybersecurity capabilities have advanced to the point where we can identify and analyze hacks faster than ever before,\u201d said Barak\u00a0Klinghofer, co-founder and chief product officer at Hexadite, a Boston-based company that does cyber-threat incident response. No less an authority that Kevin Mitnick,\u00a0a hacker who spent five years in prison for computer-related crimes, tweeted that Trump was wrong and that hackers can be caught\u00a0after the act. \"Take it from someone who knows this fact very well,\" said Mitnick, who now has his own consulting company, Mitnick Security. Some criminals are, indeed, caught in the act. Security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a hack attack in May, says it watched the hackers while they were in the system. The company was, \u201cable to watch everything that the adversaries were doing while we were working on a full remediation plan to remove them from the network,\" said the company\u2019s chief technology officer\u00a0Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike CTO. One clue: Time off for Russian holidays But hackers leave plenty of clues cyber security professionals can use to identify the perpetrators after the fact. Knowing who\u2019s behind an attack involves combining forensics, data and psychology, said Nick Rossmann, a senior production manager at FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. FireEye is often brought in to do post-attack forensics in large breaches. \u201cThreat intelligence is an art form,\u201d said Rossman. Analysts look at what software the attackers are using, what platforms and what address they\u2019re coming from. \u201cYou look at what tools they\u2019re using. Is it a certain kind of malware that requires skill to use? Was it custom-built to penetrate a specific network?\u201d he said. They also look at motivations, what information was stolen and who it might be useful to. Finally, timing is often a clue. In an investigation of one hacking group, FireEye observed that all the activity took place during the work hours in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and the attackers also took Russian national holidays off. Rossmann added that U.S. intelligence agencies are well-supplied with staffers who have the necessary\u00a0knowledge and background to do these types of investigations. \u201cWe hire people right from the government for a reason.\u00a0They have the skills to do this,\u201d Rossman said. Trump disagrees with U.S. intelligence community The CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump. Trump's transition team responded \u00a0t, \"these are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said\u00a0Monday that two Senate committees will investigate the CIA's allegations. Republican leaders join outrage at Russia, will investigate hacks President Obama on Friday \u00a0ordered\u00a0the nation's intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of attempts by foreign hackers to influence U.S. elections. The entire U.S. intelligence community, which includes 16 different agencies, as well as\u00a0at least three private computer security companies,\u00a0have independently investigated\u00a0security breaches associated with the U.S. presidential election, concluding that the Russian government was behind the hacks. In a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security released on October 7, U.S. intelligence agencies said they were \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\" The specific instances outlined in the statement included: \u25ba Emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. \u25ba Emails from that hack given to WikiLeaks. \u25ba Scanning and probing of state election-related systems. On Sunday, Trump dismissed\u00a0the link as\u00a0\"ridiculous,\" telling Fox News Sunday \"I think it's just another excuse,\" adding\u00a0\"I don't believe it ... Every week it's another excuse.\" ",

Since then, McKinney has depended on odd jobs at his church just to pay the bills. Under Tennessee law he could be eligible for up to $1 million in compensation.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story But in pursuing the F-35 program, Mr. Trump may be facing a target that even he cannot budge. The president-elect is just the latest in a long line of critics in both parties who have beat up on the 15-year project, only to see it survive thanks to deep political support across the country. Lockheed has spread work on the F-35 to hundreds of subcontractors in most of the 50 states, and members of Congress typically oppose any cuts that would cost jobs in their states or districts. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is unclear what alternative the president-elect could embrace if the military turns away from the F-35 this late in the jet\u2019s development; the government has spent about $100 billion on the project, and 204 planes have been built. The Pentagon, under Robert M. Gates, the secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011, canceled a different fighter jet, the F-22 , leaving nothing but the F-35 to replace aging fighters used by the Air Force, Navy and Marines. Once in office, Mr. Trump could try to shrink overall costs by trimming back plans to buy more than 2,400 planes. But doing so simply pushes up the price of each jet. And that in turn could provoke diplomatic incidents with American allies who have contracted to add F-35s to their militaries. Higher costs per plane could exceed their budgets, as well. In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s public criticism of the plane may be about sending a warning message to private companies that contract with the military. While Mr. Trump said throughout the campaign that he would rebuild the nation\u2019s military, his Twitter post on Monday signaled to contractors that they should not try to fleece the federal government. The immediate impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on Monday was financial: After it was published, shares of Lockheed Martin had fallen by 4 percent around midday, reducing the company\u2019s market value by about $4 billion, before rebounding somewhat. Lockheed shares ended the day down about 2.5 percent, closing at $253.11 a share. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter just as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was in Israel to welcome the arrival of two F-35s, the first of a new-generation fleet meant to help maintain Israel\u2019s air superiority in the region. Speaking at the ceremony, Mr. Carter described the F-35 as \u201cthe most advanced aircraft in history\u201d and said, \u201cIsrael is our first and only friend in the region that is flying\u201d it. Lockheed Martin\u2019s program manager for the F-35, Jeff A. Babione, who was also in Israel for the planes\u2019 arrival, said, \u201cI certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question the president-elect would have about the program.\u201d Mr. Babione added that Lockheed had invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane. Lockheed said that if the government stuck to plans to increase production, it could reduce the average price for each F-35 by 2020 to $85 million, about the same as less sophisticated fighters cost. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The F-35 was designed as a state-of-the-art aircraft for all of the branches of the United States military, with the goal of overwhelming adversaries with technological superiority. The jet would be able to evade radar and dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles while giving pilots a better picture of enemy threats advancing toward them. But despite initial promises that the all-in-one plane would save taxpayer money, costs have veered sharply higher over 15 years of development. Mr. Trump has not said how he will seize control of the project\u2019s costs, which have risen despite repeated attempts over more than a decade to restrain spending and fix costly mistakes. In an interview on Sunday, and in a speech to supporters in Michigan on Friday, the president-elect accused military officials of failing to negotiate good deals with private-sector contractors because they know they might be hired by the companies after their military service ends. \u201cThe people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cYou know, they make a deal like that, and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal.\u201d Mr. Trump said military officials who were in charge of negotiating multibillion-dollar deals like the F-35 project should be barred for life from employment with the companies that they worked with, though he did not cite any examples involving the fighter plane. That would be an expansion of the president-elect\u2019s proposal that people who work for his administration be barred from lobbying for five years. In a hearing this year, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, demonstrated the dilemma for members of Congress and others who worry about the ballooning cost of the project. He hailed the plane as a needed part of the country\u2019s arsenal even as he criticized the program\u2019s inability to deliver on time and within budget. \u201cThe full capabilities this aircraft will eventually provide are critical to America\u2019s national security,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cBut at the same time, the F-35 program\u2019s record of performance has been both a scandal and a tragedy.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The technology in the F-35 and other weapons systems is increasingly complex, and politics tend to exacerbate the problems. To lock in congressional support, the Pentagon often starts building the weapons before testing is complete. Cutting funding in the middle of programs can increase costs in the long run if it reduces the economies of scale in the manufacturing plants. Pentagon officials said recently that they needed an extra $500 million to finish development of the planes. They have also been wrangling with Lockheed over the price of the latest batch of planes. The F-35 program is also sensitive diplomatically, and as costs per plane increase, the overruns affect the ability of other countries to buy the jets. Israel, for example, has ordered 33 of the stealth fighters at a cost of more than $5.5 billion, to come from the assistance Israel receives from Washington, and the Israeli cabinet decided recently to increase the number of planes to 50. Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, Christopher Drew from New York and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. ",

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and John Podesta arrive for a portrait unveiling ceremony for retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., last week. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Amid news of possible Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, a top Hillary Clinton adviser is publicly casting support for a push by some members of the Electoral College to receive an intelligence briefing ahead of their formal vote next week. \"The bipartisan electors' letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,\" Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said in statement Monday. \"Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed.\" CIA Concludes Russian Interference Aimed To Elect Trump It's the losing Democratic nominee's most public show of support yet for efforts to question the legitimacy of election results that gave Donald Trump the presidency. And it follows news over the weekend that the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the election to help the Republican win. The letter comes from 10 mostly Democratic electors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine and New Hampshire Rep.-elect Carol Shea-Porter. Only one signatory is a Republican, Texan Chris Suprun, who has already said he is refusing to vote for Trump despite his state's results. The electors point to the recent news about Russian involvement and argue that it's their role to best discharge their duties to \"prevent a 'desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils,'\" as Alexander Hamilton outlined in The Federalist Papers #68. Trump is challenging one of the Colorado electors, who signed the letter, in court. He's claiming that if the court overturns a state law binding electors to the statewide winner, it would undermine his election. Though Colorado did vote for Clinton, some electors are hoping it could be used to overturn other state laws where Trump did win. Article continues after sponsorship Contrary To Trump's Tweet, Russian Hacking Came Up Before Election (A Lot) In his statement of support for the electors' push, Podesta also claims that despite the Clinton's campaign's \"protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign,\" even though the issue was discussed many times by both candidates and reporters. \"We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American,\" Podesta continued. \"Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. This is not a partisan issue and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia's role. We believe that the Administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia's interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia's roles in the election and to make this data available to the public.\" Clinton's campaign also supported recount efforts in key Midwest states, like Wisconsin and Michigan, initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein, though the Democrats were skeptical they would alter the results. Trump and his aides have pushed back against reports of any Russian interference in last month's election, and the president-elect himself cast doubt on the accuracy of the CIA's intelligence. Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, reportedly under consideration for Trump's deputy secretary of state, questioned whether the reports were a \" false flag \" perpetrated by the Obama administration. McConnell, Differing With Trump, Says He Has 'Highest Confidence' In Intel Agencies But GOP congressional leaders are supporting an investigation into whether Russia did interfere. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he has the \"highest confidence\" in U.S. intelligence agencies. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also said in a statement that Congress \"must condemn and push back forcefully against any state-sponsored cyberattacks on our democratic process.\" Democratic congressional leaders have been far more direct in their criticism and accusations. Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blamed FBI Director James Comey's letter in the final weeks of the campaign for reigniting controversy around Clinton's private email server and costing her the election. And yet, Reid noted, Comey did not release more information about possible Russian involvement in the election. \"It's obvious he was a partisan in all this,\" Reid told CNN about Comey. \"There's information out there. He had it, I'm confident. And he ignored it.\" ",

He's preparing to reveal his choice for secretary of state as soon as Tuesday, they said. \"The president-elect has consulted various legal specialists as well as Don McGahn, his pick for White House counsel, about how to deal with his organization, the officials said.
