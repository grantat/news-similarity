The Indianapolis Star reported that the ACLU\u2019s Indiana chapter and Knightstown resident Joseph Tompkins argue that the Christian symbol on display in the Knightstown town square violates the First Amendment. The lawsuit is seeking for removal of the cross, monetary damages and declaration that the cross display violates the First Amendment.\u00a0 CBS affiliate WTTV reported that the suit alleges that the Latin cross \u201cis the preeminent symbol of Christianity, representing the instrument of the crucifixion of Jesus.\u201d So if the display is religious, the suit argues, it has no business on town property. \u00a0 Court documents say that the illuminated cross is atop a large evergreen tree and has for a number of years. The documents say there are no other holiday decorations on the square.\u00a0 \u00a0 The documents go on to say that every day, Tompkins \u201cis forced to come into direct and unwelcome contact\u201d with the cross on top of the tree as he drives through town. This, the suit says, has caused him \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d which can only be remedied by taking the cross down and paying Tompkins monetary damages. \u201cYou gotta sit down and talk about it before you file the lawsuits,\u201d said Knighstown resident Kevin Richey to WTTV. \u00a0 The town of about 2,200 residents is about 40 miles east of Indianapolis.\u00a0 Town officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment from the newspaper or The Associated Press. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Boeing shares moved lower yesterday after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that the government should cancel its order of a new Air Force One 747 jetliner, which he says could cost $4 billion. He also said the costs are \"out of control.\" Video provided by TheStreet Newslook In this June 2003 file photo, a Boeing 747 of Iran's national airline is seen at Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran. Iran said Sunday it has finalized a $16.8 billion deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes, a deal made possible by last year's landmark nuclear agreement. (Photo: Hasan Sarbakhshian, AP) Boeing has government approval to fill Iran Air's $16 billion aircraft order, but it may still be grounded by Congress. And President-elect Trump, who has criticized the Iran nuclear accord that allowed the deal to take off, could eventually have a say, too. The Chicago-headquartered Boeing said Sunday that it will sell 80 jetliners worth $16.6 billion to Iran Air. Boeing got approval to sell planes in Iran in September\u00a0but had to wait for a license for the Iran Air deal from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. This would be the largest business deal that a U.S. company had done with Iran since President Obama signed an executive order lifting sanctions against the country. That\u00a0order came after Iran agreed to end its pursuit of nuclear weapons under an accord reached in July 2015 with\u00a0the United Nations Security Council members \u2014\u00a0the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014\u00a0and Germany. Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One But Boeing's deal could face opposition in Congress and the White House. \u201cWe will aggressively fight this deal in next Congress, though we probably won't even need new legislation to do it,\u201d said David Pasch, communications director for Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill.\u00a0\u201cThe incoming appointees at Treasury and State will no longer report to a White House willing to bend over backward\u00a0and ignore national security concerns (in order) to keep Iran from walking away from the nuclear deal.\u201d In May, Roskam, along with fellow\u00a0Illinois Republican\u00a0Reps. Robert Dold and Randy Hultgren, sent a letter to Boeing asking the company not to do\u00a0business with Iran until it renounces support for terror groups.\u00a0Last month, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would prevent the\u00a0Treasury Department from giving U.S. banks the licenses to help Boeing complete the transactions. Since\u00a0Obama would likely veto the bill, it hasn't moved in the Senate. \"Congress will have a lot to say, particularly working in concert with an administration that has a fairly low view of this deal,\" Roskam told USA TODAY. He also said the\u00a0deal depends on financing.\u00a0Any bank that would get involved \u201chas to ask itself is it worth the reputational risk to be complicit with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism?\u201d Congressional opposition to the Iran nuclear accord has gained momentum with the victory of Trump, who has called\u00a0the accord \"the stupidest deal of all time.\" He and\u00a0Vice President-Elect Mike Pence have suggested they will consider renegotiating the deal when they take office. Trump's transition staff did not respond to requests for comment. Joe Lieberman, the former Independent senator from Connecticut who's now chairman of United Against\u00a0Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group, said the Iran deal faces a hostile\u00a0future in Washington. While it's not clear Congress or the new Trump administration will try to overturn it, \"there will at least be demands for stricter enforcement of the nuclear deal,\u00a0an expansion of non-nuclear sanctions on Iran,\u00a0and for companies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like Boeing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to cease efforts that reward the regime with lucrative business opportunities when it continues to be the leading state-sponsor of terrorism worldwide,\" Lieberman said. Boeing itself\u00a0has also\u00a0been in the news recently with Trump's call for the cancellation of the manufacturer's deal to build the next Air Force One planes because of\u00a0cost overruns on the project.\u00a0\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted last week. Boeing, which also said the Iran deal will help support nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs, expects to begin filling Iran Air's shopping list, which includes 50 737s, in 2018. The planes will be delivered over a 10-year period, Farhad Parvaresh, the managing director of the Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Iran's official news agency IRNA\u00a0 on Sunday. Boeing signs deal to sell aircraft to Iran Boeing isn't the only company looking to cash in in Iran. Competitor Airbus is also breaking into the market, and last week Royal Dutch Shell, the world's second-largest energy company, said it would begin developing oil and gas in Iran. At United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that advocates against the normalization of business dealings with Iran, retired Capt. Michael Pregent\u00a0advised against Boeing's sale due to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps'\u00a0use of \"civilian airliners to support terrorism.\" A founding member of UANI's veterans advisory council, Pregent said, \"It is inexcusable for Boeing to enter into business dealings with the regime when they are fully aware it is responsible for deaths and maiming of our men and women in uniform.\" Before last year's nuclear accord to curtail Iran's nuclear program, the U.S. had not had diplomatic ties with the country since 1980. The year before a revolution overthrew the U.S.-backed shah of Iran and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days. The State Department had considered Iran as a\u00a0\u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\" for funding U.S.-targeted\u00a0militant groups around the world, including Palestinian terror groups.

They were crucial to his November victory. But the challenges those voters face is about more than just economics and government policy, it cuts all the way to the physical health of their communities. People who live in Trump's most supportive communities feel they are not as healthy as the nation as a whole and people in their communities are more likely to die from a drug or alcohol overdose, according to data from the Gallup and the Centers for Disease Control analyzed by the American Communities Project . Meet The Press merged data from three groups of counties that Trump won by more than 20 points - Graying America, Evangelical Hubs and Working Class Country. Those counties carry some common traits. They are more rural than the other places and tend to have lower incomes and lower college education rates. There are 1024 counties in that merged group. Trump won 986 of them. And they look very different from the country on some key health measures. Related: Donald Trump Talks Policy, Conflicts, Calls Idea Russians Helped Him 'Ridiculous' More than 28% of the people in those counties said they have health problems that prevent them from doing things people their age normally can do. In some of those places that was much higher, well over 30%. That's compared to a national average figure of roughly 22%, according to Gallup surveys conducted in the 3rd quarter of 2016. Those are self-diagnoses, of course, and respondents could be referring to anything from hard knee or back pain to diabetes. But the \"health problems\" question is fairly consistent across the counties Trump won. The counties Clinton won tended to have fewer than average people citing \"health problems\" that affected their lives. Play ",

    "text": "Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Is Now Over 2 Million, But Don't Expect Big Changes A statement from his transition team on Friday in response to reports of the CIA assessment said, \"The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history.\" Trump also said in his Fox interview, \"I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country.\" The Short Answer Trump contends that the size of his victory was historic, which is not borne out by the results. Trump won 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232. That comfortably puts him above the required 270 electoral votes. But it's hard to argue this represents a landslide of historic proportions, given that out of 58 presidential elections, the winner has received more electoral votes in 37 contests. The Long Answer Trump's win is historic, but mainly because it was so unexpected. He was outpaced by Hillary Clinton on nearly every conventional metric applied to how a successful campaign is run. Trump was counted out by nearly every political professional, and most of the media. Even his own campaign allies were expecting a loss. So the voters delivered a truly historic upset on Election Day. By that measure, Trump's statement about \"one of the greatest defeats\" holds up. Comparing Trump's 306 electoral votes to recent history, he falls between the 2000 and 2004 razor-thin margins of George W. Bush, and Barack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012. 2000 \u2014 Bush 271, Gore 266 2004 \u2014 Bush 286, Kerry 251 2008 \u2014 Obama 365, McCain 173 2012 \u2014 Obama 332, Romney 206 2016 \u2014 Trump 306, Clinton 232 Article continues after sponsorship So on the historic score, Trump's margin is pretty average for recent elections, and way down the list if you go all the way back to the beginning of the nation. Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, recently calculated the electoral college margins in all 58 U.S. presidential elections, and showed Trump coming in 46th. Separately, there's the question of whether Trump's victory is a \"landslide.\" President Obama is sometimes said to have achieved \"electoral landslides,\" but that is even stretching historical standards. Clear landslides came most recently in the 1980s. Ronald Reagan won 489 electoral votes to Jimmy Carter's 49 in the 1980 election. Four years later, Reagan won 49 states, delivering him a 525 to 13 victory of Walter Mondale. In 1988, George H.W. Bush succeeded Reagan with a total of 426 electoral votes to Michael Dukakis's 111. Each of those Reagan and Bush victories came with an 8 to 9 percent margin in the popular vote, as icing on the cake. Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton by about 2.8 million votes. There have been five presidents who lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College. Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections hide caption toggle caption Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections To be certain, Trump's win the Electoral College is what matters. But his loss in the popular vote to Hillary Clinton is itself historic. At 2.8 million votes, Trump's deficit is by far the largest for any candidate who won the Electoral College and lost the popular vote. ",

Rand Paul: I'm an 'Automatic No' on John Bolton 0 Shares Email Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money. The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' \"This Week\" that he \"won't vote for a budget that never balances\" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him. \"The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment , and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?\" Paul said. Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare. Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible. \"All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,\" Paul said. \"I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,\" he said. Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is \"going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.\" But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state. \"I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,\" Paul said. \"He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War . He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran . He wants to do regime change in Iran.\" \"John Bolton doesn't get it,\" Paul said. ",

But I'm going to have nothing to do with management,\" Trump told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Trump's Businesses And Potential Conflicts: Sorting It Out Trump said recently that he will take steps to separate himself from his business operations and will announce details at a major press conference this coming Thursday. That announcement led to speculation about whether Trump planned to divest himself from his businesses by selling off his vast network of hotels, golf courses and licensing agreements. But the comments Sunday suggest nothing has really changed since Trump first began addressing the issue during the campaign, and that Trump has no intention of selling. \"You know, when you sell real estate, that's not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time,\" Trump said. Former government ethics officers say that by continuing to own businesses while president, Trump allows himself and his family to profit from his office and opens himself up to numerous conflicts of interest. Article continues after sponsorship Not A Hack: U.S. Office Of Government Ethics Tweets At Trump Trump's comments Sunday do little to address those conflicts, says Meredith McGehee, chief of policy, programs and strategy at Issue One , a nonprofit group dedicated to removing money from politics. \"Let's be clear: This is not divestment of foreign holdings. And it's not any kind of blind trust. The bottom line is that, with his children in charge of operations, no way meaningful firewall can exist,\" McGehee said. \"Rather this arrangement enables him to enrich himself and his family through his administration's policies and actions,and will be interpreted by many across the world as a signal of how to gain access and influence with his administration,\" she added. Norm Eisen, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution , said Trump had not come close to addressing the issue. \"His children and his executives and his businesses are going to become a magnet for improper influence in the United States and around the world,\" Eisen said. \"Quids are constantly going to be dangled, and how long will it be before a quo follows?\" During the interview Wallace pressed Trump about the conflicts of interest, noting that \"foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump Hotel in D.C. You've got business operations, deals with foreign countries.\" Trump replied that he has no interest in making money while in the White House. He said he had \"turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest.\" \"If I were going to do new deals right now, I am turning down billions of dollars of deals. I will tell you, running for president, the money I spent is peanuts compared to the money I won't make. And that's OK because this is so important. What I'm doing is so important.\" When Wallace noted that allowing his children to manage the company was \"the same thing,\" Trump replied: \"They're not making deals. And they're going to run my company. I have a lot of property and great stuff. They're going to run it. They're going to run it. Hopefully they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run it properly. But I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be good.\" But Eisen said that arrangement would not resolve conflicts, unless Trump signs over everything to an independent trustee immediately. \"Although it is of course important that Mr. Trump have no involvement in Trump business operations, in order to avoid conflicts, he must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent. Otherwise he will have a personal financial interest in his businesses that will sometimes conflict with the public interest, and constantly raise questions and legal issues,\" Eisen said. \"For example, unless he divests ownership, he will have an interest in the foreign government payments and benefits that flow to his businesses daily,\" he said. \"That creates such a serious conflict of interest that the framers of the constitution prohibited it for the president in the emoluments clause. Far smaller potential conflicts led every president for four decades to do a blind trust or the equivalent, and so should Trump.\" When Wallace pointed out that Trump had \"hammered\" his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, over \"pay to play\" conflicts involving the Clinton Foundation, Trump insisted the two situations were different. \"She's taken in massive amounts of money from foreign countries and other things,\" he said.

Survivor Abubakar Musa said he also saw among the victims the bodies of soldiers, who were guarding a nearby electric power installation. Officials blamed the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group that has staged numerous attacks in Maiduguri, the birthplace of the insurgency. One bomber appeared no older than 7 and the second about 8 years old, said Abdulkadir Jabo, a civilian self-defense fighter who stopped them from going into the market. \"I asked the older girl where she was going but she could not speak Hausa or Kanuri ... and appeared very unsettled, so I turned her back,\" he told The Associated Press. Seconds later, she detonated, followed by the younger girl, Jabo said. Police Commissioner Damian Chukwu identified the bombers as teen-aged girls. Earlier, officials said they were a man and a woman. There was no way to resolve the discrepancies. Boko Haram has used scores of women and girls in suicide bombings, prompting suspicions that some are among the many thousands that they have kidnapped over the years. In a particularly horrific instance, a woman suicide bomber carrying a baby on her back was shot by soldiers at a checkpoint on Nov. 28. The shot detonated her explosives, killing the woman and the baby. Sunday's blasts occurred near Maiduguri's Monday Market, just weeks after the state government reopened the roads leading to the market. They had been closed for nearly two years over security concerns following previous bombings at the market that killed dozens of people. On Friday, two women suicide bombers exploded in a market at Madagali, 150 kilometers (95 miles) southeast of Maiduguri, killing 57 people and wounding 177 including 120 children. Since Nigeria's military has dislodged insurgents from towns and villages this year, Boko Haram has been attacking soft targets. Suicide bombings and attacks on military camps continue, though Nigeria's government claims it has the insurgents on the run. President Muhammadu Buhari declared the Islamic uprising \"technically defeated\" a year ago. On Friday, he vowed Nigeria's military is working \"at slamming the final nail in the coffin of Boko Haram.\" The seven-year insurgency has killed more than 20,000 people, forced 2.6 million from their homes and created a massive humanitarian crisis. Boko Haram, which has one branch allied to the Islamic State group, wants to install an Islamic state in Nigeria, West Africa's oil giant of 170 million people divided almost equally between a mainly Christian south and predominantly Muslim north. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Faul contributed from Lagos, Nigeria. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Lesley Stahl: Saudi Arabia? Benjamin Netanyahu: No comment. Lesley Stahl: I have to ask you, because it\u2019s the most fascinating of all: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are you actually developing an anti-Iran alliance in the Middle East? Benjamin Netanyahu: Doesn\u2019t have to be developed. It\u2019s there anyway. Israel is developing a whole skein of new alliances, in some cases with countries that have been challenging the U.S. around the world like Russia which has placed its troops in Syria, Israel\u2019s next door neighbor. Lesley Stahl: How would you describe your relationship with Russia right now? Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s amicable. But the minute Mr. Putin decided to put his military forces in Syria, I went to see him.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLook, here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \u00a0I\u2019m not intervening in Syria. But at the same time, if Syria tries to intervene with us, if Iran tries to use Syria to attack us, we\u2019ll stop it. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re telling Mr. Putin that you will attack if you\u2019re attacked? Benjamin Netanyahu: I said, \u201cWe should avoid this.\u201d\u00a0 And he said \u201cI agree.\u201d\u00a0 So we coordinated between our militaries because no one wants an inadvertent Israeli-Russian clash. Lesley Stahl: You have a friendship with Mr. Putin, and a friendship with China. You seem to be inching toward an anti-American bloc. Benjamin Netanyahu: God, no.\u00a0 Let me tell you something\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Well, talk about that \u2018cause I think there\u2019s an impression of that. Benjamin Netanyahu: That\u2019s a false impression.\u00a0 First of all, there is, there is an irreplaceable ally.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the United States of America. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but here you are making friends with our adversaries\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: So no. You have relations with Russia and you have relations with China. We can have relations, economic relations, trade relations with other countries as you do.\u00a0 Why not? He has used economic and trade relations to improve Israel\u2019s standing in the world by selling and in some cases giving away its high-tech inventions. Israel boasts of more start-ups per capita than anywhere in the world, many based in Be\u2019er Sheva, and nations have lined up to buy drones, as India has, and cutting-edge agricultural technology, as China has. There\u2019s excitement about a new innovation that extracts drinking water out of air.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So this is Israeli diplomacy through technology? Benjamin Netanyahu: Exactly right. Lesley Stahl: Countries that used to vote against you regularly at the U.N., are now your clients. I mean African nations - . Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s a revolution there.\u00a0 We can\u2019t keep up. What\u2019s surprising is that he\u2019s making progress with all these countries without making any progress with the Palestinians, who\u2019ve lived under Israeli occupation in the West Bank for half a century. Lesley Stahl: What about the quality of Palestinians\u2019 lives. You know, it\u2019s 50 years since what people call \u201cthe occupation.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s 50 years. You still have checkpoints.\u00a0 People have to be cleared. Soldiers everywhere in their lives.\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Actually, I\u2019ve lifted checkpoints quite a bit and we\u2019re trying to create bridges and thoroughfares and so on so we can have freer movement. Palestinians know-- they look at Aleppo in Syria, and they look at Yemen, and they look at Libya, and they look at other places, and they know that our intention is coexistence. Lesley Stahl: You told us that Israel is less isolated today than it has been in many years in the past. And yet, at the same time, you\u2019re losing support in-- in Western Europe. Benjamin Netanyahu: Isolated?? All these countries are coming to Israel and it\u2019s a fantastic change. Lesley Stahl: But not Western Europe.\u00a0 Not you, your natural allies, or your older allies yet. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, they\u2019re coming\u2014 Lesley Stahl: They call you colonials. Benjamin Netanyahu: They\u2019re coming around too. Lesley Stahl: But they call you occupiers. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well they call us a lot of things but I think they\u2019re coming around too, I have to tell you. But criticism has spread, on U.S. campuses too. Lesley Stahl: There\u2019s a movement called BDS, to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel and its products, because of the Palestinian issue, the unresolved Palestinian issue. And this is the playbook that they used, you know, against Apartheid in South Africa\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s not about this or that issue. It\u2019s against the very existence of the State of Israel. Lesley Stahl: You know what they want? I know what they want.\u00a0 They want you to stop expanding and building settlements. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yea, well, we did. We stopped. We stopped in Gaza. We tore out the settlements and gave the Palestinians Gaza.\u00a0 And what happened?\u00a0 Did we get peace?\u00a0 We got 20,000 rockets on our heads and terror tunnels. Still, his critics argue that\u2019s not a justification. For the steady expansion of the settlements in the West Bank. Those settlements are smothering Palestinians\u2019 hope for their own separate state. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think the obsession, the focus on settlements as though this were the issue and this is the obstacle to peace, I disagree with that. Lesley Stahl: But it is an obstacle. I mean\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it\u2019s not an obstacle. Lesley Stahl:\u00a0 Well, you say that, but they don\u2019t say that. \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, but I\u2019ll say something else. The real reason we haven\u2019t had peace is because of a persistent refusal of the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state in any border. \u201cYou ask us to recognize you, I\u2019m willing to do that. I ask you to recognize us. Recognize the Jewish state, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d And if they do, this thing will begin to correct itself very quickly.\u00a0 It\u2019s a condition he doesn\u2019t put on his new friends.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Have any of the Arab states said they accept Israel as a Jewish state? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah they say a lot of things in various forms. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: And never actually said they accept you. Benjamin Netanyahu: Do they say it publicly at this point?\u00a0 Not yet.\u00a0 He acknowledges that the Arab states want to see movement on the Palestinian issue. \u00a0 But despite Washington\u2019s call for a halt, settlement expansion has continued, even after the U.S. gave Israel a $38 billion military aid package. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas recently greeted each other at the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres. But the two have not held open, direct negotiations in over six years, for which they blame each other.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: What kind of a state is it going to be if you just, you know, don\u2019t do anything? Benjamin Netanyahu: I\u2019m not going to just not do anything. I\u2019m going to do something. Lesley Stahl: Well, if you don\u2019t negotiate with the Palestinians\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019m willing to negotiate with them at any moment. Lesley Stahl: And if it doesn\u2019t happen? Benjamin Netanyahu: I haven\u2019t reversed my position.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said, \u201cLook, we will solve this because we want two nation states at peace and with the proper security arrangements. Lesley Stahl: You would be pushing for a two-state solution if that\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Two states for two peoples. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m focused.\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019d like to have President Trump, when he gets into the White House, help me work on that.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see if the Arab states can help me achieve that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new reality.\u00a0 A new possibility.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Elise Viebeck and Karoun Demirjian December 11 at 1:57 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Follow @karoun Republicans Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) have been highly critical of Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Russia. On Sunday, they joined Democrats in demanding a wide-ranging probe of Russia\u2019s election influence. (Michael Reynolds/EPA) Two Senate Republicans joined\u00a0demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia\u2019s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald J. Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-elect\u2019s expected\u00a0decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee\u00a0\u2014 joined calls by incoming\u00a0Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.) \u00a0for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIA\u2019s private conclusion that Russia\u2019s activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA's assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyber-attacks.\u201d [ Trump, CIA on collision course over Russia\u2019s role in the election ] \u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security,\u201d they added. But McCain and Graham \u2014 who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election \u2014\u00a0 have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). One GOP senator \u2014 Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee \u2014 agreed with McCain and Graham\u2019s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections. \u201cCybersecurity investigation of Russian interference can\u2019t be partisan,\u201d Lankford tweeted Sunday. Republicans may be loathe to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into Russia\u2019s election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as \u201cridiculous.\u201d They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he praised during the campaign. \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it . . . No, I don\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d Trump said of the CIA charges on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d CIA officials told senators it is now \"quite clear\" that electing Donald Trump was Russia's goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) [ Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election ] McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets \u2014 although some of them suggested Congress\u2019s review of Russian actions should broaden. \u201cAll this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news,\u201d Cornyn tweeted Saturday. The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: \u201cCyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia \u2013 not just election influence.\u201d \u2014 JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 10, 2016 Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he \u201crejects any politicization of intelligence matters,\u201d calling foreign intervention \u201cunacceptable.\u201d For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether \u00a0Putin\u2019s government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trump\u2019s likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO, as secretary of state due to his \u00a0ties to\u00a0Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State,\u201d Rubio tweeted Sunday. Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Bob Menendez (N.J.) and Chris Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate. Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state \u201calarming and absurd,\u201d concluding that \u201cthe Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President\u2019s Cabinet guiding our nation\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d Yet\u00a0the committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) \u2014 who was considered a possible pick for Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 has said Tillerson would be a good choice. \u201cIf it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual,\u201d Corker tweeted. Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone.

More than 1,390 flights were canceled in Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports \u2014 about half arrivals and half departures, flight-tracking website FlightAware reported. O'Hare recorded 3.9 inches of snowfall and Midway recorded 3.7 as of noon on Sunday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said. By Sunday afternoon, 213 flights had been cancelled at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, according to FlightAware. Across the United States, more than 2,000 flights were delayed on Sunday, according to FlightAware, although not necessarily all of them were due to weather. Additional snowfall was forecast from Minnesota across the Great Lakes on Sunday, heading into parts of the Northeast by evening, Frank Giannasca, senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel, told NBC News. As much as 5 to 8 inches of additional snowfall was expected across the lower Great Lakes towards parts of the interior Northeast, he said. The storm had dumped more than half a foot of snow on parts of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin by early Sunday afternoon, according to the Weather Channel .

Airport (@fly2ohare) December 11, 2016 People traveling across the Great Lakes and parts of the Midwest, and from Pennsylvania and up through Michigan and Chicago would be \"dealing with periods of snow and probably some snow covered roads\" in areas where it may be hard for crews to keep up, Giannasca said. Chicago could see a total of 7 to 12 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said, and it and the region was under a winter storm warning through Sunday night. The city was bracing for plunging temperatures that are expected to send the thermometer to around 8 degrees next week. Post by NBC News . \"This is certainly going to be the coldest air this year,\" Weather Channel meteorologist Kelly Cass said. Map depicting snow cover from light to heavy across the U.S. at 1:10 a.m. ET on Sunday. The Weather Channel A swath of the country from South Dakota to Vermont was under a winter weather advisory early Sunday, the weather service said. The storm could bring up to 7 more inches of snow to the coast of Lake Erie in Ohio. In Kirtland, Ohio, east of Cleveland, nearly 33 inches of snow had fallen over the course of the storm as of Saturday morning, the weather service said. An additional 5 to 8 inches of snow was also expected in Detroit, the Weather Channel said, and close to five inches were forecast in Cleveland. A plane slid off the runway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport Sunday at around 11:30 a.m., Delta Air Lines said in a statement. The flight landed and was turning from the runway onto the taxiway \"when it left the pavement, stopping in the snowy grass,\" Delta said. No injuries were reported and the aircraft was towed to the maintenance hangar for inspection, the airline said. A Federal Aviation Administration source told NBC News the incident looked like the result of \"poor braking conditions,\" noting that the runway was wet and snowy.

Snow was expected to continue falling in the Northeast Monday through the evening, impacting a swath from northern Pennsylvania to New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, according to the Weather Channel. While New York City could get snow early Monday, it is more likely to turn into rain, forecasters said. Around 3 inches could fall north of the city, throughout Connecticut and in Boston by the time it's all over, forecasters said. Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., were also expected to see rain into Monday morning. Another round of snow was in store for the Pacific Northwest and the Plains this weekend. By Monday, snow totals will reach as much as 2 feet in some parts of Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, The Weather Channel reported. There was some good news for commuters for the rest of the week, Giannasca said. \"By tomorrow really the worst of the storm will be over, except for Maine,\" he said. \"It'll be winding down everywhere else after the morning.\" But the storm's departure was set to bring frigid temperatures afterward to the Midwest and Northeast by mid-week, according to the Weather Channel, with some areas featuring temperatures up to 30 degrees below average.

    "text": "Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump last week in Columbus, Ohio. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump , defending his recent phone call with Taiwan\u2019s president , asserted in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States was not bound by the One China policy, the 44-year diplomatic understanding that underpins America\u2019s relationship with its biggest rival. Mr. Trump, speaking on Fox News, said he understood the principle of a single China that includes Taiwan, but declared, \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\u201d \u201cI mean, look,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201d Mr. Trump is not the first incoming Republican president to question the One China policy, but his suggestion that it could be used as a chip to correct Chinese behavior sets him apart, several Asia experts said. While Mr. Trump has been praised by some Republicans for taking a new look at China policy, his stance could risk a backlash by Beijing, the analysts said. Not since 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon and Mao Zedong enshrined the One China principle in the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9, has an American president or president-elect so publicly and explicitly questioned the agreement, which resulted in the United States\u2019 ending its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Chinese government issued no immediate response to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. But the comments are likely to reignite a debate that erupted nine days ago when he took a congratulatory phone call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan. At first, Mr. Trump played down the implications of the call, saying he was just being polite. Later, his aides said he was well aware of the diplomatic repercussions of speaking to Taiwan\u2019s leader. Lobbyists for Taiwan, including the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas , spent months laying the groundwork for the call. On Friday, China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has designated as his national security adviser, according to a person told about the meeting. It was not clear what the men had discussed. Some Republican foreign policy experts \u2014 including John R. Bolton, who is believed to be a front-runner for the post of deputy secretary of state \u2014 have praised Mr. Trump for shaking up a decades-old diplomatic agreement. As a candidate, Ronald Reagan criticized the decision to abrogate recognition of Taiwan; after his election, he invited a delegation from Taiwan to attend his inauguration, antagonizing Beijing. In 1982, as president, Reagan pushed for the so-called Six Assurances, one of which was a reaffirmation that the United States did not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, he abided by the terms of the 1979 joint communiqu\u00e9 that established relations between the United States and China. Photo President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan speaking on the phone with Mr. Trump this month at her office in Taipei, Taiwan. Credit Taiwan Presidential Office But Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the policy could be wielded as a chip in a broader negotiation with China has implications not just for Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing, several experts on Asia said, but also for America\u2019s support for Taiwan. \u201cBy putting One China up for grabs, Trump will suck all the oxygen out of the U.S.-China relationship, and it risks eventually trading away U.S. support for Taiwan for another U.S. interest,\u201d said Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere are good reasons why eight presidents since 1972 have relied on the One China policy,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is one area where the Trump team would do well to heed the lessons of history instead of bucking them in the uncertain hope of getting something.\u201d Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Medeiros\u2019s predecessor in the Obama administration, said the One China policy had \u201calways been seen as a foundation of the relationship.\u201d \u201cNow Trump apparently sees it as part of a broader set of new transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cMixing trade with an issue seen by Beijing as involving sovereignty is likely to produce an angry Chinese backlash and worsen both issues.\u201d An editorial on Monday in The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, said that Mr. Trump was \u201clike a child in his ignorance of foreign policy.\u201d \u201cThe One China policy cannot be bought and sold,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cTrump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price.\u201d Mr. Trump, however, did not appear worried about inflaming Beijing. He repeated in the Fox News interview many of the criticisms he has made about China, emphasizing what he said was its unwillingness to help curb the nuclear ambitions of its neighbor North Korea \u2014 an issue that foreign policy experts believe could confront Mr. Trump as the first geopolitical crisis of his presidency. The president-elect said he would not tolerate having the Chinese government dictate whether he could take a call from the president of Taiwan. He reiterated that he had not placed the call, and described it as \u201ca very short call saying, \u2018Congratulations, sir, on the victory.\u2019\u201d The Chinese government, which once viewed Mr. Trump favorably as an alternative to the hawkish Hillary Clinton, has struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach. China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, initially played down the significance of the phone call, calling it a \u201cpetty action by the Taiwan side\u201d that he said would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But as Mr. Trump has repeated his campaign criticisms of China \u2014 and as his statements about Taiwan have rippled throughout the region \u2014 Beijing has noticeably hardened its tone. It warned him last week, in a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People\u2019s Daily, that \u201ccreating troubles for the China-U.S. relationship is creating troubles for the U.S. itself.\u201d Advertisement In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. Trump, the editorial said that pushing China on Taiwan \u201cwould greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again.\u201d Christopher Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.

Against a four-man rush, Stafford scanned the field, then took off when pressured. He side-stepped linebacker John Timu at about the 4-yard line. \u00a0 The Bears (3-10) forced the Lions to come from behind by intercepting Stafford twice in the fourth quarter. In the process, they ended their streak of 18 quarters without an interception or fumble recovery. \u00a0 On the second interception, rookie Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc was physical against veteran Anquan Boldin, then undercut an out route. Le\u2019Blanc raced 24 yards to the end zone, holding the ball above his head and high-stepping the last 10 yards. It gave the Bears a 17-13 lead with 7:07 to play. \u00a0 The Bears tried to drive from their 25 into field goal range. Holding penalties against Charles Leno, then Ted Larsen, negated back-to-back completion of 27 and 23 yards into Lions territory. That set up a climactic fourth-and-11 from the Lions\u2019 44.

By Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell December 11 at 6:39 PM Follow @mikedebonis Follow @kelsey_snell Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President-elect Donald Trump is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law\u2019s insurance would go away. Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast. While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years. \u201cI\u2019d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,\u201d said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d efforts. \u201cWe have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats won\u2019t help with anything.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. 3. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Hatch and other high-ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections. Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the 84,000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two-thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy,\u201d Collins said. But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues \u2014 many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti-Obama waves of 2010 and 2014 \u2014 who see little reason to dawdle. \u201cThe history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that it\u2019ll never get done,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), elected recently as the new chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. \u201cRepublicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?\u201d Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot-dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a \u201cterrific\u201d replacement that will provide \u201cgreat health care at a fraction of the cost.\u201d The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare\u2019s sunset. But other fights loom \u2014 over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition. The battle lines, however, are familiar, with \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to retire. Come Jan.\u00a020, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health-care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan.\u00a03. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets. So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute. \u201cWe\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. \u201cThe number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people.\u201d Hard-liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill \u201cwith all deliberate speed\u201d but pledged only to then \u201cset into motion a process to replace it.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Republicans would move \u201cas well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people.\u201d Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing. \u201cThe idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace,\u201d he said. Conservative activists who pushed a take-no-prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited. \u201cWhen Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you don\u2019t wait,\u201d said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. \u201cI\u2019m a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. That\u2019s it.\u201d Democrats and many health-care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12\u00a0million Americans are covered under those policies. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed-door meeting. \u201cDelayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states,\u201d Burwell told reporters after the meeting. Republicans want to end Obamacare\u2019s system of penalties and subsidies. But many \u2014 including Trump \u2014 want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick. Experts warn that \u201crepeal and delay\u201d under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3\u00a0billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated. \u201cThat $3\u00a0billion is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Blumberg said. \u201cWith all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get.\u201d Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers. \u201cThe insurance industry should understand that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cThey signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, they\u2019re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free-market insurance industry.\u201d The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic. There will be a slim 52-to-48 Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes. Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan \u2014 and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so. \u201cWe all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all,\u201d Hatch said. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, has rejected that strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it,\u201d he told The Washington Post recently. But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well-organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction. One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal-and-replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11,000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks that you\u2019re going to flip a switch . . . but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done.\u201d Brandon was even blunter: \u201cThis is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies],\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? It\u2019s hard. \u201cThe political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place,\u201d he added. \u201cThe old excuses of having divided government, they\u2019re gone.\u201d A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. \u201cThey have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully they\u2019ll recognize that it\u2019s not quite so simple,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave. But many others are not. \u201cLiterally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a first-termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to act on it.\u201d John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Trump Links C.I.A. Reports on Russia to Democrats\u2019 Shame Over Election By NICHOLAS FANDOS Continue reading the main story Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump during a \u201cthank you\u201d rally on Friday in Grand Rapids, Mich. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he did not believe American intelligence assessments that Russia had intervened to help his candidacy, casting blame for the reports on Democrats, who he said were embarrassed about losing to him. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He also indicated that as president, he would not take the daily intelligence briefing that President Obama and his predecessors have received. Mr. Trump, who has received the briefing sparingly as president-elect, said that it was often repetitive and that he would take it \u201cwhen I need it.\u201d He said his vice president, Mike Pence, would receive the daily briefing. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years.\u201d He added that he had instructed the officials who give the briefing: \u201c\u2018If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I\u2019m available on a one-minute\u2019s notice.\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming dismissal of the importance of that daily interaction with intelligence agencies, as well as his claims of politically tainted intelligence reports on Russia, widened a breach between a president-elect and the agencies he will have to rely on to carry out priorities like fighting terrorism and deterring cyberattacks. His stance on the issue is also putting him increasingly at odds with senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including members of his own party, who say that the evidence of Russian interference is clear and warrants a congressional investigation. The Obama administration reached a consensus months ago that Russia was trying to meddle in the election. After initially believing that Russia\u2019s goal was to undermine American democratic processes, the intelligence agencies concluded a week after the vote that the Russian efforts had been intended, at least in their latter stages, to help Mr. Trump. The president-elect said those new reports were politically motivated. \u201cI think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,\u201d he said in the interview, recorded on Saturday. During the campaign, he also dismissed suggestions of Russian meddling. Pressed about why he did not believe the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions, Mr. Trump said there was disagreement among intelligence agencies about the extent and the origin of the hacking.

    "text": "Trump vows no \u2018wrecking ball\u2019 to Obama legacy \u2013 but signals big changes Published               December 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump left the door open Sunday on how exactly he plans to overhaul the regulation-heavy agenda pursued by the Obama administration, suggesting he wouldn\u2019t dismantle all that his predecessor has done \u2013 while making clear the government needs to be more business-friendly. Asked in an exclusive interview with \u201c Fox News Sunday \u201d whether he\u2019d take a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d to President Obama\u2019s legacy, the construction magnate responded: \u201cNo.\u00a0I don't want to do that at all.\u00a0I just want what's right.\u201d The answer may have surprised those watching Trump\u2019s recent Cabinet selections, which have included: a prominent ObamaCare critic to lead the Health and Human Services Department; a foe of Obama\u2019s overtime pay expansion to lead the Labor Department; and a state attorney general currently suing the Environmental Protection Agency to lead that very agency. Trump, at the same time, has sent mixed signals about his plans, meeting in recent days with prominent climate change activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about the implications of those meetings as well as his Cabinet selections, Trump indicated his interest is in making the government more efficient and responsive to business.\u00a0 TRUMP RIPS CLAIMS OF RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IN 2016 RACE At the EPA, he said, \u201cYou can't get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay?\u00a0That's why people don't want to invest in this country.\u201d\u00a0 Trump said: \u201cSo we're going to clean it up.\u00a0We're going to speed it up and, by the way, if somebody is not doing the right thing we're not going to approve. \u2026 We can't let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.\u201d Trump steered clear of committing to specific actions regarding projects that have pitted environmental interests against the energy industry, while suggesting economic considerations are paramount to him. On the long-disputed Keystone pipeline that was halted by the Obama administration, Trump said \u201cyou\u2019re going to have a decision fairly quickly.\u201d Asked about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which the Army Corps of Engineers wants to re-route following protests, Trump said he did not want to answer right now. \u201cBut I will tell you, when I get to office, if it's not solved, I'll have it solved very quickly,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cSomething will happen.\u00a0It'll be quick.\u00a0I think it's very unfair.\u00a0So, it\u2019ll start, one way or the other.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, said he is still studying the Paris climate agreement \u2013 a pact, backed by the U.S. and dozens of other nations, committing countries to curb the global rise in temperatures \u2013 but, \u201cI don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries.\u201d When asked where he stood on the environment and climate change, Trump would not be pinned down. \u201cI'm very open-minded.\u00a0I'm still open-minded.\u00a0Nobody really knows,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cLook, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows.\u00a0It's not something that's so hard and fast. I do know this:\u00a0other countries are eating our lunch.\u201d Taken together, Trump\u2019s comments, meetings and appointments speak to an incoming president still weighing his options on how drastically he wants to reverse or halt the Obama regulatory agenda. In an indication that the incoming administration may be preparing for big changes with regard to energy sector programs and rules, his transition team reportedly has sent around a questionnaire asking the Energy Department for a list of appointees and senior executives \u2013 and details on who has spearheaded the agency\u2019s clean energy initiatives. One unnamed department official described the questionnaire as a hit list, according to an Associated Press report. The memo sparked alarm among some Democrats, as did Trump\u2019s decision last week to name Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. Pruitt has been involved in lawsuits against the Obama EPA, including over the controversial Clean Power Plan and waterway regulations. He also has suggested the debate over global warming \u2013 and the impact of human activity on global temperatures \u2013 is unsettled. \u00a0 Former Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested Sunday that the Pruitt pick suggests the meetings with Gore and others are not informing policy decisions. \u201cI\u2019m glad they reached out to Gore, but apparently they are not hearing what Gore has to say,\u201d he told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Sanders said it\u2019s troubling Trump would appoint a climate change \u201cdenier\u201d to lead the EPA. Trump\u2019s first order of Obama legacy business may be the Affordable Care Act, with congressional Republicans eager to send a repeal bill to his desk next year. Trump has said he plans to nominate Georgia Rep. Tom Price to lead HHS, which would put an outspoken ObamaCare critic at the helm of the agency that implemented the law. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that the Obama administration \u201cpushed investment out\u201d with its raft of rules and predicted a shift toward what he called \u201ccommon-sense regulation,\u201d including with health care. \u00a0 \u201cOur No. 1 focus is jobs [in the House],\u201d he said. \u201c[ObamaCare] is going to collapse on itself. We have to look at health care in a new form and have a new health care system.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "(David Lazarus) When Zeldes heard about Makaeff\u2019s call to her firm \u2014 a four-person operation in 2010 \u2014 her ears perked up. \u201cI thought, \u2018Trump University. Is there a university I hadn\u2019t heard of? Is this a real university? Do people really think this is a university?\u2019\u201d she recalled. As luck would have it, a\u00a090-minute Trump University preview seminar was being held in San Marcos. Zeldes decided to check it out. \u201cMy heart broke,\u201d Zeldes said. \u201cI thought, wow, this is really a dog and pony show. You walk in and there\u2019s these big life-sized posters of Donald Trump. I got to hear the pitch and see people really compelled by the pitch they were making.\u00a0\u2026 They\u2019d say \u2018How many people lost equity on their homes? How many want to leave that legacy for their children? How many of you want to learn how to make that money back?\u2019\u201d The attendees were encouraged to pay $1,500 for a three-day seminar to learn more, which led to pitches for a $35,000 yearlong program promising real estate riches, according to former students. Makaeff claimed to have spent about $60,000 in all. Zeldes\u2019 firm took the case on a contingency, but before filing\u00a0the complaint in San Diego federal court the attorneys brought on Robbins Geller, which had more staff and resources. Once the lawsuit was filed on April 30, 2010, the phone calls started coming in. \u201cI probably personally spoke to almost 400 people who took Trump University courses,\u201d attorney Amber Eck recalled. \u201cThese are devastating stories.\u201d From seniors to business people to real estate entrepreneurs, the students\u00a0had similar stories of being encouraged to max out one, two or\u00a0three credit cards to pay for Trump University courses, Eck said, or to take out retirement savings, inheritances or home equity credit. The attorneys\u2019\u00a0big break in the case came when they began hearing from former Trump University employees. They\u00a0leaked playbooks and scripts used by instructors long before the items were released in discovery. The documents detailed the room layout\u00a0during seminars, the temperature the thermometer should be set at (\u201cno more than 68\u00a0degrees\u201d), the many comebacks that employees could use when students were reluctant to put down money. \u201cThey specifically set up the room so the exit would be blocked so it\u2019d be difficult to get past a Trump University person,\u201d Eck said. Trump fights back Attorney Jason Forge, of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, speaks to the media after a Trump University court hearing in San Diego. Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune Attorney Jason Forge, of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, speaks to the media after a Trump University court hearing in San Diego. Attorney Jason Forge, of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, speaks to the media after a Trump University court hearing in San Diego. (Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune) Early on in the case, Trump delivered a counterpunch, suing Makaeff for defamation. \u201cThere was no grace period where there was smooth sailing,\u201d said\u00a0Jensen, of Robbins Geller. \u201cThis case always had challenges by virtue of who the defendant is.\u201d Trump\u2019s suit made its way to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Makaeff prevailed. Jensen questioned Trump during his first deposition in 2012 at Trump Tower in New York\u00a0and described the encounter as confrontational. \u201cHe threatened to sue me and my firm. There was bullying and intimidation going on,\u201d she said. Trump aggressively defended his program. He and his legal team\u00a0said Makaeff and other disgruntled students didn\u2019t put in enough effort to succeed in business and partly blamed the downturn in the real estate market for their troubles. \u201cThe student evaluations received throughout the courses of Trump University were extraordinarily positive,\u201d Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said in an interview. \u201cPeople sought out this program because they wanted to better their lives, supplement their income, change jobs, reach out and try something new and different in their lives to challenge themselves, and that\u2019s much of what the courses and instruction offered people.\u201d Forge, from Robbins Geller, was brought on as a lead litigator in the case in 2013. He\u2019d gained a reputation as a hard-charging assistant U.S. attorney and\u00a0was part of the team that prosecuted Rep. Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham in the largest bribery scandal in congressional history. He also brought his experience prosecuting white-collar criminals under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\u00a0to the Trump case. \u201cThe more I thought about it the more I thought this could be a pretty good RICO case,\u201d Forge said. \u201cThe allegations in this case are not that different from the kind of Ponzi schemes I worked on at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\u201d The lawyers tried to add a RICO cause of action to the lawsuit, but it was denied. So they filed a separate class-action lawsuit using RICO. Art Cohen, a Northern California businessman and former student who had contacted the attorneys with offers to participate in the case, became the class representative. Trump University 101 Students allege they paid up to $35,000 to attend\u00a0seminars and learn\u00a0inside secrets to success in real estate from mentors who were \u201chandpicked\u201d by Trump. Instead, they claim the program was nothing more than an infomercial trying to squeeze more money out of students and that they did not learn what was promised.

See more videos Case put in national spotlight U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio injected Trump University into the national conversion in February when he leveled a series of attacks against Trump during a televised Republican presidential debate. \u201cI was at the gym.\u00a0I\u2019m on the elliptical and the guys next to me are talking about, \u2018Hey, did you hear about Trump University?\u2019\u201d Zeldes recalled. \u201cThe Republicans were using our case to try to get rid of Trump, then it became a household word.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer said the case suddenly became a \u201cpolitical football.\u201d \u201cThe case was used, unfairly so,\u00a0with enormous distortions by political opponents to try to take shots at Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump handled himself deftly when asked about it. \u2026 His opponents were searching for anything they could to undermine his popularity with the public and used the case as a political weapon, and ended up obviously failing,\u201d Petrocelli said. He called the press coverage on the case overwhelmingly biased. \u201cThat was probably the biggest challenge, overcoming the negative publicity that portrayed the case in a very unfair and inaccurate light,\u201d Petrocelli said. That\u2019s also when Trump lashed out at the judge overseeing the case, calling U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel a \u201cMexican\u201d who was biased against him for his views on immigration.\u00a0Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants. But Trump\u2019s rise politically did little to change the inner workings of the case, other than present logistical scheduling challenges, the attorneys said. The intense media scrutiny had its effect on\u00a0Makaeff, who\u2019d been suffering from health problems and family issues and decided she couldn\u2019t take the stress of being a class representative any longer. The judge allowed her to step back from the case. That left as named plaintiffs Sonny Low, 75, a retired foreign service officer in Chula Vista who works at\u00a0 Home Depot \u00a0to pay off his Trump University debt, John Brown in New York, and J.R. Everett in Florida. Trump gets deposed Attorneys found a more cooperative, engaged\u00a0Trump in his final two depositions, in December 2015 and January 2016. \u201cHe would give much more candid responses than typical of a real polished CEO who knows how to smile and shine you on without really answering questions. That\u2019s not his style,\u201d said Forge, who did the questioning. \u201cHe gave answers to a lot of questions, and I would not question the sincerity at all. I respected him for giving us very real answers. \u201cIt ties back into the persona he has, not as if his persona is a fake one. He wants to be seen, and it\u2019s well earned. He\u2019s somebody who calls it as he sees it.\u201d Eck, who was at the depositions, attributes Trump\u2019s candor to the strong evidence that was piled up against him by that point. \u201cOnce you have someone in a box it\u2019s easier to get the testimony,\u201d she said. She also thinks Trump was anticipating the transcripts of the depositions would be made public \u2014\u00a0which they were. The final deposition, at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, included friendly chit-chat. \u201cHe was downright charming. He was very nice,\u201d Forge said. \u201cHe asked me on break, \u2018Are you surprised how I\u2019m doing in the polls?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I have to say, I am.\u2019 \u201c\u2018That\u2019s OK, so am I,\u2019\u201d Trump responded, according to Forge. The conversation surrounding Trump\u2019s campaign continued. \u201cI said, \u2018A lot of things you are saying are really great. Other things are really scary,\u2019\u201d Forge said. Trump didn\u2019t appear to take offense at the comment, he said. The stunning downfall of San Diego Congressman Cunningham also came up. \u201cI said [Trump]\u00a0was right on the money about how corrupt the system was, not just the rank corruption that [the Cunningham]\u00a0case involved, but that so many people told us over the course of that investigation that if Cunningham would have been smarter, he would have worked the system to get just as much money without breaking the law.\u201d Both sides get ready for the trial ",

(Fox 13 Tampa) An internal report blames staffers at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Florida for leaving the body of a deceased veteran to decompose in a shower for nine hours and then trying to cover it up. The 24-page report concluded that hospice staffers at the Bay Pines VA hospital failed to provide appropriate post-mortem care to the veteran\u2019s body, Fox 13 Tampa reports. The report found hospice staff put the veteran\u2019s body in a hallway and left it there for an unspecified time, the station reported. Staff then put the veteran\u2019s body in the shower room and did not \u201ccheck on the status of the decedent\u2026for over nine hours.\u201d The report also found that a staff member then \u201cfalsely documented\u201d the incident, Fox 13 reported. The investigative report said that leaving the body unattended for so long increased the chance of decomposition. WISCONSIN VA DENTIST FAILED TO MEET PROPER CLEANING STANDARDS \"The report details a total failure on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs and an urgent need for greater accountability,\" Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., told the station. \"Unsurprisingly, not a single VA employee has been fired following this incident, despite a clear lack of concern and respect for the veteran. The men and women who sacrificed on behalf of our nation deserve better.\" The unnamed veteran died in February after spending time in hospice care. The hospital's Administrative Investigation Board ordered retraining for staff. Hospital spokesman Jason Dangel told the Tampa Bay Times hospital officials view what happened as unacceptable. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Video provided by AFP Newslook President-elect Donald Trump attending the Army-Navy game Saturday in Baltimore (Photo: Rob Carr) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Donald Trump ran for the White House\u00a0as an outsider and a pragmatist.\u00a0But he's quickly putting together an administration\u00a0that will be\u00a0the most fiercely conservative of any in decades. After campaigning as the least ideological presidential contender in modern times, Trump is\u00a0naming a Cabinet and senior White House staff that is dominated by retired military leaders, wealthy business executives and partisan activists who oppose the historic mission of the departments they are poised to head. While the president-elect issued few policy blueprints while he was seeking the job, his nominees for key posts already have been leading the charge to dismantle President Obama's initiatives on health care and climate change. \"I call it the\u00a0three 'G' Cabinet: Goldman, generals and gazillionaires,\" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, said mockingly Sunday on ABC's This Week, a reference to multiple Trump appointees who have worked at the Wall Street firm\u00a0Goldman Sachs. On Fox News Sunday, Trump said he\u00a0was\u00a0\"very, very close\" to naming his pick for the Cabinet's biggest prize, secretary of State, speaking favorably of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. \"He's much more than a business executive,\" Trump said of Tillerson, reported to be the frontrunner for the job.\u00a0\"I mean, he's a world-class player.\" The president-elect also favorably mentioned two other prospects, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker. Trump's unorthodox campaign, dominated by a promise to \"make America great again\" and attacks on Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, gave limited \u00a0insights about what a Trump administration would look like. But in the past four weeks, he has\u00a0reassured Republicans and alarmed Democrats by appointments that largely reflect GOP orthodoxy \u2014 from a Labor secretary-designate who opposes raising the minimum wage to a Housing and Urban Development secretary-designate who warns that subsidized housing fosters dependency. His domestic team would have been a good fit for just about any of his Republican primary rivals, though Trump's friendly stance toward Russia and its provocative president, Vladimir Putin, is at odds with GOP tradition and the party's leading congressional voices on foreign policy. So far, Trump's choices \u2014 including top jobs for a trio of veterans of Goldman Sachs, a firm he blasted at campaign rallies\u00a0\u2014 haven't reflected the populist impulses that fueled his appeal to some white working-class voters\u00a0or his vow to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington of donors and other insiders. \"I think we're going to have one of the great Cabinets ever put together,\" Trump boasted.\u00a0The nominations, announced via Twitter and at campaign-style rallies, provide clues about how he will operate and what he will do after the Inauguration. Here are some things we're learning: 'I like generals' \"I think generals are terrific, you know?\" Trump said in Sunday's interview on Fox News. \"They go through schools and they sort of end up at the top of the pyramid, and it's like a test. They passed the test of life.\" He's picked three of them to top jobs: retired Marine Corps Gen.\u00a0James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis as secretary of Defense, retired Marine Corps Gen.\u00a0John Kelly as secretary of Homeland Security, and retired Army Gen.\u00a0Michael Flynn as national security adviser. He's also met at Trump Tower with retired Army Gen.\u00a0David Petraeus and retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis as he weighed the possibilities for secretary of State. Corporate command Not since the Eisenhower administration have so many business executives landed top government jobs, making Trump's Cabinet the wealthiest in American history. \"I want people that made a fortune because now they're negotiating with you,\" he told supporters in Des Moines Thursday during his \"thank you\" tour. \"It's not different than a great baseball player or a great golfer.\" He has designated former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Bannon as his senior White House strategist, Goldman veteran Steve Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary and\u00a0billionaire activist Betsy DeVos as Education secretary. Another billionaire, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, has been named deputy Commerce secretary. Linda McMahon, a former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, has been chosen to head the Small Business Administration. A millionaire who is married to a billionaire,\u00a0she contributed $7 million to pro-Trump super PACs\u00a0this fall. Climate-change campaign in the crosshairs Last week, environmental activists were encouraged when Trump met with former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, both activists on climate change. Then the president-elect selected as head of the Environmental Protection Agency Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt \u2014 a skeptic of climate change who repeatedly has sued the EPA to push back regulations aimed at reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), an ally of the fossil-fuel industry, is reported to be Trump's choice to lead the Interior Department. She has supported legislation to open the Atlantic Ocean to drilling and prevent the Interior Department from regulating hydraulic fracturing. Trump, who during the campaign called climate change \"a big scam,\" now says it's up for debate and decries the burden of regulations on businesses. (Mainstream scientists overwhelmingly agree that the climate is changing, in part due to human activity.) \"I'm still open-minded,\" Trump said Sunday. \"Nobody really knows.\" He complained that China, Mexico and other countries were \"eating our lunch\" because of environmental regulations. \"\"We can't let all of these permits, that take forever to get, stop our jobs,\" he said, adding that he was studying whether to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. \"I don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries.\" Russian roulette Trump's stance on Russia, including his call for more cooperation with Putin, puts him at odds with many of the Republicans allied with him on other fronts. Some of the top appointments he has made or is considering are aligned with his views. Flynn sat next to Putin last year during a paid appearance in Moscow for Russia Today, a TV network financed by the Kremlin.\u00a0Tillerson, who has negotiated business deals with Putin for years, was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013. Trump\u00a0disputed the conclusion in an unpublished CIA report that Russia tried to intervene in the election to boost his prospects. \"I think it's ridiculous,\" he said. \"I don't believe it.\" Senate Armed Services chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) disagreed. \"It's clear the Russians interfered,\" he said on CBS' Face the Nation. He called for a select congressional committee to investigate Russia's efforts and expressed concern about Tillerson's ties to Moscow. \"It's\u00a0a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin, and obviously they've done enormous deals together,\" McCain said. \"That\u00a0would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, one of Trump's primary rivals who happens to be on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will consider his nomination for secretary of State, on Sunday signaled his concern in a Trump-like way \u2014 on Twitter. \"Being a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryofState,\" he posted. 4908 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 130 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hBnc4M ",

    "text": "Bears QB Matt Barkley eager for Alshon Jeffery's return Photos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Sunday marked the final day of Alshon Jeffery 's four-game suspension, a punishment that went into effect Nov. 14 after Jeffery was busted for violating the NFL 's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Jeffery is expected to be reinstated Monday and is expected to rejoin the team for meetings at Halas Hall. Quarterback Matt Barkley acknowledged after Sunday's 20-17 loss to the Lions at Ford Field that he's eager for Jeffery's return. \"The more guys, the better,\" Barkley said. \"Especially Alshon, who has been in the system for so long and is a dynamic playmaker. He can help in the ways that he can. Hopefully he doesn't miss a step and he goes right back into game speed and we'll be able to utilize him.\" On Sunday, with Jeffery suspended, Kevin White on injured reserve and Eddie Royal (toe) and Marquess Wilson (groin) inactive, the Bears again were operating with a depleted receiving corps. Together, that quartet of receivers has missed 27 games this season. On Sunday, Cameron Meredith led the Bears with six catches for 72 yards. Still, it's easy to be intrigued by how Barkley's play may elevate with the team's top receiver coming back for the final three games. Emergency exit: Cornerback Tracy Porter left the game for good with a little more than a minute left in the first half, immediately after committing an illegal-contact penalty. It was Porter's second flag on the series. The veteran cornerback motioned for a sub and urgently jogged to the locker room, bothered by an illness. Bears coach John Fox said he hadn't anticipated Porter's ailment being a game-ending issue. Bears on Sunday happened somewhere other than their game in Detroit and it might not turn out to be much more than a rumor.\u00a0 But hey, it has to be more worthwhile than waiting for the Bears to commit another penalty. And so, the story goes that legendary executive Bill Polian... The best news for the Bears on Sunday happened somewhere other than their game in Detroit and it might not turn out to be much more than a rumor.\u00a0 But hey, it has to be more worthwhile than waiting for the Bears to commit another penalty. And so, the story goes that legendary executive Bill Polian... (Steve Rosenbloom) \"That caught us a little bit off guard,\" Fox said. \"But it was very real. He was very sick quickly.\" Added Porter: \"I tried to make it to halftime, but I couldn't. Once I got the second penalty, I was like, 'I'm doing more damage than good. So let me go take care of myself.'\" Making a run for it: The first thing Matthew Stafford saw on his game-winning touchdown run? \"A lot of white jerseys,\" the Lions quarterback said. Still, Stafford found a way to elude all the Bears in pursuit. Stafford's 7-yard score with 3:17 left came as he escaped pressure in the pocket from Mitch Unrein and Pernell McPhee. As Stafford took off, Leonard Floyd was unable to catch him from behind. Near the goal line, Stafford juked enough to get past linebackers John Timu, Nick Kwiatkoski and safety Deon Bush. \"Once I decided to run, I was getting in,\" Stafford said. That touchdown capped a seven-play, 76-yard drive. Stafford suffered a finger injury early in Sunday's game with ESPN reporting he had a dislocation and torn ligaments in the middle finger of his throwing hand. But he fought through it and scored another win. Stafford and the Lions have recorded eight of their nine victories with go-ahead drives in the fourth quarter or overtime. Extra points: Anquan Boldin 's three receptions, including a 16-yard second quarter TD, gave him 1,064 catches for his career, moving him into 10th all time. ... The Bears have lost four consecutive games at Ford Field, their longest skid in Detroit since dropping six in a row at the Pontiac Silverdome between 1994 and 1999. ",

As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some of Trump's selections that they view as unacceptable and outside of the political mainstream. Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to publicly shame them \u2014 all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they need to kill a nominee or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick. Related: ExxonMobil CEO Expected as Secretary of State Pick Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in active duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate. But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs. Betsy DeVos Carolyn Kaster / AP There's Trump's reported secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing that agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots. There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hardliner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments. Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks pouring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird, both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.

    "text": "CBS News Dec 11, 2016 1:33 PM EST Kellyanne Conway on Sunday defended President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s response to the confirmation from intelligence officials that Russia worked to influence the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump, saying the stories are just an attempt to \u201crelitigate\u201d the results from Election Day. Mr. Trump \u201cthinks people are trying to relitigate the election,\u201d Conway told CBS\u2019 \u201c Face the Nation ,\u201d \u201c...First it was [FBI Director] Jim Comey\u2019s fault. Then we\u2019re going to have a recount. Then it\u2019s the alt-right\u2019s fault. Now it\u2019s Russian interference.\u201d Conway\u2019s comments follow reports in the Washington Post and other news outlets -- and confirmed by CBS News -- that intelligence officials believe Russia not only worked to cause chaos in the U.S. election, but was specifically working to promote Mr. Trump . She echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the story: in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d he said new revelations about Russia\u2019s influence on his behalf are \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2026 Every week it\u2019s another excuse. \u00a0We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\u201d Conway called for a \u201cpeaceful transition,\u201d and suggested those unhappy with the election result look at President Obama\u2019s actions as a guide. \u201cI want to tell everybody, take the cues and the clues from President Obama himself who has not just congratulated Donald Trump as the new president but conceded to him,\u201d she said. (Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, not Mr. Obama, formally conceded the election to Mr. Trump.) Conway added that Mr. Obama and his administration are \u201cthere to support this peaceful transition into democracy and I just believe unfounded accusations like this really undercut that.\u201d Conway said Mr. Trump would allow a\u00a0 congressional investigation \u00a0into the matter to proceed, reassuring that he \u201cwould not interfere in the legislative branch in that way\u201d -- but also said Mr. Trump has \u201cmade very clear\u201d his views on the subject of Russian interference. Conway also worked to square Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the Russia issue with his overall feelings toward the intelligence community: in the wake of the stories this weekend, the Trump transition team released a statement blasting the intelligence community as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d \u201cHe absolutely respects the intelligence community. He\u2019s made clear he\u2019s going to put his own people in there as well,\u201d Conway said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s said is laughable and ridiculous is this entire notion \u2026 that somehow this was meant to defeat Hillary Clinton and elevate him to the presidency. Its untrue and it\u2019s also unfair.\u201d She also defended his decision to receive the president\u2019s highly classified intelligence briefings just once a week , as opposed to daily as his recent predecessors have done, and noted she and other top-level advisers are not included in those briefings. \u201cHe appreciates these briefings but let me make very clear that even me as a close adviser and many others with whom you\u2019ll be speaking about do not have access to those top secret briefings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that type of clearance nor should we. So \u2026 he is not divulging the information he has, nor should he.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

By Chris Cillizza December 11 at 1:14 PM Follow @thefix The election of Donald Trump was a through-the-looking-glass moment in American politics. As in, everything that we \u2014 the collective political horde \u2014 thought was conclusive about how you win an election (outspend your opponent, build a better organization, lead in polling, run more TV ads) was disproved in one fell swoop on Nov. 8. Trump did everything wrong \u2014 by these traditional standards \u2014 and he won. And it wasn\u2019t the first time. The traditional rules of the road would have meant that Trump never rose beyond the 1 percent of the vote with which he started the Republican primary-season fight. The idea that a candidate could bully and insult his way to the Republican nomination over 16 (largely) serious candidates was simply unthinkable. The\u00a0\u201crules\u201d said it couldn\u2019t happen. Trump, to his immense credit, understood that a) flouting the rules actually endeared him to a big swath of voters and b) there just might not be any real rules at all. That insight allowed him to play a totally different game in both the primaries and the general election. While the political establishment was tut-tutting over Trump\u2019s fight with a Gold Star family or his comments about the weight of a former Miss Universe, the real\u00a0estate mogul was in the process of remaking how political campaigns are won.\u00a0Through a combination of a massive social-media presence, his celebrity and the belief \u2014 disproved by facts, but no matter! \u2014 that he was a straight shooter, Trump took every rule of the game and not just broke it but smashed it. The Fix's Callum Borchers explains the history of the \u201cprotective pool\u201d of reporters that traditionally follows the president, and recounts a few times when a protective pool ended up being critical. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) All of which meant that on Nov. 9, the political establishment was left to look at the shards of conventional wisdom scattered everywhere to try to find meaning. How did we do it? In most cases, by falling back on the very same assumptions and analytical points that led us to miss\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump, president\u201d so, so badly. \u00a0 [10 Post reporters look back on chronicling an unconventional campaign] How could Trump chat with the Taiwanese president, breaking decades of protocol and potentially endangering our fragile detente with China? How could he pick \u2014 or be on the verge of picking \u2014 the chief executive of ExxonMobil as secretary of state? Or Ben Carson, a doctor, to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development? Or, more parochially for reporters but no less hidebound by tradition, not agree to have a protective press pool follow him wherever he goes? Or a hundred other smaller breaks with\u00a0\u201cthe way things are done\u201d that Trump has engineered over the past month or so? The simple truth is that Trump\u2019s transition process has been a logical continuation of the campaign he ran: a total disregard for the established methods and the rules governing those methods. If you back Trump, you are undoubtedly thrilled with these moves, believing that he promised radical change in a broken Washington and is delivering on it. If you oppose Trump, you see his flouting of the established order as not only risky, but also deeply dangerous. I take no side in that fight. But I do think that it\u2019s absolutely necessary to avoid using the old measures of success or failure to assess Trump. He has proved, repeatedly, that those metrics simply do not apply to him. To continue to analyze him and his moves as we would, say, President Jeb Bush or President Hillary Clinton, is to ignore the fact that any traditional analysis of the campaign Trump ran would never have put him anywhere near the White House. [\u2018I will give you everything.\u2019 Here are 282 of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises.] Two major questions remain: 1. Is Trump\u2019s ability to innovate in the political campaign space \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what he has done, whether you like it or not \u2014 something that can carry over to his time in the White House? Do voters want something different in a president than they want in a presidential candidate? If so, Trump\u2019s unwillingness to change could badly damage his presidency. 2. Is Trump an exception in politics or the new rule? Is it his unique combination of celebrity, social media and brashness coupled with these deeply anti-political times a one-off? Or does he represent a new normal in politics? Will the 2020 campaign be filled with Trump takeoffs \u2014 Mark Cuban, Howard Schultz, Kanye West(?) \u2014 or will it be the usual assortment of governors, senators and House members? I don\u2019t know.\u00a0What I do know is that Trump is like nothing else we\u2019ve ever seen in modern American politics. We all need to adjust accordingly. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Stoking the fears of a Trump presidency, liberal activist groups have launched campaigns online and around the nation to help people cope \u2013 and even survive \u2013 their version of democratic doomsday. Some are based on Trump\u2019s mixed signals about illegal immigration, while others seem aimed at a more generalized sense of unease. One effort that launched this week, called \u201cWhatDoIDoAboutTrump.com,\u201d is depicted by its organizers as a non-partisan \u201cwebsite [that] turns Trump angst into action \u2013 online and off.\u201d \u201cNot sure how to protect yourself if some of Trump\u2019s campaign promises become reality?\u201d the San Francisco-based site asks. It provides links to websites of organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which advise people about what steps to take or what they may face if Donald Trump follows through on some of his promises. One link leads to \u201cWelcome to the OH CRAP! WHAT NOW? SURVIVAL GUIDE,\u201d which describes itself as \u201ca crowdsourced collection of health, legal, and safety plans and resources + social, digital and economic security related resources urgent now as an outcome of the recent US election.\u201d Related Image Expand / Contract Hundreds of Rutgers University students march last month to protest some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies. (The Associated Press) Experts say scaring consituencies about politics is standard operating procedure for activist groups, but what's different this time are the intensity, and the fact that it has started well before Jan. 20, 2017, when Trump will be sworn in. Corinna Kester, one of the founders, says the group, which includes a former national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, is not pushing an agenda. \u201cIf people are upset about the election, we encourage them to figure out how to get involved and work with that, from donating to petitions to protests.\u201d We can say, in one sense, it is intensifying divisions in America. - Fred Siegel, senior fellow, Manhattan Institute Organizations and, in many cases, lawyers, are urging people and groups they deem at-risk under a Trump presidency to take action now to protect themselves. School administrators are assuring students concerned about immigration raids that they won\u2019t be spirited away, some city officials are vowing to provide a sort-of buffer to any federal attempts to strip benefits or programs. On Monday, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that it was setting up a hotline and \"support sites\" in response to the deep anxiety among students about Trump as president. The Rev. Al Sharpton is organizing a rally of black activists and lawmakers in Washington D.C. days before Trump\u2019s inauguration in mid-January to, as he told The Hill, \u201cput the Democrats on notice to use the confirmation hearings to really go after\u201d Trump\u2019s nominees. One of the most high-profile efforts aimed at creating preemptive buffers against Trump policies are so-called sanctuaries for immigrants who are here illegally. Students at various colleges are pushing their campuses to be designated sanctuaries. Some cities are moving toward declaring themselves safe zones for such immigrants, saying they will not report them to immigration authorities if they come across them during the course of providing a service. On Tuesday, the Santa Ana City Council voted to designate the municipality a sanctuary, a non-binding action that they may make enforceable through an ordinance, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Times noted that \u201cthe move is in direct defiance of President-elect Donald Trump, who was critical of illegal immigration and sanctuary cities during his campaign.\u201d \u201cThe day after Donald Trump got elected, our kids were falling apart emotionally,\u201d the Times quoted Councilmember Sal Tinajero, who is a high school teacher, as saying. \u201cThey thought their parents would be deported.\u201d \u201cThe reason you\u2019re seeing this push now is that us leaders ... want to tell them they are going to be protected. If they are going to come for them, they have to come through us first.\u201d Trump has denounced such efforts as divisive and the people who have protested his election as \u201ccrybabies.\u201d His supporters, as well as some who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton or third party candidates, say it behooves everyone to accept the results of the election and work to be united. \u201cThis sounds like a large group therapy session,\u201d said Fred Siegel, a historian who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and professor at Saint Francis College. \u201cThere\u2019s a way in which this is all good and right in democratic terms.\u201d Siegel said the trend to organize in advance of Trump assuming the presidency is intriguing, and more in line with the kind of actions taken against policies and governments that are seen in Europe, particularly France. \u201cWe can say, in one sense, it is intensifying divisions in American society,\u201d Siegel said to FoxNews.com, \u201cWhat that represents is President Obama\u2019s success in Europeanizing American politics.\u201d \u201cIn France, the argument has always been when something occurs in Parliament that is unacceptable to you, you take to the streets. These [actions] are occurring in advance of \u2013 not in response to \u2013 policy being initiated.\u201d Louis DeSipio, a political science professor at the University of California-Irvine, said that the patchwork efforts to organize against Trump and his expected policies reflect an already-divided nation. \u201cPresident-elect Trump set out broad principles, and wasn\u2019t specific about some policies,\u201d DeSipio said. \u201cThere will always be people who are unhappy about an election. In any election, you can see a complete reversal of fortunes. The challenge for any president in this situation is to build bridges to some of his former opponents.\u201d President George W. Bush did so in response to concerns \u2013 among those who did not support his election \u2013 over how he would handle education and Medicare prescription costs, DeSipio said. \u201cHe worked with Democrats, with Sen. Ted Kennedy, on both of those issues,\u201d he said. DeSipio expressed misgivings about efforts underpinned by a refusal to accept Trump as president, a movement that has a hashtag -- #notmypresident. \u201cPhilosophically, I don\u2019t accept it,\u201d DeSipio said. \u201cHe was accepted by rules in place before the election.\u201d The approach of some groups to try to influence policy and laws at the local level can be both healthier and more practical in many cases, he added. \u201cWe may get some criticism from Trump supporters,\u201d said Kester. \u201cBut we\u2019re all getting involved in a democracy.\u201d Elizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

    "text": "Trump faces first significant post-election pushback from Republicans over CIA report on Russia Donald Trump Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas in 2015. Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas in 2015. (John Locher / Associated Press) Sarah D. Wire Contact Reporter As President-elect Donald Trump \u00a0dismissed\u00a0intelligence\u00a0reports about Russian interference in the presidential\u00a0election as \u201cridiculous,\" calls for a government investigation  from lawmakers, including some in his own party, grew louder Sunday. It marked the first\u00a0significant post-election pushback Trump has encountered\u00a0from a Republican Party that only belatedly and reluctantly embraced the unconventional nominee, whose\u00a0views often clash with traditional GOP ideology. In a rare joint statement Sunday, four high-profile Republican and Democratic senators called for a government investigation\u00a0into the matter and\u00a0urged colleagues not to allow the issue\u00a0to become partisan. \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d read a\u00a0statement from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), committee member Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.); incoming Senate Minority Leader leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.). \u201c Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.\u201d The statement came in the aftermath of a Washington Post report late Friday that a secret CIA analysis found that the Russian government\u2019s hacking of Democratic Party emails this year was a deliberate effort to damage Democratic nominee\u00a0 Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances. The Trump transition team responded by mockingly comparing the CIA assessment to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgment\u00a0on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump called the assessment \u201cridiculous,\u201d and suggested it was an excuse Democrats put forward to rationalize\u00a0their loss. \"I don\u2019t believe it,\u2019\u2019\u00a0Trump told host Chris Wallace. \u201cI think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country .\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Trump also defended his decision to skip some of his daily intelligence briefings, saying he gets them \u201cwhen I need it\u201d and complaining\u00a0they are repetitive. \u201cI'm, like, a smart person. I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\u201d Trump said. The Trump\u00a0transition team\u2019s resistance to\u00a0calls for an investigation into Russia's actions and refusal to accept\u00a0the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies appears rooted in a fear that it may undercut the legitimacy of his victory. \u201cThe Russians didn\u2019t tell Hillary Clinton to ignore Wisconsin and Michigan, OK?\u201d said\u00a0Reince\u00a0Priebus, who is to become Trump's chief of staff, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\u00a0\u201cShe lost the election because her ideas were bad.\u201d Trump tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of the\u00a0CIA analysis\u00a0on \u201cFox New Sunday.\u201d \u201cThey have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place,\u201d Trump said. But in October, the\u00a0U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security said publicly that\u00a0they were \u201cconfident that the Russian government\u201d was behind the\u00a0hacking of U.S. political groups and individuals in an attempt \u201cto interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d \u00a0At the time, they did not say whether the efforts were aimed at helping one candidate or the other. During the final weeks of the campaign, thousands\u00a0of embarrassing emails, many stolen from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta , were released by WikiLeaks on nearly a daily basis. On Friday, the White House said President Obama had\u00a0ordered the CIA and other intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of foreign-based digital attacks aimed at influencing the election.\u00a0Obama ordered the review completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Since the election, Republicans have worked hard to move beyond the divisions caused by Trump\u2019s candidacy and unite behind the new head of their party. Several high-profile GOP leaders continued to voice support for Trump over the weekend. The No. 2 Senate Republican, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) downplayed the news on Twitter, saying \"All this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news.\u201d House Speaker Paul D.\u00a0Ryan (R-Wis.) stopped short of calling for a congressional investigation Sunday in a statement to Politico. \"Speaker Ryan has said for months that foreign intervention in our elections is unacceptable,\u201d spokeswoman\u00a0AshLee Strong\u00a0said. \u201cThe speaker cannot comment on or characterize the content of classified briefings but he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters.\" But Trump\u2019s attempt\u00a0to undercut public trust in the\u00a0the CIA assessment, his willingness to break with the\u00a0intelligence community\u00a0and his conciliatory approach toward\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared\u00a0to be too\u00a0much for some Republicans. McCain told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Trump should acknowledge Russia may have influenced the election. ",

One of the planes is seen here at the domestic Mehrabad airport in Tehran in 2013. Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images Iran Air has finalized its historic purchase of 80 U.S.-made passenger jets, signing a deal with Boeing that's the first of its kind since the overthrow of Iran's shah in the 1970s. U.S. officials approved the deal in September , months after Iran emerged from sanctions. The sale of 50 737 planes and 30 wide-body 777 airliners will support nearly 100,000 jobs, Boeing says . The first planes are slated for delivery in 2018, with more jets following over the next 10 years, Iranian officials say. As NPR's Jackie Northam has reported : \"Iran and Boeing go a long way back. Boeing was the largest supplier of civilian aircraft to Iran before the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran has kept flying those same planes for decades and its fleet of aging, worn-out commercial aircraft is in desperate need of replacement.\" Iran is rushing to update its aging commercial airline fleet \u2014 according to The Tehran Times , the country's state-owned airline has also placed orders for 100 Airbus planes and 20 smaller craft made by France-based ATR. The Times also notes that the deal is being finalized \"weeks before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has criticized the nuclear accord with Iran.\" Article continues after sponsorship According to Iran's FARS news agency , both Boeing and Airbus have also agreed to give Iran's aviation industry the rights to manufacture spare parts and carry out maintenance and repair on their planes.

Puskar / AP Former Coltsp resident and general manager \u00a0Bill Polian delivers his speech during an induction ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Canton, Ohio. Former Coltsp resident and general manager \u00a0Bill Polian delivers his speech during an induction ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Canton, Ohio. (Tom E. Puskar / AP) The best news for the Bears on Sunday happened somewhere other than their game in Detroit and it might not turn out to be much more than a rumor.\u00a0 But hey, it has to be more worthwhile than waiting for the Bears to commit another penalty. And so, the story goes that legendary executive Bill Polian would consider returning to an NFL front office under the right circumstances, according to a CBSSports.com report , and the Bears are expected to get into the bidding.\u00a0 Yes, Polian has been out of the day-to-day business of winning football games for a while, but then, so have the Bears. When Polian was active, he put together Buffalo\u2019s four straight Super Bowl teams in the early 1990s and then the Colts \u2019 Super Bowl champion that beat the Bears in 2006.\u00a0 In between, Polian put together the Carolina expansion team that nearly went to the Super Bowl in its second year of existence. Even at 74 and five years removed as Colts GM, Polian still brings more gravitas and institutional knowledge of the league than any random McCaskey or Ted Phillips. The Bears had a chance to hire Polian years ago, but it never happened. Perhaps it was a random McCaskey\u2019s unwillingness to cede power. Perhaps it was cash. That\u2019s always a favorite. Perhaps it was something else equally lame. But whatever the reasons, those reasons have to go away. Polian would be the football boss with the right to fire anyone. None of this cockamamie stuff about being forced to keep a coach or being forced to keep a GM. I couldn\u2019t imagine Polian taking the job any other way.\u00a0 And another thing: This wouldn\u2019t some kid GM. Let\u2019s see John Fox try to co-opt Polian\u2019s power. Yeah, I know, it\u2019s just a rumor, but hey, Bears rumors are far more interesting than Bears football. Photos from the Bears-Lions game in Detroit on Dec. 11, 2016, at Ford Field. So, basically, Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc\u2019s\u00a0pick-six only gave Matthew Stafford the chance to direct yet another game-winning drive in the fourth quarter. Matt Barkley \u2019s TD pass\u00a0to Cam Meredith down the right sideline was brilliant. In stride. Led the receiver to the end zone. Gave him a chance to beat the best cornerback on the opponent. Why can\u2019t Barkley do that before halftime? On their opening drive,\u00a0the Bears drove to the Lions 10, then Ted Larsen false-started, and before the next snap, the Bears were flagged for delay of game. Bearsness is mobile.\u00a0 The game ended\u00a0with Leno Jr. and Larsen costing the Bears 70 yards with holding penalties on huge completions that twice would\u2019ve left the Bears inside the Lions 20 in the last 90 seconds of a three-point game. Bearsness is not just mobile, it\u2019s indefatigable. But hey, at least\u00a0the Bears get a red zone participation ribbon. If you hadn\u2019t seen\u00a0CBS\u2019 graphic, would you have guessed that Lions offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter went to Tennessee? How bad is the NFC North if the Lions offense is the best part of the division leader and that unit is penalty-prone? Speaking of penalty-prone,\u00a0it will be easier to list the Bears cornerbacks who didn\u2019t commit pass interference. I can\u2019t figure out\u00a0if Bryce Callahan is making a lot of plays because he\u2019s good and getting better or that it just looks that way because he\u2019s in a fallow Bears secondary. Oops, no, wait,\u00a0Callahan PI. Never mind. The Bears were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs Sunday. Of course, they were realistically eliminated in September. ",

Elgin Clark, left, and Edgar Palma, from Sunrun home solar company, install a solar panel on a home in Van Nuys. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Ralph Vartabedian Contact Reporter Californians are\u00a0likely to pay more for gasoline, electricity, food and new homes \u2014 and to feel their lives jolted in myriad other ways \u2014 because their state broadly expanded its war on climate change this summer. The ambitious new goals\u00a0will require complex regulations on an unprecedented scale,\u00a0but were approved in Sacramento without a study of possible economic repercussions. Some of the nation\u2019s top energy, housing and business experts say the effort may not only raise\u00a0the cost of staples, but also slow the pace of job and income growth for millions of California families. California is doing something no other state has done. \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown And now that Donald Trump, who has dismissed climate change, is headed for the White House, Californians may find themselves making sacrifices while the residents of other states are missing in action. Two key laws this summer kicked California\u2019s climate change fight into high gear. \u00a0 Senate Bill 32 requires the state to cut greenhouse gases 40% below their level of 1990 \u2014 based on evidence that a global reduction at that level\u00a0would limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above the temperature levels of a few decades ago. Senate Bill 1383 requires similar reductions in methane, refrigeration gases and black carbon. Before signing SB 32 , Gov. Jerry Brown said he didn\u2019t expect problems. \u201cCalifornia is doing something no other state has done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bringing into law real measures backed up by the real power of the state of California. It will take some balance that we don\u2019t overdo it, but I am not afraid we are going to get to that point.\u201d It is dubious as to whether the California goal will be achieved without large economic costs. \u2014 James Sweeney, director of Stanford University\u2019s Precourt Energy Efficiency Center But nobody really knows what\u2019s in store for the state. The Legislature\u00a0relied\u00a0on years of\u00a0sophisticated computer modeling to understand how staying the course on the use of fossil fuels\u00a0will disrupt Earth\u2019s climate. No one, however,\u00a0can point to detailed economic study of\u00a0how the new goals will affect the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy.\u00a0 A preliminary analysis just released by the California Air Resources Board, which has sole authority to impose the new rules,\u00a0projects a potential reduction of 25,000 to 102,000 jobs and the loss of $7 billion to $14 billion in gross state economic output. The board said those impacts are\u00a0small relative to the state\u2019s economy. Other experts, however, note that too little is known to make solid predictions, while industry groups project severe consequences. \u00a0 Although California\u00a0set a goal of reducing\u00a0greenhouse gases by 40% below 1990 levels, for example, the state did not collect greenhouse gas data before 1990. So no one can say how far back in its history as a state with cars and industry California will have to go to hit that emission level.\u00a0 That benchmark\u00a0could, however, require the state to emit no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases than it did as far back as the 1960s, based on national data that do not take into account California\u2019s faster growth and more energy-efficient economy. Individual industry sectors always overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits and assume that you will implement it in the dumbest possible way. \u2014 Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board \u201cIt is dubious as to whether the California goal will be achieved without large economic costs,\u201d said James Sweeney, director of Stanford University\u2019s Precourt Energy Efficiency Center.\u00a0 He added\u00a0that the enhanced climate change fight will likely lead to a less diversified and more fragile state economy. \u201cMeeting the requirement will require severe restrictions, far beyond those seen to date.\u201d Exactly what restrictions are not clear, because the rules have yet to be adopted. But Sweeney\u2019s analysis shows that the reduction in greenhouse gases will need to be eight times faster than the state has accomplished under the first climate change effort that started in 2006 \u2014\u00a0and the rate of reduction is twice as fast as what U.S. agreed to under the Paris climate agreement.\u00a0 California is already digging deep into state resources for the climate battle. It spends about $2 billion on energy efficiency and renewable-energy programs, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. And its regulatory trading systems redistribute several billion dollars a year. In total, the state allocates more on the climate battle than on state support for the University of California system. Mary Nichols, the longtime chairwoman of the air board, acknowledges that the scale and breadth of the ramped-up\u00a0regulatory effort to curtail greenhouse gases surpasses past programs. Risky is what's happening to the climate. \u2014 Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate change activist group 350.org \u201cIt is the biggest thing we have done yet in sheer volume,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires a level of coordination between different agencies that we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d Nichols added\u00a0that every past era of environmental regulation prompted similar concerns of economic Armageddon, which proved to be unfounded. \u201cIndividual industry sectors always overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits and assume that you will implement it in the dumbest possible way,\u201d she said. It actually doesn\u2019t much\u00a0matter to the climate\u00a0whether California hits its goal of\u00a0cutting emissions by 40%,\u00a0because the state accounts for only 1% of worldwide emissions, said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley business professor and expert on renewable energy. \u00a0\u201cMore important is the technology and practices that can be exported to the rest of the world.\u201d Environmentalists\u00a0are quick to point out that if Earth\u2019s weather patterns continue\u00a0to go\u00a0haywire, it won\u2019t just be California\u2019s economy that comes unglued. \u00a0 \u201cRisky is what's happening to the climate,\u201d said environmentalist and author Bill McKibben. \u201cEverything else is just a challenge, which once upon a time Americans were good at stepping up to.\u201d\u00a0 A Nissan Leaf is plugged into an electric-vehicle charging station at the Malibu Country Mart. Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times A Nissan Leaf is plugged into an electric-vehicle charging station at the Malibu Country Mart. A Nissan Leaf is plugged into an electric-vehicle charging station at the Malibu Country Mart. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Critics, however, say that consigning Californians\u2019 economic well-being to untested regulatory systems is reckless, and the hit on wallets has already begun. Gasoline prices, for example,\u00a0are headed up under several very complex regulatory systems,\u00a0including the state\u2019s low-carbon fuel standard and the cap-and-trade auction market. And electricity prices will likely go up. At least half\u00a0of California\u2019s electricity must come from renewable sources by 2030, and though solar panel costs have dropped sharply and are subsidized by a 30% federal tax credit, existing long-term contracts already signed by utilities will likely continue to drive up the price of electricity, Borenstein said.\u00a0 The state\u2019s shift to natural gas for 60% of its in-state electricity generation could also lead\u00a0to higher electricity prices. Gas prices have spiked 115% since March, though the impact has not yet filtered down to consumers. Not once did anybody ask how we could do this. \u2014 Roger Isom, president of the California Cotton Growers and Ginners Assn. When gasoline or electricity prices go up, people tend to use less. Manufacturers, however, may leave the state. \u201cOver the long term, manufacturers will be choosing to put their money elsewhere,\u201d said Dorothy Rothrock, president of the California Manufacturing and Technology Assn. In 2000, California accounted for 5.6% of U.S. manufacturing investment. Today, it accounts for 1.8%, she said. A study by NERA, an economics research firm working for the manufacturers association, asserted that the climate goal could cost California households an average of $3,000 annually. The California Energy Commission and the Public Utilities Commission have their own extensive regulatory programs to reduce energy consumption, and the climate change legislation\u00a0will give them more legal backbone. We are at the point where we have to ask does agriculture fit into California\u2019s future. \u2014 Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno Farm Bureau The Energy Commission, for example, has a goal that by 2020 all new homes will have to meet a net zero energy mandate, meaning solar roofs will have to supply all the home\u2019s power while large amounts of insulation lower energy demand. Other rules apply later to government and commercial buildings. \u201cIt means buildings will be part of the solution,\u201d said energy commissioner David Hochschild. But Dave Cogdill, president of the California Building Industry Assn., said the goal\u00a0will add $45,000 to the average cost of a 2,500-square-foot home in California. The higher cost is likely to lead to fewer new homes, exacerbating the state\u2019s housing and employment\u00a0problems. And a slowdown in construction could\u00a0potentially reducing gross state product by $7.5 billion and employment by 75,000 jobs, said Brad Williams, an economist at Capitol Matrix Consulting who studied the legislation for the building association. An analysis by Jeff Greenblatt, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory expert on energy efficiency,\u00a0projects that significant improvements\u00a0of existing buildings will be necessary, but on a scale 30 times faster than the current rate of improvement. \u201cIt would be a huge lift. You could incentivize it, but I don\u2019t know how you would pay for it,\u201d he said. The effects of the new rules on California agribusiness could be even more significant.\u00a0 Martine Ledesma operates a \"crustbuster\" that compresses cotton into giant modules for handling at the Stone Land Company in Stratford, Calif.

Martine Ledesma operates a \"crustbuster\" that compresses cotton into giant modules for handling at the Stone Land Company in Stratford, Calif. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) \u201cWe are not saying we shouldn\u2019t do anything for the climate,\u201d said Roger Isom, president of the California Cotton Growers and Ginners Assn. \u201cBut it would be great if somebody was on the playing field with us. Not once did anybody ask how we could do this.\u201d Isom said the cotton industry is already in free fall.\u00a0 Dairies are also bracing for a difficult future, said Anja Raudabaugh, executive director of the Western Dairymen\u2019s Assn. Just this year, 53 dairies have gone bankrupt, left the state or simply closed their doors, a trend likely to accelerate, she said. \u201cThere is no way we can manage the reductions they want,\u201d she said. Dairy herds produce roughly 10 million metric tons of the greenhouse gas methane each year, a consequence of cow flatulence, burping and manure. Under SB 1383, that has to change. At a heated meeting in June, dairy officials pleaded with the Air Resources Board that they already reduced methane emissions.\u00a0Air board scientist Ryan McCarthy suggested that new technology could help, and the discussion turned to an experimental system from Argentina that would capture gas in a backpack on each cow through a hose inserted into their digestive system. \u201cAll of our jaws hit the floor,\u201d\u00a0recalled Raudabaugh. \u201cIt is an outlandish scheme.\u201d Dairy worker Guillermo Sanchez tends to milking cows at Tom Barcellos' dairy farm in Porterville, Calif.

(Tomas Ovalle / For The Times) Many other agriculture sectors will be facing new challenges that will drive up costs, according to Daniel A. Sumner, a UC Davis professor and director of the\u00a0University of California Agricultural Issues Center.\u00a0\u201cAgriculture will be smaller along with the rest of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at the point where we have to ask does agriculture fit into California\u2019s future,\u201d said Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno Farm Bureau. \u201cWe can\u2019t take anything that happened this year and say this Legislature and this governor want the agriculture industry here.\u201d\u00a0 And as the economy changes, so will\u00a0people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 State law, for example,\u00a0requires development of denser urban communities, where residents will drive less. \u201cPeople need to stop driving around and stop buying throw-away merchandise,\u201d said Greenblatt, the Lawrence Berkeley scientist. That goal may\u00a0prove tough, given that Californians drove more than ever this summer, up 6% from last year. A 20% reduction in travel miles, currently about 190 billion annually, could be needed by 2030 to meet the state\u2019s climate goals,\u00a0according to estimates by the Air Resources Board. The agency says the public can walk, bike, ride share and use transit. \u201cIt is not draconian,\u201d McCarthy said.\u00a0 Many, in fact, say that the changes California\u2019s climate goals will spur are long overdue and will make Californians\u2019 lives better. Californians, said Nichols of the Air Resources Board, could have had cleaner air, more walkable, bikeable cities, and a head start on a vibrant green economy years ago. What impeded that, she said, is that \u201cthe entrenched power of the status quo wouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d ::: Regulations the air board is considering\u00a0 The Air Resources Board is in the early stages of formulating new regulations and reinforcing existing ones to achieve massively reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The agency released a draft of its ideas in early December, representing \u00a0the largest and most comprehensive regulatory effort in state history. Here are some of the possible approaches: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions at refineries by 20%. Electrify boilers. Increase renewable electricity by more than the existing 50% statewide requirement. Cut greenhouse gas emissions at oil and gas fields by at least 25%. Work with ports to develop \u201csuper-low emission efficient ships.\u201d Increase use of low-emission diesel fuels. Reduce the amount of driving across the state. Use fertilizers with lower nitrogen content. Cut organic waste going into landfills by 75%. Increase landfill fees. Improve freight transportation efficiency by 25% by 2030. Deploy more than 100,000 zero-emission freight vehicles by 2030. Have 4.3 million zero-emission vehicles operating by 2030. Develop zero-emission rail vehicles. Alter environmental rules to increase density in residential neighborhoods. Accelerate replacement of residential gas furnaces. Increase the large-scale storage of electricity. Develop new pipeline systems to transport renewable natural gas from farms and landfills to urban users. Modify the cap-and-trade auction system so that it covers the entire energy sector. Implement rules to require state pension funds to sell holdings in coal producing companies. Modify streets for more bicycle and foot travel.

Time President-elect Donald Trump, center, speaks with members of the military in a box in the stands during the Army-Navy college football game at M&T; Bank Stadium, Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016, in Baltimore. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) Donald Trump says\u00a0it's \"ridiculous\" to believe Moscow helped him win the presidency and he rejects\u00a0intelligence findings that Russia intervened in the U.S. election. \"I think it's just another excuse,\" Trump said in an interview aired on\u00a0Fox News Sunday. \"I don't believe it ... Every week it's another excuse.\" During the interview, Trump also appeared to reject the idea of setting up a blind trust to manage his assets during his presidency, saying that his \"executives\" and his children would run his companies in his absence. Democrats and some Republicans have called for hearings and investigations into the CIA's conclusion that Russia authorized hacking and other tactics in order to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., issued a joint statement Sunday with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling for a bipartisan effort to explore the allegations and defend the nation against cyber attacks. The two were joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Sen, Jack Reed, D-R.I., the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"For years, foreign adversaries have directed cyberattacks at America's physical, economic, and military infrastructure, while stealing our intellectual property,\" their statement said. \"Now our democratic institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American.\" In his Fox interview, Trump said Democrats are pushing the idea of Russian involvement in an effort to explain their surprise election loss. He also said there's no way to know if Russia was behind the hacking of e-mail accounts belonging to Democratic and Clinton campaign officials. \"Once they hack if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them,\" Trump said. \"They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place.\" Russia is believed to be a topic of presidential intelligence briefings, though Trump does not receive them every day.\u00a0He told Fox News Sunday that he receives the briefing \"when I need it,\" because it tends to the same information day-to-day. \"I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\" Trump said, noting that Vice President-elect Mike Pence is receiving frequent briefings. Trump told Fox that \"very good people\" do the briefings, and he has told them: \"'If\u00a0something should change from this point, immediately call me.\u00a0 I'm available on one-minute's notice.'\" In other parts of the interview, Trump said: \u2022 Executives and his children will run his various companies. The New York City businessman said liquidating his assets and placing the proceeds in a blind trust would be impractical and time-consuming because so much his business involves real estate. \"You know, when you sell real estate that's not like going out and selling a stock,\" Trump said. \"That \u00a0takes a long time.\" Said Trump: \"My executives will run it with my children. \u00a0It's a big company, it's a great company. \u00a0But I'm going to have nothing to do with management.\" Trump dismissed suggestions that foreign governments and others would try to buy influence by buying into Trump products, such as staying at his new hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. His focus is on being president, Trump said, and he has rejected business deals in the wake of his political campaign. \"I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest,\" Trump said. \u2022 He is \"open-minded\" about human impact on climate change, and what can be done about it. \"Look, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows,\" Trump said. \"It's not something that's so hard and fast.\" While he is \"studying\" the Paris climate change agreement with other countries, Trump indicated he would re-start the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines after he takes office Jan. 20. The Obama administration blocked both pipelines. \u2022\u00a0He is \"getting very close\" to naming a secretary of state. Aides have identified ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as a leading candidate for the State Department post. Asked about Tillerson, Trump said that he's \"much more than a business executive,\" and knows government officials around the world. \"He knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\" Trump said. \"He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company \u2014 not for himself \u2014 for the company.\" Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to say he has not made a final decision: \"Whether I choose him or not for 'State'- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!\" \u2022 Said the president of Taiwan called him to congratulate him, and that it would have been \"disrespectful\" to have turned down the offer. Given China's objections to the call, Trump suggested he is not necessarily bound by the decades-old\u00a0\"one China\" policy in which the U.S. recognizes only the government of mainland China. \"I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\" Trump said. 14124 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 568 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hA7YNo ",

    "text": "Source: IHS Conflict Monitor (control areas from Dec. 5-Dec. 8) DEC. 10, 2016 By The New York Times Later, Umm Faisal said, she, her husband and two children took a taxi to the rebel-held town of Marea, near the Turkish border. Along the twisting route, they bribed guards at checkpoints and talked their way out of detention by Kurdish militias. Before she left the refugee center, Umm Faisal refused to appear on state television, she said, because \u201cI couldn\u2019t lie on TV.\u201d Others, though, have been filmed thanking Mr. Assad, receiving aid bags marked \u201cHelp from Russia\u201d and saying rebels had earlier prevented them from leaving. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One aid worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said it was unclear how freely civilians in government territory were speaking. But the worker said one man had told her in compelling detail that the rebels refused to let him leave for medical treatment for his young daughter, who was rail thin from a stomach ailment. Separately, a nurse in eastern Aleppo, who spoke on the condition that she not be named, told us that rebels had stopped her parents and others from leaving the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. First, the fighters warned their group that government troops would shoot them, the nurse said. Then they threatened the travelers, asking why they wanted to \u201cgo to those who are bombing you.\u201d \u201cWe are dead either way,\u201d one civilian had replied, the nurse said. Aid workers say the reclaimed areas of east Aleppo are largely destroyed and empty: Very few people stayed as troops moved in. The army took several hundred people back to one district, Hanano, telling them to move into abandoned apartments. But with no electricity, heat or water and many homes looted, some have asked to return to shelters despite the cold, uncomfortable conditions there as aid agencies scramble to catch up. Those who have decided to stay inside eastern Aleppo face continued airstrikes and shelling as people crowd into shrinking areas without medical care. Modar Shekho, a nurse, and his family ran from their house under fire, several of his friends said. As they searched for shelter, a shell killed his brother. As they looked for a place to bury him, the friends said, another explosion killed his father, a teacher who had helped arrange for students to take their state exams despite the siege. It was the second time that Mr. Shekho had lost two members of his family in a single day, according to friends; a brother and sister, a doctor and nurse, died in a hospital bombing in 2013. Given such suffering, rebel groups are arguing. A hard-line minority, including the Qaeda-linked Levant Conquest Front, wants to continue the fight, and the rest, including United States-backed groups, want to make a deal to get civilians out. Some question whether they have already waited too long. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Zohair al-Shimali, a longtime activist, said he and others who had led street protests and later supported rebels had failed to deliver. \u201cPeople started to hate their lives because of us,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is for nothing, we lost everything.\u201d He said that while some rebels were counseling \u201cpatience,\u201d he was ready for any deal, either for rebels to leave in exchange for ending the bombing or to bus civilians out. \u201cPeople have the right to take their children wherever they want, we can\u2019t take them as hostages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t meet the promises we made them.\u201d Infighting and mistrust among rebels have hastened their collapse. During the week, Qaeda-linked fighters attacked United States-backed groups and took their supplies. Dr. Farida, a gynecologist who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, checked off the people around her who planned to leave. \u201cMy only neighbor, my only aunt and uncle, my secretary, my maid, and even my right hand at work are going to the regime areas,\u201d she wrote in a text message. \u201cThey are neutral and just want to live and eat and drink, they don\u2019t care about the revolution and religion. \u201cI feel like I lost a piece of me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Maher Samaan from Paris.
