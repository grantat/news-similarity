An Uber self-driving car is displayed in a garage in San Francisco. (Eric Risberg/Associated Press) David Pierson Uber said it will continue to operate its self-driving cars in San Francisco despite demands from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to cease its program or face legal action. In a call with reporters Friday, Anthony Levandowski, Uber\u2019s vice president for self-driving technology, argued that the ride-hailing giant\u2019s newest cars shouldn\u2019t be regulated like autonomous vehicles because they still require human drivers in case of emergency. In essence, Uber\u2019s new fleet of taxis should be treated the same as Tesla, Levandowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why the DMV would seek to require self-driving Ubers to get permits when it accepts that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology does not need them,\u201d he\u00a0said. The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a tersely worded letter addressed to Levandowski on Friday, the attorney from the California Department of Justice ordered Uber to remove its self-driving cars from the state\u2019s roadways until it complies with state rules. \u201cIf Uber cannot advise the undersigned that it will immediately remove its self-driving vehicles from California public roadways until it obtains the appropriate permit, as 20 other companies have done, the Attorney General will seek injunctive and other appropriate relief,\u201d the letter said. It is not unusual for Uber to launch a new program without consulting regulators. A self-driving truck rolled out in Nevada also caught the ire of the DMV there after a promotional video surfaced showing one of the vehicles rolling down a highway without a driver behind the wheel.\u00a0 \u201cReal-world testing on public roads is essential both to gain public trust and improve the technology over time,\u201d Levandowski said. John M Simpson, privacy project director with Consumer Watchdog, was angered by Uber's decision to flout the DMV's demand. \"It's an outrageously irresponsible position,\" Simpson said. \"The DMV should immediately seek an injunction and Uber's executives should be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible under the law.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Visiting Downtown Disney?

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Dec 16, 2016 5:00 PM EST President Obama began his final end-of-year press conference by touting all of the achievements his administration has made over the last eight years and then told reporters that the White House handled Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. election in the right way.\u00a0 President Obama on Russian hacks, Syria and more Mr. Obama said that wages have grown over his two terms, Obamacare has provided healthcare insurance to thousands of Americans and it\u2019s led to businesses creating millions of jobs. The president said he cut deficits by nearly two-thirds and he cut down the U.S. troop size overseas and Osama bin Laden has been killed. Russian hacking of the U.S. election The president was asked if he was prepared to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin by name for ordering a cyber attack against the U.S. election and whether he agrees with Hillary Clinton\u2019s assertion that \u00a0Russian hacking contributed to her loss.\u00a0 \u201cBased on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and that as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and to make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference from cyber attacks in the future,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cMy hope is that the president-elect is going to be similarly concerned that we aren\u2019t going to have foreign interference in our election process.\u201d Obama vows to retaliate for U.S. election interference The president then explained that the White House didn\u2019t reveal what Russia\u2019s motives were before the election or that the administration didn\u2019t respond more forcefully because he didn\u2019t want to contribute to the \u201chyper-partisan atmosphere.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI wanted to make sure that we were playing this thing straight...imagine if we had done the opposite...it would have become immediately just one more political scrum,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we handled it the way it should have been handled.\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Obama said that he pulled Putin aside at a conference in China in early September to tell him to \u201ccut it out\u201d and the president said the U.S. did not see further tampering of the election.\u00a0 He was asked later on whether he would declassify evidence that proves Russia was responsible. \u201cWe will provide evidence that we can safely provide that does not compromise sources and methods,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know.\u201d Pressed on whether he absolutely believed Putin authorized the hacks, Mr. Obama responded that \u201cThe intelligence that I\u2019ve seen gives me great confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack - the hack of the DNC, and the hack of John Podesta.\u201d Evidence, he said, was provided in a closed session on a bipartisan basis to him and leaders of Congress, including the chairs and ranking members of relevant committees.\u00a0 He added that the hack \u201chappened at the highest level\u201d of the Russian government, noting that \u201cnot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis is a pretty hierarchical operation,\u201d he said. \u201cLast I checked, there\u2019s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation particularly when it comes to policies directed at the United States.\u201d\u00a0 When asked whether he believes Donald Trump\u2019s social media responses to the reports on Russian hacking emboldened the Kremlin, the president urged some caution before criticizing his successor.\u00a0 \u201cI think the president elect is still in transition mode from campaign to governance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you\u2019re not in power as when you\u2019re in power.\u201d Mr. Obama further called on the president-elect to choose a unifying path forward on the issue, saying it would be wise to \u201cwelcome a bipartisan process\u201d of investigating the election to ensure the preservation of democracy\u2019s cornerstone.\u00a0 A senior administration official said this week that the U.S. has \u201chigh confidence\u201d \u200ethat it was the G.R.U. -- Russia\u2019s largest intelligence agency -- that conducted the hacking of the DNC and DCCC with the goal of giving an advantage to Donald Trump . \u00a0Further, officials say they are convinced that the hacking that plagued the DNC was approved by Putin. Sources confirmed to CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues this week that they believe Putin was aware of attacks that began in July of last year. \u00a0 In an interview with NPR that aired early Friday morning, the president said that \u201cthere is no doubt that when any\u00a0 foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections , that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing.\u201d And \u201csome of it may be...explicit and publicized,\u201d he continued. \u201cSome of it may not be.\u201d Future of the Democratic party The president weighed in on the future of the Democratic party, urging liberals to expand their horizons -- even into red states -- when it comes to winning over voters. \u201cHow do we make sure we are showing up in places where democratic policies are needed, where they\u2019re helping?\u201d Mr. Obama asked. He pointed to his own campaigns in the past and what he did to win them, saying he won his U.S. Senate seat in Illinois by \u201cgoing to fish fries and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t win every one of their votes, but they got a sense of who I was,\u201d he said, noting that his own family\u2019s history \u201cwasn\u2019t all that different from theirs even if I looked a little bit different.\u201d The president expressed regret that he was unable on the whole to transfer his own grassroots campaign success to down-ticket candidates, especially during midterms. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I would have liked to have done more of, but it\u2019s kind of hard to do when you\u2019re dealing with all kinds of issues\u201d in the White House, he said. Still, he added, \u201cI could not be prouder of the coalition I put together in each of my campaigns, because it was inclusive.\u201d Asked to weigh in on the race for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, where Labor Secretary Tom Perez is a contender, the president said he was glad he didn\u2019t \u201chave a vote in this.\u00a0 He did, however, comment on some of the candidates, which he said were \u201calso my friends and are fine people as well.\u201d Of Perez, Mr. Obama called him \u201cone of the best secretaries of labor in our history.\u201d \u201cHe is tireless,\u201d he said. He is wicked smart. He has been able to work across the spectrum of, you know, labor, business, activists. He has produced.\u201d \u201cWhoever leads the DNC, and any candidate with the Democratic brand going forward, I want them to feel as if they can reach out and find that common ground,\u201d he said. Aleppo, Syria: \u201cI cannot claim that we have been successful.\u201d Asked if he felt personally responsible for the atrocities in Aleppo, Syria during the country\u2019s civil war, Mr. Obama said he has \u201calways\u201d felt responsible. \u201cBecause of my office, because I\u2019m president of the United States, I feel responsible,\u201d he said, adding that the same applies for domestic issues as well as international conflicts. Specifically on actions that can be taken in Syria, Mr. Obama said he has \u201ctaken the best course I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States.\u201d Aleppo evacuations halted after attack \u201cI understand the impulse to want to do something\u201d in Aleppo and Syria as a whole, the president said. \u201cIt sounded like the right thing to do -- but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap.\u201d At the same time, he said of the U.S. approach in Syria: \u201cI cannot claim that we have been successful.\u201d On establishing a safe zone in Syria, the president said it would be very difficult to do. \u201cThat requires some force that is willing to maintain that territory in the absence of consent from the Syrian government -- and now the Russians or the Iranians,\u201d he said. A free and fair election? Mr. Obama was asked if he can assure the public that the election was \u201cfree and fair.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was a concern and will continue to be a concern going forward,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with. That assurance, I can provide.\u201d\u00a0 Russian influence and U.S. foreign policy The president was asked if he\u2019s concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin and about his pick for secretary of state: Rex Tillerson.\u00a0 \u201cThe Russians can\u2019t change us or significantly weaken us,\u201d he said, adding that the Russian economy doesn\u2019t produce anything that consumers want except oil, gas and arms.\u00a0 \u201cThey can impact us if we lose track of who we are,\u201d he said. They can impact us if we abandon our values,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Mr. Obama then appeared to make a thinly veiled criticism of Mr. Trump. He said that Putin can weaken the U.S. if Americans buy into notions that \u201cit\u2019s okay to intimidate the press\u201d or \u201clock up dissidents\u201d or \u201cdiscriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like.\u201d Revisiting the \u201cOne China\u201d policy The president was asked if the \u201cOne China\u201d policy needs a fresh set of eyes or whether Mr. Trump\u2019s approach -- taking a call from Taiwan\u2019s leader -- would set the U.S. on a collision course geopolitically. \u201cI\u2019m somewhere in-between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think it should be not just the prerogative but obligation of a new president to examine what makes sense and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d President-elect's comments may lead to frayed ties with China Mr. Obama said that there\u2019s no bilateral relationship \u201cthat carries more significant\u201d than between the U.S. and China. He said that Mr. Trump needs to understand what the consequences would be of up-ending the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. The president advised Mr. Trump broadly, \u201cAcross the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you are doing it in a systematic, deliberate and intentional way.\u201d\u00a0 The Electoral College Calling the Electoral College a \u201cvestige\u201d and a \u201ccarryover\u201d from the time of the founding fathers, the president discussed the recent debate over electors and their usefulness.\u00a0 \u201cThere are some structures in our political system as envisioned by the founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is if we have a strong message if we\u2019re speaking to what the American people care about, typically the popular vote and the Electoral College vote will align.\u201d When pressed on whether he would allow electors to receive an intelligence briefing before they gathered for a vote next week, Mr. Obama said that he would not wade into that issue. \u201cIt is not my job to decide my successor,\u201d he said. \u201cI have provided people with a lot of information about what happened during the course of the election but more importantly, the candidates have talked about their beliefs and their vision for America.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "In his final press conference, Obama looked back on eight years, but pressing questions about Russian hacking and violence in Syria took center stage. Leigh Vogel/WireImage hide caption toggle caption Leigh Vogel/WireImage In his final press conference, Obama looked back on eight years, but pressing questions about Russian hacking and violence in Syria took center stage. Leigh Vogel/WireImage President Obama held his final press conference of 2016 and painted a rosy picture of his tenure as president \u2014 from economic growth to foreign policy. So how did he hold up on the facts and what context did he leave out? We look at five different quotes: 1. \"The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies are trying to obfuscate the truth. The world should not be fooled, and the world will not forget.\" President Obama accuses Russia and Syria of trying to \"obfuscate the truth\" in the city of Aleppo, but says the world will not be fooled and will not forget. He says they are to blame for the atrocities unfolding there. The president says he does feel responsible too. He's defending his decision, though, not to take any military action to tip the balance in Syria. He says it couldn't be done on the cheap. The Obama administration often argued that the choice was between diplomacy or military action, though activists argued there were other options short of sending in thousands of troops uninvited, including safe zones or targeted strikes on Syrian airfields to take out helicopters that were dropping barrel bombs and chlorine bombs on civilian areas. Article continues after sponsorship \u2014 Michele Kelemen, diplomacy correspondent 2. \"So with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States. And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings \u2014 if you tallied it up, days and weeks of meetings \u2014 where we went through every option in painful detail with maps and we had our military and we had our aid agencies and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours. Whenever we went through it, the challenge was that short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars...\" President Obama talked about the only other option in Syria being large numbers of troops, but not necessarily. His national-security advisers back four years ago wanted him to arm and train the rebels on a large scale. He decided against it. One of those advisers was Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump's choice to run the Defense Department. Another was Hillary Clinton, as well as Obama's former CIA Director David Petraeus. Safe zones? You would have to send a force on the ground and ask permission of Syria and Russia. Really? What about the hundreds of US Special Operators running around Syria? Obama just sent 200 more. Did he get approval from Assad? Also, Turkey already has sent in combat troops, heading to Al Bab \u2013 without permission. \u2014 Tom Bowman, Pentagon reporter 3. \"There was a survey some of you saw where \u2014 not this just one poll, but pretty credible source, 37 percent of Republican voters approve of Putin. Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.\" Obama appears to be referring to a YouGov poll that showed a recent spike in Republicans' favorability of Vladimir Putin. Pollster Will Jordan tweeted a chart of this on Wednesday: Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt And as Politico reported on Friday : \"Back in July 2014 just 10 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, according to a poll conducted by the Economist and YouGov. By September of 2016, that number rose to 24 percent. And it's even higher today: 37 percent of Republicans view Putin favorably, the poll found in December.\" Republicans' favorability of Putin is still negative, but it is a sharp increase from where they were as recently as September. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben, political reporter Median household income 4. \"...the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record. In fact, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top.\" U.S. Census Bureau This is right \u2014 the median household income in the U.S. climbed by 5.2 percent between 2014 and 2015, to $56,516. That's the biggest jump since the Census Bureau started keeping track in 1967. In addition, income growth at the bottom and middle was stronger than it was at the top by that Census data. Growth at the 10th percentile level was around 7.9 percent, a rate that declined as one went up the income ladder toward the median (that is, the 50th percentile). Median income grew by 5.2 percent. For people at the 90th percentile, it grew by nearly 2.9 percent. That said, how good the data looks for lower income levels depends upon how it's sliced, not to mention which data one uses. As economist Emmanuel Saez pointed out at the Center for Equitable Growth in July, IRS data showed that incomes for people in the top percent of earners grew by 7.7 percent in 2015, compared to 3.9 percent for the bottom 99 percent. That's still solid growth for the 99 percent, and it could still mean strong growth in the bottom tiers of earners, but it suggests that in the top sliver of earners, income growth was once again stronger than for many people in lower classes. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben Perceptions of Democrats as 'liberal, latte-sipping,\" \"politically correct,\" and \"out-of-touch\" 5. \"And where Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte- sipping, you know, politically correct, out-of-touch folks, we have to be in those communities. And I've seen that, when we are in those communities, it makes a difference. That's how I became president. I became a U.S. Senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving downstate Illinois and going to fish fries and sitting in V.F.W. Halls and talking to farmers.\" There's no way of knowing how widespread the perception of Democrats as precious, out-of-touch, urban coastal elites is, nor how much it may have hurt Clinton and other Democrats in the election. However, it is altogether possible that the isolation from and resentment toward political power that many Americans feel pushed them to vote for Republicans. As one political scientist explained to NPR this year, that may be a force behind many rural Americans rejecting Clinton in favor of Trump this year. And Hillary Clinton really did tend to do far worse in rural areas than in urban areas. And her performance in those rural areas was worse than Obama's in 2012, which in turn was worse than Obama's performance in those areas in 2008. Those declines in rural areas were much larger than any declines that took place over those same periods in suburban or urban areas. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben ",

By Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima December 16 at 7:43 PM Follow @nakashimae FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Obama issued a public warning to Moscow that it could face retaliation. New revelations about Comey\u2019s position could put to rest suggestions by some lawmakers that the CIA and the FBI weren\u2019t on the same page on Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s intentions. Russia has denied being behind the cyber-intrusions, which targeted the Democratic National Committee and the private emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Trump, in turn, has repeatedly said he doubts the veracity of U.S. intelligence blaming Moscow for the hacks. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Trump said in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d his first Sunday news-show appearance since the Nov. 8 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it. . . . No, I don\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d At a \u201cthank you\u201d event Thursday night with some of her top campaign donors and fundraisers, Clinton said she believed Russian-backed hackers went after her campaign because of a personal grudge that Putin had against her. Putin had blamed Clinton for fomenting mass protests in Russia after disputed 2011 parliamentary elections that challenged his rule. Putin said Clinton, then secretary of state, had \u201csent a signal\u201d to protesters by labeling the elections \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) [ Moscow has the world\u2019s attention. For Putin, that\u2019s a win. ] The positions of Comey and Clapper were revealed in a message that CIA Director John Brennan sent to the agency\u2019s workforce Friday. \u201cEarlier this week, I met separately with FBI [Director] James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election,\u201d Brennan said, according to U.S. officials who have seen the message. The CIA and the FBI declined to comment on Brennan\u2019s message or on the classified intelligence assessment that CIA officials shared with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, setting off a political firestorm. In the closed-door Senate briefing, CIA officials said it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was one of Russia\u2019s goals, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. CIA and FBI officials do not think Russia had a \u201csingle purpose\u201d by intervening during the presidential campaign, officials said. In addition to the goal of helping elect Trump, Putin aimed to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, intelligence officials have told lawmakers. A few days after the Senate briefing, a senior FBI counter\u00adintelligence official briefed the House Intelligence Committee but was not as categorical as the CIA briefer about Russia\u2019s intention to help Trump, according to officials who were present. The FBI official\u2019s more cautious presentation of the intelligence to the House panel left some Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the room with the impression that the FBI disagreed with the CIA. (Reuters) Officials close to the FBI and the CIA now say that lawmakers had misunderstood Comey\u2019s position. \u201cThe truth is they were never all that different in the first place,\u201d an official said. Similarly, officials said, Clapper and Brennan saw the intelligence the same way. Earlier this week, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a Trump supporter, wrote to spy chiefs to demand briefings on the Russian meddling. But Clapper responded that he wanted to first complete a review of all available U.S. intelligence, as directed by Obama. Brennan tried to talk to Nunes several times about the dispute. But officials said the congressman didn\u2019t take his calls until after he issued a statement Wednesday asking intelligence leaders to \u201cclarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us.\u201d Officials disputed the statement, saying Nunes had been fully briefed on the intelligence. \u201cIn recent days, I have had several conversations with members of Congress, providing an update on the status of the review as well as the considerations that need to be taken into account as we proceed,\u201d Brennan wrote in his message to CIA staffers. \u201cMany \u2014 but unfortunately not all \u2014 members understand and appreciate the importance and the gravity of the issue, and they are very supportive of the process that is underway.\u201d Brennan wrote to the CIA workforce, officials said, to reassure them in the face of accusations from Trump supporters that intelligence was being politicized. Nunes did not respond to requests for comment, but in a statement, he said, \u201cWe have not received any information from Intelligence Community (IC) agencies indicating that they have developed new assessments on this issue. I am alarmed that supposedly new information continues to leak to the media but has not been provided to Congress.\u201d In one of his last news conference of the year, Obama defended his administration\u2019s response to the Russian hacking and vowed to \u201csend a clear message to Russia\u201d that its meddling was unacceptable. \u201cI think we handled it the way it should have been handled,\u201d he said of the hacking investigation and the lack of a formal accusation of blame until a month before the election. \u201cWe allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence.\u201d Obama was referring to an Oct.\u00a07 statement by Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson publicly blaming Russia for hacking political organizations, a clear reference to the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic officials. U.S. officials said an earlier draft of the Clapper-Johnson statement singled out Putin by name for authorizing the influence operation. But before the final statement was made public, Putin\u2019s name was removed \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t be provocative,\u201d one official said. Instead, the statement blamed \u201cRussia\u2019s senior-most officials.\u201d At that time, Obama said, the U.S. intelligence community \u201cdid not attribute motives\u201d to Russia\u2019s decision to intervene in the election. \u201cImagine if we had done the opposite,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cIt would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place \u2014 at a time, by the way, when the president-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.\u201d At Friday\u2019s news conference, Obama did not directly point the finger at the Russian president. But he came close to doing so by saying: \u201cNot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.\u201d [ Putin wants revenge and respect, and hacking the U.S. is his way of getting it ] Some members of Clinton\u2019s campaign, Democrats in Congress and others have taken the Obama administration to task for not calling out Russian efforts to influence the election sooner, as well as for not taking retaliatory action against those responsible for the cyber-intrusions and leaks to WikiLeaks, the anti- secrecy group. Obama said some possible retaliatory measures might not be seen by the public, although they would be seen or felt by Moscow. Obama, who has only a few weeks left in office, made clear any response to the hacks must be carefully thought through. \u201cThe relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future but does not create problems for us is something that\u2019s worth taking the time to think through and figure out.\u201d Abby Phillip and Greg Miller contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(The Washington Post) Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russian hacking. The CIA and FBI declined to comment. The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill about two weeks ago in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Specifically, CIA briefers told the senators it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was one of Russia\u2019s goals, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

USA TODAY Sports Minnesota Golden Gophers head coach Tracy Claeys. (Photo: Jeff Hanisch, USA TODAY Sports) The University of Minnesota football team is threatening to boycott one of the nation\u2019s best known and most lucrative second-tier bowl games over the suspension of 10 players accused of participating in a sexual assault. Prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges, and the players thought the matter was behind them. But a separate school investigation concluded Wednesday that the athletes violated a policy adopted last year that defines sexual assault as anything without a \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d expression of consent. Now, less than two weeks before the Golden Gophers\u2019 scheduled Dec. 27 face-off with Washington State, the walkout threatens to upend the Holiday Bowl. On Thursday, the entire team gathered to tell reporters they will not practice or play unless the suspensions are revoked. Several players also are facing possible expulsion. Have never been more proud of our kids. I respect their rights & support their effort to make a better world! \u303d\ufe0f\uf3c8 \u2014 GoldenGopherHFC (@GoldenGopherHFC) December 16, 2016 \u201cAll these kids\u2019 reputations are destroyed,\u201d senior quarterback Mitch Leidner said. \u201cTheir names are destroyed. It\u2019s extremely difficult to get back, and it\u2019s very unfair for them, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re sticking together through this thing.\u201d In a joint statement issued Friday, University President Eric Kaler and athletic director Mark Coyle called the suspensions \u201ca values-based decision,\u201d not a legal judgment. \u201cBut we can tell you that certain behavior is simply unacceptable and antithetical to our institutional values. We support Gopher Athletics\u2019 decision because this is much bigger than football,\u201d the statement said. The administration said they had offered to meet with players Friday, but the offer had not been accepted. Sexual misconduct already has been a sensitive subject for the university and for its athletics department. Former athletic director Norwood Teague resigned in August 2015 amid allegations of sexual harassment. His replacement, Coyle, was brought in with orders not to tolerate such behavior and played a key role in the decision to suspend the players. University officials have declined to say why the players were suspended or provide any details of the internal investigation, citing student privacy rules. But an attorney for several of the suspended players and the father of one of them confirmed the action was taken in connection with an alleged sexual assault in an apartment near campus in the early hours of Sept. 2, after the Gophers won their season-opener. According to police reports, the woman who made the complaint attended a few parties before ending up in the off-campus apartment of players Carlton Djam and Tamarion Johnson. The reports said she accompanied Djam and a male whose name was redacted to Djam\u2019s room, where she had sex with both of them at the same time. Video 2: #Gophers football team makes its demand in boycott of all activities leading to Holiday Bowl. https://t.co/oyg8MhmKCa \u2014 Andy Greder (@andygreder) December 16, 2016 After the unnamed male left, she said Tamarion Johnson entered the room and that she had sex with him, too. She said she remembered seeing several people watching. \u201cShe described it as a line of people, like they were waiting for their turn \u2026 She recalls yelling for them to stop sending people in the room because she couldn\u2019t handle it,\u201d one of the reports said. The woman said she recalled at least three other men forcing themselves on her, including players Dior Johnson and Ray Buford Jr. She told police the sexual contact between her and Djam and the unnamed man may have been consensual, but that it was not consensual with the others. She was not sure if she had had sex with player KiAnte Hardin, though he told police they did and that she agreed to it. The men all told police their sexual contacts with her were consensual. The school\u2019s policy says consent may be initially given, but can be withdrawn at any time and that \u201csexual activity must stop\u201d at that point or even if there is confusion over consent. Djam recorded video of part of his encounter with the woman and turned it over to police. According to one investigator\u2019s description of it: \u201cShe appears lucid, alert, somewhat playful, and fully conscious; she does not appear to be objecting to anything at this time. \u2026 (She) sounds as though she is somewhat intoxicated, but is not slurring her words and is certainly conscious and aware of what is going on. She does not appear to be upset by the sexual activity and does not indicate that she wants it to stop \u2026 and the sexual contact appears entirely consensual.\u201d The woman acknowledged to police that she drank five to six shots of vodka that night and that there were gaps in her memory, the reports said. Statement from Mark Neville, Executive Director, National Funding Holiday Bowl: https://t.co/JtwtNJLlFI \u2014 Holiday Bowl (@HolidayBowlGame) December 16, 2016 The roles of most of the other suspended players were not clear in 22 pages of redacted police reports released Tuesday. The Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office said it had insufficient evidence to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that either force was used or that the victim was physically helpless as defined by law.\u201d That statement cited the high standard of proof needed to secure a conviction in criminal cases. But the university uses a lower bar in student discipline cases \u2014 the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d That standard, used by courts in most civil cases, requires proof only that it\u2019s \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the student code of conduct was violated. A redacted copy of the university\u2019s 82-page investigation report obtained by Minneapolis television station KSTP goes into greater detail than the police report, with the woman saying she believed 10 to 20 men had sex with her, though she was not certain because of her limited memory. University investigators wrote that they generally found her account more credible than those of the accused students. The investigators concluded that several students had failed to provide full and truthful information. The school\u2019s Office for Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action investigates allegations of sexual misconduct against students, according to university websites. The office then prepares a report and shares its findings with the Office for Student Conduct and Academic Integrity, which determines the sanctions and informs the accuser and accused. Either side can request a formal hearing before a special committee, and either party can appeal that panel\u2019s decision. It\u2019s not clear if that has happened. Neither attorney Lee Hutton, who represents several of the players, nor the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Office returned calls seeking comment from The Associated Press. BOWL WATCHABILITY\u00a0RANKINGS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 40. Quick Lane Bowl: Boston College (6-6) vs. Maryland (6-6), Detroit, Dec. 26, 2:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2 \u2014 While both teams are happy to get this postseason opportunity, the fact is neither of them played a brand of football that was aesthetically pleasing this season. BC\u2019s games tended to challenge the viewer\u2019s resolve even when the Eagles were winning. They averaged under 20 points a game, while the Terrapins weren\u2019t much more productive putting up just over 25. It will likely be close, but it almost certainly won\u2019t be pretty.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 39. Heart of Dallas Bowl: Army (7-5) vs. North Texas (5-7), Dec. 27, noon ET, ESPN \u2014 In addition to occupying a less-than-ideal time slot, this game has the added disadvantage of being a rematch. The Black Knights committed a ton of mistakes in a 35-18 loss to the Mean Green on Oct. 22. Obviously the West Pointers have played a lot better since then, but the same cannot be said for North Texas. The Mean Green dropped four of their last five, including a head-scratching setback at Texas-El Paso in the regular-season finale.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 38. St. Petersburg Bowl: Miami (Ohio) (6-6) vs. Mississippi State (5-7), Dec. 26, 11 a.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The RedHawks deserve plenty of credit for getting to bowl eligibility, winning their last six games following an 0-6 start. But they haven\u2019t fared well outside the MAC, so they aren\u2019t likely to match up well with the Bulldogs. Miss State somewhat salvaged a disappointing season with November victories against Texas A&M; and archrival Ole Miss.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 37. Independence Bowl: North Carolina State (6-6) vs. Vanderbilt (6-6), Shreveport, La., Dec. 26, 5 p.m. ET, ESPN2 \u2014 We\u2019ll grant that both teams ended the season on a high note, getting to .500 at the expense of an in-state rival. The Commodores, in fact, won their last two, displaying some offensive punch that might help this game exceed expectations. The Wolfpack\u2019s win against North Carolina just made a season of \u2018what ifs\u2019 harder for their fans to accept. They aren\u2019t likely to make much headway against the Vandy defense.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 36. Hawaii Bowl: Middle Tennessee (8-4) vs. Hawaii (6-7), Honolulu, Dec. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Raiders at least get another nice destination after playing in the Bahamas to finish last season. But this one is in effect another home game for the Warriors, who give up plenty of points but still tend to perform better when they don\u2019t have to leave the islands. Middle\u2019s offense has been somewhat makeshift since QB Brent Stockstill went down with a season-ending injury, but they did explode for 77 points against Florida Atlantic in their most recent outing.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 35. Arizona Bowl: Air Force (9-3) vs. South Alabama (6-6), Tucson, Dec. 30, 5:30 p.m. ET, ASN \u2014 This contest isn\u2019t likely to attract much of an audience given the rest of the day\u2019s activities. The Falcons will be heavy favorites playing much closer to home, though the curiously inconsistent Jaguars managed wins against Mississippi State and San Diego State despite finishing 2-6 in the Sun Belt.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 34. Foster Farms Bowl: No. 23 Utah (8-4) vs. Indiana (6-6), Santa Clara, Calif., Dec. 28, 8:30 p.m. ET, Fox \u2014 This has the makings of a mismatch, assuming the Utes can overcome their disappointing finish and play to their potential. The Hoosiers\u2019 record is unexceptional, without either notable wins or egregious losses. But they\u2019ll be in something of a state of flux following coach Kevin Wilson\u2019s ouster, and the crowd figures to favor Utah.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 33. Cactus Bowl: Boise State (10-2) vs. Baylor (6-6), Phoenix, Dec. 27, 10:15 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The 2016 season frankly can\u2019t end soon enough for Baylor, a program already beset with off-field issues that turned miserable on the field as well with a six-game closing skid. The Broncos\u2019 Mountain West aspirations were dashed in road setbacks at Wyoming and Air Force, so their biggest challenge might be finding sufficient internal motivation to handle the Bears.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 32. Liberty Bowl: Georgia (7-5) vs. TCU (6-6), Memphis, Dec. 30, noon ET, ESPN \u2014 Despite a few interesting end-game situations, Georgia\u2019s season typified the lackluster landscape that was the SEC East. The Horned Frogs were just as inconsistent, looking unstoppable at times and completely inept at others. If the version of TCU that dropped its season finale on its home field to Kansas State 30-6 shows up in Memphis, there won\u2019t be much to see.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 31. Pinstripe Bowl: Pittsburgh (8-4) vs. Northwestern (6-6), Bronx, N.Y., Dec. 28, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 It was an odd season for the Panthers, with an offense potent enough to claim victories against two top-five teams but a defense inconsistent enough to lose a few shootouts. None of Pitt\u2019s losses can be classified as bad, however, and they should be able to outscore the up-and-down Wildcats. Northwestern\u2019s defense can keep it in a lot of games and will need to do so again.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 30. New Orleans Bowl: Southern Mississippi (6-6) vs. Louisiana-Lafayette (6-6), Dec. 17, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The participants and their fans won\u2019t have far to travel for this event, at least, though it isn\u2019t likely to generate much interest beyond the region. The Golden Eagles tended to sink or swim with QB Nick Mullens, who returned from a two-game absence due to a concussion in time to lead a needed win against Louisiana Tech in the season finale. The Ragin\u2019 Cajuns are happy to be here as well after finishing 4-8 a year ago. They had to win their last two, including an upset of Sun Belt co-champ Arkansas State, to make it happen.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 29. Cure Bowl in Orlando: Arkansas State (7-5) vs. Central Florida (6-6), Dec. 17, 5:30 p.m. ET, CBSSN \u2014 As mentioned, the RedWolves shared the Sun Belt crown. But they posted a non-league mark of 0-4, including a puzzler against FCS member Central Arkansas. Their reward is in effect a road game, and the Knights will be quite pleased for the chance to defend their home turf after going winless in 2015. UCF has no standout wins but acquitted itself well in a one-point loss to eventual AAC champion Temple.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 28. Military Bowl in Annapolis, Md.: No. 24 Temple (10-3) vs. Wake Forest (6-6), Dec. 27, 3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Speaking of Temple, the Owls probably deserved a better fate in several regards. They claimed the title in the most competitive, top-to-bottom, of the group-of-five conferences, only to see their coach hired away and to earn just a short bowl trip. The Demon Deacons are in their first bowl since 2011, but they enter on a three-game slide and will likely have to count on their defense to keep this one close.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 27. Miami Beach Bowl: Tulsa (9-3) vs. Central Michigan (6-6), Dec. 19, 2:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Hmmm...the Chippewas playing a team from the state of Oklahoma \u2014 where have we seen that before? Sorry, Cowboys\u2019 fans. To be honest, CMU\u2019s season hasn\u2019t lived up to its promise since that controversial September win in Stillwater. The Golden Hurricane were involved in plenty of shootouts in the AAC and figure to put up another big score.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 26. New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque: New Mexico (8-4) vs. Texas-San Antonio (6-6), Dec. 17, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Lobos never seem to get to travel when they make the postseason. There\u2019s a bit more intrigue this time, however, as UNM plays host to UTSA in its bowl debut. Though the visitors are the Roadrunners, the Lobos will likely do most of the running; they lead the FBS in rushing offense averaging 361 yards a game.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 25. Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth: Navy (9-4) vs. Louisiana Tech (8-5), Dec. 23, 4:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Despite its ending, it was a superb season for the Midshipmen as they cracked the top 25 and played for a conference title for the first time in their storied history. But all that took a physical toll, and they now limp into this bowl date on a two-game skid with several key players sidelined. Louisiana Tech also lost in a conference title game, but the Bulldogs\u2019 high-octane passing attack will be a difficult matchup for Navy.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Birmingham Bowl: No. 22 South Florida (10-2) vs. South Carolina (6-6), Dec. 29, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Turns on the coaching carousel are often unpredictable and rarely desirable, but the Bulls\u2019 program seems poised to emerge in good shape. Meantime, they\u2019ll try to put a stamp on a solid season with win against SEC competition. Like most of their fellow division members, the Gamecocks weren\u2019t always easy to watch, and they\u2019ll almost certainly want to keep the score down in this duel with dynamic USF QB Quinton Flowers.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. Texas Bowl in Houston, Kansas State (8-4) vs. Texas A&M (8-4), Dec. 28, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Not all 8-4 teams are created equal. The Wildcats aren\u2019t all that disappointed about it, while the Aggies endured yet another November swoon and might already be in next-year mode. Most of K-State\u2019s games stayed close throughout, but A&M has struggled to move the ball since losing QB Trevor Knight to injury.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Holiday Bowl in San Diego: Minnesota (8-4) vs. Washington State (8-4), Dec. 27, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 it\u2019s rare that this event doesn\u2019t draw a matchup worthy of the top half. But the Big Ten\u2019s strong New Year\u2019s Six presence has limited the pool somewhat for the league\u2019s other bowl partners. This is not to take anything away from the Golden Gophers, who improved on last year\u2019s 6-7 campaign. But if they fall behind early, they won\u2019t have the firepower to catch up with the Cougars, who were in the Pac-12 title hunt until the final weekend of the season.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Famous Idaho Potato Bowl in Boise: Idaho (8-4) vs. Colorado State (7-5), Dec. 22, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 This pairing probably escaped notice upon its release, but it could prove to be highly entertaining. The Rams were among the hottest teams in the west at season\u2019s end winning four of their last five, with the only loss coming in a 49-46 shootout with Air Force. The Vandals posted a 6-2 league record in their penultimate swing through the Sun Belt and hope to leave an impression before returning to the Football Championship Subdivision. Idaho tends to make this event fun when it\u2019s here, earning a 42-35 win against Southern Miss in 1998 and a 43-42 triumph over Bowling Green in 2009.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. Dollar General Bowl in Mobile, Ala.: Troy (9-3) vs. Ohio (8-5), Dec. 23, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014  Both these teams missed out on opportunities to win or share their respective conference titles on the regular season\u2019s final weekend, and neither will want to end the campaign with a losing streak. The Trojans feature the more diverse offense with the one-two backfield punch of QB Brandon Silvers and RB Jordan Chunn, but the Bobcats should have QB Greg Windham back at full speed to test the Troy defense.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. TaxSlayer Bowl in Jacksonville: Georgia Tech (8-4) vs. Kentucky (7-5), Dec. 31, 11 a.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Getting here was a good step for both programs. For the Yellow Jackets 2016 was a bounce-back, while it was something of a breakthrough for the Wildcats as they made headway in the SEC East. The game itself should be in interesting contrast of styles, though both offenses do most of their work on the ground. Georgia Tech\u2019s option attack, directed by QB Justin Thomas, will try to control the clock and keep UK\u2019s pair of 1,000-yard rushers, Boom Williams and Benny Snell, off the field.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 18. Bahamas Bowl in Nassau: Old Dominion (9-3) vs. Eastern Michigan (7-5), Dec. 23, 1 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 When you haven\u2019t been to a bowl since 1987 like EMU, or if you\u2019re bowling for the first time like ODU, any destination is nice. The fact that they get to go to the Bahamas is icing on the cake. The contest itself should be entertaining as well. Monarchs QB David Washington has thrown for 2,648 yards and 28 TDs. The Eagles will counter with Brogan Roback, who served a two-game suspension to start the season, has epitomized the program\u2019s maturation.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Belk Bowl in Charlotte: No. 19 Virginia Tech (9-4) vs. Arkansas (7-5), Dec. 29, 5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 If nothing else, this clash shouldn\u2019t lack for dramatic moments. The Hokies\u2019 campaign has been a mixed bag of signature wins and puzzling losses, but when they don\u2019t beat themselves they can play with anyone. The Razorbacks have also battled inconsistency but can also put up a big score when they don\u2019t give the ball away.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Sun Bowl in El Paso: No. 16 Stanford (9-3) vs. North Carolina (8-4), Dec. 30, 2 p.m. ET, CBS \u2014 The Cardinal fell off the national radar after a bad first month. But they gradually worked their way back into the top 25. And oh yeah, they still have all-purpose threat Christian McCaffrey. The Tar Heels\u2019 season has been the reverse, featuring a strong start with some exasperating losses to area rivals down the stretch. UNC is never out of a game with QB Mitch Trubisky, but he must be careful against the Stanford defense.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Music City Bowl in Nashville: No. 21 Nebraska (9-3) vs. Tennessee (8-4), Dec. 30, 3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 There were positive steps for these proud programs, but neither fan base will feel particularly satisfied with an ending loss. Tennessee has been let down by its defense, particularly over the last month of the campaign, but QB Joshua Dobbs will do everything in his power to go out a winner. The Cornhuskers didn\u2019t fare well against the tougher competition on their schedule, so a bowl win would help erase some bad memories. QB Tommy Armstrong is still battling a hamstring injury but hopes to be ready.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Russell Athletic Bowl in Orlando: No. 12 West Virginia (10-2) vs. Miami (Fla.) (8-4), Dec. 28, 5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Mountaineers enjoyed a terrific year, except when they were facing teams from Oklahoma, of course. Whether a win here will actually translate into momentum for 2017 remains to be seen, but it would be a nice send-off for senior QB Skyler Howard. The Hurricanes have endured a wild ride of four-game streak, with a skid in the middle sandwiched by a good start and better finish. QB Brad Kaaya will look to maintain the sharpness he showed in the final month.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego: BYU (8-4) vs. Wyoming (8-5), Dec. 21, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 One of the better rivalries from the old WAC gets rekindled in this appealing destination. Though the Cowboys missed out on the Mountain West championship, they\u2019ve still enjoyed a fine turnaround. The Cougars seem to only know how to play close games, so a tight finish is a good possibility. The bad news for BYU is QB Taysom Hill sustained yet another season-ending injury, this time to his elbow.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Camellia Bowl in Montgomery, Ala.: Toledo (9-3) vs. Appalachian State (9-3), Dec. 17, 5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Sun Belt co-champion Mountaineers take on the high-flying Rockets, who came within a game of playing for the MAC title in this opening-day treat. Leading the way for Toledo is veteran QB Logan Woodside, who has 43 TD passes this season with the help of an explosive receiving corps. ASU QB Taylor Lamb isn\u2019t quite as prolific but directs a solid ground attack that has helped them to a possession-time edge of nearly eight minutes per game.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 11. Boca Raton Bowl: Western Kentucky (10-3) vs. Memphis (8-4), Dec. 20, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Conference USA champion Hilltoppers will treat their fans to this tasty tilt with the Tigers, who made coach Mike Norvell\u2019s debut season a success. WKU, of course, knows a bit about having its coach hired away \u2014 Jeff Brohm is leaving for Purdue, and on Wednesday the WKU announced Notre Dame offensive coordinator Mike Sanford as its new hire \u2014 but has maintained its winning tradition. The Hilltoppers are putting up over 45 points a game while the Tigers average just under 40, so buckle up and enjoy watching WKU\u2019s Mike White and Riley Ferguson of Memphis trade big plays.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Sugar Bowl in New Orleans: No. 7 Oklahoma (10-2) vs. No. 17 Auburn (8-4), Jan. 2, 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 This is the last one before the national championship game, but it has the potential to unfold as the least attractive of the majors. Whether this game turns out to be competitive largely depends on the Tigers, who hope to have several of their key offensive playmakers healthy by game time. The Auburn defense will pose a challenge for the Sooners\u2019 pair of Heisman finalists, QB Baker Mayfield and WR Dede Westbrook, but things could get out of hand quickly if the Big 12 champs build a lead.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas: No. 8 Wisconsin (10-3) vs. No. 14 Western Michigan (13-0), Jan. 2, 1 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The curiosity factor of how the group-of-five representative fares against a power-conference opponent will turn to intrigue if the Broncos are able to hang with the Badgers into the second half \u2014 and they very well might. Wisconsin isn\u2019t an offensive juggernaut, and WMU doesn\u2019t often make mistakes that would give the Badgers a short field. The Broncos did display some uncharacteristic nervousness in the MAC title game, however, and they\u2019ll have to shake any residual jitters immediately to make the most of this chance.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Outback Bowl in Tampa, No. 18 Florida (8-4) vs. No. 25 Iowa (8-4), Jan. 2, 1 p.m. ET, ABC \u2014If nothing else, this contest should be close throughout because neither offense is likely to generate sufficient points for a big lead. It would not be stunning, in fact, to see one of these accomplished defensive units produce a big play that could shift momentum. And hey, no matter who wins, there\u2019s a free appetizer.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. Las Vegas Bowl: San Diego State (10-3) vs. Houston (9-3), Dec. 17, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC \u2014 You\u2019ll want to make time to catch this highlight of the bowl season\u2019s first full day. If not for some ill-timed off days resulting in losses, either of these teams might have been candidates to appear in the New Year\u2019s Six lineup. As it is, the Mountain West champion Aztecs and Donnel Pumphrey (No. 2 nationally in rushing with 2,018 yards; he needs just 108 yards to become the all-time FBS leader) should stage a terrific back-and-forth battle with the Cougars and feisty QB Greg Ward Jr.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla.: No. 6 Michigan (10-2) vs. No. 10 Florida State (9-3), Dec. 30, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Even though this is a much sought-after bowl destination, it\u2019s not the one either of these teams wanted at the start of the season. Even so, a victory will mean a top-10 finish. Seminoles\u2019 freshman QB Deondre Francois appears to have a bright future, though his line must do a much better job protecting him. In the meantime he\u2019ll look to send backfield mate Dalvin Cook off to the next level with a win, assuming he chooses to enter the draft. The Wolverines should have QB Wilton Speight back at full strength, and it will be interesting to see how many uses Michigan finds for Jabrill Peppers in what might also be his send-off performance.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Alamo Bowl in San Antonio: No. 11 Colorado (10-3) vs. No. 13 Oklahoma State (9-3), Dec. 29,  9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 We strongly considered making this one the most appealing pairing outside the six access bowls. It features two teams that were playing for power conference titles on the final weekend of the regular season. The time off should help Buffaloes\u2019 QB Sefo Liufau\u2019s bad ankle heal. CU will need him at full speed to keep up with Mason Rudolph and the Cowboys.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Citrus Bowl in Orlando: No. 15 Louisville (9-3) vs. No. 20 LSU (7-4), Dec. 31, 11 a.m. ET, ABC \u2014 In the end, we went with this one to head the non-New Year\u2019s Six clashes. The main attraction is the Heisman Trophy winner against the stingiest defense he\u2019s encountered all season. Cardinals\u2019 QB Lamar Jackson will have to pick his spots to run more carefully against the hard-hitting Bayou Bengals, though LSU will miss the constant presence of LB Kendell Beckwith (knee).\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.: No. 5 Penn State (11-2) vs. No. 9 Southern California (9-3), Jan. 2, 5 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The \u201cGranddaddy\u201d easily heads the list of non-playoff matchups. You will not find two hotter power-five teams entering the bowl season outside of Tuscaloosa. Much of the Trojans\u2019 reversal of fortune is attributed to the switch to freshman QB Sam Darnold, but the USC defense also made strides after September. The Nittany Lions have made second-half comebacks into an art form this season, but their fans would still like to see a strong first series from QB Trace McSorley and RB Saquon Barkley to ease some anxieties.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Peach Bowl in Atlanta: No. 1 Alabama (13-0) vs. No. 4 Washington (12-1), Dec. 31, 3 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The apparent inevitability of the Crimson Tide\u2019s march to the SEC championship prompts us to put their game second of the playoff semifinals. Washington took its fans on a tremendous ride this season all the way to the Pac-12 title. But it doesn\u2019t bode well that in the Huskies\u2019 lone loss to USC they were dominated at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and that is where Alabama imposes its will on a weekly basis. Washington QB Jake Browning must make some deep connections early for the Huskies to have any shot at pulling off the upset.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 1. Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz.: No. 2 Ohio State (11-1) vs. No. 3 Clemson (12-1), Dec. 31, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Keeping in mind the overarching \u2018anything can happen\u2019 reality that is, after all, the reason we watch sports, we give this semifinal a higher probability of holding our interest. Both the Buckeyes and Tigers survived a few nail biters to get here, so a little fourth-quarter drama to close out the calendar year is a strong possibility. S Malik Hooker and the superb Buckeyes\u2019 secondary could limit the big-play opportunities for Clemson QB Deshaun Watson, so the Tigers will need a big contribution from RB Wayne Gallman. The Ohio State attack works best when QB J.T. Barrett can find all-purpose back Curtis Samuel in space, but he\u2019s sure to receive added attention from Clemson LB Ben Boulware.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Republican \u201cfaithless elector,\u201d who made headlines across the country when he wrote a blistering op-ed pledging not to vote for President-elect Trump in the Electoral College, is now under scrutiny himself after his claim to have been a firefighter on 9/11 has been questioned by a local news outlet. Christopher Suprun, a Republican elector in Texas, wrote a piece for the\u00a0 New York Times on Dec. 5 called \u201cWhy I Will Not Cast My Electoral Vote for Donald Trump.\u201d In it, Suprun cites his past as a firefighter on 9/11 as one of the reasons for not voting for Donald Trump on Dec. 19, despite Texas voting comfortably for Trump on Nov. 8. \u201cFifteen years ago, as a firefighter, I was part of the response to the Sept. 11 attacks against our nation. That attack and this year\u2019s election may seem unrelated, but for me the relationship becomes clearer every day,\u201d Suprun wrote. In the piece, he calls on fellow Republican electors to vote their conscience and deny Trump the 270 votes he needs to win the White House, and to back a Republican alternative such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has publicly distanced himself from such efforts. \u201cThe election of the next president is not yet a done deal. Electors of conscience can still do the right thing for the good of the country. Presidential electors have the legal right and a constitutional duty to vote their conscience,\u201d Suprun wrote. \u201cI pray my fellow electors will do their job and join with me in discovering who that person should be.\u201d Yet, as the move to deny Trump the 270 votes has gained momentum and media coverage, Suprun\u2019s past has come under scrutiny. Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA reported that Suprun\u2019s LinkedIn page claims that he was part of Manassas Fire Department in Sept. 2001, but found that he was not part of that Fire Dept. until October, and cited an anonymous first responder who knew Suprun, who contradicted his claims. \u201cHe claimed to be a first responder with the Manassas Park Fire Department on September 11, 2001 and personally told us stories 'I was fighting fire that day at the Pentagon.' No, I was on a medic unit that day at the Pentagon and you make a phone call to Manassas Park and you find out that he wasn't even employed there until October 2001,\" the source told the outlet. Even if Suprun had been hired by Manassas Park before 9/11, the fire chief there told WFAA that they did not respond to the Pentagon that fateful day. \"It\u2019s no different than stolen valor for the military,\u201d the source told WFAA. Suprun responded to the allegations in a statement Friday: \u201cYou\u2019re right, I wasn\u2019t in New York on 9-11,\u201d he said [although WFAA did not make such a claim.] \u201cI was a part of the response to the Pentagon attacks, as a member of the Dale City fire department in northern Virginia.\u201d He explained further in response to a question at an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d on Reddit. \u201cThat story exhibits a reckless disregard for the truth. I never claimed to be a first responder on 9-11 with the Manassas Park Fire Dept. I was a volunteer firefighter at the time for the Dale City Fire Dept. when I responded to the attacks at the Pentagon,\u201d he said. Suprun\u2019s claim is backed up in part by a story in Philly.com in 2012, which reported on a talk Suprun gave for the Never Forget foundation. In that, Philly.com reports him claiming in that talk that he was indeed part of the Dale City Volunteer Fire Department. However, that account does not present him as a firefighter, as he claims to be in his Times op-ed and his Reddit answer, but as a volunteer paramedic. His account does not have him fighting fires, but administering first aid in a nearby parking lot, before being deployed to a recreation center, where he treated first responders. Calls to Dale City Fire Dept. from FoxNews.com were not immediately returned. Follow up questions to Suprun\u2019s agent seeking to clarify his role that day were also not returned. It was not the only question WFAA raised in regards to Suprun\u2019s record. On his LinkedIn profile, Suprun says he is presently a paramedic with Freedom EMS in Dallas, but WFAA reports that no such company exists. A spokeswoman for Air Methods ambulance service, where Suprun's LinkedIn also claims he works, told the outlet he is not employed there either. Electors make their decision on Dec. 19. Suprun is so far the only elector to publicly express his intent to change his vote from Trump. It would take 37 votes to deny Trump the votes needed, which would then send the question to the House of Representatives. Trump would likely still win among the Republican-heavy legislature, but rogue electors hope that by presenting a moderate Republican, they can convince them to snatch the White House away from the billionaire.

By Aaron Blake December 16 at 12:47 PM Follow @aaronblake Hillary Clinton looks on as first lady Michelle Obama speaks during a campaign rally at Wake Forest University on Oct. 27, in Winston-Salem, N.C. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Hillary Clinton, in audio just unearthed by the New York Times , offers her most unvarnished accounting of her 2016 election defeat yet. And while it's no surprise that she blames FBI Director James B. Comey \u2014 she's done that before , if a bit less forcefully \u2014\u00a0she also points pretty squarely at another \u201cunprecedented,\u201d non-Comey actor: Russia. Here's a partial transcript of Clinton's comments to campaign donors Thursday night: There were some unprecedented factors that I don\u2019t think we can ignore, because to do so is at our peril. Now, don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from independent analysts. Take it from the Trump campaign. Take it from Nate Silver, who\u2019s pointed out that swing-state voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me, because of the FBI letter from Director Comey. And Nate Silver believes \u2014 I happen to believe this \u2014 that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome. But we're also learning something more every day about the unprecedented Russian plot to swing this election. And this is something every American should be worried about. You know, we have to recognize that, as the latest reports made clear, Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me. Clinton later added, in reference to\u00a0Russia's meddling, that \u201cthe press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign.\u201d Clinton doesn't directly say \u201cI lost because of Russia\" \u2014 at least not as directly as she says it about Comey \u2014 but it wasn't as if she brought it up simply to make a case about cybersecurity; she brought it up in the context of the \u201cunprecedented factors\u201d that led to her loss. Right after she points to late deciders voting against her because of Comey, she brings up Russia. And Clinton isn't the only one entertaining the idea that Russia made the difference. President Obama said in a new NPR interview that Russia's meddling changed the \u201catmosphere\u201d of the race and dominated the news coverage in a way that crowded out other issues and advantaged Trump in a clear way. Obama told Steve Inskeep : That whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that number one, issues weren't talked about a lot in the coverage, huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively, her experience, her \u2014 her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of State, all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum, in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxiety and fears that some voters have I think definitely made a difference. But did it actually make a difference? Obama then\u00a0put on his political scientist/pundit cap and left it open as a possibility. \u201cElections can always turn out differently,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage.\u201d Obama was very diplomatic about this, but he's clearly not disputing the idea that Russia may have changed the results of the 2016 election; that's the inescapable extension of his comments. He was asked a direct question about whether it \u201ccould have turned out differently,\u201d and Obama's answer was decidedly far from \u201cno.\u201d And in fact, Obama seems to think Russian meddling mattered in a very big way by essentially turning the entire debate away from Clinton's strengths. Obama emphasized during the same interview that he didn't want to start \u201cre-litigating\u201d the 2016 election, but the problem with looking at Russia's role is that this is inherently part of the process. The fact is that Trump's margin of victory was so small \u2014 less than 1 percentage point in the three states that mattered: Michigan (0.2 percent), Pennsylvania (0.7) and Wisconsin (0.8) \u2014\u00a0that even a small shift could have made the difference. If Russia's meddling moved the vote in every state just one point toward Trump, it made the difference. This is a big reason Republicans have been reluctant to go down this road . Even those who may be legitimately worried about Russia's meddling know it's not hard to draw the line from A to B to C: The Russians meddled on Trump's behalf, and Trump won by a very small margin ( about 80,000 votes ), so it's quite possible Russia tipped the scales in the election. The comments from Clinton and Obama aren't likely to make them feel better about entertaining this investigation and all the questions that come with it. If the conclusion of that investigation is that Russia penetrated deeply and was able to influence the process in a serious way, there will always be that doubt about whether it made the difference and whether Trump would have been president without it. We may never know for sure, but as Clinton and Obama demonstrate, plenty of people will have their suspicions. politics ",

Rush-hour snow, freezing rain, possibly record-breaking cold Subzero cold sets in across the Chicago area, making for a frigid commutes and a sunrise that looks deceptively warm. (Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staff Contact Reporter Chicago will get a break from the arctic chill long enough for a snowstorm around the evening rush Friday, freezing rain on Saturday morning, then more snow before polar air returns and possibly breaks some records by the end of the weekend. The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory in effect from noon Friday until 6 a.m. Sunday. The snow is expected to be heaviest during the middle and end of the evening rush Friday, possibly an inch an hour in some places. The snow may turn to sleet and freezing rain Saturday morning, especially in areas to the south of the city. \"Any amount of light freezing rain or freezing drizzle could have large impact,\" the weather service warned. The wind will pick up and the temperature will drop by evening, when more snow is expected. The two waves of snow Friday and Saturday are expected to dump as much as 8 inches near the Wisconsin border, less to the south. Wind chills could get down to minus 25 or worse Saturday night all the way through Sunday night. The low Saturday night is expected to be minus 1, the high Sunday near 2 above and the low Sunday night minus 10. Both days could break records. The record low for Dec. 17 is minus 1 set in 1951, the record low for Dec. 18 minus 11 set in 1983. The storm system has generated storm advisories and warnings from the Rockies through South Dakota into Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northern Indiana and Lower Michigan. This latest arctic front will finally move out Monday and temperatures will begin to climb during the week before Christmas. It's expected to be in the low 30s on Christmas Day with a chance of snow showers.

By REUTERS. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said on Friday that he refrained from taking aggressive public action in retaliation for Russian hacking of Democratic Party institutions before the presidential election because he was concerned that such moves might be interpreted as unfair meddling in the campaign. In a news conference before leaving for a two-week vacation in Hawaii, Mr. Obama said that he told President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in September to \u201ccut it out,\u201d but that the United States government did not retaliate in a public way before the Nov. 8 election. \u201cWe did not,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd the reason we did not was because in this hyperpartisan atmosphere, at a time when my primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged,\u201d such a move would \u201cimmediately be seen through a partisan lens.\u201d \u201cWe were playing this thing straight.

    "text": "Dec 16 2016, 6:05 pm ET University of Minnesota Football Players Boycott Activities After Sexual Assault Suspensions by Erik Ortiz Football players boycott after teammates suspended 3:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161217004948if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/834920515771\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The entire University of Minnesota's football team is boycotting practices \u2014 and potentially an upcoming bowl game \u2014 until a forceful request from players is met: lift the suspension of 10 teammates involved in sexual assault allegations. It's a defiant demand by the 99-member team against university officials \u2014 one that if not resolved means the Gophers won't hit the field in the Dec. 27 Holiday Bowl against Washington State University. Before then, the team is supposed to hold five practices before flying to San Diego for the match-up. During a news conference Thursday at the team's practice facility, the players said they were blindsided by the suspensions this week. \"All these kids' reputations are destroyed,\" said senior quarterback Mitch Leidner. The teammates, wearing maroon uniforms, stood with the players who were suspended indefinitely from the team, calling them the \"10 falsely accused.\" The players told reporters they also want an apology from university president Eric Kaler and athletic director Mark Coyle, as well as a closed-door meeting with two University Board of Regents members to discuss how to \"make the program great again.\" The Minnesota Golden Gophers look to the sideline for instructions in the second quarter against the Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium on Nov.26, 2016, in Madison, Wisconsin. Dylan Buell / Getty Images One of those board members, Darrin Rosha, told NBC News on Friday that he is open to a discussion. \"I have been in contact with the chair of our board, and he is evaluating that request,\" Rosha said. \"I made clear to him that I am willing and prepared to meet with our student athletes pending a resolution of their legitimate concerns.\" A university spokesman declined to comment further Friday, and told NBC News that federal privacy laws prevent the school from sharing details about the suspended students. \"The reality is that not everyone can have all of the facts, and unfortunately the university cannot share more information due to federal laws regarding student privacy,\" Kaler and Coyle said in a joint statement. Kaller added in a statement Friday that his first responsibility is upholding the university's values. \"One of my jobs as president is to put our institutional values at the forefront of all we do and ensure our actions are aligned with those values. This principle is far more important than any football game and the university community as a whole, and it is more important than any single athletic team,\" Kaller said. Coyle echoed Kaler's sentiment in a letter to University of Minnesota student athletes. \"We're confident that together, we can get through this difficult time much stronger if we hold true to our values and hold each other accountable,\" he said. The suspension of the 10 players stems from a Sept. 2 incident in which a female student had sexual contact with players. In a redacted police report, a police investigator said the sexual encounter with one player appeared to be consensual based on videos taken at the time and shown to police by the player, according to the Star-Tribune newspaper. However, the Star-Tribune said, the woman told police that sexual contact with three other players was not consensual. Police reports and the female student's testimony obtained by the newspaper describe how the student went to an off-campus apartment with two football players. During the course of the night, she said, had sex with one player. But she was forced to have sex with others, she said. \"I was shoving people off of me,\" she later testified in court to obtain restraining orders, according to the Star-Tribune. \"They kept ignoring my pleas for help. Anything I said they laughed. They tried to cheer people on.\" The woman filed restraining orders against five players in October, but she dismissed them after an agreement that they would stay at least 20 feet away from her, the Star-Tribune and NBC affiliate KARE reported. While six players were involved in the incident itself, police said, it's unclear why the others have been implicated. In the end, no players were ever arrested and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office on Oct. 3 said it declined to press charges. \"Based on the evidence available ... there is insufficient, admissible evidence for prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either force was used or that the victim was physically helpless as defined by law in the sexual encounter,\" prosecutors said. Still, an attorney for the 10 players said some of them have been recommended for expulsion from the university following an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action investigation. Attorney Lee Hutton did not immediately return a request for comment Friday, but has said he would appeal the suspensions. If facts are proven to be untrue, who will be the first to resign? \u2014 Attorney, Lee Hutton (@LeeHuttonIII) December 16, 2016 A father of one of the suspended students, freshman Antoine Winfield Jr., threatened to pull his son out of the Big Ten school if officials don't step down. \"It's a brotherhood,\" Antoine Winfield Sr., himself a retired player for the Minnesota Vikings, said at the news conference, \"and it shows you the support and love that all the players feel for each other.\" While the players still have the upcoming Holiday Bowl, some of them could see their scholarships revoked if they don't resume playing football. \"What, are they going to pull 120 guys off the team?\" senior Drew Wolitarsky asked during the news conference. \"I mean, they're not going to have a team if that's the case.\" Tracy Claeys, the Gophers' head coach, attended the news conference as well and tweeted about his players: Have never been more proud of our kids. I respect their rights & support their effort to make a better world! \u303d\ufe0f \u2014 GoldenGopherHFC (@GoldenGopherHFC) December 16, 2016 The suspension has divided students on campus, some of whom support the players and others who say the alleged victim's claims shouldn't be so quickly brushed aside just because charges weren't filed. Gopher lineman Joe Bjorklund tweeted that players standing up for one another \"isn't an attack\" on the female student. Erik Ortiz ",

    "text": "<p>Researchers testing the water in Flint, Michigan.&nbsp;</p> Close CBS News WASHINGTON --\u00a0Congressional Republicans quietly closed a year-long investigation into Flint, Michigan\u2019s crisis over lead in its drinking water, faulting both state officials and the Environmental Protection Agency for contamination that has affected nearly 100,000 residents . In letters to fellow Republicans, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Friday that Michigan and federal officials were slow in detecting high levels of lead in the water and did not act fast enough once the problem was discovered. Michigan task force calls for state-wide tests for lead The committee findings offer no new information and essentially summarize what emerged during several high-profile hearings earlier this year. \u201cThe committee found significant problems at Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality and unacceptable delays in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s response to the crisis,\u201d wrote Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. \u201cThe committee also found that the federal regulatory framework is so outdated that it sets up states to fail.\u201d Flint\u2019s drinking water became tainted when the city switched from the Detroit water system and began drawing from the Flint River in April 2014 to save money. The impoverished city was under state control at the time. Congress blasts Michigan governor, EPA chief for Flint crisis Regulators failed to ensure the water was treated properly and lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply. After nearly a year of haggling, Congress cleared legislation last week to provide $170 million to deal with the Flint crisis and help other communities with lead-tainted water. In his letters to fellow GOP lawmakers, Chaffetz cites \u201ca series of failures at all levels of government\u201d that \u201ccaused and then exacerbated the water crisis.\u201d While the Republican chairman signaled the apparent conclusion of the inquiry - Congress ended its two-year session last week - the panel\u2019s senior Democrat insisted the investigation should continue and accused Michigan\u2019s Republican governor of stonewalling the committee over documents related to the Flint water crisis. Some lead exposure victims facing new threat as adults Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, senior Democrat on the oversight panel, said he wants Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to produce key Flint-related documents within 30 days. Cummings said Snyder and his administration have obstructed the committee\u2019s investigation into the Flint crisis for a year, refusing to provide - or even search for - key documents. Snyder\u2019s intransigence has thwarted committee efforts to answer critical questions about what he knew as the crisis unfolded and why he didn\u2019t act sooner to fix Flint\u2019s water problem, Cummings said. \u201cRequiring Governor Snyder to finally comply with the committee\u2019s request will allow us to complete our investigation and offer concrete findings and recommendations to help prevent a catastrophe like this from happening again,\u201d Cummings wrote to Chaffetz. \u201cIn contrast, allowing Governor Snyder to flout the committee\u2019s authority will deny the people of Flint the answers they deserve.\u201d It\u2019s highly unlikely Republicans who control Congress will continue the inquiry next year. A spokeswoman for Snyder said the governor\u2019s office has provided the committee with hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and the committee has wrapped up its investigation. \u201cIn Michigan, we are working hard each day to continue Flint\u2019s full recovery with funding for pipe replacement and health care for residents,\u201d spokeswoman Anna Heaton said, adding that it is \u201cnot productive to spend time engaging in partisan political attacks from out-of-state politicians\u201d such as Cummings. Chaffetz addressed his letters to the chairmen of committees that oversee congressional spending and the EPA. He asked them to consider redirecting hundreds of millions of dollars now targeted to fighting climate change to upgrade the nation\u2019s drinking water pipes and other infrastructure. Chaffetz also asked for closer congressional oversight of the EPA, saying the agency has failed to update rules concerning lead and copper pipes nationwide. Aryele Bradford, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the oversight panel, called it \u201cinexplicable\u201d that Chaffetz would \u201crush to close down this investigation.\u201d His action \u201cdoes a real disservice to the families of Flint who hoped they would get a fair shake from our committee,\u201d she said. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "St. Joseph, La., a town of about 1,100 people in northern Louisiana. Courtesy of Garrett Boyte hide caption toggle caption St. Joseph, La., a town of about 1,100 people in northern Louisiana. Courtesy of Garrett Boyte Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has declared a Public Health Emergency for the town of St. Joseph, after officials found water going to three buildings \u2014 one of them the town hall \u2014 was contaminated with lead or copper. The governor said state testing showed elevated levels of lead at a private residence as well as the town hall building, on Thursday. The tests also showed \"elevated levels of copper\" at two private homes. The governor's office issued a statement warning residents of St. Joseph, which is home to about 1,100 people , not to use tap water: \"The Town of St. Joseph has experienced water problems for years due to the poorly maintained and deteriorating water distribution system. Frequent breaks in the water distribution system provide a potential health risk because of the drop in water pressure. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Louisiana Department of Health recommends that residents use an alternative source of water for personal consumption, including making ice, brushing teeth or using it for food preparation and rinsing of foods.\" Article continues after sponsorship The state's emergency preparedness office said it will provide three liters of water per day to each person in town until the state and local governments come up with \"a more permanent source\" of water while the current distribution system is repaired. Beyond Flint: In The South, Another Water Crisis Has Been Unfolding For Years Residents of St. Joseph have been concerned about the town's water quality for years, in part because it often doesn't look clean. In February, resident Garrett Boyte told NPR , \"It's just a given fact that at some point during the week, you're going to have brown or yellow water.\" Louisiana state health officer Jimmy Guidry told NPR in February, \"Like most small water systems, when you don't have many customers, it's very expensive and it's not affordable.\" He continued: \"It could take years. It's the kind of thing, which if you don't maintain it along the way, you're going to have to take care of it when it gets in trouble, and now it's in serious trouble. And it's going to be very costly to take care of those issues.\" \"What's happening here in St. Joseph got the attention it's gotten because Flint has made water a public issue,\" Boyte said, referring to the water crisis in Flint, Mich., where corrosive river water leached lead from pipes that delivered the supply to homes. This week marked one year since Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declared a state of emergency . Unfiltered tap water in the city is still not safe to drink. A Year Later, Unfiltered Flint Tap Water Is Still Unsafe To Drink On Friday, a federal appeals court ruled the Michigan government must continue to provide bottled water to Flint residents who do not have adequate water filters, after the state argued the water quality had improved to the point where it was no longer necessary, according to The Associated Press. Last week, Congress finally approved $170 million in aid to Flint, Steve Carmody of Michigan Public Radio reported , but \"city officials say they'll need tens of millions more to replace all of the city's lead pipes. The state says about 600 pipes have been replaced this year; at that rate it would take half a century to replace more than 30,000 suspect lines.\" ",

President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) Christi Parsons and Brian Bennett Contact Reporters President Obama publicly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of involvement in cyberattacks aimed at the U.S. election and leveled a threat on Friday \u2014 that the U.S. would retaliate, perhaps in ways no one but the Russians would see. Obama said that he had\u00a0\u201cgreat confidence\" in the assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russians had\u00a0carried out computer\u00a0hacks aimed at the Democratic National Committee and senior aides to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , and that the operation had been approved at \u201cthe highest levels\u201d in Moscow. \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,\" he added, saying\u00a0that the Russians needed to understand that \u201cwe can do stuff to you.\u201d (Nina Agrawal) U.S. counter-strikes would come \u201cin a thoughtful, methodical way\u201d and would be felt by the Russians, Obama said. \u201cSome of it, we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will.\u201d Obama\u2019s statement came as CIA and FBI officials sought to rebut claims that the agencies were at odds in their assessment of Russia\u2019s role in the attacks. In a message to CIA employees, the agency\u2019s director, John Brennan , said that\u00a0a \"strong consensus\" existed\u00a0among U.S. intelligence services that\u00a0Russia\u00a0orchestrated hacks and that the online leaks were designed at least in part to help Donald Trump win the White House. FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. agreed with that assessment, Brennan wrote. He had met separately with both of them, Brennan added,\u00a0and \u201cthere is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election .\u201d The message was confirmed by a U.S. official after it was\u00a0first reported by the Washington Post. Pat McCrory on Friday signed a hastily passed bill designed to strip power from the incoming Democratic governor and his party. A second bill with similar intentions now awaits McCrory\u2019s signature. ... Defying protesters and legal threats from his successor, North Carolina\u2019s outgoing Republican Gov. Pat McCrory on Friday signed a hastily passed bill designed to strip power from the incoming Democratic governor and his party. A second bill with similar intentions now awaits McCrory\u2019s signature. ... (Matt Pearce) A second U.S. official said the\u00a0FBI concurred with intelligence agencies that the Russian government had orchestrated the cyberattacks, which disclosed emails from the files of\u00a0the Democratic National Committee as well as Clinton\u00a0campaign Chairman\u00a0 John Podesta and other top Democrats. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing and\u00a0portions of it are classified. Although FBI agents have not determined Russia's motive with certainty, they can tell the hacks targeted Democrats and benefited Trump. Whether the Russians were trying to help\u00a0elect Trump, sow confusion in the electoral process,\u00a0undermine an\u00a0eventual Clinton presidency or achieve a combination of those outcomes remains unclear to\u00a0agents, the second official said.\u00a0 Russian officials have denied involvement in the hacking and have said\u00a0the U.S. should show more proof or let the subject drop. Trump has repeatedly denied that anyone knows whether Russia was behind the leaked emails and has mocked\u00a0the CIA's assessment that top Russian officials intervened to help him get elected. In the face of those denials, Obama, who has directed U.S. intelligence agencies to complete a thorough review of the Russian actions before he leaves office, said his administration would disclose at least some of the evidence to the public. But, he warned, much of it would have to remain secret. \u201cWe will provide evidence that we can safely provide, that does not compromise sources and methods,\u201d he said. He added:\u00a0\u201cWhen you are talking about cybersecurity, a lot of it is classified, and we're not going to provide it because the way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know.\u201d Obama\u2019s final scheduled\u00a0news conference of the year \u2014\u00a0an unusually long 90-minute affair that was interrupted briefly while the White House doctor attended to a reporter who had fainted \u2014\u00a0revealed a deepening preoccupation with Putin and Russia in the waning days of his presidency. Asked\u00a0about Trump\u2019s dealings with China and Taiwan since the\u00a0election, Obama cautioned the president-elect\u00a0not to wade too deeply into foreign policy too soon. Obama said he had told Trump that \u201cbefore he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place\u201d and \u201cfully briefed\u201d so they \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d And he repeated that the blame\u00a0for the carnage in Aleppo, Syria, where thousands more civilians were killed or displaced in the last week, should fall on the Syrian government and its Russian allies. But it was the Russian interference in the campaign and the partisan debate surrounding it that clearly was on the president\u2019s mind. In an interview with National Public Radio that aired earlier in the day, Obama said that\u00a0the leaks from Democratic emails had \u201ccontributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time, were Hillary's emails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC.\u201d\u00a0 He returned to that theme repeatedly during the news conference. His intense focus on the topic suggested widespread worry among Western allies about a rising threat from Russia, as well as his own concern that Trump and the Republican Party lack the proper skepticism of the Russian leader. Displaying\u00a0a partisan tone that he had avoided in other remarks since the election, Obama sharply criticized\u00a0Republicans who have spoken admiringly of Putin and who have tried to deny or minimize\u00a0Russia\u2019s interference in the election. He cited a recent YouGov poll that showed 37% of Republicans now approve of Putin. \u201cOver a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd how did that happen? It happened in part because for too long, everything that happens in this town, everything that's said, is seen through the lens of \u2018does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats or relative to President Obama.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Russia, he said,\u00a0can\u2019t \u201csignificantly weaken us. They are a smaller country; they are a weaker country. Their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don't innovate.\u201d But, he said, the U.S. could weaken itself through excessive partisanship and mutual mistrust. \u00a0 \u201cWhat I worry about more than anything,\u201d he added, is how \u201cyou start to see certain folks in the Republican Party and Republican voters suddenly finding a government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for as being OK, because that's how much we dislike Democrats.\u201d Obama denied that there had been much \u201csquabbling\u201d between the White House and Trump\u2019s aides on the topic, brushing off Trump\u2019s recent criticism of the White House press secretary as evidence that \u201cthe president-elect, you know, is still in transition mode.\u201d\u00a0 And as Marine helicopters circled the airspace above the White House\u00a0in preparation for his departure for two weeks of vacation in Hawaii, the president derided the idea that a systematic attack on Democratic computer systems could have happened without Putin\u2019s knowledge. \"This is a pretty hierarchical operation,\u201d he said of the Russian government. \u201cLast I checked, there\u2019s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation, particularly when it comes to policies directed at the United States.\" \"I will confirm that this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government,\u201d Obama went on. \u201cAnd I will let you make that determination as to whether there are high-level Russian officials who go off rogue and decide to tamper with the U.S. election process without Vladimir Putin knowing about it.\" Times staff writer Del Quentin Wilber contributed to this report.

The Army also instituted a new procedure that prompts the review of the security clearances of top brass to be triggered by investigations of misconduct, Fanning said Friday. The new approach to clearances, which grant troops and civilians access to national security secrets, stems from a USA TODAY report on a senior officer fired from his job last spring but allowed to retain his clearance for several months. Lt. Gen. Edward Carbon will examine the recent spate of top officers felled by misdeeds, and, one, Maj. Gen. John Rossi, who killed himself, Fanning said. \u201cThis has hit the general officer corps pretty hard,\u201d Fanning said of the suicide. Fanning stressed that the overall number complaints lodged against the Army\u2019s top officers and\u00a0senior civilians has remained relatively low, and dipped in the most recent reporting period, fiscal year 2016, which ended on Sept. 30. The vast majority of that group of about 560 senior officials perform their duties honorably, he said. Maj. Gen. David Haight \u00a0(Photo: Army) Data do, however, show what Fanning referred to as \u201can uptick\u201d in extramarital affairs and other misbehavior. An internal Army report found that \u201cmost concerning is that seven allegations of sexual misconduct, inappropriate relationships and sexual harassment were substantiated in FY16. This constituted a significant increase from the two allegations involving sexual misconduct that were substantiated in FY15. These types of cases have a significant negative impact on the Army and its image.\u201d The Army has been rocked several high-profile cases of top officers felled by extramarital affairs, carousing and suicide. Among the findings of investigators: Maj. Gen. David Haight, the \u201cswinging general,\u201d had an 11-year affair and led a \u201cswinger lifestyle\u201d; Maj. Gen. Ron Lewis, who had been the three-star adviser to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, frequented strip clubs, got drunk in public and had improper interactions with women; Rossi took his own life in July, just days before he was to be become a three-star general. Fanning speculated that the multiple combat tours over the last 15 years of soldiers like Haight, and their long absences from their families, may have contributed to their misconduct. \u201cWe want to have a better understanding of the impact that has on our senior officers, and look for ways that we can mitigate any causes or linkages that we see,\u201d Fanning said.

A plan to add one car pool and express toll lanes to Interstate 290 has been identified as the Illinois Department of Transportation 's preferred option for the roadway, officials announced. During an advisory group meeting Wednesday at the Carleton Hotel in Oak Park , IDOT officials provided an... (Steve Schering) Harmening told Hickey in an Aug. 11 letter that Emergency Traffic Patrol management had implemented controls to prevent fraudulent reporting by drivers and that all drivers had been retrained. Emergency Traffic Patrol officers are supposed to assist stranded drivers on state highways. Officers may need to change tires, provide emergency gas or jump-start batteries. Shealey had been investigated by IDOT auditors for filing false reports and was suspended for 10 days in 2012. The inspector general's office then began a probe to see if there were other problems in the unit. The investigation also found drivers leaving their jobs for long periods while they were supposed to be on duty. Shealey, for example, was found to be off work for more than three hours on June 17, 2013, and more than five hours on June 18, 2013. Instead of working, he was found to be in restaurants or gas stations or parked on side streets, the report found. Another driver was found to have repeatedly passed motorists on the side of the road but filed false reports claiming he was giving help. A supervisor who was fired, Zenon McHugh, admitted to investigators that he had heard \"shop talk\" among drivers about falsifying assist reports but had not inquired about them. McHugh also told investigators, \"If no one is looking, it's not a problem,\" the inspector general's office reported. McHugh could not be reached for comment. But IDOT later issued a statement: \"The inspector general investigation was ongoing when the new administration arrived. Once we had the results, the Illinois Department of Transportation began to take immediate action and worked independently to institute several changes to ensure that this never happens again, including firings, suspensions and establishing new protocols to hold employees to the highest possible standards. Our top priority always will be the safety of the traveling public. We will implement other changes as necessary to keep that commitment.\" In 2014, all but two of the drivers cited in the investigation and all but one of the supervisors made more than $100,000 annually, the report said.

On Thursday, she said that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended \u201cto undermine our democracy.\u201d Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended \u201cto undermine our democracy\u201d and were ordered by Vladimir V. Putin \u201cbecause he has a personal beef against me.\u201d Speaking to a group of donors in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Putin, the Russian president, had never forgiven her for the accusation she made in 2011, when she was secretary of state, that parliamentary elections his country held that year were rigged. \u201cPutin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. It is the first time Mrs. Clinton has publicly addressed the impact of the hacks since the intelligence community concluded that they were specifically aimed at harming her campaign. \u201cMake no mistake, as the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the group, which collectively poured roughly $1 billion into her effort. \u201cThis is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\u201d The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. In her remarks, she endorsed the proposal of a bipartisan group of senators to investigate the hacking and said the inquiry should be modeled on the commission set up after the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cThe public deserves to know exactly what happened, and why, in order for us to prevent future attacks on our systems, including our electoral system,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mrs. Clinton said the hacking was one of two \u201cunprecedented\u201d events that led to her defeat. The other was the release of a letter by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director , shortly before the election disclosing new questions about emails handled by her private server. The letter, she said, cost her close races in several battleground states. \u201cSwing-state voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the F.B.I. letter from Director Comey,\u201d she said. Mrs. Clinton first talked about the impact of Mr. Comey\u2019s letters in a conference call with donors a few days after the election. Since the election she has kept a low profile, mostly appearing on social media in photographs by passers-by who have spotted her walking her dogs near her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. ",

    "text": "By Reena Flores CBS News December 16, 2016, 1:10 PM Hillary Clinton talks election loss, Vladimir Putin's \"personal beef\" with her Email In a discussion with donors Thursday night, Hillary Clinton attributed her general election loss to the \u201cunprecedented\u201d events of Russian cyber interference and a\u00a0 letter written by FBI Director James Comey \u00a0to Congress. The cyber attacks -- which U.S. intelligence sources believe were\u00a0 approved by Vladimir Putin -- were the result of a \u201cpersonal beef\u201d the Russian leader had with her, Clinton told the gathering of fundraisers, who had given a total of about $1 billion to her campaign. She attributed the Russian president\u2019s vendetta to her harsh criticism of the country\u2019s 2011 parliamentary elections, which she called \u201cso flawed, so illegitimate that it was embarrassing.\u201d \u201cPutin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,\u201d she said, according to audio obtained by the New York Times. \u201cHe is determined to score a point against me which he did. But also undermine our democracy.\u201d U.S. investigators believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to damage Hillary Clinton and inject doubt and chaos into the election pr... That Putin\u2019s grudge against Clinton led to Russia\u2019s involvement in the U.S. elections was a theory espoused earlier this week by some like Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d McFaul was asked about why Putin would champion Donald Trump over Clinton. \u201cLet\u2019s remember that Vladimir Putin thinks she interfered in his election -- the parliamentary election in December 2011 -- and has said as much publicly, and I\u2019ve heard him talk about it privately,\u201d he said Sunday. Clinton, in her talk with donors, hammered home that the cyber hacks were \u201cnot just an attack against me and my campaign.\u201d \u201cThis is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here,\u201d Clinton said, before calling for a \u201crobust\u201d investigation by Congress into the hacks similar to the commission investigating the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. \u201cThis is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\u201d Clinton also attributed her defeat in battleground states to the 11th-hour letter sent by FBI Director James Comey to lawmakers, where he once again raised the specter of finding more emails from her private server, months after the agency concluded their investigation and just days before the general election. Citing political analyst Nate Silver and his interpretation of available data, she said \u201cswing state voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me because of the FBI letter from Director Comey.\u201d \u201cNate Silver believes - I happen to believe this - that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome,\u201d said Clinton, who has remained largely out of the public eye since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8. Clinton\u2019s remarks come just as the Obama administration has pledged to take action against Russia for the hacking attacks. \u201cI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections , that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing,\u201d President Obama told NPR in an interview Thursday, responding to a question about whether it was necessary for Russia to pay a price for interfering in the election. \u201cSome of it may be...explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Pat McCrory has signed a measure limiting the powers of his soon-to-be Democratic successor, Roy Cooper, a move critics are calling an unprecedented power grab orchestrated by the state's Republican-controlled legislature. The bill McCrory signed on Friday merges the State Board of Elections and State Ethics Commission into one entity comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans. Previous state law would have allowed Cooper to put a majority of Democrats on the board, which sets the rules for the state's notoriously burdensome balloting .

Protesters packed the halls of the General Assembly Friday as lawmakers voted on another bill that would require Senate confirmation for cabinet appointments. The state Senate voted to approve that measure Friday afternoon, sending it back to the state House for final consideration. At least 16 people were arrested Friday, according to General Assembly police. The series of measures were introduced in a surprise move Wednesday during a special session ostensibly called by the General Assembly to consider relief for Hurricane Matthew victims. Lawmakers did indeed approve a $201 million aid package earlier in the day, but then moved onto the legislation aimed at curbing the power of Cooper, who beat Republican McCrory last month by about 10,000 votes. McCrory did not concede until last week -- a full month after voters cast their ballots -- following numerous failed attempts to lodge complaints about the election results. No evidence of widespread voting fraud ever came to light. In his first national television interview since winning the gubernatorial contest, Cooper told MSNBC's Chuck Todd Thursday that the legislature's action was a \"partisan power grab that goes far beyond political power.\" Play ",

(Chris Seward/The News & Observer via AP) 0 Shares Email Nearly a month after Election Day , North Carolina Republicans appeared to finally accept Democrats' narrow win in the contentious governor's race. As it turns out, they weren't done fighting. In a surprise special session in the dying days of the old administration, some say, the Republican-dominated legislature has thrown the government into total disarray, introducing bills aimed at emasculating incoming Gov. Roy Cooper's administration. Cooper, the current attorney general, has threatened to sue. And many in the state are accusing Republicans of letting sour grapes over losing the governor's mansion turn into a legislative coup that flies in the face of voters. \"I believe fervently in democracy. I'm watching it be undermined ... by people who seem unwilling to consider or to listen,\" said Margaret Toman, who was among hundreds of protesters rallying inside the Legislative Building this week, demanding that Republicans leave Cooper's authority alone. The protesters were so loud that Senate and House cleared the galleries, and more than a dozen people were arrested. There were at least 16 new arrests Friday as the House resumed its debate. Protesters chanted \"all political power comes from the people.\" More than 150 demonstrators remained behind in the rotunda of the Legislative Building. Republicans are considering scaling back the number of political appointees Cooper can make and require the Senate's approval for top administrators at state agencies. They also are talking about erasing the governor's ability to shape elections boards statewide. Republicans insist the legislation is simply adjusting the constitutional powers already granted to the General Assembly. They've said many of the provisions had been debated for years but always got set aside. \"There's probably no better time than to deal with it in the present,\" said Republican Rep. Bert Jones. Democrats said it was a GOP power grab occurring a week after Republican incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory conceded a race he lost by just over 10,000 votes. \"It is done in a blatant political move by a party that must be afraid of the voters so they have to hold onto the power that they have,\" said Democratic Rep. Graig Meyer. Rep. Billy Richardson, also a Democrat, agreed, expressing disappointment at the legislature's quick-footed actions during the special session. \"I really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\" Richardson said. Whatever bills get final approval, likely to come Friday, will head to the governor's desk, but it's unclear what would happen next. McCrory, who hasn't commented publicly, could veto or sign the bills, or they could become law without his signature \u2014 and before Cooper takes office Jan. 1. Republicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities. Two former North Carolina governors \u2014 Republican Jim Martin and Democrat Jim Hunt \u2014 said this week that the legislation goes too far. Cooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans' agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights. \"If I believe that laws passed by the legislature hurt working families and are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,\" Cooper said. Republicans pointed to past sessions of the General Assembly, when it was dominated by Democrats. Democrats stripped the powers of the first and only GOP lieutenant governor of the 20th Century in the late 1980s. But Democrats said there's been no such widespread effort to limit the power of an incoming executive before he took office. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Animal rights activists have unleashed their anger at Texas A&M University, where they say a professor\u2019s experiments on golden retrievers amount to animal cruelty. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) claims Dr. Joseph Kornegay, who works in the school\u2019s Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, is conducting \u201ccruel, useless experiments\u201d on the dogs. The tests involve muscular dystrophy research that PETA says could be carried out without using live canines. \"Three decades of painful experiments on generations of debilitated and suffering golden retrievers have failed to result in a cure or even a treatment that can reverse the course of muscular dystrophy in humans,\" said Dr. Alka Chandna, PETA's senior laboratory oversight specialist. \"PETA is calling for an immediate end to these cruel, useless experiments.\" Those claims were amplified in a letter PETA\u2019s Dr. Emily Trunnell wrote to college President Michael Young that asked the college to instead conduct tests with what they call \u201cmodern, non-animal, human-relevant studies.\u201d In the letter, PETA cited Kornegay\u2019s own research saying researchers stretch muscles of the dogs with levers to induce mechanical damage, and that some dogs experience a shift in their hind limbs and an inability to open their mouths or jaws. The letter also accuses the college\u2019s program of specifically breeding dogs with muscular dystrophy, and calls for an end to that practice. PETA is demanding that the dogs now in the lab be made available for adoption. Kornegay acknowledged the practice, but said there aren\u2019t enough client-owned dogs with the disease for research. He said similar methods are used for dogs with other diseases like hemophilia or retinal diseases. \u201cThere\u2019s not another way,\u201d said Kornegay. \u201cI\u2019m a dog lover, I\u2019m a veterinarian, I\u2019ve had dogs all my life. So every time we have a research project we want to be as sure as we can that the research will be valuable because the dogs are valuable. Not financially valuable, but valuable as individuals\u201d Along with the letter, PETA released a video which they claim was taken undercover inside the Texas A&M laboratory. The video also shows dogs in similar conditions at a lab in France. The footage shows dogs in metal cages, which appear weak as they struggle to eat. Some can be seen salivating excessively, which PETA says is a symptom of the dog\u2019s swollen tongues and weak jaws. Kornegay confirmed that part of the video was shot at a Texas A&M facility, but said based on the dogs in the video, it must be about three years old. He said the facility is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and also noted dogs in the video were wagging their tails, walking up to the person taking the video and doing \u201cwhat dogs do.\u201d \u201cThe suggestion that these dogs are being depicted through the video in a way that they\u2019re being abused or the care for them is not appropriate is just untrue, to be kind. It couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth,\u201d said Kornegay. Kornegay has written more than 30 publications about his research on muscular dystrophy in dogs, including a 2013 article titled \u201cComparative Genomics of X-linked Muscular Dystrophies: The Golden Retriever Model.\u201d \u00a0\u201cToday, dogs are providing valuable information toward understanding and treating human diseases, making the phrase \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d more appropriate than ever,\u201d wrote Kornegay. Kornegay also wrote that dogs can better predict the potential success of treatments for humans compared to other animals like mice. He told Fox News he believes in the importance of his research. \u201cI\u2019ve had to come to terms with what I\u2019ve spent over 30 years doing and the value of that,\u201d said Kornegay. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the research is valuable, it\u2019s important and that progress is being made.\u201d Ray Bogan is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in El Paso, Texas.

But the brutality, Obama contended, could not have been fully dealt with without U.S. troops on the ground and full-scale U.S. involvement. \"Unless we were all in and ready to take over Syria, we were going to have problems\u2026It was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,\" Obama said. Despite that, Obama said he feels a responsibility for the brutal violence that has been captured by both journalists and on social media. \"I always feel responsible...There are places around the world where horrible things are happening and because of my office, because I am the president, I feel responsible,\" Obama said. Trump's arrival to the White House could prompt a major shift in U.S. policy towards Assad and his ally, Russia. \"I don't like Assad at all,\" Trump said during a presidential debate in October. \"But Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS.\" Obama acknowledged it's good for an incoming president to view U.S. foreign policy with \"fresh eyes,\" but that he needs to take a \"systematic, deliberate\" approach to dealing with America's alliances around the world. Trump angered Chinese leaders by holding a call with the Taiwanese president that bucked the well-established \"One China\" policy that does not acknowledge Taiwan as own government. \"Their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant. That doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past, it doesn't mean that you got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in,\" Obama said.

Tax records show the family of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave thousands of dollars to this and other settlements. A photograph from October shows part of the Jewish settlement of Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. Tax records show the family of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave thousands of dollars to this and other settlements. (AP) Tracy Wilkinson and Joshua Mitnick Contact Reporter Here in the desert hills of the\u00a0West Bank, near\u00a0the Palestinians\u2019 principal city of\u00a0Ramallah, a group of Orthodox Jews has\u00a0built the town of Beit El, a place\u00a0that most of the world considers an illegal\u00a0settlement constructed on\u00a0occupied Palestinian land. For decades, U.S. policy has opposed such settlements as harmful to the peace process. But the\u00a0Israeli\u00a0settlers now have some well-placed American supporters. Funds\u00a0to help construct Beit El came\u00a0partly from a U.S.-based foundation run by President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner , and the Kushner\u00a0family. And David Friedman, Trump\u2019s long-time real estate lawyer who was named Thursday as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel, served as the president of the American Friends of Beit El foundation. His name is on a girls\u2019 school in the settlement in tribute to his support. The amounts given by the Kushners were small; $5,000 here, $10,000 there, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. But they constitute another piece in the puzzle of how\u00a0the\u00a0Trump administration will approach one of the Middle East\u2019s most\u00a0intractable conflicts. There are growing signs that\u00a0Trump is poised to upend\u00a0decades of U.S. foreign policy on dealing with Israelis and Palestinians,\u00a0giving Israel a freer hand to build settlements\u00a0and relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Debate over Russian hacking heats up; Obama promises retaliation Dec. 16, 2016, 12:52 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration: President Obama says the U.S. will retaliate against Russia , but actions may be secret Some Jewish groups... (Tracy Wilkinson) Several of Trump\u2019s advisers have said they do not regard settlements as illegitimate or obstacles to peace. Unlike President Obama , who pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to temporarily freeze some settlement construction on land seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, Trump appears less likely to pressure Israel to constrain its building. \u201cI think it is safe to say that we will see diminished American efforts to promote traditional diplomacy, traditional critique of Israeli settlement activity or the need to resume some peace process with the Palestinians,\u201d said Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. At the same time, Trump said in an interview with the New York Times that he would \u201clove\u201d to be the president who finally made peace between Israel and the Palestinians; he has said it would be the \u201cultimate deal.\u201d Trump even went so far as to say Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, might serve as a special envoy to the Middle East to work on Israeli-Palestinian issues \u2014 a prospect many consider preposterous given the younger Kushner\u2019s lack of diplomatic experience and because he would be seen as biased in favor of Israel. Trump has also said he would move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something almost no country in the world has done because Jerusalem is disputed. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians claim it, or part of it, as their capital, and the U.S. position for decades has been that its status must be resolved through negotiations. Past U.S. presidents\u00a0made similar pledges about relocating the U.S. embassy. But upon taking office, all concluded such a step would not only provoke Palestinians, but also unsettle Arab allies throughout the region. After his appointment was announced,\u00a0Friedman stated he looked forward to forging the U.S. bond with Israel \"from the U.S. embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem.\u201d Friedman also has voiced opposition to\u00a0the so-called two-state solution, the existence of an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side by side in peace, which has been\u00a0the basis of U.S. policy since the 1950s\u00a0and the framework for peace negotiations in that part of the world.\u00a0At a Jerusalem election rally shortly before the U.S. election, he vowed that a Trump administration would never pressure Israel to accept a Palestinian state. Such assertions explain why several U.S. Jewish groups reacted negatively to Friedman\u2019s selection.\u00a0Friedman\u2019s positions on the two-state solution \"foreclose on the possibility of advancing,\" Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, said in an interview. By abandoning the two-state solution, \u201cthey\u2019re saying they are not bound by the last 25 years\u201d of history,\u00a0said Michael Koplow, policy director of the Israel\u00a0Policy Forum, a liberal think tank that focuses on Israel. Dennis Ross, veteran diplomat who served as Middle East envoy in Republican and Democratic administrations, cautioned that Trump will not be able to write\u00a0off\u00a0the Palestinians altogether if a real resolution is to come about. \u201cThe first thing is you have to restore a sense of possibility,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThere is no sense of possibility on either side now.\u201d Violence between Israelis and Palestinians has diminished since the end of the last major uprising more than a decade ago. But both\u00a0sides worry that any major shifts in the\u00a0status quo, such as the relocation of the U.S. embassy, a\u00a0marked increase in settlement construction or a move by Israel to annex West Bank territory, could trigger renewed Palestinian protests or terror attacks. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat\u00a0warned Trump against upsetting the fragile status quo, which was achieved through previous rounds of negotiations. \u201cThese are issues agreed to in an American-sponsored, international-sponsored\u00a0peace process \u2026 and no one should take any decisions which may preempt or prejudge, because this will be the destruction of the peace process as a whole.\u201d Successive Israeli governments, and especially that of the hawkish Netanyahu,\u00a0have allowed a vast network of settlements to develop throughout the West Bank and in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem. More than half a million Jewish Israelis now live in settlements, according to Israeli government figures. Few issues anger Palestinians\u00a0more than settlements, which they see as crisscrossing the land they claim as their state and making territorial continuity of their future state impossible. Past U.S. presidents \u2014\u00a0both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have criticized settlement expansion, with especially pointed words coming recently from Obama, who famously does not get along with Netanyahu, in part because of the landmark deal to curtail Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear armament. Netanyahu argues that Iran cannot be trusted and poses a major threat to Israel. Despite the criticism, the United States in September agreed to a $38-billion, 10-year package of military assistance to Israel, the largest single pledge of security aid in U.S. history.\u00a0 Israeli settlers are hoping to make inroads during the Trump administration.\u00a0At Beit El,\u00a0Baruch Gordon, a fundraiser for the settlement, described\u00a0Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father,\u00a0as a \"very good friend\" of the settlement and one of its top supporters. \"Charlie and his wife are wonderful people,'' he said. He said he had not met Jared. On a recent\u00a0Friday\u00a0before Shabbat, yeshiva students poured over religious texts inside a brand new study hall, a beit midrash. It and its small campus were erected with contributions from the\u00a0U.S. foundation, American\u00a0Friends of Beit El Yeshiva Center,\u00a0which lists the Charles Kushner as a founding trustee of its annual fundraising gala.\u00a0 Through its own U.S. charity, Beit El is one of several Jewish settlements that has received money from the Kushner Foundation in recent years, according to IRS\u00a0filings.

In his final press conference of 2016, the president also blamed Russia, Iran and Syrian President Bashar Assad for the ongoing violence in the city at the center of a grinding civil war. \u201cThe world shall not be fooled, and the world will not forget,\u201d Obama said. Obama spoke in the White House press briefing room and faced questions of a variety of topics including allegations of Russian hacking in the U.S. election. The president pushed back on statements he was letting Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cget away with\u201d hacking the U.S. election. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of squabbling,\u201d Obama told reporters. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve said is the facts.\u201d Obama was asked how the U.S. might respond to cyberattacks related to the election that the U.S. intelligence community has blamed on Russia. President-elect Donald Trump has rejected that assessment while accusing the Obama administration of trying to delegitimize his election victory. Obama began his press conference by touting his achievements from his time in office, noting that the unemployment rate has decreased and higher rates of insured people under his healthcare overhaul. Obama said he was leaving the country \"stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started.\" But he's reminding the public that there's more to be done on the country's biggest problems. He says he's going to continue working to push the agenda of his administration after leaving office. Following Friday\u2019s press conference, Obama will depart for his annual family vacation in Hawaii. \u00a0 Advertisement ",

Matt Rourke/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Hillary Clinton spoke at a private event Thursday night. Pictured here, the Democratic presidential candidate walks off the stage after speaking in New York on Nov. 9. Matt Rourke/AP Hillary Clinton has kept a low profile since losing the election to Donald Trump, but at a private event before donors Thursday night, she blamed her loss, in part, on \"some unprecedented factors\" \u2014 namely Russian hacking and the letter about the investigation into her email server released by FBI Director James Comey days before the election. \"Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me,\" Clinton said, per audio obtained by The New York Times . The event, for campaign donors, was closed to the press. In the remarks, Clinton ties the \"beef\" to the country's parliamentary elections in 2011, which as secretary of state, Clinton said were \"unfair, not free, illegitimate.\" Obama On Russian Hacking: 'We Need To Take Action. And We Will' Around the time of those elections, Russian citizens took to the streets to protest Putin's power grab. \"Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people,\" Clinton said. \"And that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election.\" These were Clinton's most extensive remarks to date about the Russian hacking, how it may have related to her electoral loss and the origins of what NBC termed as Putin's \"vendetta\" against Clinton. Clinton has previously blamed the FBI, in part, for her loss. Her campaign staff also has talked about the FBI's role in the election earlier this month at a conference at Harvard's Institute of Politics examining the election results . Clinton's team blamed FBI Director James Comey's two letters in the final days of the campaign as well as Russian-linked hacking of the Democratic National Committee and campaign Chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Family Tried To Auction Coffee With Ivanka, Raising Ethical Concerns The argument, one which Clinton repeated last night, is that voters who were undecided until the end broke for Trump because of the Comey letter and the swirling controversy linked to daily WikiLeaks posts of internal campaign emails. In a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday night, Podesta argued the FBI's priorities were off, given that the agency apparently put more emphasis on investigating Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state than Russian interference in the U.S. election. \"Comparing the FBI's massive response to the overblown email scandal with the seemingly lackadaisical response to the very real Russian plot to subvert a national election shows that something is deeply broken at the FBI,\" Podesta wrote. Clinton herself attempted to argue that it was bigger than herself, saying she was pleased to see a bipartisan group of senators calling for an investigation into the hacking. \"This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here,\" Clinton said. \"This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\" President-elect Trump, however, continues to downplay the significance of the hacking, questioning whether it really was Russia: Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2016 The Senate Intelligence Committee released a statement, describing how it plans to proceed with its investigation into the hacking, and the intelligence community's conclusion that it was directed by people at the highest levels of the Russian government. \"Majority Leader McConnell and incoming Minority Leader Schumer have made it clear they expect any review of Russia's involvement in our nation's elections to be conducted in a bipartisan manner,\" the intelligence committee's statement reads. \"It is a charge the [committee] takes seriously.\" MAILBAG: Could 'Faithless Electors' Keep Donald Trump Out Of The White House? The statement also says the committee will carry out the investigation expeditiously, \"but we will take the time to get it right and will not be influenced by uninformed discourse.\" Some hearings will be public, but much of the work will be conducted behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of the committee's work. As for the results of the election, some Democratic Party donors who spoke to Politico questioned whether the focus from Clinton's team on Comey and Russia is productive, saying a full postmortem of what went wrong in the campaign is still needed.

    "text": "President Obama Says Hillary Clinton Was Not 'Treated Fairly' During Presidential Election By MaryAlice Parks Dec 16, 2016, 6:41 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Obama Addresses Alleged Russian Interference in Election 0 Shares Email President Obama said today that he did not think Hillary Clinton was \u201ctreated fairly\u201d during the presidential election. Obama was asked specifically during a news conference whether his former secretary of state lost because of Russia\u2019s reported hacking of the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign computer servers. The president pivoted on that question, and instead lobbed a critique of the media. He said he found the coverage of Clinton \u201ctroubling.\u201d \u201cI think she's worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and I don't think she was treated fairly during the election, I think the coverage of her -- and the issues -- was troubling,\u201d he said. Clinton and her campaign in recent days have also expressed disappointment with news outlets' focus on her private email server during the campaign over Russia\u2019s involvement in the data breaches. Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta , called the coverage of the Russia story \u201clackadaisical,\u201d and Clinton last night reportedly told donors in New York that she was glad the press was catching onto the issue. Looking ahead, President Obama said that perhaps he can give \u201ccounsel and advice\u201d to the Democratic Party. \u201cThe question is how do we rebuild that party as a whole so that there's not a county in any state -- I don't care how red -- where we don't have a presence and we're not making the argument because I think we have the better argument,\u201d he said of the Democratic Party. He added that he would have liked to have helped more to build a national and successful party but struggled to contribute more time because of his primary responsibilities at the White House. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014The FBI is now backing the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russian hackers sought in part to tilt the election in favor of President-elect Donald Trump when they breached American political institutions resulting in the theft of a trove of sensitive communications, a U.S. official said Friday. President Obama, meanwhile, indicated Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin must have been aware of the cyber attacks. \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,\" Obama told reporters Friday. \"This happened at the highest levels of the Russian government.'' Obama said he was awaiting a complete review of the matter by intelligence and and national security officials before he leaves office next month. Read more: Obama threatens retaliation against Russia for election hacking The FBI's support of the CIA's assessment, according to the official familiar with the bureau's position but not authorized to comment publicly,\u00a0comes after FBI Director James Comey and National Intelligence Director James Clapper had meetings with CIA Director John Brennan earlier this week to review the agency's conclusion. The FBI had indicated as recently as Monday that the CIA\u2019s assessment \u2014 delivered earlier this month to some members of Congress \u2014 may prove accurate but lacked the definitive evidence necessary for the agency to reach such a conclusion. That changed, the official said, after the high-level meetings resulted in a consensus on Russia\u2019s motive, a conclusion that so far has been flatly rejected by Trump and has roiled the capital\u2019s political establishment. The Washington Postfirst reported the development Friday. Russia, which has dismissed the CIA\u2019s findings, was publicly identified in October as having breached the systems of the Democratic National Committee, resulting in theft of a trove of sensitive communications. Those communications were later provided to WikiLeaks and DCLeaks, which published the information in the months and weeks leading up to the general election. The leaks prompted the resignation of Democratic\u00a0National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the eve of the party's national convention in July. The leaks also led supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders to protest that the Democratic primaries were rigged against him. At the time Russia was publicly identified, Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson concluded that the disclosures were \"intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.'' The FBI had stopped short of endorsing the CIA's new assessment that Russia was hoping to boost Trump, the official said, because it had been considering how much weight to ascribe to multiple possible motives: Was Russia attempting to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's ability to govern, betting that she would be elected? Was it retaliation against Clinton for her past criticism of Russian elections? Was it intended to undermine confidence in the American political system? Or was it a combination of all? The official said the bureau continued to weigh those and other options. But in the end, the collective effect of the Russian action was to assist Trump. Read more: ",
