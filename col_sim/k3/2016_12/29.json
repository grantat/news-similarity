    "text": "Trump announces 8,000 more jobs for American workers Published               December 28, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday the addition of roughly 8,000 new jobs for Americans, including 5,000 that telecommunications giant Sprint will bring from \u201call around the world.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re coming back to the United States, which is a nice change,\u201d he said. Trump, who takes office January 20, said the other 3,000 jobs will be hires from a new company called One Web. Trump was elected in part on the promise to return to the United States jobs that American companies had moved overseas, in search of cheaper labor costs. Last month, he announced that Carrier would keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, after months of criticizing the air-conditioning corporation on the campaign trail for plans to move the jobs to Mexico. Trump spoke Wednesday from his Mar a Largo estate in Palm Beach, Florida. The wealthy businessman-turned politician also said he had a \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cgeneral\u201d conversation earlier in the day with outgoing President Obama. Trump opposed the Obama administration\u2019s move last week to allow the United Nations to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building more settlements in the disputed West Bank. He said Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s speech earlier Wednesday defending the administration\u2019s U.N. decision \u201cspoke for itself.\u201d Trump, who in recent days has been especially critical of the U.N., also said that the international body \u201chas tremendous potential but is not living up to itself.\u201d Trump added he had help on the jobs deals from several people including Massayoshi Son, the chief executive officer for SoftBank of Japan, which owns Sprint. Trump has had previous business dealings with Son, whom he described on Wednesday as a \u201cterrific guy.\u201d \u00a0 ",

Reynolds was hospitalized after a call that she was having trouble breathing, two law enforcement sources familiar with the incident told NBC News. Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart confirmed an adult female was transported to Cedars Sinai Medical Center \"in fair to serious condition\" from an address associated with Reynolds' family. Actresses Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher pose in the press room at the 21st annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on January 25, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. Jason LaVeris / FilmMagic Reynolds, 84, shot to fame after her leading role playing Kathy Selden in \"Singin' in the Rain,\" starring alongside veterans Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, in 1952 when she was 19 years old. She made her film debut in 1950 in the musical \"The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady.\" Related: Carrie Fisher Mourned by Fellow Stars: 'Our Princess Has Passed Away' Her career spans nearly seven decades, and she has appeared in some of the most iconic films of the 20th century. She was the first wife pop star Eddie Fisher in 1955, who later divorced her to marry her best friend Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds and Fisher had two children together, Carrie and Todd. Carrie Fisher died Tuesday at age 60 after suffering a heart attack on a London to Los Angeles flight on Friday. Fans from around the world have mourned her death, and well-wishers set up a makeshift star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Fisher's half-sister, Joely, tweeted \"God speed mama\" and a photo of herself and Reynolds on Wednesday afternoon. Joely is the daughter of Eddie Fisher and actress actress Connie Stevens.

AP Donald Trump speaks in Iowa in November. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said telecommunications giant Sprint is moving 5,000 offshore jobs back to the United States and OneWeb, a satellite Internet start-up, is adding 3,000 more jobs in the U.S. The jobs were made possible, Trump said, through Softbank CEO\u00a0Masayoshi Son, a Japanese billionaire and technology investor, who met with Trump in New York earlier this month. After that meeting, the two businessmen announced Softbank would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs. Trump: SoftBank to add $50B, 50K jobs in U.S. Softbank owns 80% of Sprint and this month it invested $1 billion in OneWeb, a venture that intends to offer affordable Internet access. Son called the investment a \"first step\" in his commitment to Trump. \"Because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope, I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States and taking them from other countries,\" Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. \"They're bringing them back to the United States and Masa and some other people were very much involved in that so I want to thank them,\" Trump said. \"And OneWeb, a new company, is going to be hiring 3,000 people and that's very exciting.\" It is unclear where the 8,000 jobs will be based and if they are part of Softbank's 50,000 jobs plan. In his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to create or bring back jobs to the U.S. Earlier this month, he announced a controversial deal to keep furnace manufacturer Carrier from outsourcing about 1,100 jobs to Mexico. Carrier will get $7 million in state tax incentives to keep the jobs in Indiana. Son, who became a billionaire through investments in Japan and China, is in the midst of raising a $100 billion investment fund with\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0and others.

In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana. \u201cIt is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\u201d Heard said. \u201cNow we are seeing it quite frequently.\u201d Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don\u2019t know about CHS, and partly because patients don\u2019t want to admit to using a substance that\u2019s illegal. Recreational marijuana measures pass in four states CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use. That\u2019s what happened with Crowder, who has been off all forms of marijuana for seven months. \u201cNow all kinds of ambition has come back. I desire so much more in life and, at 37 years old, it\u2019s a little late to do it, but better now than never,\u201dhe said. CHS has only been recognized for about the past decade, and nobody knows exactly how many people suffer from it. But as more states move towards the legalization of marijuana, emergency room physicians like Dr. Heard are eager to make sure both doctors and patients have CHS on their radar. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Tweeting from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he's spending the holidays with his family, Trump wrote, \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!\" Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 Trump's tweet followed an interview in which Obama claimed that he would have won with his message of hope if he had faced off against Trump in the 2016 election. \"I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama said. Asked on a morning conference call to clarify the roadblocks to which Trump referred, his pick for White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said he would let Trump's tweets \"speak for themselves.\" Trump briefly emerged from Mar-a-Lago this afternoon and fielded a question from ABC News about whether the transition of power was going smoothly. \"I think very, very smoothly, very good,\" Trump said. \"You don't think so?\" The White House earlier this month notably defended a decision by the Energy Department not to comply with a request from the Trump transition team to provide names of employees who worked on the Obama administration's climate policy efforts. Obama has repeatedly committed to a peaceful and smooth transition of power, keeping with centuries of American tradition, and said that he will, despite his disagreements with Trump during the campaign, escort him to the Capitol and attend his inauguration on Jan. 20.

In an exclusive interview with NBC's Andrea Mitchell, Kerry said he would not get into a \"debate\" with Trump, but suggested U.S. allies have been \"affected\" by the president-elect's recent commentary on U.S.-Israeli relations and other sensitive foreign policy issues. RELATED: Kerry Warns Israel: Two-State Solution in 'Jeopardy' Trump's recent online rhetoric is widely seen as a break from the tradition of deference to the sitting president during a period of transition.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 In the interview, Kerry pushed back against allegations that the U.S. in any way orchestrated the United Nations' condemnation of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories with the four countries that put forward the resolution. \"Those four countries that ultimately brought it to the floor did so absolutely on their own,\" Kerry said. \"I had no communication with those four countries in the course of that process.\" He said the U.S. decision to abstain in the controversial vote was in line with American \"values\" and in support of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.

NEW CLASH WITH ISRAEL: KERRY RIPS 'SETTLER AGENDA' IN SPEECH DEFENDING UNITED NATIONS VOTE Netanyahu, speaking in Jerusalem just over an hour after Kerry\u2019s speech had ended, said Kerry's rhetoric was \"as unbalanced as the anti-Israel resolution passed [at the United Nations] last week.\" \"Secretary Kerry paid lip service to the unrelenting campaign of terror that has been waged by the Palestinians against the Jewish State,\" he said, later adding: \"Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders.\" WHITE HOUSE DENIES KERRY PLOTTED WITH PALESTINIANS BEFORE UNITED NATIONS VOTE Israeli officials have said since the Security Council resolution was passed on Friday that the U.S. played a covert role in developing the proposal -- charges the U.S. has denied.\u00a0Israel's government was enraged after the U.S. abstained from voting on the resolution, which called Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem a violation of international law.\u00a0 But Netanyahu on Wednesday made the firmest -- and most-high ranking -- accusation that America secretly worked toward advancing the resolution. \"We have it on absolutely incontestable evidence the U.S. organized, advanced and brought this resolution to the Security Council,\" said Netanyahu, who promised to share the \"sensitive\" intelligence with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump tweeted his support for Israel before Kerry even spoke, and Netanyahu quickly returned the goodwill on Twitter:\u00a0\"President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel!\" During his remarks, Netanyahu again looked past the Obama administration and addressed Trump. \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with the American Congress \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 to mitigate the damage this resolution has done and ultimately repeal it,\" he said. Netanyahu said that while he sought peace, his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, has walked away from peace offers \"time and time again.\" Earlier Wednesday, Kerry sparked the diplomatic showdown when he questioned Netanyahu's commitment to Palestinian statehood. Though Netanyahu has said he believes in the two-state solution, Kerry said Netanyahu\u2019s government is \u201cthe most right-wing in Israel's history.\u201d \u201cIf the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,\u201d Kerry said. Abbas in a statement \"reiterated his commitment to a just and lasting peace as a strategic option,\" saying Palestinians would resume negotiations\u00a0\"the minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities.\" Netanyahu\u2019s office, however, immediately slammed Kerry\u2019s speech as \"skewed against Israel\" and \"obsessively\" dealing with the issue of Israeli settlements. Netanyahu spoke shortly after the Israeli Attorney General\u2019s office approved a police probe of the prime minister in two separate cases, The Times of Israel reported, citing Channel 10. A Netanyahu spokesman had previously told Haaeretz the case was \"nonsense.\" Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also panned Kerry's speech. \"To coordinate anti-Israeli initiatives with the Palestinians at the U.N. and to advance a one-sided resolution against Israel in the Security Council is the opposite of supporting Israel,\" Danon said. \"The Obama Administration acted against Israel at the U.N. and any claim to the contrary is a distortion of reality.\" Almost immediately after Kerry\u2019s speech, Netanyahu posted to his Facebook page a 2008 image of Obama\u2019s visit to Israel alongside two captions: \u201c2008: Presidential candidate Barack Obama at the Western Wall; 2016: UN calls the Western Wall \u2018occupied Palestinian territory.\u2019\u201d \u201cSeriously?\u201d Netanyahu wrote.

As early as Thursday or Friday, a 2015 Obama executive order will be updated to announce the retaliatory steps, the officials said. The announced steps will likely include economic sanctions coordinated by the Treasury Department. Unannounced steps will be covert and will involve cyber option \u2014 although the U.S. has been very careful to try to avoid engaging Russia in an all-out cyber war, the officials said.

SUSPECT IN MURDER OF ACTRESS, YOGA TEACHER CHARGED IN 6 OTHER CRIMES IN 2016 Gary Love, of Wadsworth, Ohio, was held without bond.\u00a0Iredell County Sheriff Darren Campbell told local media the mother and daughter were violently assaulted in what he called a \"demonic\" crime. Deputies found the woman dead Monday morning after her daughter texted the friend for help.\u00a0The daughter told deputies she had been tied up since Christmas Eve. EX-STUDENT WHO FATHERED SON WITH TEACHER KILLED BOTH, POLICE SAY The friend told WSOC the kidnapped teen texted her \"to call 911, me and my mom need help fast.\" She was treated at a local hospital and is staying with relatives.\u00a0Authorities were awaiting autopsy results to determine how the mother died. Love, 47, told officers who came to check on the two that they were at a funeral, before he ran out the back door. He was arrested soon afterward. It's unclear if he has an attorney. Media outlets are not identifying the woman and daugher, as investigators say they expect to add sexual abuse charges. Love had been in North Carolina for several months, Campbell said. The suspect and the woman knew each other years ago when they lived in New York, according to a sheriff's office release. Local media outlets reported Love was wanted in Ohio for domestic violence and had a protection order against him. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

The Chicago skyline looms as a Metra train pulls into the Berwyn Metra station in Berwyn on Sept. 1, 2016. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Mary Wisniewski Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The year 2017 will see some changes in getting around the Chicago area by road and rail \u2014 higher Metra fares along with renovations that can cut delays; a completed Jane Addams Tollway but continued work on several highway interchanges and intersections like Western and Belmont avenues; and new laws intended to improve road safety. Public transit To start with, the commuter rail service Metra is increasing fares for the third time in three years, starting Feb. 1. Fares for its 150,000 daily commuters will increase by an average of 5.8 percent, or $11.75 for monthly passes and $2.75 for 10-ride passes. Metra Union Pacific North riders this spring will see the next phase of a project to replace bridges on Chicago's North Side, from Grace Street to Balmoral Avenue. As part of this two-year $30 million project, the new inbound half of the Ravenswood station will be built, spokesman Michael Gillis said. Metra and Union Pacific also plan to start a $118 million project to remove two bottlenecks along the UP West Line by installing a third set of tracks in the remaining double-track segments \u2014 a 1.8-mile segment from River Forest to Melrose Park, and a 6.1-mile segment from West Chicago to Geneva. Metra also will begin the $34 million construction of a new bridge on the Milwaukee West Line over the Fox River in Elgin. The single-track bridge, originally built in 1881, will be replaced by a two-track bridge. The CTA also has a number of projects and goals for 2017, spokeswoman Tammy Chase said. The $203 million Wilson Avenue station and track reconstruction should be done by the end of next year, agency officials said. Work should be completed in the middle of the year on the $75 million Washington/Wabash station. New Wilson station Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune The CTA's Wilson station, seen March 22, 2016, has been undergoing an upgrade. The CTA's Wilson station, seen March 22, 2016, has been undergoing an upgrade. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Work will continue on the $280 million 95th Street Red Line terminal, set for completion in 2018, the agency said. The CTA also plans to begin work on the $18 million Quincy Brown Line station renovation project and the $15 million Belmont Blue Line station upgrade, while completing a $23 million renovation at the Illinois Medical District. Future projects are in the works, with the CTA planning a final project alignment for the long-discussed Red Line extension from 95th Street to 130th, as well as doing planning for the Red and Purple Line modernization north of Belmont. The CTA also plans to issue a request for proposals to buy 20 to 30 all-electric buses. Pace riders will be able to take advantage of a managed flex lane on I-90 in mid-2017, which should allow buses to move faster from Elgin to Schaumburg and Rosemont. The suburban bus service also plans two park-and-rides at Barrington Road and Route 25. On the Tollway Some good news for 2017 is that the long, painful rebuilding of the Jane Addams Tollway wrapped up at the end of December, with four lanes open in each direction. Jane Addams Tollway James C. Svehla / Chicago Tribune The new lanes of the Jane Addams Tollway (I-90) are seen in Schaumburg on Nov. 18, 2016. The new lanes of the Jane Addams Tollway (I-90) are seen in Schaumburg on Nov. 18, 2016. (James C. Svehla / Chicago Tribune) Work should be completed next year on an eastbound exit ramp at I-90 and Barrington Road, and construction will continue on the Elmhurst Road interchange. The Illinois Tollway also has partnered with Cook County for a westbound I-90 entrance ramp at Roselle Road. Work continues on installing \"smart road\" features on a 16-mile segment of I-90 between Barrington and the Kennedy Expressway. The Illinois Tollway is installing high-tech gantries over the road every half mile intended to provide drivers with information about travel times, traffic incidents and lane closures \u2014 with directional arrows to show which lane is moving faster, said Greg Bedalov, the Illinois Tollway's executive director. \"We can give real-time information to the motoring public,\" said Bedalov, who noted that the Tollway will integrate its information with navigation apps like Mapquest and Waze. On other parts of the Tollway system, the authority plans to continue I-390's march east, with the goal of reaching Route 83 by the end of the year. This is part of the Tollway's plan to provide western access to O'Hare International Airport, Bedalov said. The work will include 17 ramps and 15 bridges, with new interchanges at Prospect Avenue/Arlington Heights Road and Wood Dale Road. \"It's absolutely critical as part of the Elgin-O'Hare western access project, which has been identified as a project of regional and national significance,\" Bedalov said. The extension will not go as far this year as the Canadian Pacific tracks to the west of the airport. The railroad refused the Tollway access over the tracks, and the Tollway responded in November by suing CP before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. In other Tollway news, work should be completed next year on the new Farnsworth Avenue interchange at I-88, a $20 million project near the Aurora outlet mall. Also next year, planning and design work will ratchet up for the rebuilding of I-294 from 95th Street to Balmoral Avenue, Bedalov said. IDOT and CDOT On Illinois freeways, the rebuilding of the outbound I-55 and Lake Shore Drive interchange should be done by this summer, and the inbound will be done by the fall, said Illinois Department of Transportation spokeswoman Gianna Urgo. The project costs $134 million. Work will proceed on the Cumberland flyover at I-90; on I-90 from Cumberland Avenue to Harlem Avenue; and on the Jane Byrne Interchange project, including I-290 from Racine Avenue to the Post Office, Urgo said. In DuPage County, work on Irving Park Road at York Road should be complete next year, Urgo said. In Lake County, work on the Milburn bypass at U.S. Highway 45 and on the Union Pacific railroad bridge over Route 132 in Gurnee will start this spring. In Will County, work on the U.S. Highway 6 and I-55 interchange will finish up in 2017, while reconstruction of U.S. Highway 6 from Cedar Road to Will-Cook Road starts next fall. In Chicago, the $25.6 million Adams Street Bridge rebuilding, which has clogged up traffic going in and out of downtown, is expected to be done by the spring, as should the $23.5 million reconfiguration of the Elston, Fullerton and Damen intersection, according to Mike Claffey, spokesman for the Chicago Department of Transportation. Belmont Avenue-Western Avenue viaduct Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Traffic on North Western Avenue in Chicago passes debris from the Belmont Avenue-Western Avenue viaduct demolition project on March 7, 2016. Traffic on North Western Avenue in Chicago passes debris from the Belmont Avenue-Western Avenue viaduct demolition project on March 7, 2016. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) The tricky $25.7 million reconfiguration of the Western/Belmont/Clybourn intersection will take a little longer and should wrap up by mid-2017, Claffey said. As some projects end, others begin. Reconstruction of the Oakwood Boulevard (39th Street) bridge over Metra and Canadian National railroad tracks is expected to start in mid-2017. Construction also will start next summer on the Riverview Bridge along the east side of the river under Addison Avenue, then crossing over to the west side of the river. It will provide bike and pedestrian access between Clark Park to the south and California Park to the north. Work also begins on the Irving Park Road Bridge, which will include a pedestrian/bike underpass on the west side of the river, connecting California Park on the south to Horner Park on the north. Speaking of bike and pedestrian projects, the next two phases of the Navy Pier flyover section of the Lakefront Trail will be completed in 2017, with sections over the Ogden Slip, DuSable Park the Chicago River. The project should be complete in 2018, Claffey said. New laws The new year also brings in new transportation laws. One law that takes effect Jan. 1 more clearly defines bicycles as vehicles on the streets of Illinois, with the same right-of-way-privileges and rights of motor vehicles. Another law requires Illinois drivers education teachers to tell student drivers how to handle themselves during a traffic stop by police. Failure to stop at a railroad crossing will cost you more. The fine will go up to $500 from $250 for a first violation and to $1,000 from $500 for a second violation. Of course, the ultimate price would be getting yourself and the others in your car killed. Jeffrey Kroll, an attorney who specializes in transportation-related injuries, said he hopes the higher railroad crossing fines will decrease crashes. But he sees distracted driving as the biggest problem on the roads right now and wants higher fines for that too. The top fine for using a hand-held mobile device while driving in Illinois is $150, which Kroll called \"nominal.\" \"If we want to avoid distracted driving, I think we want to hit motorists where it hurts most \u2014 in the pocketbook,\" he said. Finally, look for the city of Chicago to present a long-awaited, three-year \"Vision Zero\" plan to improve traffic safety, following a tough year for bike and pedestrian fatalities. Vision Zero is an international road safety project that aims for zero deaths and serious injuries from traffic crashes. Ten city departments are involved in the city's plan, including police, fire and the CTA. mwisniewski@chicagotribune.com ",

Pruitt's outspoken criticism of climate change and his close ties to the energy industry have raised concerns about his ability to lead the agency. Sue Ogrocki/AP Democratic senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee say Donald Trump's choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency should reveal his connections with energy insiders before his confirmation hearings get underway. In the letter dated Tuesday, the senators told Scott Pruitt, currently Oklahoma's attorney general, they were concerned about his close ties to energy lobbyists and wanted him to disclose lists of donors who contributed to a nonprofit organization that took funds from a network connected to the Koch brothers. Pruitt is an outspoken critic of climate change and has sued the Obama administration over the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The letter was signed by five Democrats plus independent Bernie Sanders. \"We have been troubled that as Attorney General of Oklahoma you used, nearly verbatim, industry talking points in official correspondence your office sent to EPA concerning EPA's estimation of methane pollution in your state,\" said the letter, signed by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Cory Booker, Ben Cardin and Sanders. \"What that conduct says about your ability to lead EPA in a manner that is not beholden to special or secret interests is a subject we expect will receive a full airing during your confirmation hearing,\" the letter continued.

    "text": "By Crimesider Staff AP December 28, 2016, 3:45 PM Video appears to show Fort Worth, Texas police shooting man as he walks away Dashboard camera video released by an attorney for David Collie appears to show a Fort Worth, Texas police officer shoot the 33-year-old as he\u2019s walking away from the officer. Email FORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 A police dashcam video appears to show a Texas officer shoot a black man as he\u2019s walking away from the officer and not posing any immediate threat. A lawyer for David Collie released a copy of the video showing the July encounter with a Fort Worth officer and a Tarrant County sheriff\u2019s deputy. The officer and deputy were off-duty at the time and working a security detail together at an apartment complex, attorney Nate Washington said Wednesday. He said Collie was shot in the back, leaving him paralyzed. Warning: The following video contains violent imagery. on YouTube Police at the time were searching for two shirtless black men who they believed had committed a robbery near a gas station, Washington said. Authorities said in a news release they issued at the time that Collie pulled a box cutter from his pocket and pointed it at the officers. Collie was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant but a grand jury declined to indict him. Fort Worth police did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment on the incident. Collie, 33, was walking from work to a friend\u2019s apartment when the officers approached him in the patrol vehicle, Washington said. It was the Fort Worth officer who shot Collie, Washington said, and the video appears to show the officer firing his weapon about 10 seconds after exiting the vehicle and as Collie walked away. The video was obtained about three weeks ago from the Tarrant County district attorney\u2019s office through an open-records request, Washington said. The attorney said he released the video Tuesday at a news conference at Collie\u2019s insistence because Collie was tired of comments made to his mother by people assuming he must have done something wrong. Washington said Collie wanted to make clear he \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything to threaten an officer.\u201d Release of the shooting video came just days after the Fort Worth police were in the spotlight over another incident. A cellphone video captured a white Fort Worth officer last week wrestling a black woman to the ground and then arresting her and her two daughters. The officer appeared to be argumentative and escalate the encounter with the woman, who had called police following an encounter between her son and a neighbor. The video has been viewed millions of times. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Secretary of State John Kerry's speech was a \"deep disappointment.\u201d embed Mr. Kerry usually speaks in the careful words of diplomacy, being careful not to publicly name names, or put choices in the harshest terms. He dropped most of those niceties on Wednesday, especially about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government. \u201cThe Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that policies of this government \u2014 which the prime minister himself just described as \u2018more committed to settlements than any in Israel\u2019s history\u2019 \u2014 are leading in the opposite direction, towards one state.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a remarkable moment in the American-Israeli relationship, and it was a remarkable moment for Mr. Kerry. With his presidential hopes dashed after his loss to George W. Bush in the 2004 election, Mr. Kerry saw his time as secretary of state as a chance to make a true change in the Middle East. In three weeks, his near-constant travels around the world will end and his energetic diplomacy will suddenly terminate. He has one major accomplishment under his belt \u2014 the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 but he could not achieve his goals on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, or in the Syrian civil war. Mr. Kerry cast himself as one of Israel\u2019s greatest friends, and cited a lifelong commitment to the country. But he said he had to \u201csave the two-state solution while there was still time.\u201d \u201cWe did not take this decision lightly,\u201d he said of the United Nations vote. For Mr. Kerry, the speech was also a rueful valedictory. As soon as he took over from Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in 2013, he plunged into the tar pit of Middle East peace negotiations with an enthusiasm neither his predecessor nor President Obama shared. The goal was a nine-month negotiation leading to a \u201cfinal status\u201d of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by the summer of 2014.

    "text": "Should Mr. Trump make good on such promises, he would take aim at not only his own brand, but his daughter\u2019s as well. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t stand to lose much. While his goods are largely manufactured overseas, most of his retail ventures have gone the way of Trump vodka and steaks. And what products can be found \u2014 at his hotels and golf courses and on Amazon sold by independent sellers \u2014 are the vestiges of a mostly defunct clothing line or sporadic shipments of Trump sweatshirts and hats. Ivanka Trump\u2019s company , by contrast, is the type of operation that Mr. Trump is squarely aiming for. Her shoes and dresses largely retail for less than $150. Coats cost as much as $400. Factored into those prices is the cost of materials and production, as well as shipping, tariffs, marketing and advertising expenses. Cheap production overseas means more coin in the coffers of Ms. Trump and the shoe, accessory and clothing makers that are her partners, among them Marc Fisher footwear, the G-III Apparel Group and Mondani. (Ms. Trump\u2019s company, which is privately held, does not disclose its financials.) Almost all of her goods are made overseas, according to a New York Times review of shipments compiled separately by Panjiva and ImportGenius , two trade databases. ImportGenius tallied 193 shipments for imported goods associated with Ms. Trump for the year through Dec. 5, mostly Chinese-made shoes and handbags. Her dresses and blouses are made in China, Indonesia and Vietnam, according to a review of hundreds of clothing tags and financial documents filed by G-III. It is the harsh reality of the clothing business. Before Ms. Trump started her shoe and clothing lines in the early 2010s, she did what any well-connected New Yorker would, consulting corporate chieftains, fashion designers and department store executives. She ultimately decided to license her name. Photo The Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry store in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan. Ms. Trump, whose public persona is at the heart of her brand, is already facing some blowback for her father\u2019s inflammatory comments about minorities and potential conflicts of interest. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times Since then, Ms. Trump, 35, has pondered making some items in-house. Investors were consulted, and a business plan was drawn up \u2014 but the project was scrapped, said one person briefed on the discussions. It was costly and impractical, so suppliers continued to make her clothes overseas. \u201cWhen I started my business, I recognized where my strengths were and knew that I didn\u2019t have any experience in production and manufacturing,\u201d Ms. Trump said in a rare interview.\u201cI am not a designer. I am an entrepreneur.\u201d In retail, where margins are slim, overseas manufacturers are crucial to profits. Most of the clothing Americans buy at Walmart, Macy\u2019s and Target are made abroad, including 97 percent of apparel and 98 percent of shoes, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is part of a long history of American garment manufacturers chasing cheap labor. They moved to China in the 1980s, then elsewhere in Asia. Now, Chinese shoemakers are building factories in Africa, where wages are about $40 a month, compared with $400 in China. Even then, an overseas strategy does not portend survival, as Mr. Trump\u2019s experience shows. At Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, the Trump Store is downstairs from the lobby, sandwiched between a restaurant and an ice cream parlor. While a $65 white polo golf shirt from Lesotho in southern Africa was available, there was no sign of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s other items, like the dress shirt made in Vietnam on display upstairs. Last year, Macy\u2019s dropped Mr. Trump\u2019s clothing line over inflammatory comments he made about Mexican immigrants. Now about the best place to find his ties, dress shirts and accessories is on Amazon.com \u2014 and even that stock is just a hodgepodge. The company that made Trump-branded comforters and sheets, Downlite, said it had ended its relationship with him last year. His beds, designed by Dorya, aren\u2019t in stores, either. They are made to order overseas, according to the company. Mr. Trump said in campaign interviews that he would like to make his apparel in the United States, but that it was hard to find companies that did. When George Stephanopoulos of ABC pressed him to explain, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThey don\u2019t even make the stuff here.\u201d That is not exactly true. B J Nickol, president of the All American Clothing Company, based in Arcanum, Ohio, said he employed 15 people, as well as subcontractors in about 20 states who cut, sew and ship shirts, jeans and sweaters. He estimated it cost All American $10 to $15 to manufacture a polo shirt, including fabric and labor. He sells them for about $28 to $38, or about half of what a polo shirt costs at Trump Tower. While the company mostly sells shirts to individuals, Mr. Nickol said he would welcome a big-time customer like Mr. Trump. Mr. Nickol said he had witnessed the impact on his community when apparel manufacturers moved away. \u201cAnd the only way we could think of to fix that was to keep jobs here,\u201d he said. Photo Ivanka Trump shoes largely retail for less than $150. Credit Danny Ghitis for The New York Times While large-scale clothing manufacturing is unlikely to return to the United States, specialty items or high-end apparel has promise. Todd Shelton, a fashion designer who makes sleek separates and sells them online, sews his clothes at a factory in East Rutherford, N.J. Advertisement But there are trade-offs, namely price. A pair of women\u2019s jeans made by Todd Shelton costs $200; an Oxford shirt is $180. And cost is only one factor. Fashion is another. Recently, Ms. Trump tried to make a flip-flop in the United States. She and one of her main partners, Marc Fisher, shopped a design to retailers, according to a person with knowledge of the venture. Buyers, though, didn\u2019t like the design \u2014 and it never got made. With the Ivanka Trump brand, another variable now comes into play: politics. Ms. Trump served as a more polished emissary of her father\u2019s messages during the campaign, and she is under pressure to bring jobs home. And in a postelection era, her carefully crafted public persona, which is at the heart of the brand, is at risk. Ms. Trump has found a way to commercialize female empowerment, selling petal pink sheaths and trendy shoes to young professionals on the go. Her brand\u2019s hashtag #womenwhowork often accompanies pitches to buy her satchels and clothes. \u201cShe wants to make sure her reputation is unblemished,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, a consumer behavior and retail analyst at the NPD Group, a research firm. Ms. Trump is already facing some blowback. She was criticized for meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan while completing a licensing deal with a company whose largest shareholder is wholly owned by the Japanese government. Consumers offended by her father\u2019s inflammatory comments about minorities continue to boycott her line. Ms. Trump acknowledged the potential appearance of conflicts as her father prepared to move into the White House. She said she would step down as the head of her namesake brand if asked to become an adviser to her father and the Trump administration. \u201cI would completely separate myself from my businesses,\u201d said Ms. Trump, who is also considering a leave of absence from the Trump Organization, where she serves as an executive vice president for development and acquisitions. Representatives for Mr. Trump declined to comment. But it will not drastically change her company\u2019s strategy. She and her team do not plan to move manufacturing back just to quell critics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s great to say we want to do all of this, but we want to make responsible business decisions, too,\u201d said Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand. \u201cFrom a business perspective, we have to have longevity.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 28, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: For the Trumps, \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 May Be a Tricky Label to Stitch.

By Robert Costa December 28 at 4:33 PM Follow @costareports President Ronald Reagan gives a thumbs-up sign to the crowd as his wife, first lady Nancy Reagan, waves from a limousine during the inaugural parade in D.C. on Jan. 20, 1981. (AP) President-elect Donald Trump privately told several visitors to his winter retreat in Florida on Wednesday that he is writing the first draft of his inaugural speech and is looking to presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy for inspiration, according to three people familiar with the conversation. Trump told them that Reagan\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d and Kennedy\u2019s articulation of grand national ambitions are central to how he thinks through his own speech, which will be given\u00a0Jan. 20,\u00a0the people said. And while Trump is working closely with Stephen Miller, his aide and speechwriter, on the text, he confided that in recent days he has become more personally involved in the writing process, the people said. The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversation. A Trump transition spokesperson was not available for comment. [ At Trump\u2019s inauguration, Franklin Graham, Cardinal Dolan and four more clergy members will pray ] Trump made his private\u00a0remarks during lunchtime at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., to presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, Bloomberg columnist Margaret Carlson, Democratic lobbyist Thomas Quinn and Newsmax Media chief executive Christopher Ruddy, who is a longtime friend of the president-elect. While the media and political personalities were dining together as Ruddy\u2019s guests, Trump \u2014 who has been at the property for most of late December \u2014 ventured over at various points during a two-hour period to speak with them, the people said. A\u00a0person familiar with Trump\u2019s comments said he is \u201cenamored with Reagan\u2019s confident style and how he connected with the country.\u201d \u201cHe went on and on about Reagan and how much he admires him. But it wasn\u2019t all about Reagan. He spoke about Kennedy and how he was able to get the country motivated, to go to the moon. He\u2019s thinking about both men as he starts to write the speech, which is something he\u2019s now taking the lead on,\u201d the person said. The person added that part of the draw to\u00a0Kennedy is that Trump knows that \u201cwhat\u00a0would have been Kennedy\u2019s 100th birthday will come only a few months after his inauguration next year.\u201d When reached Wednesday by phone, Brinkley, who is a professor at Rice University in Houston, declined to discuss Trump\u2019s framework for the inaugural address. But he confirmed that Trump spoke at length about history and asked questions about past inaugurations. \u201cWe talked about JFK and Reagan and about how William Henry Harrison caught pneumonia after giving too long of an inaugural speech,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cI was there as a presidential historian, telling stories and listening to his view of the presidency.\u201d Brinkley said he found Trump to be \u201crelaxed and utterly gracious\u201d and \u201cas happy to talk about NBA basketball as he was about history.\u201d \u201cIt reminded me a little of Nixon, who loved football,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I raised the fact that I was writing a book about Kennedy and the moon shot and NASA, he did talk about how he admires Kennedy in addition to Reagan. There was admiration for Reagan\u2019s style and for Kennedy,\u201d\u00a0Brinkley said. \u201cHe recognizes that he\u2019s entering a club,\u201d he continued. \u201cEven if he didn\u2019t spend a lifetime reading presidential biographies, he appreciates that he is\u00a0joining the\u00a0club and is learning more about its traditions.\u201d According to the people familiar with the conversation,\u00a0Trump also told the group that he was nearing decisions on the remaining slots in his cabinet \u2014 secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs\u00a0\u2014 but he did not disclose his list of finalists. A lighter moment came when Trump asked Brinkley about how presidents gave inaugural addresses before the invention of the microphone. Brinkley told Trump that presidents would have supporters whisper the speech through the crowd so that people in the back could know what was being said. Trump found the anecdote amusing. President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office during the 58th inauguration on Jan. 20. Here's a look at what we know about the planned inaugural activities and a look back at how the tradition has evolved. (Claritza Jimenez,Danielle Kunitz,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) \u00a0 ",

Carrie Fisher presents her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Life Achievement Award at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Jan. 25, 2015. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) RELATED: See the full Obituary for Reynolds here. Her death was announced several hours after she was rushed to Cedar-Sinai Medical Center from her son\u2019s home in Beverly Hills. A law enforcement source said Reynolds complained of breathing problems. Reynolds was one of Hollywood\u2019s top actresses and singers in the 1950s and 1960s, and a celebrity whose sometimes rocky personal life was chronicled by the media. She continued to act regularly into the 1990s. When Reynolds was young, she moved to Burbank with her family and quickly started performing in school plays and even with the town symphony. She won the Miss Burbank beauty contest at 16 and captured the attention of Warner Bros. and MGM . Reynolds signed with Warner Bros. but only managed to make 1950\u2019s \u201cThe Daughter of Rosie O\u2019Grady.\u201d She had better luck at MGM after she signed with the studio in 1950, causing a sensation in her short but memorable scene as the boop-oop-a-doop singer Helen Kane in the 1950 musical biopic \u201cThree Little Words.\u201d That same year she and Carleton Carpenter hit the charts with the song \u201cAba Daba Honeymoon\u201d from their film \u201cTwo Weeks With Love.\u201d Her stock in Hollywood rose when Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen cast her as the female lead in their 1952 musical classic \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Reynolds made several other musicals at the studio, including 1953\u2019s \u201cI Love Melvin\u201d and \u201cGive a Girl a Break.\u201d She got a chance at more dramatic fare with 1956\u2019s \u201cThe Catered Affair\u201d with Bette Davis.

One father, Victor Bloomingberg, explains why. DEC. 28, 2016 America\u2019s third-largest city is dangerous enough that more than a fifth of Chicago\u2019s 652 public schools have Safe Passage routes to help children travel safely. The routes were chosen in areas with some of the highest concentrations of violent crime, particularly on the West and South Sides. Safe Passage route Shooting or homicide in 2016 Lake south side About 1,300 workers dressed in neon-green vests stand within eyeshot of one another on 142 designated routes . According to the city, no child has ever been a victim of a serious incident while Safe Passage workers have been on duty. \u201cWe\u2019re those kids\u2019 parents from the time they\u2019re leaving home to the time they\u2019re getting to school, because those are our babies,\u201d said Lakita Pearson, a Safe Passage supervisor on the West Side. Workers are often hired from within the community so they can build relationships \u2014 even with the \u201cindividuals who pull triggers,\u201d said Autry Phillips, executive director of Target Area Development Corporation, which helps the city manage nine Safe Passage routes. \u201cThey understand that when they see those vests out there, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, look, this is the time kids are walking past here now; let\u2019s get it right,\u2019\u201d Mr. Phillips said. The Safe Passage program began in 2009 after a 16-year-old student, Derrion Albert, was beaten to death after leaving his high school on the South Side. The city expanded the program in 2013, increasing the number of the routes, but the program still has its limitations. There are vast sections of the city not covered by Safe Passage, and some parents say the workers are merely \u201ceyes and ears\u201d and can\u2019t really protect children from levels of violence that have become extraordinary. With more than 750 homicides in 2016 so far, the city has had its deadliest year since 1997.

By John Wagner December 28 at 4:05 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner President-elect Donald Trump answers questions from the media during transition team meetings at the Mar-a-Lago Club on Dec. 28. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) After having repeatedly praised President Obama\u2019s efforts to ensure a smooth transition, President-elect Donald Trump reversed course on Wednesday, accusing the current occupant of the Oval Office of putting \u201croadblocks\u201d in his way. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 9 a.m., saying he was \u201cdoing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.\u201d Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 \u201cThought it was going to be a smooth transition \u2014 NOT!\u201d the\u00a0Republican president-elect wrote. The White House\u00a0declined to comment on Trump's tweet and others that followed. President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump had kind words for each other in the aftermath of the election. Then things seemed to change after Christmas. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s assessment comes amid days of verbal sparring between the outgoing and incoming president. During a ceremony Tuesday marking the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, Obama cautioned against \u201cthe urge to turn inward\u201d and stressed a need to \u201cresist the urge to demonize those who are different\u201d \u2014\u00a0remarks some thought were aimed partly at Trump. Trump also made it clear Wednesday that he is perturbed by a number of steps the Obama administration is taking in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech that was planned Wednesday by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Middle East policy. We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but....... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,\u201d Trump wrote in another series of tweets. \u201cThey used to have a good friend in the U.S., but \u2026 not anymore.\u201d Trump said the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d was the \u201chorrible\u201d Iran nuclear deal reached last year that was supported by a coalition of world powers but vigorously opposed by Israel. Trump was also highly critical this week of the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \u201cStay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his inauguration date. During a conference call with reporters later Wednesday morning, transition spokesman Sean Spicer at first declined to elaborate on Trump's tweets, saying they \u201cspeak for themselves.\u201d He later said that Obama and his administration officials have been generous with their time during the transition process and helpful with \u201cmechanical\u201d issues. On Wednesday afternoon, during a brief appearance before reporters at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump was asked about whether he thinks the transition is going smoothly. \u201cOh, I think very, very smoothly,\u201d he replied. \u201cVery good. You don't think so?\u201d Trump also sounded more conciliatory later in the afternoon, when he told reporters that Obama had called him earlier in the day. \u201cHe\u00a0called me, we had a very nice conversation,\u201d Trump said, without offering much elaboration. Trump\u2019s view of his Democratic predecessor\u00a0soured earlier this week when Obama said on a podcast hosted by his former adviser, David Axelrod, that he thought he could have prevailed in an election over Trump. [ President Obama says he could have beaten Trump \u2014 Trump says \u2018NO WAY!\u2019 ] Those comments prompted two tweets in as many days from Trump contesting Obama\u2019s assessment. On Tuesday, Trump chided Obama for the failure of his campaign efforts on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to bear fruit. \u201cPresident Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states and lost,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cThe voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report. politics ",

Chief Warrant Officer 5 Glen Webb says names of the victims are being withheld until their relatives are notified. The helicopter was based at nearby Ellington Field. Witnesses said the aircraft broke apart in the air late Wednesday afternoon. Debris and a small oil slick were on the bay. A piece of the chopper's blade was found on land near the crash site. Divers were working into the night to retrieve the victims. The wheels of the helicopter poked above the water's surface about 25 yards from shore near a vacant cruise ship terminal. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Natalia Kolesnikova, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is preparing to penalize Russia over the hacking of Democratic officials during this year's presidential election\u00a0and could take action very soon, officials said Wednesday. Anticipating an imminent announcement,\u00a0Russia continued to deny the hacking allegations and condemned reports of new sanctions as \"provocation directed by the White House.\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters : \"To be honest, we are tired of lie about the 'Russian hackers,'\u00a0which is being poured down in the United States from the very top.\" President Obama told reporters earlier this month he would retaliate against the Russians\u00a0but noted that his actions may or may not be made public. \"Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you,\" the president said. The Obama administration and\u00a0U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of getting involved in the election in an effort to help Donald Trump win. Read more: Obama: 'We handled it the way it should have been handled\u2019 Trump has questioned whether Russia\u00a0was\u00a0behind\u00a0the hacking\u00a0of Democratic officials' email acounts, and he said Democrats are pushing the story in order to explain away Hillary Clinton's loss. Two Republican senators \u2014\u00a0Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and\u00a0John McCain of Arizona \u2014\u00a0said they support new sanctions on Russia, but they should be imposed by the next Congress and the incoming Trump administration. \u201cThe bottom line is you need to hit Russia in a sustained fashion,\" Graham told Fox News, \"so if Obama tries to do something going out the door that\u2019s not sustained, then you send the wrong signal.\" Graham\u00a0called for sanctions on Russia's energy sector\u00a0and said that Russia President Vladimir Putin should be singled out. McCain, also on Fox News, said: \u201cMake sure that Vladimir Putin knows that this kind of action in the future will be responded to, so far he\u2019s gotten away with whatever he has wanted to do. We need a firm policy.\" In a White House news conference earlier this month, Obama said the response to Russia should be done \"in a thoughtful, methodical way,\" predicting \"an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us.\" Posted!

    "text": "Nereida Moreno Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Sixty Cook County sheriff's deputies from the court services division are being investigated for allegedly lying about the number of hours they worked, an official with Sheriff Tom Dart 's office said Wednesday. The attendance fraud investigation began \"several months ago\" and will be resolved within the next six weeks, said Cara Smith, chief policy officer for Dart. The deputies being investigated are all salaried employees who receive paid overtime for working in county courthouses, courtrooms and security stations. The group includes supervisors. \"We're continuing with the investigation and will take appropriate action once it's concluded,\" Smith said. There have been at least five investigations into attendance-related fraud or irregularities in the past four years, including a recent probe into the fugitive task force of the central warrants division, Smith said. In September, five deputies from the fugitive task force were suspended without pay and one of those employees, a sergeant, has since resigned. The sheriff's office is seeking termination of the other four employees involved, Smith said. That incident, however, is unrelated to the current investigation in the courthouse division. ",

Pasadena Police Chief Phillip Sanchez, flanked by Special Agent in Charge Rob Savage of the U.S. Secret Service, left, and Pasadena Fire Chief Bertral Washington, speaks Wednesday at Pasadena City Hall ahead of the Rose Parade. (Maya Lau / Los Angeles Times) Maya Lau Contact Reporter Police plan to use\u00a0parked patrol cars and heavy, water-filled barricades at key crossings along the\u00a05.5-mile Tournament of Roses parade route in response to recent terrorist attacks that used\u00a0trucks as weapons. In announcing the new security measures on Wednesday,\u00a0Pasadena Police Chief Phillip L. Sanchez stressed there was no known threat to the parade, the Rose Bowl Game\u00a0or the city of Pasadena. But he said the changes were made in an abundance of caution, adding that parade security is frequently tweaked as terrorism tactics and threats evolve. The barriers will\u00a0be placed at more than 50 intersections along the route. \u201cWhen [attackers]\u00a0use vehicles as a ramming tool, typically it\u2019s because they\u2019re able to generate a lot of speed. So we\u2019re trying to take the speed out of that equation,\u201d Sanchez said. Twelve people died and dozens\u00a0more were hurt when a truck plowed into a Berlin market last week. A similar truck attack occurred in Nice, France, earlier in the year, killing 86\u00a0and injuring hundreds. Police and counterterrorism officials have been discussing ways to guard against truck attacks since the Nice attack. Officials have said the incident exposed vulnerabilities when large crowds gather in one area. The new measures in Pasadena were announced as police outlined the more typical security rules for the Jan. 1 parade: No drones. No selfie sticks. No umbrellas. The list of \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d has grown longer for those who plan to enter secure areas of the Rose Parade\u00a0and Rose Bowl this year, but officials say the security measures are crucial for an event that draws 700,000 people or more to the streets of Pasadena. (Gale Holland) Sanchez said the barricade plan already was in place before the Berlin attack earlier this month. Drivers should be aware of the barricades, and all visitors should allow extra time navigating to the events, Sanchez said. Since the Nice massacre, security officials have been discussing ways of preventing truck attacks. The Rose Parade, given its geographic size and the number of visitors, could pose greater challenges than protecting smaller venues or specific buildings. At high-level government facilities and even the Academy Awards in Hollywood, approaching vehicles must zigzag through series of barriers that prevent any vehicle from building up speed by driving directly down the road. Since Timothy McVeigh used a Ryder rental truck packed with ammonium\u00a0nitrate to attack\u00a0the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people, counterterrorism officials have run scenarios with trucks entering\u00a0downtown L.A. and\u00a0Los Angeles International Airport and being detonated. The heightened security measures in Pasadena, which also will include security checkpoints for ticketed parade patrons and walk-through metal detectors for those going to the game, underscore a \u201cnew normal\u201d for the public holiday celebration, Sanchez said. He urged people to be \u201cminimalists\u201d and leave their pets, firearms \u2014 even if licensed \u2014\u00a0and anything extraneous at home, even for those not entering protected zones. \u201cYou can see how serious we are about this event. We are well-prepared. Our efforts are well-refined. This is not new ground for us,\u201d he added. Sanchez said about 1,500 officers \u2014 including local police as well as Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies and agents from several federal law enforcement organizations \u2014 will be patrolling the area in uniform and in plainclothes. He added that many security measures \u201cwill be visible and obvious to the public, but many will not be.\u201d Officials are urging residents to use the public-safety mobile app Nixle and to text \u201cROSEPARADE\u201d to 888 777 to receive updates about events. Text-message technology can be helpful because it uses a different data channel than Web browsing on mobile devices, in case of an outage, Pasadena spokesman William H. Boyer said. A full list of security recommendations for the events can be found at the Tournament of Roses website .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caption Hypodermic needles and syringes washing up in Newport Beach Hypodermic needles and syringes\u00a0have been washing ashore in Newport Beach at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, an area that see a high degree of flotsam and jetsam following storms.

By Carol Morello and Ruth Eglash December 28 at 4:56 PM Follow @CMorelloWP Follow @reglash Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Wednesday harshly criticized Israeli settlements in the West Bank, saying their growth threatens to destroy the viability of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that the United States was obliged to allow passage of a U.N. resolution condemning the activity in order to preserve the possibility of peace. Kerry noted that the number of Israelis living in settlements has grown significantly and that their outposts are extending farther into the West Bank \u2014 \u201cin the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state.\u201d \u201cNo one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace,\u201d he said. Kerry, in the hour-long speech delivered at the State Department, also condemned Palestinian incitement to violence as a barrier to direct negotiations. But his focus was on defending the Obama administration\u2019s policies and highlighting Israel\u2019s actions at a moment of high tension between the two governments, following the passage of the U.N. resolution. [ Read the transcript of Kerry\u2019s speech ] (Reuters) \u201cRegrettably, some seem to believe that the U.S. friendship means the U.S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles \u2014 even after urging again and again that the policy must change,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect.\u201d He said the vote at the United Nations was about \u201cIsrael\u2019s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That\u2019s what we are trying to preserve, for our sake and for theirs.\u201d Saying the two-state solution was in \u201cserious jeopardy,\u201d Kerry said Israel would never improve its relations with Arab countries if it precludes the possibility of a separate state for Palestinians. \u201cIf the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot be both.\u201d Some Israeli politicians applauded Kerry\u2019s speech. Former prime minister Ehud Barak tweeted that it was a \u201cPowerful, lucid speech. World & majority in Israel think the same.\u201d But most Israeli leaders and the political right immediately took umbrage, accusing Kerry of trying to dictate policy to an elected government. \u00adIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the speech \u201ca big disappointment.\u201d (Reuters) \u201cHe deals obsessively with the settlements, he fails to deal with the Palestinian failure to recognize a Jewish state,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cIf he put the same emphasis on Palestinian incitement and terror that he did on settlements then maybe we will be on the way to peace.\u201d Kerry acknowledged that his vision is not shared by President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cPresident Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from the long-standing U.S. policies on settlements, Jerusalem \u2014 and possibly the two-state solution,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThat is for them to decide \u2014 that\u2019s how we work. But we cannot, in good conscience, do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away. This is a time to stand up for what is right.\u201d Trump has said that he will move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move freighted with political significance in advance of any settlement, and his nominee to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, has said Jewish settlements in the West Bank are legal. [ Trump picks a supporter of West Bank settlements for ambassador to Israel ] About two hours before Kerry started speaking, Trump tweeted his criticism of the Obama administration: \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but . . . not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d Netanyahu, in turn, promptly tweeted his gratitude: \u201cPresident-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel!\u201d Although he did not mention Netanyahu by name, Kerry addressed head-on the Israeli leader\u2019s assertions that the United States had \u201ccolluded\u201d in and \u201corchestrated\u201d last week\u2019s U.N. resolution affirming that settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has \u201cno legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution.\u201d Kerry denied that the United States drafted or promoted the resolution. But he acknowledged that the United States took part in preliminary discussions, as is routine. Kerry said the diplomats told other Security Council members they would oppose a resolution that did not condemn Palestinian incitement to violence. They also said if the text were more \u201cbalanced,\u201d it was \u201cpossible\u201d the United States would not block it. Kerry called the current Israeli governing coalition the most right-wing in country\u2019s history and said it is driven by an extremist settler agenda inimical to a two-state agreement. \u201cThe result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as \u2018more committed to settlements than any in Israel\u2019s history,\u2019 are leading in the opposite direction,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThey\u2019re leading towards one state.\u201d \u201cThe vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were standing up for.\u201d Kerry offered six principles that he said would satisfy Israeli security needs and Palestinian aspirations for a homeland. Most have been proven sticking points in previous negotiations \u2014 among them, Jerusalem as a mutual capital for two states; normalized relations with Arab states in the region; and financial compensation for Palestinian refugees, along with acknowledgment of their suffering. Kerry returned from vacation to give his speech, which was being worked on until a few minutes before he walked on stage in the Dean Acheson Auditorium. It was a sign that the administration was still struggling to deal with the political firestorm ignited by the resolution vote. The outrage in the Israeli government has been matched among some members of Congress. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Kerry\u2019s speech \u201cat best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration.\u201d The U.S. abstention has been condemned by several Democrats as well, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who is the party\u2019s incoming leader. But for Kerry it was a speech that captured the pent-up frustration that has grown in the two years since his nine-month effort to broker a peace agreement collapsed, and his attempts to tamp down Palestinian violence came to nothing. And Kerry, famous for always sounding a hopeful note, was clearly pessimistic about whether his words would make any difference. \u201cWe can only encourage them to take this path,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot walk down it for them.\u201d Eglash reported from Jerusalem.

Debbie Reynolds, who lit up the screen in \"Singin' in the Rain\" and other Hollywood classics despite a tumultuous life, has died a day after losing her daughter, Carrie Fisher. Reynolds was 84. Her son, Todd Fisher, said Reynolds died Wednesday. \"She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,\" Fisher said from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where his mother was taken by ambulance earlier Wednesday. He said the stress of his sister's death on Tuesday \"was too much\" for Reynolds. Carrie Fisher, who was 60, had been hospitalized since Friday. SAG Awards | 2015 Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times Carrie Fisher presents her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Life Achievement Award at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Jan. 25, 2015. Carrie Fisher presents her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Life Achievement Award at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Jan. 25, 2015. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) \"She said, 'I want to be with Carrie,'\" her son said. \"And then she was gone.\" Reynolds enjoyed the heights of show business success and endured the depths of personal tragedy. She lost one husband to Elizabeth Taylor and two other husbands plundered her for millions. Fisher, who found lasting fame as Princess Leia in \"Star Wars\" and struggled for much of her life with drug addiction and mental health problems, died after falling ill on a plane. Reaction to Reynolds' death was swift. \"Debbie Reynolds, a legend and my movie mom. I can't believe this happened one day after Carrie,\" Albert Brooks, who played opposite Reynolds in \"Mother,\" said on Twitter. \"I can't imagine what Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds' family are going through this week. I send all of my love,\" Ellen DeGeneres tweeted. (Tribune news services) Reynolds found superstardom early. After two minor roles at Warner Bros. and three supporting roles at MGM, she was cast alongside Gene Kelly in \"Singin' in the Rain.\" She was 19 with little dance experience, and she would be appearing with two of the screen's greatest dancers, Donald O'Connor and Kelly. \"Gene Kelly was hard on me, but I think he had to be,\" Reynolds, who more than held her own in the movie, said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. \"I had to learn everything in three to six months. Donald O'Connor had been dancing since he was three months old, Gene Kelly since he was 2 years old.\" The 1964 Meredith Willson musical \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,\" with Molly's defiant song \"I Ain't Down Yet,\" brought Reynolds her only Academy Award nomination. She also received a Tony nomination in 1973 for her starring role in the Broadway revival of \"Irene,\" in which her daughter also appeared. After her transition from starlet to star, Reynolds became popular with teenage girls and even more so when in 1955 she married Eddie Fisher, the pop singer whose fans were equally devoted. The couple made a movie together, \"Bundle of Joy,\" which seemed to mirror the 1956 birth of Carrie. The Fishers also had a son, Todd, named for Eddie's close friend and Taylor's husband, showman Mike Todd. Debbie Reynolds Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Debbie Reynolds photographed at her Los Angeles home on Jan. 15, 2012. Debbie Reynolds photographed at her Los Angeles home on Jan. 15, 2012. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) During this period, Reynolds had a No. 1 hit on the pop charts in 1957 with \"Tammy,\" the Oscar-nominated song from her film \"Tammy and the Bachelor.\" But the Cinderella story ended after Mike Todd died in a 1958 airplane crash. Fisher consoled the widow and soon announced he was leaving his wife and two children to marry Taylor. The celebrity world seemed to lose its mind. Taylor was assailed as a husband stealer, Fisher as a deserter. Reynolds won sympathy as the innocent victim, a role emphasized when she appeared before news cameras with diaper pins on her blouse. A cover headline in Photoplay magazine in late 1958 blared: \"Smiling through her tears, Debbie says: I'm still very much in love with Eddie.\" Fisher's singing career never recovered, but Reynolds' film career flourished. She starred with Glenn Ford in \"The Gazebo,\" Tony Curtis in \"The Rat Race,\" Fred Astaire in \"The Pleasure of His Company,\" Andy Griffith in \"The Second Time Around,\" with the all-star cast in \"How the West Was Won\" and Ricardo Montalban in \"The Singing Nun.\" She also provided the voice of Charlotte in the 1973 animated \"Charlotte's Web.\" But over the years, her marital woes continued. Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2016. In 1960 Reynolds married shoe magnate Harry Karl. The marriage ended in 1973 when she discovered that Karl, a compulsive gambler, had devastated her assets. Reynolds' third marriage, to Virginia businessman Richard Hamlett in 1984, proved equally disastrous. In 1992, against friends' advice, she paid $10 million to buy and convert a faded Las Vegas hotel into the Debbie Reynolds Hotel and Casino. She performed nightly and conducted tours of her movie memorabilia. Reynolds, who ended up filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and selling the property at auction the next year, accused Hamlett of making off with her money. \"All of my husbands have robbed me blind,\" she asserted in 1999. \"The only one who didn't take money was Eddie Fisher. He just didn't pay for the children.\" In her later years, Reynolds continued performing her show, traveling 40 weeks a year. She also appeared regularly on television, appearing as John Goodman's mother on \"Roseanne\" and a mom on \"Will & Grace.\" Her books included the memoirs \"Unsinkable\" and \"Make 'Em Laugh.\" In 1996 she won critical acclaim in the title role of Albert Brooks' movie \"Mother.\" Reynolds and her daughter were featured together in the HBO documentary \"Bright Lights,\" scheduled for release in 2017. Tribune archives: After nearly 4 decades, Debbie Reynolds still can pack a theater Open link Mary Frances Reynolds spent the first eight years of her life in Depression-era poverty in El Paso, Texas, where she was born on April 1, 1932. Her father, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad, was transferred to California and the family settled in Burbank, near Warner Bros. studio. The girl flourished, winning 48 Girl Scout merit badges, excelling in sports and playing French horn and bass viola in the Burbank Youth Symphony. Girlfriends persuaded her to enter the beauty contest for Miss Burbank, and she won over the judges. Eventually, she teamed up with Taylor \u2014 long since divorced from Fisher \u2014 and two other veterans, Joan Collins and MacLaine, for the 2001 TV movie \"These Old Broads.\" The script, co-written by Reynolds' daughter, was about aging, feuding actresses who get together for a reunion show. Reynolds would look back wryly on the Taylor affair, acknowledging that no man could have resisted her and that she actually voted for Taylor when she was up for best actress in 1960. The former romantic rivals had reconciled years before Taylor died in 2011; Reynolds recalled they had both been passengers on the Queen Elizabeth. \"I sent a note to her and she sent a note to me in passing, and then we had dinner together,\" she told The Huffington Post a few months after Taylor's death. \"She was married to Richard Burton by then. I had been remarried at that point. And we just said, 'Let's call it a day.' And we got smashed. And we had a great evening, and stayed friends since then.\" Reynolds received an honorary Oscar in 2015, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, but was too ill to attend the ceremony. Her granddaughter, actress Billie Lourd, accepted the statuette in her honor. \"I'm so sorry that I'm sick, but I am thrilled beyond words, shocked, and you couldn't be more amazed that a little girl from Burbank even came near this sort of accolade,\" she said in a pre-recorded statement. She was recognized for her decades-long commitment to various charities, including the mental-health organization she founded, the Thalians. Associated Press ",

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., on Wednesday. Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump and @realDonaldTrump are contradicting each other. Wednesday afternoon, Trump emerged from his Mar-a-Lago resort to tell reporters that he and President Obama had spoken on the phone and had \"a very nice conversation.\" \"I appreciate that he called me,\" Trump said. The comment came hours after Trump blasted Obama on Twitter. Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 But asked by reporters Wednesday afternoon how that transition was going, Trump said, \"I think very, very smoothly. Very good. You don't think so?\" (A \"not\" was not forthcoming in real life.) President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences The Obama tiff \u2014 or non-tiff, depending on which Trump you listen to \u2014 is the latest sign of a disparity between Trump's public statements and his social media statements. There's long been a serious personal rift between the two, but with Trump set to take the oath of office in less than a month, the stakes are higher . Presidents' words move markets and can create global tension. Take Trump's recent tweet about nuclear weapons , which quickly ricocheted around the world despite Trump aides' efforts to minimize the importance of the statement. On Wednesday Trump also highlighted a Japanese tech mogul's plans to create 8,000 new jobs in the U.S. Article continues after sponsorship Is Trump's Deal With Carrier A Form Of Crony Capitalism? Trump had previously appeared with Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower, to announce Son's promise to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs. Wednesday, Trump offered what appeared to be more specifics as part of that plan: 5,000 jobs that Sprint will bring back into the U.S. from overseas. Son's company, SoftBank, owns about 80 percent of Sprint. \"They're taking them from other countries. They're bringing them back to the United States,\" Trump said. In a statement on its website, Sprint said it \"anticipates these jobs will support a variety of functions across the organization, including its customer care and sales teams.\" But the jobs aren't finalized yet \u2014 the company said it will \"begin discussions immediately with its business partners\" and aims to fill the positions by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. \"We are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his Administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,\" Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement. \"We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans.\" The additional 3,000 jobs come from a $1 billion SoftBank investment in OneWeb, a Virginia company that will set up a factory in Florida to manufacture satellites to provide broadband Internet access. Trump said the jobs are being created \"because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope\" around his election. He had previously taken credit for the Carrier Corp.'s keeping hundreds of jobs in Indiana \u2014 which came with tax concessions from the state where Trump's incoming vice president, Mike Pence, currently serves as governor. Correction Dec. 28, 2016 An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the company named by Donald Trump as OneWorld. It is OneWeb. ",

A coalition of five Indian nations formally proposed the monument, attempting to preserve the area's archeological sites from looting and grave robbing. William Yardley Contact Reporter Further burnishing his environmental legacy, President Obama on Wednesday designated two new national monuments in rugged areas of Utah and Nevada \u2014\u00a0places that have deep cultural importance for Native Americans but that have become flashpoints in the debate over control of public land\u00a0in the West. The larger and perhaps more controversial of the two, the Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah, encompasses 1.35 million acres of desert and canyons that are ancestral lands of several Indian tribes, including the Navajo Nation, whose reservation is just to the south. Now, members of the Navajo, Hopi, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute, and Zuni tribes, all of which pushed for the designation, will serve on what the administration described as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d special commission that will advise the federal government on how to protect the area while also ensuring access so tribal members can collect traditional medicinal plants and perform tribal ceremonies.\u00a0 While both national monuments will be open for recreation, their designation means they will be better protected from development such as mining and oil and gas production. In the West, where half of the land is controlled by the federal government, many states and elected officials have long accused the government of putting up barriers to local economic development. Yet on Wednesday, Russell Begaye, the president of the Navajo Nation, invoked history older than any government, saying that the area had provided food and sanctuary to tribes for millennia. \u201cThese places \u2014 the rocks, the wind, the land \u2014 they are living, breathing things,\u201d Begaye said. (David Montero) The monument, which is directly south of Canyonlands National Park, is smaller than the 1.9 million acres the tribal groups had sought but larger than the 1.2 million acres that Utah\u2019s congressional delegation had proposed for protection under legislation that has stalled in Congress. Begaye said the tribal coalition was\u00a0elated\u00a0by the designation. \u201cThat area that we most want is fully covered by the 1.35 million,\u201d he said. Obama also designated the Gold Butte National Monument, 300,000 acres along Nevada\u2019s border with Arizona that is between Lake Mead, a crucial reservoir for the drought-stricken Colorado River, and the Grand Canyon. The administration said the\u00a0area holds important tribal sites as well as historic ranching structures and sites related to early Spanish settlements. It is near the ranch of Cliven Bundy, whose family led standoffs with the government in Nevada in 2014 and at Oregon\u2019s Malheur National Wildlife Refugue this year, protesting what it said were unfair federal land policies. The administration said Wednesday that both monument areas had been subject to\u00a0vandalism and that the designation would bring them greater protection. It also said the Gold Butte National Monument would improve \u201cclimate resilience\u201d by preserving corridors for wildlife to travel. (Nigel Duara) Obama said in a statement that the monuments would \u201cprotect some of our country\u2019s most important cultural treasures, including abundant rock art, archaeological sites, and lands considered sacred by Native American tribes\u201d and \u201censure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes.\u201d Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat and the departing minority leader, has long pushed for the Gold Butte designation.\u00a0On Wednesday, he\u00a0called Gold Butte \u201cquintessential Nevada,\u201d with landscapes \u201cunlike anything else in the world.\u201d Critics said the designations would stir further resentment among people angry about federal land\u00a0policy. About 65% of the land in Utah is owned by the federal government. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said the president\u2019s \u201cunilateral decision to invoke the Antiquities Act in Utah politicizes a long-simmering conflict\u201d and \u201cthreatens to further inflame controversies that were near resolution.\u201d Using executive power under the Antiquities Act of 1906, the president has designated more than two dozen national monuments, totaling more than 550 million acres, though the vast majority of that area is protected water. As they have with other conservation measures enacted at the end of his administration, the designations on Wednesday raised questions about whether his Republican successor, Donald Trump , may try to reverse them. Christy Goldfuss, managing director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, noted on Wednesday that no president had reversed a previous president\u2019s monument designation and that the act does not specify the authority to do so. Yet Goldfuss conceded that Congress, now under Republican control, has the power to change the law. Goldfuss noted that Bears Ears had been considered for protection since the 1930s. Despite that\u00a0history, Chaffetz called the designation a \u201cmidnight move.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with President-elect Trump to follow through on his commitment to repeal midnight regulations,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cWe will work to repeal this top-down decision and replace it with one that garners local support and creates a balanced, win-win solution.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caption Hypodermic needles and syringes washing up in Newport Beach Hypodermic needles and syringes\u00a0have been washing ashore in Newport Beach at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, an area that see a high degree of flotsam and jetsam following storms.

Roof, who appeared in a striped prison uniform, with his hands and feet shackled, confirmed today he still intends to represent himself, although U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel has said he does not support Roof's decision. Roof told Gergel he will make an opening statement. The government plans to call more than 30 witnesses \u2014 mostly survivors and victims' family members \u2014 to testify in the sentencing phase. Survivors Polly Sheppard and Felicia Sanders, who testified during the guilt phase, are expected to testify again. Opening statements are set to begin Jan. 3. The same jury that found him guilty will return to decide if he'll be sentenced to death. Charleston Church Shooting Survivor Recounts Watching Her Son Die at Dylann Roof Trial Roof, who is white, was convicted earlier this month of shooting and killing the parishioners at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. The 33 federal counts against Roof included hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death. Roof entered the church armed and \"with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,\" according to the federal indictment against him. The parishioners welcomed Roof into their Bible study group, according to the indictment, after which Roof drew his pistol and opened fire. In the defense's opening statements during the guilt phase of the trial, attorney David Bruck told the court, \"He did it ... You're probably wondering, so what we are doing here? Why does there need to be a trial? ... The practical reason is that the government has asked for the death penalty after conviction, and because of that, we have a procedure to go through. \"Our society does not order the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life,\" Bruck added. \"You're going to want to understand who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.\" Roof also faces a state trial, set for early next year, in which he may also face the death penalty. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Emily Schultheis CBS News December 28, 2016, 5:49 PM Donald Trump announces two companies will create new jobs in U.S. Last Updated Dec 28, 2016 8:02 PM EST President-elect Donald Trump announced two companies are adding thousands of additional U.S.-based jobs Wednesday evening. Speaking briefly with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump said that phone carrier Sprint will bring 5,000 jobs back from overseas. \u201cThey have taken them from other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are bringing them back to the United States.\u201d Sprint confirmed the announcement on its website, saying the jobs would be added by the end of fiscal 2017 and it would \u201c begin discussions immediately with its business partners, states and cities to determine the right locations in the U.S. to create these jobs.\u201d Details on what types of jobs would be added were not immediately available. See who President-elect Donald Trump wants in his inner circle at the White House \u201cWe are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his Administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,\u201d said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure in the press release. Mr. Trump said that another company, OneWeb, will hire 3,000 people in the U.S., which he called \u201cvery exciting.\u201d OneWeb is a satellite network aimed at providing affordable internet access. Mr. Trump said the deal \u201cwas done through\u201d SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a Japanese billionaire. The pair met in New York earlier this month, and announced together that SoftBank -- which is Sprint\u2019s largest shareholder and has invested in OneWeb -- would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and planned to create 50,000 jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether the 8,000 jobs announced Wednesday are included in that 50,000 figure. The 5,000 jobs at Sprint are part of that commitment but will be funded by the carrier, not Son, Bloomberg reported. OneWeb founder and executive chairman Greg Wyler said that a recent infusion of cash from Son allowed the company to accelerate its production process, resulting in 3,000 jobs added across its supply chain. OneWeb\u2019s own staff would rise from 200 to about 1,000, he said. Wyler credited Mr. Trump with persuading Son to increase SoftBank\u2019s investment in OneWeb, thereby speeding up the production process. He added that he was optimistic about an improved business climate in the U.S. under the new administration, including lower corporate tax rates and a simpler tax code. ",
