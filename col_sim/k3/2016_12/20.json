German media reported that the truck jumped the sidewalk and drove into the crowd around wooden stands at the market, which was set up around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Germany has not seen a large-scale terror attack, such as the ones earlier this year in Brussels and Nice, in southern France, but authorities have said that the country remains on alert. ",

    "text": "Email Associated Press photographer Burhan Ozbilici was attending a photo exhibition Monday when a Turkish policeman opened fire,\u00a0 killing Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey . He recounts how he captured the chaotic scene with his camera despite the lethal danger. \u00a0\u00a0 ANKARA, Turkey -- The event seemed routine, the opening of an exhibit of photographs of Russia. So when a man in a dark suit and tie pulled out a gun, I was stunned and thought it was a theatrical flourish. Instead, it was a coolly calculated assassination, unfolding in front of me and others who scrambled, terrified, for cover as the trim man with short hair gunned down the Russian ambassador. The gunshots, at least eight of them, were loud in the pristine art gallery. Pandemonium erupted. People screamed, hid behind columns and under tables and lay on the floor. I was afraid and confused, but found partial cover behind a wall and did my job: taking photographs. The exhibition, titled \u201cFrom Kaliningrad to Kamchatka, from the eyes of travelers\u201d featured photos from Russia\u2019s westernmost Baltic region to the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the east. I decided to attend simply because it was on my way home from the Ankara office. When I arrived, the speeches had already begun. After Russian Ambassador Andrey Karlov began to make his address, I moved closer to photograph him, thinking the pictures would come in useful for stories on Turkish-Russian relations.\u00a0 A gunman gestures near the body of Russian Amassador Andrei Karlov at a photo gallery in Ankara, Turkey, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici He was speaking softly and -- from what I could tell -- lovingly about his homeland, stopping occasionally to allow the translator to relay his words in Turkish. I remember thinking how calm and humble he seemed. Then came the gunshots in quick succession, and panic in the audience. The ambassador\u2019s body lay on the floor, just meters (yards) away from me. I couldn\u2019t see any blood around him; I think he may have been shot in the back.\u00a0 It took me a few seconds to realize what had happened: A man had died in front of me; a life had disappeared before my eyes. I moved back and to the left, while the gunman -- later identified as police officer Mevlut Mert Altintas -- gestured with his gun at people cowering on the right side of the room. At first, I couldn\u2019t figure out what had motivated the shooter. I thought he might be a Chechen militant. But people later said he was shouting about the Syrian city of Aleppo. So he was probably angry about Russian bombardments of Aleppo that were aimed at driving out anti-government rebels. Many civilians have been killed in the fighting. He also shouted \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d but I couldn\u2019t understand the rest of what he said in Arabic. The gunman was agitated. He walked around the ambassador\u2019s body, smashing some of the photos hanging on the wall.\u00a0 ",

    "text": "At least nine people were killed and dozens injured when a truck plowed through a crowd at a popular Christmas market in Berlin, police said Wenzel said the truck was registered in Poland, but that police were still investigating where it came from and who the driver is. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawki said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. Zurawki said that \u201cthey must have done something to my driver,\u201d he told TVN24. Berlin\u2019s top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and said that reports the truck may have been hijacked were \u201cpure speculation.\u201d\u00a0 5:22 p.m. ET -- The White House released a statement Monday evening about the truck plowing through the crowd at the Berlin Christmas market.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas Market in Berlin, Germany, which has killed and wounded dozens,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cWe send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded.\u201d 4:53 p.m. ET -- Berlin police are encouraging people to use a Facebook safety check to learn if loved ones are safe after a truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market.\u00a0 The tweet linked out to Facebook, which has set up checks periodically after natural disasters and attacks around the world.\u00a0 But police also asked people to refrain from spreading videos to protect privacy \u00a04:40 p.m. ET --\u00a0Germany\u2019s justice minister says that federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, are taking over the investigation after a truck rammed into a Christmas market in Berlin.\u00a0 Heiko Maas didn\u2019t give further details in a post on Twitter Monday night about the \u201cshocking news\u201d from the capital. He added: \u201cwe are mourning with the relatives\u201d of the victims. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere says that he\u2019s in constant touch with security authorities, but didn\u2019t give any indication in a statement whether they believe the incident was an attack. BERLIN - At least nine people were killed and dozens injured when\u00a0a truck plowed through a crowd at a popular Christmas market in Berlin late Monday, police said. Polizei Berlin said that a suspect had been arrested near the scene. A passenger in the truck died at the scene, although it\u2019s not clear how or when that happened yet. The identity of the passenger and arrested suspect have not been released. Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel told ZDF television that the suspect arrested was believed to be the truck driver. The incident happened in Breitscheidplatz, a major square in the center of the German capital, that is normally filled this time of year with people celebrating the holiday season.\u00a0 While officials haven\u2019t stated whether it was an purposeful attack or an accident, CBS News correspondent Charlie D\u2019Agata reports that witnesses said there was little doubt it was a deliberate attack based on the way it jumped the curb. \u00a0 Additionally, the incident happened just a few weeks after the U.S. State Department warned that various terrorist groups were going to be targeting outdoor markets and festivals this holiday season throughout Europe. A large Scania truck with its windshield smashed out could be seen on the sidewalk alongside the market, although officials have not yet confirmed that it was the truck used in the attack. \u00a0 A firefighter walks in front of a truck at the site of an accident at a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS Witness Shandana A. Durrani said she was walking and texting when the truck entered the market about 20 feet away. She said she heard some popping but wasn\u2019t sure if it was a gun or not. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t stopped to check my phone, I would have been hit,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cEveryone went scurrying. So many people hurt.\u201d She said the way the market was laid out, \u201cthere was just no place to run so a lot of us hid behind other stalls.\u201d Every year, the city of Berlin hosts a Christmas market there near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue. The incident happened at the foot of the landmark Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church, which was kept as a ruin after World War II.\u00a0 Paramedics work at the site of an accident at a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Several  people in the U.S. intelligence community told CBS News that the situation in Berlin has all the hallmarks of a terror attack. Officials here in the U.S. say it bears similarities to the recent terror attack in Nice, France \u00a0- in which 86 people were killed and hundreds injured - and is what terror groups have been calling for their followers to do. German police have recently rounded up a series of people for planning attacks on Christmas markets, and even detained last week a 12-year-old Iraqi boy for attempting to set off a nail bomb in one of them. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports the U.S. State Department issued a warning in late November specifically cautioning Americans in Europe to \u201cexercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets.\u201d The release cited ISIS, al Qaeda and \u201ctheir affiliates\u201d as planning attacks using \u201cconventional and non-conventional weapons\u201d focusing on the upcoming holiday season and \u201cassociated events.\u201d Many in Germany have been fearful of a rise in terrorism since the country took in more than a million migrants and refugees last year, mostly fleeing conflict in the Mideast.\u00a0 German prosecutors were already investigating a 12-year-old boy who allegedly attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen last week. A survivor of an accident with a Polish truck is rescued on a stretcher near a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch The German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources. In the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported. Police said it would have burned but would not have exploded. Stephan Meyer, the parliamentary spokesman on security issues for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said the boy apparently had turned rapidly to Islamic extremism. \u201cThis shows how quickly the radicalization of a young person, a child, can take place,\u201d he said. In the Nice attack, officials said Mohamed Lahouaiyej Bouhlel deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into thick crowds on the French Riviera celebrating the country\u2019s independence day. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

But Obama opted not to issue a warning that specific when he spoke to Putin about the hacking during a September meeting at the G-20 summit in China, said intelligence officials offering NBC News exclusive new details. The president didn't want to inflame an already tense situation, the officials said. Instead, he used less specific language to warn Putin of consequences if Russian interference didn't stop.

This time Obama used the phrase \"armed conflict.\" \"International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace,\" said part of a message sent over the Red Phone on Oct. 31, according to a senior U.S. official. \"We will hold Russia to those standards.\" Related: Why Obama Didn't Do More About Russian Hack The so-called \"Red Phone\" system is used to communicate in moments of crisis, such as the September 11, 2001 terror attacks or the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Formally known as the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center line, it is no longer a literal phone, and instead sends email messages and attachments. The Obama administration had never used the system before, officials said. Several intelligence officials told NBC News the use of the Red Phone communicated just how serious the situation had become. \"It's a dramatic step to pick that phone up and use it,\" said Ret. Adm. James Stavridis, the former head of NATO.

Having lost a close election, however, senior Democrats don't see the White House pushback against Putin as a success. The Russians had already stolen reams of emails and used them to embarrass Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Whether those revelations swung the election can never be known, but Democrats say they played a major role in an election decided by fewer than 80,000 votes spread across three states. Related: FBI Agrees With CIA Assessment That Russia Wanted Trump to Win Donna Brazile, a Democratic party official, has said publicly that attempted cyber intrusions of Democratic Party systems continued through Election Day \u2014 and that Democrats felt abandoned by the government. A senior intelligence official told NBC News the message ultimately sent to the Russians was \"muddled\" \u2014 with no bright line laid down and no clear warning given about the consequences. The Russian response, said the official, was non-committal. \"The Ultimate Red Line\" In a statement, a senior White House official confirmed that the Red Phone was used on Oct. 31 to send a message to Moscow. \"This action was part of our ongoing, rigorous efforts to press the Russian government to halt the actions of those responsible for these cyber attacks.\" The official declined to provide details of the message, however. Obama claimed success for his message to Putin at a news conference last Friday. \"I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequence if he didn't,\" said Obama. \"In fact, we didn't see further tampering of the election process.\" Stavridis, whom Hillary Clinton considered as a potential running mate, said he believed the U.S. response to the Russian hacks \"was insufficient to achieve the objective of ensuring that we do not receive further attacks. In other words, when someone tries to bully you, you have to push back or you invite further response.\" But he also said the word \"war\" has to be deployed \"extremely carefully.\" \"I think declaring something an act of war, let's face it, is the ultimate red line.\" William M.

(Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential electors in all 50 states are meeting Monday to officially cast their votes for Donald Trump as GOP electors are under intense pressure to oppose him. Electors in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania\u00a0voted during the morning and early afternoon and parceled out their state's votes with no rogue electors. Trump won Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Democrat Hillary Clinton carried Illinois and New Hampshire. \u00a0 Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there\u2019s little indication of a significant rebellion. The meetings, which occur\u00a0more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, is typically a formality. This year, the nation\u2019s 538 electors are in the spotlight as Trump critics mount a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state have been released throughout the day Monday. Read more: GOP electors targeted with $500K ad buy in final anti-Trump push Electors have received thousands of emails and phone calls\u00a0arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nation\u2019s history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls. Thousands of protesters have gathered outside state capitols throughout the country. \"Many Republican electors have told me they're open to sending the vote for President to the U.S. House of Representatives, which has happened twice in our nation's history,\u201d said Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who is not voting for Trump . \u201cFrankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,\" he said. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe. \u00a0 Yet, so far, Suprun is the only Republican to publicly say he\u2019ll vote against Trump. Opponents would need 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov.\u00a0John Kasich, has told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would kick to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which is unlikely to override their own party\u2019s president. Further, the\u00a0Republican National Committee\u00a0has been conducting a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump. Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump got 306 of the 538 electoral votes \u2014 the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a state\u2019s congressional delegation. Read more: A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote It\u2019s the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gore\u2019s loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadn\u2019t been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote. The coalition of outside groups, calling themselves the Hamilton Electors, ran $500,000 in television ads over the weekend featuring actors\u00a0including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing quoting from the Federalist Papers about the need for electors to exercise their conscience in casting their votes. Yet a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows 46% of voters say electors should be bound to vote for the candidate that won their state, to 34% who think electors shouldn\u2019t be bound if they have significant concerns about the winner. Trump himself took to Twitter on Sunday night to express his frustration, saying his supporters would be \u201cscorned and called terrible names\u201d if the situation was reversed. If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2016 The polls also show how significantly false information has spread as Trump recently declared that he won in \u201ca massive landslide victory.\u201d Half of Republicans think Trump won the popular vote, according to recent survey of 1,011 Americans conducted by Qualtrics. Trump lost the popular vote by a by a wider margin than any president in modern history .\u00a0Among Republicans without college education, the share was 60%. Posted!

    "text": "Electoral College Members Meeting Across the Country to Cast Votes By Meghan Keneally Dec 19, 2016, 12:56 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Presidential Electors to Cast Their Votes 0 Shares Email The 538 electors are meeting today to cast their votes in the last step of the presidential election . But what is usually a formality has taken on new significance this year with Donald Trump 's election and calls for electors to defect. In order to win the election, candidates need to reach 270 Electoral College votes. Trump reached that mark, garnering 306 electoral votes on Nov. 8 compared to Hillary Clinton \u2019s 232 votes, although he trails her in the popular vote. Electoral College: What to Know About Monday's Vote Over the past six weeks, left-leaning groups have called for electors to break rules that require them to vote in a way reflective of their states\u2019 popular votes, a move that would make them \u201cfaithless electors.\ufffd? Electors are not bound by the Constitution or federal law to vote according to the popular vote of their state. Thirty states have laws that require electors to do, but those laws have not been scrutinized, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Activist Michael Moore has offered to pay the fines of those who choose to break with their states' vote. One of the biggest concerns among some electors is the role of Russian hackers ahead of the election, and the potential impact that the revelations from the stolen emails had. All but one of the 80 electors who have called for classified briefings on Russia\u2019s suspected hacking are already pledged to Clinton. The gap between the results of the popular vote and the Electoral College tally has also left some electors unhappy, with Clinton garnering some 2.8 million votes more than Trump. Only one elector who is pledged to Trump -\u2013 Chris Suprun from Texas -\u2013 has said that he won\u2019t be voting for Trump today. And one elector from Maine said he plans to vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Clinton. One elector will likely be voting for Clinton is her husband, former President Bill Clinton , will be casting his vote in New York. Clinton won the state by a large margin. The Electoral College vote won\u2019t be formalized until Jan. 6, when Congress counts the ballots. Additional reporting by Shushannah Walshe, MaryAlice Parks and Lauren Pearle. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump secures victory in Electoral College, as bid to flip electors flops Published               December 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote on Monday and secured his election as the 45th president of the United States, as the latest \u2013 and perhaps last \u2013 stop-Trump movement failed to gain traction in state capitals. A fervent push by anti-Trump forces to persuade electors to defect had turned the normally mundane civic procedure into high drama.\u00a0 But Trump easily surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, as representatives tabbed to cast ballots in accordance with their states\u2019 Nov. 8 decision mostly adhered to the election results. With several states still voting, Trump had 304 votes and Hillary Clinton had 169. Texas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes. We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media). \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2016 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence afterward tweeted \"congratulations\" to his running mate while saying he was \"honored & humbled\" to be officially elected the next vice president.\u00a0 Republican National Committee Co-Chair Sharon Day\u00a0urged Trump\u2019s detractors to stop fighting his election, now that his victory is affirmed. \u201cThis historic election is now officially over and I look forward to President-elect Trump taking the oath of office in January,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cFor the good of the country, Democrats must stop their cynical attempts to undermine the legitimacy of this election, which Donald Trump won decisively in the Electoral College with more votes than any Republican since 1988.\u201d\u00a0 Elector antics were few and far between throughout the day, with most the disruptions occurring on the Democratic side. A Democratic elector in Maine tried to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders, but switched to Clinton after it was ruled improper. Another who tried to vote for Sanders in Minnesota was replaced; a Colorado elector who tried to back Ohio Gov. John Kasich likewise was replaced. One of the biggest deviations was in Washington state, where three electors voted for Colin Powell and one voted for \u201cFaith Spotted Eagle;\u201d the remaining eight went to Clinton, the state\u2019s winner. \u00a0 It marked the first time in four decades the state's electors broke from the popular vote. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman vowed to work with the state attorney general and charge the four unfaithful electors with a violation of Washington state civil law. Such violations carry a fine up to $1,000. With Trump\u2019s win now secured, a joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results. Trump\u2019s clear Electoral College victory could serve to deter any further last-ditch efforts to effectively nullify his November win and prevent his inauguration, though the battle may shift next to his Cabinet picks. \u00a0 Few expected the \u201cfaithless elector\u201d push to imperil Trump\u2019s victory on Monday. Only one Republican elector \u2013 Texas\u2019 Chris Suprun \u2013 publicly stated he would vote for an alternative candidate. (He backed Kasich, while another Texas elector used his ballot to vote for former congressman Ron Paul.) More than three dozen Republicans would have had to abandon Trump to complicate his path to the presidency. But GOP electors still faced immense pressure -- with some even receiving threats -- from Trump foes in the run-up to Monday\u2019s Electoral College vote. Those urging disorder in state capitals often cited Clinton\u2019s popular-vote win, by roughly 2.6 million votes, over Trump in November. Celebrities made public appeals to electors to use the arcane process to upend Trump\u2019s victory, as some Democratic electors tried to persuade their Republican counterparts to defect. Reports that U.S. intelligence officials determined Russia interfered in the election to boost Trump \u2013 findings disputed by Trump himself \u2013 only fueled efforts to wield the Electoral College vote as a political circuit-breaker. As electors met, thousands of protesters descended on state capitals Monday in one last push to convince Trump voters to change their minds. In Arizona, dozens of protesters gathered outside the meeting site, marching around the Capitol mall and carrying signs that said, \"Stop Trump.\"\u00a0More than 200 demonstrators gathered at Pennsylvania's Capitol, chanting, \"No treason, no Trump!\" Both states, and dozens of others, cast their electoral votes for Trump anyway. In Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant dismissed attempts to sway Republican electors. \"This idea \u2026 that we want to change the electors\u2019 minds who have been dedicated to Donald Trump very early in the process I think is just misguided,\u201d he said. If nothing else, the furor over Monday\u2019s proceedings has served to re-acquaint Americans with a process that few pay attention to every four years. The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. To be elected president, the winner must get at least half plus one -- or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins that state's popular vote. Maine and Nebraska award them by congressional district. After a joint session of Congress certifies the results on Jan. 6, the next president will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Trump already is nearly done naming his Cabinet appointees, as he prepares for confirmation hearings and the inauguration ceremonies, in addition to his first 100 days agenda. Despite the transition process being well underway, Republican electors said they were deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support the billionaire businessman in the days and weeks leading up to Monday\u2019s proceedings. Many of the emails were part of coordinated campaigns. \"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\" Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\" Arizona elector Robert Graham told Fox News on Saturday that the state\u2019s 11 electors received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he\u2019s received information that some of the other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat. \u201cIt\u2019s out of hand when you have such \u2026 a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\u201d said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \u201cThe Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Police are calling it a deliberate attack. USA TODAY NETWORK Police stand near a black lorry that ploughed through a Christmas market on Dec. 19, 2016 in Berlin. (Photo: Sean Gallup, Getty Images) BERLIN\u00a0\u2014 A large black truck slammed into a Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12\u00a0people and injuring 48 others in what police said was a deliberate attack. The carnage happened during an outdoor market near Berlin's Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. A suspect, believed to be the driver, was arrested about a mile away from the scene. A rider in the truck - which bore a Polish license plate - was found mortally wounded in the passenger seat, according to the Associated Press and German media. The passenger, who police described as a Polish national, died as paramedics treated him. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawki said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. The scene was laced with chaos. Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of the church as desperate people looked for friends and relatives among the injured. At least one woman could be seen getting treatment in the back of an ambulance. A large Christmas tree with a gold star on top was toppled over nearby in the street. The attack shattered the pre-Christmas calm in Germany, a time when thousands of locals and tourists spend their early evenings at markets, drinking mulled wine, and eating sausages and pastries. The\u00a0markets were due to finish on Friday. Witnesses told numerous news outlets, including Fox News and the Daily Telegraph, that the truck drove at least 80 feet into the heavily crowded area and did not appear to slow down. Fox reported that the truck carried several tons of steel. It remains too early to determine whether the incident is an act of terror. But U.S. officials suggested that is the most likely explanation. \"The United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas Market in Berlin, Germany, which has killed and wounded dozens,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. \"We send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded . . . We have been in touch with German officials, and we stand ready to provide assistance as they recover from and investigate this horrific incident.\" Donald Trump said the incident smacks of an assault motivated by anti-Christmas sentiment. \"Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,\" Trump said. \"ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.\"\u200b Burkard Dregger was at a Christmas party when he heard news of the incident and rushed to the scene. \"It is a terrible thing but we need to keep cool heads and work out what has happened before we draw any conclusions,\" he said. Dregger is head of security for parliamentarians attached to Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling CDU party. He was briefed by investigators but they had not yet come to any conclusions and were keeping an open mind about the attacker and motive. \"Happiness and freedom in Germany has been destroyed tonight,\" Dregger said. In this screen grab taken from video, emergency workers attend to the  scene after an attack by a truck at a Christmas market in Berlin on Dec. 19, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: AP) Some survivors took to social media to describe the horror and panic. \"People crushed.

Truck attacks in Europe have been on government radar screens as possible ways that terrorists might try and carry out simple and cost-effective assaults.\u00a0In July, 86\u00a0people were killed in Nice, France, when a truck slammed\u00a0into a large crowd during Bastille Day celebrations. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. The U.S. State Department issued a warning last month that Americans in Europe should be vigilant to the threat of terrorist attacks during the holiday season. The alert specifically mentioned Christmas markets. After the Berlin incident, the Chicago Police Department said there was no known threat to the Chicagoland area.\u00a0Still, the police department said in a statement it was adding foot and bike patrols as well as other specialized units to provide security to Daley Plaza, where the annual German-style Christmas market is being held.

Shortly afterward, a gunman opened fire. Burhan Ozbilici/AP Editor's note: An image below shows Ambassador Andrei Karlov on the ground after he was shot. Russia's ambassador to Turkey has died after he was shot Monday evening at an art exhibition in the capital, Ankara, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in comments broadcast on Russian state television. Ambassador Andrei Karlov was shot \"multiple times\" by an armed assailant as he was \"delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of a photo exhibit,\" Turkey's state run news agency, Anadolu , reported. Three other people were injured in the attack, the agency reported. Turkey's interior minister has identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a 22-year-old Turkish riot police officer who had been working in Ankara for about 2 1/2 years, according to Anadolu . Special forces \"neutralized\" the attacker at the scene, Anadolu reported, without elaborating on what it meant by \"neutralized.\" An Associated Press photographer at the scene said the gunman was killed in a shootout with police. Article continues after sponsorship An Associated Press photographer at the scene reports this man shot Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at a photo gallery in Ankara on Monday. Burhan Ozbilici/AP hide caption toggle caption Burhan Ozbilici/AP The Associated Press photographer who witnessed the attack said the gunman wore a suit and tie and shouted \"Allahu Akhbar\" as he fired \"at least eight shots.\" The man also shouted \"Don't forget Aleppo! Don't forget Syria!\" in Turkish, the wire service added. He then yelled: \"Stand back! Stand back! Only death will take me out of here. Anyone who has a role in this oppression will die one by one.\" The assailant \"smashed several of the photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover,\" according to the AP photographer's account. The attack happened at the opening of a photo exhibition, \"Russia as Seen by the Turks,\" according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency . The local Hurriyet newspaper posted an image of multiple people lying on the floor at what appears to be a gallery that it says is from the immediate aftermath of the attack. \"We qualify the events as a terrorist attack; we stay in contact with Turkish officials who have pledged that a thorough all-round investigation will be carried out. The assassinators will be punished. Today this issue will be brought up at the U.N. Security Council,\" Zakharova said, according to Tass. \"The memory of Russia's prominent diplomat Andrei [Gennadievich] Karlov will always stay in our hearts,\" she added. Russia is a close ally of the neighboring Syrian regime's and is involved in a wide-ranging airstrike campaign in Syria. Some Russian officials are blaming the assassination on those opposed to Russia's actions in Syria, as NPR's Lucian Kim reported from Moscow. \"They want to drive a wedge between Moscow and Ankara at any price,\" Leonid Slutsky, head of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, said on state television. \"It's their strategic goal, but they won't reach it.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the attack a \"provocation to destroy Turkish-Russia normalization,\" Anadolu reported . He said that the two countries have launched a joint commission to investigate the homicide. The attack took place \"just a day before Turkey's foreign minister was to travel to Moscow for talks on Syria,\" as NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Istanbul. Karlov became ambassador to Turkey in 2013 and was a career diplomat, having served since 1976, according to an official biography . He was Russia's ambassador to North Korea and also worked at the Russian Embassy in South Korea. Prior to his post in Turkey, he served as Russia's deputy director general for consular affairs. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby tweeted, \"We condemn this act of violence, whatever its source. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\" This is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",

That's been the case since Nov. 8, when Trump won 306 electoral votes, despite losing the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million. And on Monday, the result was ratified by Electoral College voters, who gathered in state capitols across the United States to formally vote for president. 5 Things You Should Know About The Electoral College Trump secured 304 electoral votes \u2014 two fewer than he earned in November, according to the Associated Press, which tracked results from capitol to capitol. That was despite a pitched effort by some on the left who wrote letters to Trump electors trying to persuade them to switch their votes or not vote at all and keep Trump short of the 270 needed. Not only did it not happen, but more electors tried to defect from Hillary Clinton Monday than from Trump, by a count of seven to two, as of Monday afternoon. Three Democratic electors in Maine, Minnesota, and Colorado tried to vote for candidates other than Clinton. The electors' votes, however, were disallowed because of state rules binding them to the statewide popular vote winner. Four more electors in Washington state defected from Clinton. Three voted for Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American who gained some notoriety for her protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Breaking 4 \"faithless electors\" break ranks in Washington state electoral college vote. 3 vote for Colin Powell, one for Faith Spotted Eagle \u2014 Ed Pilkington (@Edpilkington) December 19, 2016 Some of the Democratic electors tried to vote for Sanders. Others, including the Powell voters in Washington, were attempting to promote alternate Republican candidates that the House of Representatives could theoretically elect as president instead of Trump. The Electoral College gathering is usually a formality \u2014 a chance for political activists to gather amid pomp and circumstance to formalize their party's victory in each state. Article continues after sponsorship MAILBAG: Could 'Faithless Electors' Keep Donald Trump Out Of The White House? But the fact Clinton won the national popular vote by such a large margin, combined with the unconventional and unpredictable \u2014 and to many, threatening \u2014 way that Trump carried himself before and after winning the White House, led to an unprecedented effort to lobby electors to vote for someone else. Electors found themselves inundated by letters, petitions, tweets and Facebook posts, urging them to cast a ballot for an alternative candidate. Many people behind the lobbying campaign cited a Federalist Paper written by Alexander Hamilton, which frames the Electoral College as a safeguard against \"foreign powers\" that try to \"gain an improper ascendant in our councils\" \u2014 a potentially relevant line, in the midst of revelations that Russia attempted to disrupt this year's election by hacking and releasing Democratic emails. Hollywood celebrities even got in on the act, recording video pleas to electors. But, unsurprisingly, that effort had no effect on Trump electors. Just in: Maine elector David Bright voting for @BernieSanders today. #mepolitics pic.twitter.com/AMPUkNog3e \u2014 Michael Shepherd (@mikeshepherdME) December 19, 2016 \"They don't understand us,\" said Pennsylvania elector Ash Khare. \"I received over 70,000 emails. I received over 5,000 letters. I received over 500 phone calls at all times of day and night.\" But Khare, like most electors, is a longtime Republican political activist who was proud to cast a ballot for Trump. MN elector Muhammad Abdurrahman is deemed a \"faithless\" elector. Is dismissed and replaced. \u2014 Brian Bakst (@Stowydad) December 19, 2016 \"I've been an elector since 1996,\" Khare told Harrisburg public radio station WITF. \"But I've never been asked to do anything because we never won since 1988.\" Maine elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would cast a ballot for Sanders. But Bright ultimately changed his vote to Clinton, after his initial ballot was ruled out of order. A Minnesota elector, Muhammad Abdurrahman, tried to vote Sanders, according to Minnesota Public Radio reporter Brian Bakst. He was replaced by another elector who cast a ballot for Clinton. Two Texas electors defected from Trump \u2014 one went for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the other for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The Kasich defector, Chris Suprun, told The Hill beforehand his plans. Another Texas elector, Art Cisneros, resigned instead of voting for Trump. He spoke to NPR earlier this month. Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Mark Makela/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Mark Makela/Getty Images Many Republican electors dismissed the pleas to \"vote their conscience,\" pointing out that their consciences were perfectly fine with Trump. With protesters heckling from the gallery of Pennsylvania's House chamber, Pennsylvania elector Robert Gleason seemed to pointedly respond to their efforts. \"My fellow electors,\" Gleason said, \"let us always remember this shared moment when we stood up for our constitutional system, followed our conscience, answered the call of Pennsylvania voters, and did our part by electing the next president and vice president of the United States, Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\" On Monday night, Trump issued a statement saying, \"today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy.\" In fact, in nearly 80 percent of previous presidential elections, the winning candidate earned a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump. There are two more steps in the process. States will submit a \"certificate of vote\" to the Federal Register by Dec. 28. Then, on Jan. 6, Congress will formally tally the Electoral College's votes in a joint session and make it official. ",

The laptop's hard drive, which sources say was discovered in an unrelated investigation into alleged sexting by former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner , had been used by Weiner and his estranged wife, top Clinton adviser Huma Abedin . FBI Director Says Investigation Into Hillary Clinton Emails Back On The FBI had effectively closed its investigation of Clinton's use of a private server as secretary of state in July, at which time the agency's director, James Comey, stated flatly in a press conference that, \u201cno charges are appropriate in this case.\" But the possibility that emails discovered on the laptop could be related to the investigation led Comey to issue a stunning letter to Congress on Oct. 28, informing them of the rekindled probe. \"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\" Comey wrote in the letter to Congress. Nine days later, on Nov. 6, just two days before the election, Comey said in another letter to Congress, \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\" Clinton has said Comey's actions were a turning point in the presidential race , telling donors soon after the election that the FBI director's announcement killed momentum in her campaign and boosted motivation for Trump. A top donor told ABC News that the Comey letter was \"a perfect setup for failure.\" 0 Shares ",

Russia has provided support for Syrian troops that bombarded rebel-held sections of Aleppo for months, creating a humanitarian crisis in the war-torn city. Both nations in recent days have worked on a plan to allow for evacuation of rebel neighborhoods. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said\u00a0Alt\u0131nta\u015f had spent more than two years with a\u00a0riot police unit in \u00a0Ankara, the Turkish capital. Chilling photographs from the scene show\u00a0Karlov\u00a0lying on the ground while the gunman \u2014\u00a0dressed in a suit,\u00a0gun drawn \u2014 stands over him. Moments later the killer was fatally shot by Turkish special forces. \"We are currently in\u00a0contact with\u00a0Turkish authorities who are assuring us that a thorough, comprehensive investigation will be conducted.\" Zakharova said. Karlov, 62, was a longtime diplomat dating back to Soviet days. He began his career in\u00a01976, and spent most of the next quarter-century representing his country\u00a0in North Korea or South Korea. He was appointed ambassador to Turkey in 2013. The White House and State Department condemned the attack and extended thoughts and prayers to Karlov's family, the Russian government and the Russian people. \"This heinous attack on a member of the diplomatic corps is unacceptable, and we stand united with Russia and Turkey in our determination to confront terrorism in all of its forms,\"\u00a0National Security Council spokesman\u00a0Ned Price said in a statement. Secretary of State John Kerry offered U.S. assistance to Russia and Turkey \"as\u00a0they investigate this despicable attack, which was also an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said the killing was a \u201cprovocation aimed at derailing Russia-Turkey ties and the peace process in Syria.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan echoed Putin's comment, adding, \"Both the Russian and Turkish administrations have the determination not to fall for this provocation.\u201d Both leaders said Russian investigators will be part of the official probe into the assassination.

The judge has since been cleared of misconduct. Eric Risberg/AP hide caption toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Activists from UltraViolet, a national women's advocacy organization, push for the removal of Judge Aaron Persky from the bench in San Francisco in June. The judge has since been cleared of misconduct. Eric Risberg/AP A California judge has been cleared of misconduct after sentencing a Stanford University student to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a woman earlier this year. \"The California Commission on Judicial Performance ruled Monday that there was no evidence that Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky displayed bias in handing down a sentence decried as too lenient by critics across the country,\" The Associated Press reported. At the sentencing in June, Persky said he considered student Brock Turner's lack of prior criminal history in determining the length of his sentence for assaulting an unconscious woman on campus. Brock Turner Freed From Jail After Serving Half Of 6-Month Sentence \"A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. I think he will not be a danger to others,\" said the judge, as we reported . Turner, 21, was released in September after three months in jail . He was expected to return to his native Ohio to live with his parents. His sentence also required him to register as a sex offender. The case sparked an ongoing recall campaign against the judge. One of those calling for his removal is Stanford Law professor Michele Dauber, who wrote in an email to NPR this fall, \"We need judges who understand violence against women. Judge Persky does not. He should be replaced. Hopefully a qualified woman will replace him.\" After the sentence, Turner's victim read a statement in court, directed at her assailant, who was a swimmer for the university: \"I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. ... My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.\" Article continues after sponsorship As The Two-Way has reported , after Turner was sentenced, Stanford \" was found to have five federal complaints about its handling of sexual violence \u2014 the most cases under review of any school on the list published by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.\" ",

The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound. A gunman opened fire on Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey at a photo exhibition on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound. Umar Farooq and Laura King An off-duty Turkish police officer who shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Syria and Aleppo!\u201d shot and killed Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey on Monday as he delivered a speech in the capital, Ankara\u2014a bloody episode that was captured on video and posted on social media. \u00a0 The assailant, identified by Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu as a 22-year-old riot policeman, was himself gunned down by security forces. The ambassador, who was shot multiple times, was pronounced dead at the hospital a short time after the shooting, officials said. \u00a0 The attack appeared to represent the latest violent spillover of the Syrian conflict into neighboring Turkey. Suicide bombings linked to the fighting in Syria have become almost commonplace in Turkey, often causing mass casualties, but this was the first deadly attack on a senior diplomat that was seemingly motivated by the brutal and multi-sided war next door. Russia and Turkey, which have both intervened militarily in Syria, are on opposite sides of the conflict. Russian firepower has helped Syrian President Bashar Assad cling to power and recapture opposition-held east Aleppo; Turkey has allied itself with some of the rebels seeking to topple him. The video of the attack, which took place at a photo exhibition sponsored by the Russian embassy, shows the envoy \u2013 veteran diplomat Andrei Karlov, 62\u2014collapsing minutes into his speech after apparently being shot from behind. The gunman moves into the frame, clad in a black suit and tie and holding a handgun, and can be heard shouting in Turkish as onlookers flee in panic. At least three bystanders were reported injured. \u201cWe die in Aleppo, you die here!\u201d the shooter yells out before firing several shots into the air. \u201cYou will not taste security until our towns are secure! Do not forget about Syria and Aleppo!\u00a0 Whoever is part of it will get their punishment!\u201d\u00a0 Supporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were quick to draw a connection to July\u2019s attempted coup against Erdogan, which was followed by a purge of tens of thousands of suspected political opponents. The mayor of Ankara, Ibrahim Melih Gokcek, who is from Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, claimed the shooter was a follower of Fethullah Gulen, an elderly cleric living in self-exile in the United States and blamed by Turkey for masterminding the coup attempt. Relations between Turkey and Russia nosedived in November 2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet along the Syrian border. Erdogan earlier this year had a fence-mending session with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and the two countries have agreed to revive a natural-gas pipeline project that had been suspended, among other cooperative steps. The assassination came on the heels of near-daily protests outside the Russian embassy in Ankara as well as the consulate in Istanbul.\u00a0 Thousands of Turks and Syrians have been holding rallies at the Russian diplomatic outposts, along with the Iranian consulate and embassy, over the two governments\u2019 war roles in support of Assad. They have escalated amid reports of heavy civilian casualties in Aleppo during the re-capture of the city\u2019s eastern sector from the rebels. Scores of Turkish police were deployed at a protest last week at the Russian consulate on Istanbul\u2019s main central avenue that drew thousands. Protesters chanted \u201cPutin, murderer! Russia, murderer!\u00a0 You will get your punishment!\u201d Adding to the tension, there were reports of gunshots fired near the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, and the State Department warned Americans to avoid the area. The State Department, which has been harshly critical of Russia\u2019s role in the Syrian war, expressed dismay over the attack. \u201cWe condemn this act of violence, whatever its source,\u201d said spokesman John Kirby. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.\u201d Russia called the killing a terrorist act and said it would bring up the episode with the United Nations Security Council. \"There is no place for terrorism, and we will be resolutely fighting against it,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the semi-official TASS news agency.

    "text": "News Nation & World Turkey police officer kills Russian ambassador to Turkey at photo exhibit (Warning: Graphic content) A gunman shot and killed Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, as he gave a speech at a photo exhibition in Ankara on Dec. 19, 2016. Tribune news services Contact Reporter An Ankara police officer dressed in a suit and tie shouted slogans about Syria's civil war after he killed Russia's ambassador to Turkey\u00a0 in front of stunned onlookers at a photo exhibition in the Turkish capital on Monday, according to officials and an Associated Press photographer who witnessed the shooting. Police later killed the assailant. Ambassador Andrei Karlov, 62, was several minutes into a speech at the embassy-sponsored exhibition in Ankara when a man identified by\u00a0Turkey's interior minister as Mevlut Mert Altintas fired at least eight shots, according to the AP photographer in the audience. \"Don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria!\" the gunman shouted in Turkish, referring to the Syrian city where Russian bombardments have helped drive rebels from areas they had occupied for years during the war. He also shouted \"Allahu akbar,\" the Arabic phrase for \"God is great\" and continued in Arabic: \"We are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.\" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Altintas, who was born in 1994, had been an officer with Ankara's riot police squad for more than two years. Soylu did not give a motive for the attack. The gunman approached Karlov as he lay on the ground and shot him at least one more time at close range, according to the AP photographer. The attacker also smashed several of the framed photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover. Three other people were wounded in the attack,\u00a0Turkey's NTV television said. After shooting the ambassador, the gunman climbed to the second floor of the same building and a 15-minute shootout with police ensued before he was killed,\u00a0Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. Andrei Karlov shot and killed Karlov started his diplomatic career in 1976, after graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. (Dec. 19, 2016) Karlov started his diplomatic career in 1976, after graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. (Dec. 19, 2016) See more videos The attack comes a day before a meeting of Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign and defense ministers in Moscow to discuss Syria. Russia and Iran have backed Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the nearly six-year conflict, while\u00a0Turkey has supported Assad's foes. \"It's a tragic day in the history of our country and Russian diplomacy,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in televised comments. \"Ambassador Karlov has made a lot of personal contributions to the development of ties with Turkey. He has done a lot to overcome a crisis in bilateral relations,\" she said. \"He was a man who put his heart and his soul into his job. It's a terrible loss for us and also the world.\" Karlov joined the diplomatic service in 1976. He served as Russia's ambassador to Pyongyang in 2001-2006, and later worked as the chief of the Foreign Ministry's consular department. He had served as the ambassador to\u00a0Turkey since 2013. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said U.S. officials were aware of reports about the shooting. \"We condemn this act of violence, whatever its source,\" Kirby said. The United Nations also condemned the attack. \"There can be no justification for an attack on an ambassador ... and we very much hope that the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Melih Gokcek, the mayor for Ankara, told reporters outside the exhibition center that the \"heinous\" attack aimed to disrupt newly-re-established relations between\u00a0Turkey and Russia. Relations between Russia and\u00a0Turkey were badly strained by the downing of a Russian warplanes at the Syrian border in November 2015, but Turkey's apology earlier this year helped overcome the rift. The leaders of the two countries, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have held several meetings in recent months and spoken frequently over the phone. Russia and\u00a0Turkey have co-sponsored the evacuation of civilians and rebels from Aleppo and also discussed the prospect of organizing a new round of peace talks in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana. Turkey\u00a0has struggled with multiple security threats in recent years, including Kurdish militants who claimed responsibility for a Dec. 10 bombing in Istanbul that killed 44 people, many of them police. The Islamic State group fighting in Syria and Iraq has also been blamed for attacks in Turkey, a NATO member and a partner in the U.S.-led campaign against the group. Additionally, Turkish security forces and courts remain preoccupied with purging state institutions of the supporters of an exiled Islamist cleric whom the government accuses of staging a failed coup attempt in July.

    "text": "Tribune news services Contact Reporter A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday evening, killing at least nine people as it tore through tables and wooden stands. Many others were injured. Police said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested nearby and a passenger was dead. The vehicle crashed into the market outside the capital's popular Christmas market at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. AP Television footage showed a large Scania truck with its windshield smashed out on the sidewalk alongside the market, with a swarm of ambulances nearby. A large Christmas tree with a gold star on top was toppled over nearby in the street, and tree branches were crushed under the truck's tires. Police said they were still investigating whether the crash was deliberate. But it came less than a month after a U.S. State Department calling for caution in markets and other public places, saying extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\" Islamic State and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack public places. On July 14, a truck plowed into a Bastille Day crowd in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. Mike Fox, a tourist from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press at the scene in Berlin that the large truck missed him by about three meters as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and wooden stands. \"It was definitely deliberate,\" Fox said. Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas, who said in a tweet \"we are mourning with the relatives\" of the victims. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere gave no indication in a statement whether authorities believe the crash was an attack. ",

    "text": "At least 12 dead, 48 injured after truck plows into Berlin Christmas market in apparent terror attack Published               December 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injured 48 others in what witnesses described as a deliberate attack. German authorities said they are still investigating whether the crash was an accident, but a statement from the White House National Security Council (NSC) said the incident \"appears to have been a terrorist attack.\" The large Scania truck with a Polish license plate crashed into the market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.\u00a0The truck came to a halt on a sidewalk on one side of the market, shortly after ramming a large stand called \"Fascination Christmas,\" ripping off one side and knocking down a large Christmas tree. The three-meter tree lay in the street, red and gold ornamental balls still attached to its limbs and a golden star at the top. Police said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested about 1 1/2 miles away, near Berlin's Victory Column monument. A passenger in the truck died at the scene as paramedics were attending to him. Authorities initially estimated that 50 people were injured. Police later revised the total to 48, while Berlin's fire brigade said others were \"more mentally injured.\" Related Image Expand / Contract Police stand beside a damaged truck which ran into crowded Christmas market in Berliin Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24.\u00a0Zurawski added that the truck had been loaded with steel structures weighing 25 tons. Die Welt newspaper reported that the arrested suspect is a Pakistani known to police for minor criminal offenses, but not terrorism. The newspaper also reported that the dead passenger was a Polish national. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the incident had a chilling echo of the July 14 truck attack in Nice, France that killed 86 people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the Nice attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. ISIS and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack public places. Mike Fox, a tourist from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press at the scene in Berlin that the large truck missed him by about three yards as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and wooden stands. \"It was definitely deliberate,\" Fox said. Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Dozens of ambulances lined the streets waiting to evacuate people, and heavily armed police patrolled the area. Police on Twitter urged people to stay away from the area, saying they needed to keep the streets clear for the rescue vehicles. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. But Berlin's top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and called reports that the truck may have been hijacked \"pure speculation.\" Even so, some politicians were pointing fingers. Marcus Pretzell, a prominent member of the anti-migration Alternative for Germany party, lashed out at the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying on Twitter: \"When will the German state of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel's dead! (hash)Nice (hash)Berlin.\" U.S. President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement calling the attack \"horrifying.\" \"Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,\" Trump said. \"ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.\" Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach. Both attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. Monday's incident comes less than a month after the State Department warned U.S. citizens to be cautious in markets and other public places, saying extremist groups were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\" In a statement, State Department spokesman John Kirby condemned the \"horrendous events\" at the Christmas market.\u00a0 NSC spokesman Ned Price said the United States has already been in contact with German officials and stands ready to assist in the investigation and response. Law enforcement sources tell Fox News that the FBI's Legal Attache (LEGAT) office in Berlin had been in touch with German officials to offer intelligence support to investigators. The sources said late Monday that no Americans had been identified among the victims. Zurich police search for gunman after shooting at mosque; at least 3 injured Last week, German prosecutors said a\u00a012-year-old boy attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen. The German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources. In the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported. Police said it would have burned but would not have exploded. Fox News' Matt Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "OPEN Interactive Feature The United Nations says it has about 100 staff members in Aleppo, mostly Syrian citizens, and several hundred others in nearby Syrian cities. Officials with the organization have said they were denied permission to observe evacuations. As many as 50,000 civilians may still be stuck in the area, according to humanitarian groups, although a precise figure is all but impossible to determine. \u201cAfter so many delaying tactics and obstruction, this resolution should finally allow the full respect of international humanitarian law in Syria,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said in a statement. \u201cIt should also pave the way for a cease-fire and negotiate a political solution that is much awaited by the Syrian people and the entire international community.\u201d The extent to which the Syrian government will cooperate with the monitoring is unclear, though Russia is a principal military backer of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. After days of delays and sporadic violence , the evacuation of civilians and fighters from besieged communities in Syria resumed Sunday night, with convoys taking people out of eastern Aleppo and two nearby Shiite villages. As of Monday afternoon, 20,000 people had been removed from the last rebel-held part of Aleppo, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said in a post on Twitter . Among those evacuated to a rebel-held area west of the city was Bana al-Abed, a 7-year-old girl whose Twitter posts with her mother throughout the siege by government forces helped draw attention to the plight of civilians. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Opposition activists posted videos and photographs of the girl and her mother on Monday after they arrived in rebel-held territory. The evacuation of more than 2,000 sick and wounded people from two Shiite villages that have been surrounded by Sunni insurgents for years also began Monday. The villages, Fouaa and Kfarya, were not originally part of the agreement but were added after pro-government gunmen prevented buses from removing people from eastern Aleppo last week. Ten buses carrying civilians from the villages left on Monday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, and local journalists posted online videos of their arrival in another government-held area. Video Security Council Votes to Send Monitors to Syria The United Nations Security Council, with the backing of Russia, voted unanimously on Monday to have observers oversee operations bringing civilians out of Aleppo, Syria. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Also added to the agreement was the evacuation of two rebel-held villages near the border with Lebanon, Zabadani and Madaya, that have long been surrounded by government forces. The evacuation deal, brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran, was intended to relieve one of the more crushing aspects of Syria\u2019s war: the practice by both sides of besieging their opponents and bombarding their communities. The agreement, and an accompanying cease-fire, has proceeded haltingly since it began on Wednesday, with gunfire on the route repeatedly stopping convoys. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the Syrian government, said five buses that had been held up by pro-government forces for hours were allowed to leave eastern Aleppo before midnight on Sunday. The eastern part of Aleppo, the remaining rebel-held area of the city, has been surrounded by government forces for months and subjected to frequent airstrikes that have killed hundreds of people and have reduced neighborhoods to rubble. If the evacuations continue without interruption, the removal of the remaining residents of eastern Aleppo will put the entire city under Mr. Assad\u2019s control and mark a turning point in the war . Aleppo was once the largest city in Syria and was its industrial hub before the war. Its fall would leave rebels in control of only smaller towns and rural areas.

(Chicago Tribune) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Donald Trump started racking up electoral votes Monday even as anti-Trump protesters across the country tried to persuade the Electoral College to prevent him from winning the White House. Trump didn't lose any electors with votes counted in a half dozen states he won Nov. 8: Tennessee, West Virginia, Arkansas, South Carolina, Mississippi and Oklahoma. Initial results gave Trump 44 votes and Democrat Hillary Clinton, 10. It takes 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency. Electors were voting throughout the day and there was scant evidence many GOP electors would peel away from their Election Day winner. More than three dozen would have to abandon him to complicate his path to the presidency. More than 200 demonstrators braved freezing temperatures at Pennsylvania's capitol, chanting, \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" and \"No treason, no Trump!\" Protesters also gathered in Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and other states. The protesters, however, were unlikely to persuade the Electoral College to dump Trump. An Associated Press survey of electors found very little appetite to vote for alternative candidates. Only one Republican said he would vote for someone else. Republican electors have been deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many of the emails are part of coordinated campaigns. \"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They are generally freaked out. They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\" Electoral college meets amid push to stop Trump Protests are planned for state capitals, but they are unlikely to persuade the electoral college to dump Trump. Protests are planned for state capitals, but they are unlikely to persuade the electoral college to dump Trump. See more videos Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\" A joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results of the Electoral College vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner \u2014 almost certainly Trump \u2014 will be sworn in on Jan. 20. The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. The AP tried to reach all of the electors and interviewed more than 330 of them, finding widespread aggravation among Democrats with the electoral process, but little expectation Trump would be derailed.

The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House. Interest in the normally mundane voting process spiked this year as opposition to Trump continues to fester, fueled by Clinton's success in capturing over 2.6 million more votes than her Republican opponent.

Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump. And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump. An elector in both Maine and Minnesota attempted to cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary. However state laws requiring electors to follow the statewide vote invalidated both efforts. Only one Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, publically pledged not to vote for Trump despite his state heavily favoring the president-elect last month. One other Texas elector also abandoned Trump in the final vote. Play ",

Got it Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim speaks at news conference at the Soumaya Museum in Mexico City in March 2011. (Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images) By Philip Rucker , Robert Costa and Joshua Partlow December 19 at 7:29 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @costareports Follow @partlowj In the closing days of his campaign, Donald Trump vilified one of the world\u2019s richest men \u2014 Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim \u2014 as part of a globalist cabal conspiring to extinguish his populist candidacy. Yet over the weekend, Slim journeyed to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for what the president-elect described as \u201ca lovely dinner with a wonderful man.\u201d The peacemaking gesture \u2014 the culmination of weeks of back-channel negotiations that included a secret visit to Mexico City by a Trump envoy \u2014 signals a possible thawing between Trump and Mexico\u2019s business and political elite, which he had used relentlessly as a foil throughout his campaign. The communications raised hopes in Mexico\u2019s business community that Trump might reconsider his vow to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and be persuaded to adopt less hard-line immigration and economic policies, which were cornerstones of his campaign. Larry Rubin, president of the American Society of Mexico and a key liaison between Republican officials in the United States and Mexican leaders, said Trump and his team are forging a better understanding of shared economic interests between the two countries. (The Washington Post) \u201cWhat President-elect Trump wants to do in coming closer to the Mexican business community has an impact not only nationally but regionally with Latin America and opens the doors for good business relations overall,\u201d said Rubin, who is one of several candidates to serve as Trump\u2019s ambassador to Mexico. \u201cThe closer that the administration is to businesses and governments in Mexico and in the region, the better for the U.S.\u201d But Trump has made no declaration of any shift in his immigration or trade policies, and any softening would carry the risk of angering his core supporters. Saturday, just hours before his dinner with Slim, Trump staged the final rally of his \u201cthank you\u201d tour in Mobile, Ala., and the crowd chanted, \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d \u201cDo not worry. We are going to build the wall,\u201d Trump said, reiterating his promise to erect a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it. Trump and Slim\u2019s dinner was designed to open a friendly line of communication rather than delve into policy details, according to people briefed on the discussions. Slim\u2019s visit to Mar-a-Lago came after Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager who remains a confidant of the president-elect, quietly visited Mexico City on Dec. 9 to meet with Slim. After the election, Slim connected with Lewandowski \u2014 someone he saw as having Trump\u2019s ear but not as a formal member of his staff \u2014 and arranged for them to discuss trade, economic and other issues, according to people with knowledge of the session. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Shefte,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) Slim has long been the dominant figure in Mexico\u2019s business community. He has a net worth estimated at $77\u00a0billion, according to the most recent tally by Forbes magazine. He controls Latin America\u2019s largest telecom company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, and is also involved in banking, construction, retail, health care, oil and other businesses. Slim also is the largest single investor in the New York Times Co. Trump\u2019s meeting with Slim is the latest example of the president-elect reconciling with former foes \u2014 most prominently, Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who had led the Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s candidacy but became a serious candidate for secretary of state. During the campaign, Slim strongly criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Mexican Americans as well as his plans to renegotiate NAFTA and build the border wall. Slim said that Trump\u2019s proposed tariff on imports would \u201cdestroy\u201d the U.S. economy. Trump in turn accused Slim of helping promote his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and cast him as part of a global conspiracy. At an Oct. 14 rally, Trump attacked Slim personally and accused Times journalists of being \u201ccorporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim.\u201d Trump\u2019s quarrel with Slim extends to the very beginning of his campaign. At his June 2015 announcement speech, Trump\u2019s remarks about undocumented Mexican immigrants being criminals and rapists sparked an intense furor. A television company controlled by Slim canceled a project it had been working on with Trump\u2019s company, and Slim\u2019s spokesman said Trump was \u201cclose-minded\u201d and his comments \u201ctotally out of line.\u201d Trump told friends at the time that he believed Slim \u2014 who once had a business relationship with a rival candidate, former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2014 helped orchestrate the public backlash. \u201cHe believes Carlos Slim was behind a lot of his problems,\u201d said one Trump friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. This person suggested that Trump sees a benefit to Saturday\u2019s dinner: \u201cHe wants to neutralize him.\u201d After Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, Slim\u2019s tone toward the \u00adpresident-elect changed. In recent comments, Slim has spoken optimistically about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cIf Trump is able to grow the United States economy and jobs, that would be fantastic for Mexico,\u201d Slim told a business forum. Slim\u2019s evolution comes as the Mexican government is undertaking an extensive effort to preserve NAFTA by proving Mexico\u2019s worth to the U.S. economy. Since Trump\u2019s win, Mexican diplomats have sought to spread the message to immigrants, through the network of 50 consulates in the United States, about their rights and legal protections. The Mexican government has enlisted business executives in both countries to talk about the economic benefits of free trade in what one Mexican official described as \u201cthe language that the new president speaks: deals and entrepreneurial vision.\u201d Mexican officials have readied themselves to discuss NAFTA, or any other topic, with the incoming administration. But they have also stressed that they don\u2019t yet know what policies Trump intends to pursue. \u201cThe truth is right now we don\u2019t even have a [negotiating] table,\u201d Paulo Carre\u00f1o, Mexico\u2019s deputy foreign secretary for North American affairs, said in a recent interview. While Trump\u2019s election has presented challenges for Mexico, Carre\u00f1o said, the government remains \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for the bi\u00adlateral relationship. Carlos Sada, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said in a speech last week to the Council of the Americas that his country would \u201cwork to find common ground with the next U.S. administration.\u201d Sada added, \u201cBesides my basic efforts to get to know better the character of the U.S. president-elect, we have to seriously recognize the juncture at which we are standing today: We either capitalize it and turn it into opportunity for the sake of a new stage of our integration and shared growth or risk a major setback.\u201d A group of CEOs from both countries met in Mexico City recently for a public policy summit chaired by Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; John Rice, vice chairman of General Electric; Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1\u00f3n, chairman of the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, a Mexican private-sector business council; and Armando Garza, chairman of Alfa, a Mexican-based multinational conglomerate. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and a number of his ministers attended the session, where business leaders discussed the impact of Trump\u2019s election on cross-border trade and other economic matters, according to people familiar with the meeting. Earl Anthony Wayne, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico under President Obama, said there is \u201ca lot of concern and a desire to find a positive way forward.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a million dollars a minute in trade that goes across our border,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cThe CEOs are very interested in preserving what they see as mutually beneficial relations. There\u2019s a lot of attention to what the policies will turn out to be and a desire to have a dialogue with whoever the new officials will be.\u201d In August, Trump made a splashy visit to Mexico City to meet with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, where the then-candidate was unusually subdued and struck a cooperative tone with the Mexican leader. Trump said at a joint news conference that day that he and Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not discuss who would pay for his proposed border wall, despite his campaign-trail vow to compel Mexico to foot the bill. Slim\u2019s mark can be seen all across Mexico City, from the glittering Museo Soumaya, an hourglass-shaped building made of aluminum tiles and named after his late wife, to the Sanborns department stores that dot so many corners. His wealth amounts to a noticeable chunk of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. In a 2013 appearance CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show With David Letterman,\u201d Trump told the host that Slim was a \u201cgood guy\u201d with \u201ca lot of money.\u201d When Letterman detailed the towering nature of Slim\u2019s fortune, however, Trump smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good when you mention Carlos Slim,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s okay.\u201d Read more: ",

Got it (Nicki DeMarco,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) By David Filipov , Kareem Fahim and Liz Sly December 19 at 6:11 PM Follow @davidfilipov Follow @kfahim Follow @LizSly MOSCOW \u2014 A Turkish police officer who angrily denounced the bloodshed in Syria killed the Russian ambassador to Turkey in Ankara on Monday, shooting the diplomat in front of a room full of horrified spectators at an art gallery in an assassination captured on video and quickly shared around the world. As the ambassador, Andrei Karlov, lay on the floor, the assailant, still waving his gun, screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo! Don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d\u00a0 The shooting was among the most brazen retaliatory attacks yet on Russia since Moscow entered the war in Syria on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, and unleashed a bombardment on Aleppo that has drawn international condemnation for what observers on the ground\u00a0have called indiscriminate attacks on civilians.\u00a0 But in Moscow, where the Kremlin has maintained that its aerial sorties and missile attacks have exclusively targeted \u201cterrorists,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry called the shooting \u201ca terrorist attack,\u201d and President Vladi\u00admir Putin called it a\u00a0\u201cprovocation aimed at rupturing ties between Russia and Turkey.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe only answer to the murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey must be the intensification of the struggle against terrorism,\u201d Putin said in nationally televised remarks.\u00a0\u201cAnd the bandits will feel it.\u201d 1 of 7 What the scene of the fatal shooting in Turkey looked like View Photos A gunman in Turkey killed Russia\u2019s ambassador at a photo exhibit. Caption A gunman in Turkey killed Russia\u2019s ambassador at a photo exhibit. \u00a0Dec. 19, 2016 Turkish police secure the area near an art gallery where Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, was fatally shot. Umit Bektas/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Putin ordered his major crime investigative unit to work with Turkish authorities, who identified the gunman as 22-year old Mevlut Mert Altintas, an officer with the riot police. In the video, Altintas, dressed incongruously in a black suit and tie, shouts out, \u201cWe are those who pledged jihad to Mohamed.\u201d Referring to Syria, he added, \u201cEvery single person who has a share in this atrocity will pay for it!\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0Several other people were wounded in the attack, which came as Karlov was speaking at the opening of an exhibit of Russian photos, but their identities were not immediately made public. [ Gallery: Scenes from Aleppo ] Altintas was killed in a shootout with police at the gallery, but Russian authorities vowed\u00a0to reveal a larger plot \u2014 and some in Moscow suggested that the West was to blame for its support of moderate rebel factions in Syria.\u00a0 Putin stopped short of that, saying only,\u00a0\u201cWe need to know who guided the hand of the murderer.\u201d The assassination was Turkey\u2019s third major attack in less than 10 days, and followed months of deadly violence \u2014 including a failed coup attempt and a suicide attack on Istanbul\u2019s international airport \u2014 that has highlighted the threats facing Erdogan\u2019s government and left the country reeling from a sense of siege. The attacks have reflected a convergence of crises that Turkey, a NATO member and major ally of the United States, has been forced to weather over the last few years. They include the spillover from the war in neighboring Syria, a failed peace deal with Kurdish militants and a domestic challenge from a shadowy network tied to a Turkish preacher living in the United States.\u00a0 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has successfully seized on the crises to consolidate his own authority. His government has moved forcefully against Kurdish and Islamist militants as well as followers of the preacher, Fethullah Gulen.\u00a0 It was not clear whether the Altintas, the assassin, fit into any of those categories. The interior minister said Altintas hailed from a town near Izmir, on the Aegean coast, and had been on the force for two and half years. Some pro-government commentators tried to brand him as a follower of Gulen, while his shouted manifesto after the shooting suggested, at the very least, he was acting out of anger at the carnage in Syria.\u00a0 In a television address hours after the shooting, Erdogan also condemned the assassination as \u201ca provocation\u201d aimed at disrupting warming ties between Turkey and Russia. Erdogan, who has been a leading regional opponent of the Syrian government, also defended Turkey\u2019s cooperation with Syria\u2019s sponsor, Russia, saying that it aimed to \u201cfind a solution for the humanitarian crisis in Syria\u201d and \u201c to stop the oppression in Aleppo.\u201d Erdogan and Putin, two strongmen with global aspirations, have found common ground in recent months in their desire to secure an end to the Syrian war that would guarantee their long-term influence at a time when U.S. diplomacy has collapsed. Their foreign ministers, as well as their counterpart from Iran, which backs Assad, are planning to meet Tuesday in Moscow to negotiating a settlement to the Syrian war that would exclude the United States and assert the three powers as the region\u2019s most vital players.\u00a0 Russia and Turkey\u2019s newfound cooperation over Syria was exemplified by\u00a0 the deal they brokered last week for the evacuation of besieged people from the last few blocks of rebel held territory in eastern Aleppo. The statements by Putin and Erdogan suggested that the assassination may not disrupt the budding convergence of interests between Moscow and Ankara. Until last summer, the two presidents had been bitter rivals over Syria, supporting opposite sides in the war and embroiled in recriminations over the shoot-down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet in November 2015. [ How the Russia-Turkish rivalry shaped the world ] Those circumstances have led some Russian politicians to accuse the West of complicity in the attacks.\u00a0 \u201cThey are afraid of that alliance, it\u2019s a counterweight to the European Union and NATO,\u201d said Vladi\u00admir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist politician whose often outlandish remarks on foreign policy are sometimes seen as a trial balloon for things the Kremlin would rather not say. Many players risk losing out in any Russian-Turkish deal over the future of Syria, including the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition, extremists with the Islamic State,\u00a0and Syria\u2019s al-Qaeda affiliate. The United States, meanwhile, joined other nations in condemning the shooting.\u00a0 \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, the Russian people, and with the other victims who were injured in this shooting,\u201d Secretary of State John F. Kerry said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe stand ready to offer assistance to Russia and Turkey as they investigate this despicable attack, which was also an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world. President-elect Donald Trump also issued a statement condemning the killing. Karlov started his diplomatic career during the Soviet era in 1976 and took the post in Ankara in July 2013, according to the embassy\u2019s website. Putin referred to him as a \u201cbrilliant diplomat\u201d who \u201chad excellent relations with the leadership of Turkey and other political forces.\u201d The incident could spur even more vigorous efforts between Russia and Turkey to secure their role as Syria\u2019s main power brokers and negotiate a settlement to the war on their terms. Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, said that any fallout \u201cwill entirely depend on Russia\u2019s reaction.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAll indications thus far is that they will retain the relations they have built with Turkey since the rapprochement a couple of months ago,\u201d he added. The recent cease-fire cobbled together was to Russia\u2019s long-term benefit in Syria, while also addressing Turkey\u2019s real concern about civilian casualties, Stein said.\u00a0 Fahim reported from Cairo, Sly from Beirut.

Turkish police officers responding to the incident fatally shot the gunman, who was identified by officials as Mevlut Mert Aydintas, aged 22. Turkish officials confirmed earlier reports that Aydintas was himself a police officer, working riot detail in Ankara. The Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov speaks a gallery in Ankara Monday Dec. 19, 2016, moments before he was shot dead by a gunman, who is seen at rear on the left. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici The leaders of Turkey and Russia said Karlo\u2019s killing has been intended to ruin Russia-Turkey ties. Speaking in televised remarks during a meeting with senior officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a \u201cprovocation aimed at derailing Russia-Turkey ties and the peace process in Syria.\u201d\u00a0 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a video message being shown on several Turkish TV channels, said that \u201cthis is a provocation to damage the normalization process of Turkish-Russian relations. But both the Russian and Turkish administrations have the determination not to fall for this provocation.\u201d Both leaders said Russian investigators will be part of the official probe into Karlov\u2019s assassination.\u00a0 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey a \u201cdespicable attack.\u201d\u00a0 Kerry said that the killing was \u201can assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world.\u201d He said that the U.S. is ready to offer help to Russia and Turkey in the investigation of the attack.\u00a0 The ambassador was several minutes into a speech at an embassy-sponsored photo exhibition in the capital, Ankara, when Aydintas, wearing a suit and tie, shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and fired at least eight shots, according to an AP photographer in the audience. The attacker also said some words in Russian and smashed several of the photos hung for the exhibition.

AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo, don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d Aydintas shouted in Turkish, referring to the Syrian city where Russian bombardments have helped drive rebels from areas they had occupied for years during the war. He also shouted \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d the Arabic phrase for \u201cGod is great\u201d and continued in Arabic: \u201cWe are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.\u201d People react after the  the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov,  was shot at a photo gallery in Ankara, Turkey, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici The gunman approached Karlov as he lay on the ground and shot him at least one more time at close range, according to the AP photographer. The attacker also smashed several of the framed photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover. Three other people were wounded in the attack, NTV said. The attack comes a day before a meeting of Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign and defense ministers in Moscow to discuss Syria. Russia and Iran have backed Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the nearly six-year conflict, while Turkey has supported Assad\u2019s foes.\u00a0 Senior Russian lawmakers are describing the killing of Karlov as a provocation aimed to derail a rapprochement between the two nations. Leonid Slutsky, the head of the foreign affairs committee at the lower house of Russian parliament, said that unspecified opponents of Russia \u201care making desperate attempts to spoil ties between Russia and Turkey, but those attempts will fail.\u201d He and other senior lawmakers called for even closer cooperation with Turkey and refrained from advising Russians to avoid visiting Turkey.\u00a0 Karlov was shot \u201cwhen an unidentified assailant opened chaotic gunfire during a public event in Ankara,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. She said Russia was in contact with Turkish officials about the incident.\u00a0 Russia and Turkey recently negotiated a cease-fire in the Syrian civil war between rebels and the Assad regime fighting over the city of Aleppo. The cease-fire has led to the negotiated surrender of rebels that had held the city since nearly the beginning of the five-year-old conflict. If the evacuation from Aleppo is completed later on Monday, it will close an important chapter in Syria\u2019s civil war, which Russia is involved in largely due to its long-standing alliance with the ruling Assad clan, and Turkey is involved in largely due to its long border with the country. Earlier this year, there was\u00a0 a diplomatic crisis between the two nations \u00a0after Turkey shot down a Russian jet Ankara said had violated their airspace during maneuvers over Syria. \u00a0 Turkey has also struggled with a series of deadly terrorist attacks recently , from both Kurdish rebels and groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS .) According to\u00a0 the Ministry of Foriegn Affairs , Karlov began his diplomatic career in 1976, and has previously served in North Korea. He became Russian Ambassador to Turkey in July of 2013. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "Obama announces record wave of pardons, commutations Published               December 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Obama on Monday pardoned 78 people and granted another 153 commutations, amounting to the most acts of clemency granted by a U.S. president ever in a single day. White House Counsel Neil Eggleston announced the decisions in an official blog post. He described all the individuals being pardoned or seeing their sentences shortened as \u201cdeserving.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThe 231 individuals granted clemency today have all demonstrated that they are ready to make use \u2013 or have already made use \u2013 of a second chance,\u201d he wrote. He also previewed additional clemency decisions in the weeks ahead, saying: \u201cI expect that the President will issue more grants of both commutations and pardons before he leaves office.\u201d The decisions could fuel criticism from the right, following a presidential campaign in which winner Donald Trump hammered a law-and-order message and suggested authorities were too soft on crime. But Obama has been granting commutations at rapid-fire pace in his final months in office, focusing primarily on shortening sentences of those convicted of drug offenses rather than pardons. Pardons amount to forgiveness of a crime that removes restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury. The pardon also lessens the stigma arising from the conviction. Eggleston said Obama has now pardoned a total of 148 people during his presidency and has shortened the sentences of 1,176 people, including 395 serving life sentences. Eggleston said each clemency recipient's story is unique, but a common thread of rehabilitation underlies all of them. Pardon recipients have shown they have led a productive and law-abiding post-conviction life, including by contributing to the community in a meaningful way, he said. The commutations were announced as Obama vacations in Hawaii during the holidays.\u00a0 Many of those on Obama\u2019s list Monday had been sentenced on drug-related convictions. Groups that have urged the president to use his clemency powers cheered the decision, urging him to go further in the waning days of his administration. \u00a0 \u201cAs the clock counts down on the Obama administration, the need for commutations of these non-violent drug offenders -- and many more like them -- is more important than ever,\u201d Jessica Jackson Sloan, national director of #cut50, said in a statement.\u00a0 The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement Trending in Politics 1 ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Ed O'Keefe December 19 at 5:36 PM Follow @edatpost Donald Trump clinched the presidency Monday as members of the electoral college cast ballots declaring him the victor, a perfunctory conclusion to the most stunning presidential contest in modern history. Trump became the winner Monday afternoon after electors from Texas cast ballots and put him over the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Results will be officially announced Jan. 6 in a special joint session of Congress. While Democrat Hillary Clinton amassed a nearly 3 million-vote lead in the popular vote, Trump won the state-by-state electoral map, making him president-elect. That political dichotomy sparked special scrutiny and intense lobbying of electors by Trump\u2019s opponents in recent weeks, including mass protests. It also drew outsize attention to the usually overlooked, constitutionally obligated gatherings of 538 electors in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The mostly symbolic calls for an electoral college rejection of Trump grew after revelations of a CIA assessment that Russian hacking could have boosted his campaign, which in the view of many Trump critics raised doubts about his legitimacy. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Trump has dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s analysis of Russia\u2019s role in the election and has boasted , including on Monday, of a \u201chistoric\u201d electoral landslide. But his 305-to-232 win over Clinton ranks just 46th out of 58 electoral college margins. \u201cThis election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cWith this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead.\u201d His detractors called on electors to buck the president-elect in favor of Clinton \u2014 or Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, or another Republican such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Ultimately, Kasich earned one vote from an elector in Texas. So did former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.). In Washington state, three electors cast votes for former secretary of state Colin Powell, while another voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, a member of the Sioux tribe from South Dakota who opposes the Dakota Access Pipeline. Pence earned the requisite electoral votes to serve as vice president, but in Washington state, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also earned some votes. Across the country, critics of the president-elect braved cold temperatures and rallied outside state capitol buildings in hopes that electors might act as an emergency brake on Trump. In Pennsylvania, which voted for a Republican president for the first time since 1988, a few hundred shell-shocked Democrats protested in Harrisburg while all 20 electors backed Trump. In Utah, protesters booed and shouted \u201cShame on you\u201d as the state\u2019s six electors cast votes for Trump in a capitol building conference room in Salt Lake City. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Shefte,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) In Florida, a crucial swing state where Trump defeated Clinton by about a percentage point, Trump won all 29 electoral votes. He also earned all 16 votes in Michigan, another state that flipped to Republicans for the first time since 1988. On the streets of Washington, D.C., two dozen protesters assembled outside Trump\u2019s hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, singing songs such as \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d Some held signs, including one that read, \u201cResist Putin\u2019s Puppet.\u201d The District\u2019s three electors later gathered at city hall, just a block from Trump\u2019s hotel. In Albany, N.Y., former president Bill Clinton sat in the state Senate chamber as an elector and cast one of the Empire State\u2019s 29 electoral votes for his wife. \u201cI\u2019ve never cast a vote I was prouder of,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting. [ In last-shot bid, thousands urge electoral college to block Trump at Monday vote ] Despite the pleas of Trump opponents, most electors had said for weeks that they planned to cast votes reflecting the will of their home states. \u201cAny choice was better than Hillary, so it\u2019s not a hard choice for me,\u201d Oklahoma Republican elector Charles Potts said in a recent interview. Richard Snelgrove, an elector who also serves as a Salt Lake County, Utah, council member, said he had received \u201cthousands of emails, hundreds of letters and a few phone calls \u2014 most of them respectful, a couple over the top, and a few that have been downright threatening.\u201d Most of the messages asked him to vote for Clinton on the grounds that she won the national popular vote. But Snelgrove said there was no justification for such a move. \u201cNo one elected me king, and it\u2019s my job to reflect the will of the people of Utah,\u201d he said. \u201cThey chose Trump.\u201d In Harrisburg, Ray-Ellen Kavey, 68, had driven from neighboring New York state to try to persuade Pennsylvania\u2019s electors to switch allegiance. \u201cI think the Constitution charges the electors with preventing exactly what is happening here \u2014 a hostile takeover of our government by a bigot who has been supported by Russia,\u201d Kavey said. \u201cI know nothing will come of this, but my conscience won\u2019t let me do any less.\u201d In Austin, Joni Ashbrook, 64, and her best friend, Mary Robinson, 62, stood outside the pink-granite Texas capitol, holding two ends of a banner that Ashbrook had sewed. \u201cResist Trump\u2019s Agenda,\u201d the sign read. Ashbrook, a retired fourth-grade science teacher, said that she knew the electors would probably vote for Trump but that she was troubled by Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and disregard for global warming. \u201cI\u2019d like for them to be very thoughtful about what\u2019s going on around them,\u201d Ashbrook said of the electors. \u201cBut this is just another way for us to say \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d In Maryland, all 10 of the state\u2019s electors voted for Clinton during a meeting in the Governor\u2019s Reception Room at the State House in Annapolis. Maryland law requires electors to vote for the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote, which Clinton won easily. Maggie McIntosh, a state delegate from Baltimore, choked up as she announced the results to an audience of more than 70 spectators. \u201cThis is kind of an emotional moment,\u201d McIntosh said with tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional moment for many women in this country and this state. Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first woman nominated by a major political party for president of the United States. She won the majority of votes here in Maryland, the electors today have chosen her as president, and she won the majority of votes in this country.\u201d The CIA\u2019s assessment of Russia\u2019s election interference prompted 10 electors \u2014 nine Democrats and one Republican \u2014 to request an intelligence briefing to learn more about Moscow\u2019s role, a move endorsed by some of Clinton\u2019s top campaign aides. Other groups had urged electors to postpone the vote until Trump explains what he plans to do about his multinational family business empire. Trump has declined to explain his plans in person but has tweeted that he will hand over day-to-day responsibilities for his company to his adult sons, who will do \u201c no new deals \u201d while he occupies the White House. Intelligence officials last week declined requests to brief electors, saying they will provide congressional briefings only when a review ordered by President Obama is completed. Electors each cast two votes, one for president and one for vice president. In every state, officials prepared a \u201ccertificate of vote\u201d to be sent to Washington for processing by Congress and the National Archives. Lawmakers are scheduled to gather Jan. 6 in the House chamber to hear the results from the states in alphabetical order during a session set to be led by Vice President Biden. It will allow lawmakers to challenge the results or the votes of individual electors. The Constitution says nothing about how electors should vote, but some states bind them to the results of the popular vote, and some state parties essentially force electors to take a loyalty pledge to serve. Just a handful of electors tested the limits this year, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether those who voted for people other than Clinton or Trump would face punishment. While much of the uncertainty headed into the day centered on how many electors would vote against Trump in the states he won, it was Clinton who saw her tally shrink further. In the state of Washington, a liberal stronghold where the Democratic nominee won the popular vote comfortably, Clinton won eight of the 12 electors. Three of the remaining four cast votes for Powell, who served in the administration of George W. Bush. And there was the vote for Faith Spotted Eagle. State Democrats had selected their electors at a lightly attended party convention packed mostly with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the runner-up in the Democratic presidential primary race. Electors in Colorado and Minnesota also tried and failed to buck Clinton. In Maine, elector David Bright initially cast his ballot for Sanders to honor thousands of younger voters who had supported the senator. But state officials ruled that Bright\u2019s vote was improper. They ordered a revote, and Bright voted the second time for Clinton.

Although electors in dozens of states still have to vote, the electoral balloting in Texas put Trump over the majority threshold, according to a state-by-state tally by the Associated Press. Thirty-six of the state's electors voted for Trump, one for John Kasich and one for Ron Paul . The next, and last, official step in the electoral process is for Congress to count the votes. Under the procedure set out by the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, that formal process is scheduled for Jan. 6. Some anti-Trump activists had hoped against hope that they could persuade electors in states that voted for Trump to defect, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Electors are nearly all party loyalists. Additionally, they faced more than two centuries of tradition\u00a0and, in some states, legal obligations\u00a0that called for them to cast their ballots according to which candidate won the popular vote in their states. No\u00a0defectors have ever changed the result of a presidential election. Four\u00a0electors today successfully defected in Washington state. Instead of voting for Hillary Clinton, who won the state's popular vote,\u00a0three electors voted\u00a0for former secretary of State\u00a0Colin Powell and one voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, an environmental activist.\u00a0Electors in two other states who tried to vote against the state's winner were replaced with alternates. There may be additional defections in the remaining states, but since Trump now has a majority of the electoral votes, those would\u00a0not be enough to change the result. Latest updates ",

Emergency workers respond to the scene after a truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday. (Associated Press) Erik Kirschbaum German police said that nine people were killed and at least 50 injured when the driver of a 40-ton truck appeared to deliberately crash into a crowded outdoor Christmas market in the heart of Berlin Monday evening. Police said they are investigating whether it was an intentional attack on the market at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, one of dozens of such cherished pre-holiday markets throughout the city where hundreds of numbers of people gather for drinks, snacks and to shop for handmade Christmas presents. A police spokesman said that a man suspected of being the truck\u2019s driver had been detained several hundred yards away from the scene, and that a passenger in the truck had\u00a0died from injuries. \u201cWe have detained a suspect whose description matched that of the person said to be driving the truck and fled,\u201d Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf told reporters. \u201cThe passenger in the truck is dead. We\u2019re just at the start of our investigation.\u201d German TV networks showed police and rescue workers moving\u00a0around a\u00a0damaged black truck with several smashed windows. Germany has not\u00a0been hit by\u00a0major terror attacks\u00a0on\u00a0the scale that France and Belgium have seen\u00a0in the last year, but authorities have been on high alert for attacks like those in Paris, Nice and\u00a0Brussels\u00a0over the last 13 months.
