Nick Ut/AP hide caption toggle caption Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca leaves federal court in Los Angeles on Monday. Nick Ut/AP The judge has declared a mistrial in the corruption trial against former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca. The jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked after three days of deliberations, according to The Associated Press. It is now up to prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office about whether to retry Baca. Baca had initially pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about corruption and prisoner abuse in the county jail he oversaw, but this summer he changed his mind and rejected a plea deal. As The Two-Way has reported : \"Baca, 74, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, was the top elected law enforcement official in Los Angeles beginning in 1998. By withdrawing his plea, Baca chose to face trial. ... \"Baca retired under pressure in 2014 amid allegations of widespread abuse of inmates' civil rights. For example, Baca's jail staff was accused of assaulting unresisting inmates. Initially, Baca blamed the allegations on rogue officers . 'There is no institutional problem within the sheriff's department when it comes to correcting itself,' he said. \"But FBI agents found a deeply rooted culture of corruption in which sheriff's deputies actively attempted to thwart federal attempts to enlist a jailhouse informant.\" Article continues after sponsorship The Los Angeles Times reported that prosecutors argued during the trial \"that Baca resented the FBI's efforts to investigate his jails and believed sheriff's officials should, as he said in a TV news interview, 'police ourselves.' \" ",

By Elise Viebeck December 22 at 3:13 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Sean Spicer, right, and Jason Miller, left, talk with the media at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster on Nov. 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump named Republican National Committee official Sean Spicer as White House press secretary, filling what is likely to be a challenging position given Trump\u2019s sometimes hostile relationship with the media and his propensity to bypass staff to communicate directly with the public on Twitter. Spicer, the RNC\u2019s communications director since 2011 and chief strategist since 2015, has become an increasingly visible presence on Trump\u2019s team since the GOP nominee won the election on Nov. 8. Noted for his combative television interviews, he helps to lead daily transition news media calls and has a close relationship with RNC chairman Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff. Trump also announced that longtime aide Hope Hicks, his campaign press secretary, will serve as director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino will continue his current role as director of social media. Jason Miller, who leads the transition calls, will be communications director. [ Trump names campaign manager Kellyanne Conway as White House counselor to the president ] Spicer, Miller, Hicks and Scavino will all hold the title of assistant to the president, in addition to their other titles. \u201cSean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again.\u201d The announcement left open how Spicer, Miller and Hicks will divide up the communications work. Traditionally, the White House press secretary has served as the main conduit between the president and global media through daily news conferences. Priebus suggested last week that this practice could change in the new administration. \u201cLook, I think that many things have to change, and I think that it\u2019s important that we look at all of those traditions that are great, but quite frankly, as you know, don\u2019t really make news,\u201d Priebus said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cAnd you know, even looking at things like the daily White House briefing from the press secretary, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of different ways that things can be done, and I can assure you we\u2019re looking at that.\u201d Spicer went a bit further in a recent interview with Fox News. \u201cI think you have to look at everything. And so I don\u2019t know that it [the White House press briefing] needs to be daily. I don\u2019t know that they need to be on camera. And I think that\u2019s a view shared by a lot of former White House press secretaries, a view by some in the media, in fact, that the White House press briefings have become somewhat of a spectacle,\u201d Spicer told anchor Megyn Kelly on Dec. 15. The comments raised questions among transparency and press freedom advocates already concerned by limitations placed on the media by Trump\u2019s team. 1 of 31 ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump, who last week nominated as ambassador to Israel a bankruptcy lawyer who heads a fund-raising effort for a West Bank settlement, made clear on Thursday that he would not wait for his inauguration to weigh in. In a statement, he said bluntly that the resolution should be vetoed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAs the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201d Mr. Trump amplified his position by posting the statement on Facebook and Twitter as well. The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....cont: https://t.co/s8rXKKZNF1 \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 22, 2016 His words closely echoed the positions expressed by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a breath of fresh air after years of clashes with Mr. Obama. Mr. Netanyahu treated the impending United Nations vote as a crisis, staying up late into the night discussing it with aides and posting on his own Twitter account, at 3:28 a.m. local time, a message urging Mr. Obama to veto what he called the \u201canti-Israel\u201d resolution. He then canceled a public appearance later in the day and called a meeting of security cabinet ministers to address the matter. \u201cThe Israelis leaned on the Egyptians this morning to postpone the vote, and the Egyptians basically caved,\u201d said a Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic delicacy of the matter. The Egyptian Mission to the United Nations could not be reached for an immediate comment. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, who was visibly upset, said: \u201cHe is acting on behalf of Netanyahu.\u201d Mr. Mansour said Arab ambassadors had met Thursday and endorsed the draft, and that a committee of the Arab League was due to meet in Cairo to discuss the text. If the White House had let the resolution pass, it would have been a symbolic blow to the diplomatic shield that the United States has always offered Israel. It would also have sent a strong signal of international disapproval over the construction of settlements, which are widely regarded as illegal under international law. The draft resolution, offered by Egypt in its role as the Arab representative to the Council, called settlements \u201ca flagrant violation under international law\u201d and \u201ca major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution.\u201d It called on Israel to \u201cimmediately and completely cease all settlement activities\u201d in the occupied West Bank. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It also included a nod to Israel and its backers by condemning \u201call acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction.\u201d That amounts to diplomatic scolding of Palestinian leaders, whom Israel accuses of encouraging attacks on Israeli civilians. Egypt, one of Israel\u2019s most reliable partners in the Middle East and a longtime United States ally, announced that it would put up the draft measure for a vote after extensive consultations with fellow Arab diplomats. The vote was scheduled for Thursday at 3 p.m. But by midmorning, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered his diplomats to pull the resolution. The Obama administration vetoed a 2011 resolution condemning settlements, and in 2013, another resolution did not muster enough votes to pass. According to Security Council Report, an independent research organization, the United States has vetoed 30 resolutions regarding Israel and the Palestinians, plus a dozen more regarding Israel and Lebanon or Syria, more than half of its 77 vetoes since the United Nations was founded in 1946. To be adopted, a resolution needs at least nine votes and no vetoes by the Council\u2019s five permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. Palestinian officials and other United Nations diplomats had said they thought the chances of passage were high. Part of the administration\u2019s calculation is likely to be based on Israel\u2019s own actions. Mr. Obama has not had a good relationship with Mr. Netanyahu, and the White House has consistently criticized Israel\u2019s continued settlement activities. The fight over the resolution comes amid another heated settlement battle unfolding in Israel. The government plans to relocate residents of Amona , a West Bank outpost that even Israel\u2019s Supreme Court declared illegal, to a nearby hilltop that Palestinians and their supporters believe is equally problematic. The court on Thursday agreed to a 45-day delay in the evacuation of Amona, putting off that fight, too, for another time. The United Nations resolution also represents the Obama administration\u2019s last chance to weigh in on the sharply deteriorating prospects for peace, and indeed the cornerstone of United States policy: a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador-designate, David M. Friedman , has suggested that Israel annex the West Bank, has denounced the two-state solution, and has likened Jewish members of the lobbying group J Street to \u201ckapos\u201d that cooperated with the Nazis. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Friedman, an Orthodox Jew who has an apartment in Jerusalem, is also a major backer of settlements, serving as president of an American fund-raising group that supports a yeshiva in Beit El, a religious settlement deep in the West Bank. Mr. Trump and Mr. Friedman have also said they plan to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, something counter to longstanding bipartisan policy that could yield ire throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Israel considers Jerusalem, including territory it captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, as its undivided capital, but the Palestinians see the holy city as the capital of their future state. Washington has long insisted that Jerusalem\u2019s status can only be determined through negotiations as part of a broader peace agreement.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune N'DIGO publisher Hermene Hartman took a political risk when she became an early and prominent African-American supporter of Rahm Emanuel 's first run for mayor in 2011. So she may have felt her bold rejection of \"consensus\" black candidate Carol Moseley Braun gave her clout. How else to explain her chutzpah in writing an email directly to Emanuel in December 2014, asking him personally to tear up $225 worth of parking tickets? An indignant Hartman, 69, wrote Emanuel to complain that \"I feel like I have gifted the city with a donation or that I have been robbed\" after she'd been given three tickets for parking with the wrong city sticker on her windshield on her South Loop block. \"It is a DAMN shame that you cannot park your car in front of your house without being ticketed,\" she continued, complaining that it had not been clear to her that she needed to buy a city sticker with her residential zone printed on it. \"I am requesting that you consider waiving this fee and issue me a refund,\" she added. \"I am hopeful that the police of our city are as diligent in fighting crime as they are in issuing parking tickets to law abiding and tax paying citizens.\" The email was released by the mayor's attorney Wednesday as part of a settlement of a lawsuit with the Better Government Association. No response from Emanuel, if there was any, was included, and his office did not immediately say what help, if any, the mayor gave Hartman. ",

USA TODAY President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Dec. 21, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump Thursday decried the state of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal,\u00a0saying in a tweet that it had to be strengthened \u201cgreatly\u201d during uncertain times. \u201cThe United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,\u201d he tweeted. Trump made his remarks a day after receiving a national security briefing from a group of mostly senior military officers, including Air Force\u00a0 Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein , deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 A nuclear arms reduction expert reacted to Trump's tweet with alarm. Joseph\u00a0Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund , said similar statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin could trigger a new and destabilizing nuclear arms race. The United States\u00a0and Russia have 95%\u00a0of the world's nuclear weapons, but smaller nuclear powers, such as China, North Korea, India and Pakistan, may view their statements as a call to bolster their own arsenals, he said. Read more: U.S., Russia dominate nuclear weapons list \"If the two guys with the biggest arsenals are talking about expanding, they're\u00a0sending a message to the other guys that it's time to start their engines,\" Cirincione said. \"And we\u2019re off to the races.\" An alternative, Cirincione suggested, would be for Trump and Putin to establish a relationship in which arms reduction is a centerpiece. \"He could assure his place his place in the history books with the deal of a lifetime,\" Cirincione said. Later Thursday afternoon, Jason Miller, Trump's communications director, said Trump was referring to potential nuclear terrorism and other issues. \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,\" Miller said in a statement. \"He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\u201d None of that was clear in Trump's initial tweet, and the president-elect did not speak publicly or send another tweet with more information. What's a triad? During the campaign for the Republican nomination and the general election, Trump struggled to show a firm grasp of U.S. nuclear strategy and capability. In a Republican debate, Trump failed to define the \u201cnuclear triad,\u201d the U.S. nuclear strategy of relying on three weapons platforms to launch weapons \u2014\u00a0bombers, land-based missiles and submarine-launched missiles. The decades-long strategy is meant to deter enemies from attacking because they will be unable to prevent a devastating response. Trump has also suggested that U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, all of whom rely on the U.S. nuclear deterrent, could acquire nuclear weapons for their own defense. The Pentagon, in its 2017, budget has several initiatives aimed at modernizing its nuclear arsenal. Among them is a $2.1 billion program to develop a new, radar-evading long-range bomber. A Russian nuclear submarine. \u00a0(Photo: Roustem Adagamov, AP) In a 2015 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obama administration plans to modernize the nation's nuclear forces would cost nearly $350 billion over a 10-year period. Robert Jervis, professor of international affairs at Columbia University and an expert on nuclear weapons, downplayed the notion that Trump\u2019s tweet would set off a new arms race. More troubling, he said, is that there\u2019s no evidence that Trump has thought long or hard about the policies for maintain and using them. Does he want to spend more than the $350 billion the Obama administration has proposed to modernize them, Jervis asked? What happens if Putin rejects his offers for better relations? The problems are complex, and the stakes exceedingly high, he said. \u201cUnless we\u2019re being fooled and he\u2019s done great thinking, these tweets are off the top of his head and are immediate responses,\u201d said Jervis, who acknowledged being a lifelong Democrat. \u201cIf you try to dig deep there isn\u2019t anything there. There\u2019s a reason states don\u2019t communicate in 140 characters without serious staff work.\u201d Gen David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, has emphasized the importance of the service's nuclear mission during a trip this week to air bases around the country. He spent a night in a missile alert facility in Nebraska and met with crew members and security personnel there. He has said the Air Force's top priority is maintaining a safe, secure and effective nuclear enterprise. The world has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of nuclear weapons in the last 25 years, Pentagon records show. Dec. 12 was the 25th anniversary of the\u00a0 Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 Since then, Pentagon statistics show, more than 7,600 nuclear warheads have been deactivated, while the United States, Russia and former Soviet republics have destroyed more than 3,600 missiles and missile launchers, 33 submarines, 155 bombers, more than 1.6 million chemical munitions, and more than 4,000 metric tons of chemical weapons.

    "text": "Aides to Mr. Trump, asked to clarify what the president-elect meant by the need to \u201cexpand\u201d the nuclear ability of the United States, responded with a statement that did not address that point. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jason Miller, the incoming White House communications director, said in a statement that Mr. Trump was referring to \u201cthe threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes.\u201d Mr. Miller added that the president-elect had in the past \u201cemphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\u201d Mr. Trump, in a Twitter post on Thursday, appeared to announce his new nuclear strategy. Here is what he might have meant. It was the second time in two days that aides had tried to recast a statement from Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, the president-elect appeared to say that recent terror attacks in Europe had vindicated his campaign pledge to bar Muslims from entering the United States. Aides later said he was merely restating his promise to implement strict vetting and suspend the admission of people from countries associated with terrorism. The vagueness of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on the country\u2019s nuclear abilities made it difficult to assess its possible impact on foreign policy once he takes office. Nuclear weapons are so fearsome that only a president can order their use, and deterrence is normally a complicated subject debated in academic treatises and negotiated over years by diplomats, and not normally in thoughts limited to 140 characters. It remained unclear from his use of the word \u201cexpand\u201d whether Mr. Trump would try to reverse agreements such as the New Start treaty , which Russia and the United States signed in 2010 and commits both nations to modest reductions in strategic nuclear forces. But the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s post \u2014 if it signals the beginning of a new era of nuclear weapons expansion in the United States \u2014 could be profound. Derek Johnson, the executive director of Global Zero , a group that seeks the elimination of nuclear weapons, accused Mr. Trump of calling for a \u201cnew nuclear arms race,\u201d even as Mr. Putin appears eager for a major expansion of Russian nuclear abilities. \u201cThe use of even a single nuclear weapon, anywhere in the world, would be a global humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in a statement. \u201cA nuclear buildup in the U.S. and Russia only makes that nightmare scenario more likely.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The United States and Russia are already racing to modernize their existing nuclear arsenals, replacing aging missile systems with smaller, more modern weapons that are harder to stop and more precise. That effort by Moscow and Washington, while allowed by current arms control treaties, has nonetheless caused fears of renewing a kind of Cold War-era arms race as the two nations seek technological dominance.

Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press The United States is also moving ahead with a modest system of missile defenses in Europe, a program that has deeply angered the Kremlin, which rejects arguments that it is aimed solely at the threat from Iran. But if Mr. Trump also intends to increase the number of America\u2019s nuclear weapons, it could represent a significant break in strategic policy that dates to talks between the two nations that began under President Richard M. Nixon. It could also be a drastic reversal of President Obama\u2019s approach. In one of his first major speeches in 2009, Mr. Obama told a cheering crowd in Prague that the United States would lead an effort to pursue rules and treaties that would result in a world without any nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama has had some limited success in pursuing that vision during his eight years in office. He convened a regular nuclear nonproliferation summit meeting aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear material with special concerns about terror groups gaining access to these materials. Mr. Obama negotiated a deal with Iran that his administration says would delay that government\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. But during Mr. Obama\u2019s time in office, North Korea has conducted several nuclear weapons tests. Contrary to Mr. Obama\u2019s own conciliatory nuclear posture, and concrete steps in that direction, his administration has also embarked on a sweeping modernization of the American nuclear arsenal that is estimated to cost up to $1 trillion over three decades. It features new factories, refurbished nuclear arms and a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. The bombers are to carry a new super-stealthy cruise missile meant to slip through enemy air defenses. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons even though he called their potential use \u201ca horror.\u201d Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

(Photo: Richard Drew, AP) Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, and their three young children were confronted on a JetBlue flight by a hostile\u00a0passenger who was subsequently kicked off the plane Thursday for causing \"conflict.\" Trump, 35, the eldest of President-elect Trump's five children, was preparing to travel on a JetBlue flight out of New York's JFK International Airport\u00a0when a male passenger berated her, demanding to know why she was on the flight and, according to TMZ , telling her, \u201cYour father is ruining the country!\u201d \u201cWhy is she on our flight? She should be riding private,\u201d the man, later identified as Daniel Goldstein, exclaimed, TMZ reported. Another passenger told TMZ that Trump ignored the man and distracted her kids with crayons\u00a0before he was escorted off the flight. As he was removed, the man yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re kicking me off for expressing my opinion?\u201d Goldstein's husband, Hunter College professor Matthew Lasner , said on Twitter that he and his husband were kicked off the flight after Goldstein \"expressed displeasure\" about flying with Trump. Lasner also tweeted that his husband was chasing the couple down in the terminal \"to harass them.\" He\u00a0has since deleted his Twitter account but savvy Twitter users resurrected some of his tweets.

The airline said\u00a0the couple was rebooked for the next available flight. \"The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly,\" according to an airline statement emailed to USA TODAY. \"If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. In this instance, our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight.\" A spokeswoman for the Trump family declined comment but did not dispute the accounts, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, tweeters poured scorn on the ejected couple for \"harassing\" a mother and her children. Wish I was on the @IvankaTrump flight.

Vice President Joe Biden during a campaign rally in Virginia on the eve of the November election. After his speech, Biden remarked backstage on the lack of apparent enthusiasm for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. (Molly Riley / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli Contact Reporter Over a career in elected public office lasting more than 46 years, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. has seen campaigns from the rudimentary, family-run effort that first launched him unexpectedly to the U.S. Senate as a 29-year-old to the sophisticated, data-driven juggernaut that helped elect him and Barack Obama twice to the nation\u2019s highest offices. But rarely has he trusted anything as much as his own gut instinct, attuned to the middle- and working-class sensibilities of his former neighbors in towns like Scranton, Pa., and Claymont, Del. And so as he sat in his office one day in October and\u00a0watched footage of a Donald Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., not far from his childhood home, Biden sensed trouble. \u201cSon of a gun. We may lose this election,\u201d Biden said,\u00a0recalling his reaction\u00a0during an interview in his West Wing office. \u201cThey\u2019re all the people I grew up with. They\u2019re their kids. And they\u2019re not racist. They\u2019re not sexist. But we didn\u2019t talk to them.\u201d They\u2019re all the people I grew up with. They\u2019re their kids. And they\u2019re not racist. They\u2019re not sexist. But we didn\u2019t talk to them. \u2014 Joe Biden, vice president Now, as the Democratic Party struggles to understand what went wrong in an election that left them with the least power\u00a0in state and federal offices in decades, that same instinct leads\u00a0Biden\u00a0to offer a diagnosis and a prescription for\u00a0what he sees as a more successful approach, one which pushes back, if ever-so-gently, against a powerful current in Democratic politics. It begins, in typical Biden fashion, with a reference to\u00a0family wisdom. \u201cMy dad used to have an expression. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect them to understand it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI believe that we were not letting an awful lot of people \u2014 high school-educated, mostly Caucasian, but also people of color \u2014 know that we understood their problems.\u201d There\u2019s \u201ca bit of elitism that\u2019s crept in\u201d to party thinking, he worries,\u00a0setting up what he sees as the\u00a0false impression that progressive values are inconsistent with working-class values. \u201cWhat are the arguments we\u2019re hearing? \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to be more progressive.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying we should be less progressive,\u201d he said, adding that he would \u201cstack my progressive credentials against anyone\u201d in the party. \u201cWe should be proud of where the hell we are, and not yield an inch. But,\u201d he added,\u00a0\u201cin the meantime, you can\u2019t eat equality. You know?\u201d He also distinguishes what he describes as\u00a0the middle-class agenda that President Obama has put forth from the more populist, anti-Wall Street message that helped power Bernie Sanders\u2019 rise in the Democratic primary. \u201cI like Bernie,\u201d Biden said, adding he agrees with the Vermont senator\u00a0on many issues. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think 500 billionaires caused all our problems.\u201d :: It was election eve, and\u00a0Biden had just concluded the last of 83 campaign events he would headline on Hillary Clinton \u2019s behalf. Something once again didn\u2019t feel right. Stepping off the stage after an at-times sentimental appearance in northern Virginia with Sen. Tim Kaine , the man he hoped would succeed him, the vice president shared a nagging concern with aides:\u00a0Any enthusiasm among the crowd of several thousand was not about the party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see any Hillary signs,\u201d Biden recalled. \u201cEvery time I talked about Hillary they listened. But \u2026\u201d Biden\u2019s speech that night mirrors his message to Democrats now. ",

A \"significant\" Islamic State-inspired Christmas Day terror plot targeting central Melbourne has been foiled after a series of arrests in raids across the city, police said on December 23, 2016. (Photo: WILLIAM WEST, AFP/Getty Images) Australian authorities say they have broken up a\u00a0Christmas Day plot to set off bombs in Melbourne, the country's second-largest city. Dubbing their investigation \"Operation Kastelholm,\" Victoria police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization said Friday that five people are being held in connection with the plot. All of them are listed as having Australian addresses. \"It will be alleged four of the men arrested were involved in undertaking preparations for planning a terrorist act in Melbourne,\" Victoria police said in a statement, adding that \"the threat has been contained and there is no on-going threat.\" The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne \u2014 26-year-old man and 20-year-old woman \u2014 were released without being charged, a police statement said. Five men between ages 21 and 26 remained in custody. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship, police said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. Ashton said police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device,\" Ashton said. He added: \"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" About 400 police officers were involved in the raids.

    "text": "Republicans accuse Dems of 'hypocrisy' after 'bathroom bill' repeal falls apart Published               December 22, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 North Carolina Republican leaders are blasting their Democratic colleagues after a supposedly bipartisan deal to repeal the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d limiting LGBT protections collapsed Wednesday night, with every Senate Democrat balking in the end. Both sides were pointing fingers in the aftermath of the unproductive special session, called specifically to consider repeal legislation for the law known as House Bill 2. The law omits gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people from state anti-discrimination protections, bars local governments from passing broad non-discrimination ordinances covering them, and orders transgender people to use bathrooms and showers that align with their sex at birth. \"I'm disappointed that we have yet to remove the stain from the reputation of our great state that is around this country and around the world,\" Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper said. But Republicans put the blame squarely on Democrats, noting that all 16 Senate Democrats voted against the repeal legislation in the end. Republicans in the Senate fell on both sides of the issue, with some voting to repeal and some voting against. Senate leader Phil Berger, a Republican, blamed Cooper and his allies for sinking the effort. He issued a lengthy statement on Facebook and Twitter accusing Democrats of \u201chypocrisy\u201d and accusing them of using the controversy for political gain. See the HYPOCRISY for yourself. Every Democrat in the Senate voted AGAINST repealing HB 2: https://t.co/7SJwDEm5nb #NCGA #NCPOL pic.twitter.com/3LS3N4pa3j \u2014 Senator Phil Berger (@SenatorBerger) December 22, 2016 \u201cThis should tell you all you need to know about Cooper and Senate Democrats\u2019 motives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t interested in moving past this issue or protecting the privacy and safety of North Carolina families. They\u2019re brass-knuckled politicians who want to wage a nasty culture war with divisive issues, so they can keep filling their campaign coffers with cash from fringe liberal activists.\u201d GOP legislators who see themselves as business-friendly appeared shaken by a months-long backlash as major companies like BASF, IBM and Bank of America described HB2 as bad for business. The compromise touted by both Cooper and outgoing GOP Gov. Pat McCrory called for Charlotte to do away with its own expanded antidiscrimination ordinance. In exchange, lawmakers would undo the LGBT law. But some conservatives never wanted to repeal the law. And when the Senate bill went a step further and called for a months-long ban on cities passing similar ordinances, Democrats said Republicans were going back on their promise.\u00a0 Cooper reportedly said GOP leaders \u201cbroke the deal\u201d by adding the local ordinance moratorium.\u00a0 Berger, however, noted that the Senate ended up splitting the bill into two parts, allowing a straight vote on the repeal only. It still failed. \u201cAll 16 of them voted NO. Why? Politics. Hypocrisy. And Roy Cooper,\u201d he wrote. North Carolina GOP Chairman Robin Hayes accused Democrats of \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Social conservatives also opposed the repeal for their own reasons, defending the law's transgender bathroom requirement -- which has no enforcement or punishment provisions -- as necessary to prevent heterosexual predators from masquerading as transgender to molest women and girls when they are vulnerable. \"We continue to encourage our leaders to never sacrifice the privacy, safety, or freedom of young girls by forcing them to use the bathroom, shower, or change clothes with grown men just to satisfy the demands of greedy businesses, immoral sports organizations, or angry mobs,\" North Carolina Values Coalition Executive Director Tami Fitzgerald said in a statement. HB2 has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in conventions, jobs and sporting events such as the NBA All-Star Game shunning North Carolina. Corporate critics of the law included Deutsche Bank and Paypal, which both backed out of projects that would have brought hundreds of jobs to the state. \"The NCAA's decision to withhold championships from North Carolina remains unchanged,\" spokesman Bob Williams said. McCrory signed the law and became its national face. HB2, along with other right-leaning bills he signed, turned this fall's gubernatorial campaign into a referendum on the state's recent conservative slant. He lost by about 10,000 votes to Cooper. Meanwhile, fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. McCrory, the first sitting North Carolina governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election, echoed Republican accusations that \"the left sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes.\" Repealing the state law could also have ended protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access.

The only confirmed talent so far are 16-year-old \"America\u2019s Got Talent\" 2010 runner-up Jackie Evancho, the\u00a0Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and the Rockettes. Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway insisted to ABC News there will be more singers, but refused to name them. Many performers -- some who have been asked, others who have not -- have already taken a pass.\u00a0 SYLVESTER STALLONE WON'T GO FOR JOB IN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Gene Simmons' wife told\u00a0 TMZ \u00a0KISS \"politely declined\" the invitation to perform at the inauguration. Simmons said he would be touring Europe at the time. Trump's longtime friend Steve Wynn reportedly promised to deliver Celine Dion to perform at the\u00a0inauguration, but could not follow through. Producer David Foster released a statement \u201cpolitely declining\u201d the offer to participate in the inauguration after rumors swirled he was participating. Elton John told the New York Times he was not performing after Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the presidential transition team,\u00a0told the BBC the singer would sing a song or two. Page Six reported that Andrea Bocelli will not perform because of the backlash he received over accepting the gig. They also reported that President-Elect Trump suggested the tenor not participate because of said backlash. Variety and the NY Post have reported that Garth Brooks will not perform at the inauguration after\u00a0 he said earlier this month he \"would be honored\" \u00a0to perform. Brooks did not return FOX411\u2019s request for comment. The manager for the band Chainsmokers had to respond to New York Magazine\u2019s Brian Feldman after he tweeted the band was performing. They are not. \u201cWill and Grace\u201d star Eric McCormack told The Wrap he would perform at the inauguration, but only in exchange for a lobotomy, adding: \"My whole brain removed from my head\u2026I don\u2019t know what the line-up will be, but I hear Scott Baio\u2019s doing dramatic readings.\u201d There is no indication that McCormack was asked. But for those who expect a good dose of entertainment with their inauguration, there's still hope! ALEC BALDWIN PLANS DONALD TRUMP ON 'SNL' FOR HOW MUCH? A spokesperson for the Beach Boys told FOX411 that the band has been asked to play at the inauguration but \u201cno decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate.\u201d And what about those other celebs who have supported Trump like Kid Rock and Kanye West? Or Ted Nugent or Paris Hilton or any of the other vocal celebs that have publicly endorsed Trump along the way? Those celebs did not return FOX411\u2019s request for comment. Which isn't a no. Trump's team did not respond to our request for comment, either. You can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA . Advertisement ",

Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images A woman is vaccinated at a health center in Conakry, Guinea, during the clinical trials of a vaccine against the Ebola virus. Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images When Ebola struck West Africa a few years ago, the world was defenseless. There was no cure. No vaccine. And the result was catastrophic: More than 11,000 people died. Nearly 30,000 were infected. Now it looks like such a large outbreak is unlikely to ever happen again. Ever. The world now has a potent weapon against Ebola: a vaccine that brings outbreaks to a screeching halt, scientists report Thursday in The Lancet. \"We were able to estimate the efficacy of the vaccine as being 100 percent in a trial with more than 5,000 people,\" says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who helped test the vaccine. \"It's very unusual to have a vaccine that protects people perfectly.\" Now, no vaccine \u2014 or drug for that matter \u2014 is perfect. And efficacy of the vaccine is clearly high but not \"100 percent.\" That value reflects the fact that they just haven't tested the vaccine on enough people yet. So it is likely to decrease as the vaccine is used over time. In the end, the efficacy is likely to sit somewhere between about 70 percent and 100 percent, Longini says. Article continues after sponsorship By comparison, the flu vaccine last year was about 50 percent effective. And the Ebola vaccine works lightning fast, within four or five days, he says. So it could even be given after a person is exposed to Ebola but hasn't yet developed the disease. Longini and his colleagues tested the vaccine on about 4,000 people in Guinea back in 2015, when Ebola was still spreading there. These people were at high risk of getting Ebola because they had had contact with someone who was infected. When they got the vaccine right away, they were completely protected. No one got sick. The vaccine \u2014 called rVSV-ZEBOV \u2014 hasn't been approved yet by either the World Health Organization or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That's predicted to happen sometime in 2018. And there are still a few open questions about the vaccine, says Dr. Anthony Fauci , at the National Institutes of Health. \"For example, we don't know how durable the vaccine is,\" he says. \"If you give health care workers the vaccine, for example, how long would they be protected? That's very important to learn.\" What is clear is that the vaccine offers short-term protection during outbreaks. And that's exactly what's needed to stop the virus from spreading and keep small outbreaks from getting out of control. For this reason, GAVI \u2014 the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \u2014 has already spent $5 million to stockpile the vaccine. \"So we have made 300,000 doses available, as of earlier this year, if there was to be sort of any resurgence or any kind of emergency,\" says Swati Gupta at Merck , which is manufacturing the shot. Vaccines typically take years, even a decade to test. But the field trials for this one took less than two years. \"It's been a pretty tremendous experience,\" Gupta says. \"There's been a lot of international partners that have come together in a real unprecedented effort.\" The magnitude of the outbreak in West Africa, she says, made companies, governments and academics push aside their own research agendas to come together and finish a vaccine.

Since winning the election, Trump has said America's \"one-China\" policy regarding China and Taiwan is up for negotiation , tweeted that the US should refuse to accept an underwater drone seized and returned by China, criticized the intelligence community's findings on Russian hacking, and threatened to reverse ongoing overtures toward Cuba unless the Cuban government meets unspecified conditions.

Later in the day, Trump tweeted that the United States \"must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" Incoming leaders have typically abided by a \"one president at a time\" rule in order to avoid sending mixed messages and to give themselves time to consult intelligence and confer with their incoming cabinet and inherited civil service. \"It's confusing,\" Stephen Hess, a policy analyst at Brookings who has worked under presidents from both parties, said. \"The president-elect doesn't really have the power to do these things and, while suggesting them at this time, it may look very different to him after January 20.\" Related: Trump Stuns Nuclear Experts With Apparent Call to Expand Arsenal Trump shattered a variety of norms during the campaign and often complained about an atmosphere of \"political correctness\" that he said had prevented politicians from speaking plainly about challenges facing the country. Critics are concerned that his often unpredictable style could create problems for both his incoming administration and the current one. Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA) told NBC News he was so alarmed by Trump's behavior that he introduced the \"One President at a Time Act\" earlier this month, which would clarify that the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from conducting foreign policy, also applies to incoming presidents. \"In the past, president-elects have shown good judgement and restraint in understanding that our duly elected officials need to conduct foreign policy while they're in office,\" Huffman said. \"We've never had a president-elect with such impulse control problems.\" Modern presidents have used nearly identical language to skirt questions on foreign affairs during their transition. President Bill Clinton told the press after his 1992 victory that he would \"reaffirm the essential continuity of American foreign policy\" and recognized \"that America has only one president at a time.\" President George W. Bush declined questions on topics like North Korea and Israel until he took the oath of office in early 2001. \"We have one president, and we'll have one president, and the current president is President Clinton, and our nation must speak with one voice,\" Bush said at a press conference. Obama took a similar stance after his election in 2008, telling reporters that \"when it comes to foreign affairs, it is particularly important to emphasize that there is one president at a time\" after declining a question on Israeli operations in Gaza. He notably repeated the phrase last month after Trump's election, reminding the press that \"there is one president at a time\" before embarking to meet foreign leaders in Greece, Germany, and Peru.

The emails show he used his personal email accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. Emails of Mayor Rahm Emanuel have been released under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits. The emails show he used his personal email accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Ally Marotti and Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel is just as bullish on Chicago business in private emails as he is in public. Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, the mayor on Wednesday turned over about 2,700 pages of emails from his personal accounts that his attorney determined were government-related. Though many of the emails are short, and the mayor's only involvement often was forwarding them to an aide, they show Emanuel using his personal accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. They also show that business leaders knew how to reach him outside of his government email address. The emails reveal Emanuel's desire to bring a PayPal operations center to the city, and his reluctance to \"bash\" one of the city's largest private-sector employers. There are also emails with big asks from companies like Airbnb and H.J. Heinz. United Airlines Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... In April 2014, investment banker Byron Trott sent an email to Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... (Rick Pearson, David Heinzmann and Jeff Coen) Jonathan Tisch, co-chairman of the board of Loews, chairman and CEO of its Loews Hotel subsidiary and chairman emeritus of the United States Travel Association, emailed Emanuel in May, seeking to rebut airlines' concerns about competition from Middle Eastern airlines allegedly receiving unfair subsidies. Emanuel responded that he was unlikely to square off against Chicago-based United Continental Holdings. \"I dont (sic) plan on being like some mayors and bash my largest private sector employer,\" Emanuel wrote in an email last May. \"That said please send someone to brief us.\" United's name popped up again in a July 1 exchange between Emanuel and Kirkland & Ellis attorney William Singer, who sent Emanuel a copy of a letter to Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans. Singer said the letter explained a United proposal that reflects \"short term, but significant growth for O'Hare\" and that United is \"fully committed to the city's long term growth and expansion plans.\" The email exchange doesn't offer details on the proposal, but Emanuel appeared frustrated by the pace of progress and lack of detailed plans. \"If you all expected yippie lets go you got the wrong mayor,\" he said. Still, he said he told the aviation commissioner to give the proposal \"her full attention,\" signing off with \"be bold.\" Kraft Heinz Before H.J. Heinz completed its purchase of Kraft Foods Group in July 2015, an executive emailed then-deputy mayor Steve Koch to push the state and city to spell out what tax breaks they would be willing to offer to put some of the combined company's jobs in Chicago. \"If the state and Chicago are not going to offer a significant tax incentive program that will weight heavenly (sic) in our decision on how many jobs remain in Illinois given how aggressive Pennsylvania is being,\" senior vice president of corporate and government affairs Michael Mullen wrote in a June 2015 email. The email was shared with Emanuel, whose reply to Koch was redacted. A few weeks after Kraft, then based in north suburban Northfield, and Pittsburgh-based Heinz combined to form the third-largest food and beverage company in the U.S., Kraft Heinz announced it would move the Northfield headquarters to downtown Chicago's Aon Center. Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, Mayor Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... (Bill Ruthhart, Hal Dardick and Jeff Coen) Kraft Heinz ended up not getting any tax incentives related to the move, Mullen said in an email to the Tribune Thursday. \"The Mayor and his staff were instrumental in our decision to move downtown and we appreciate their ongoing cooperation and partnership,\" he said. PayPal Emanuel reached out to PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready in October, to figure out why the San Jose, Calif.-based company passed over Chicago as a location for an operations center. Other cities offered better incentives, Ready explained in his lengthy response. He specifically mentioned Illinois' EDGE program, which provides tax breaks for companies that bring jobs to the state. Mayor Rahm Emanuel turned over about 2,700 pages of emails Wednesday as part of a settlement with the Better Government Association, which had sued for the mayor's communications about official business on his personal email accounts.

A Chicago Tribune suit on similar issues, filed before the BGA... (Chicago Tribune) \"We are unable to monetize a majority of the credits being offered to the company before they expire.\" The top contending city was offering cash grants and refundable tax credits, Ready wrote. That reasoning was news to Emanuel. \"Somewhere there is a breakdown of information,\" he replied. There is still time for Chicago, and the potential operations center is part of a bigger strategy, Ready said in an email Oct. 28. PayPal representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Airbnb The city's new shared-housing ordinance and how it would affect Airbnb hosts was a hot topic in the mayor's inbox. Investor Marc Andreessen emailed Emanuel in November 2015, asking him to meet with Chris Lehane, Airbnb's head of global policy, to discuss Chicago's regulatory plans. Emanuel's private emails released These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 See more videos Airbnb representatives said they thought Emanuel wasn't \"fully aware of what the bureaucrats have been working on,\" according to an email Andreessen forwarded to the mayor. Asking for the meeting seemed to be a drastic measure: In one of the emails, Andreessen's people call it an \"unusual ask\" by Airbnb. Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit said in a statement that the home-sharing company works with cities worldwide on clear and progressive home-sharing rules. \"Speaking with policymakers and community leaders is essential to crafting home-sharing rules that work for everyone,\" he said. The implementation of the ordinance has since been delayed and tweaked after being challenged by a couple of lawsuits. Talking up Chicago Occasionally, Emanuel sent emails to Chicago executives and other heavy hitters from his private account touting positive news about the city. On Sept. 1, he sent four dozen people, including United CEO Oscar Munoz, Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld and McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook the same email, with personalized salutations, highlighting improvements in Chicago Public Schools students' test scores and Fitch Ratings agency's decision to shift the city's credit outlook from \"negative\" to \"stable.\" ",

Hunter Schafer of Raleigh holds a sign in favor of repealing North Carolina HB2 during a special session of the General Assembly on Wednesday. (Ben McKeown / Associated Press) Jenny Jarvie After North Carolina lawmakers refused to repeal House Bill 2, the law that curbs legal protections for LGBT people and has cost the state millions of dollars in boycotts and lost jobs, Democrats and Republicans took to a predictable pattern: blaming each other for the unraveling of the deal. The failure to repeal the measure\u00a0ensures that North Carolina politics will remained deeply divided as Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper takes office Jan. 1, and the issue of LGBT protections will continue to be a source of contention in state and national politics in 2017. Many were shocked Monday when leaders of the liberal city of Charlotte and the Republican state of North Carolina announced they had come to a deal to get rid of HB2. The plan, concocted by the Democratic governor-elect and outgoing Republican Gov. Pat McCrory , was relatively simple \u2013 but\u00a0it depended on Charlotte leaders rescinding part of the city\u2019s\u00a0anti-discrimination ordinance, which expanded LGBT protections and allowed transgender people to choose restrooms according to the gender with which they identify.\u00a0HB2 was initially proposed in reaction to that ordinance.\u00a0 For months, Charlotte\u2019s leaders had refused to do that. But on Monday, in an unexpected about-face, they announced they had repealed their ordinance. McCrory then upheld his part of the bargain, summoning state legislators to a special session Wednesday to repeal HB2. Republican leaders thought they had reached a compromise that would allow the state to move past the controversial law. But in the end, any bill they could get rural Republicans to support, they could not get Democrats to sign up on. After a long day of backroom negotiating behind closed doors, Republican Senate leaders offered a bill that repealed HB2 while introducing a moratorium, or \u201ccooling-off period,\u201d that would prevent local governments across the state from crafting or changing anti-discrimination ordinances. Democrats refused to sign. It may have been\u00a0doomed from the beginning.It started off with both sides wanting a pound of flesh from the other side, and it just went downhill from there. \u2014 Michael Bitzer, politics professor \u201cIt may have been\u00a0doomed from the beginning,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., who noted that many rural Republicans, who face re-election next year, would face outrage from their constituents if they repealed HB2. \u201cIt started off with both sides wanting a pound of flesh from the other side, and it just went downhill from there.\u201d The evening before Wednesday\u2019s special session, rural Republicans who opposed repealing the law were rattled when they found out Charlotte leaders had only partially repealed the nondiscrimination\u00a0ordinance. Swiftly, the city council held an emergency meeting Wednesday morning to fully repeal all the changes it made in February. But that did not allay\u00a0Republican suspicion. In the end, both the House and Senate adjourned without repealing the bill. \"Today the legislature had the chance to do the right thing for North Carolina\u00a0and they failed,\u201d Cooper said at a late-night press conference Wednesday, noting that he and his staff had consulted with legislators, businesses and activists for more than a week to build momentum for repeal. \u201cRepublican legislative leaders have broken their word to me and they have broken their trust with the people of North Carolina.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, folks. I don\u2019t trust them and our folks don\u2019t trust them,\u201d Republican\u00a0Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the Senate adjourned late Wednesday, blasting both Cooper and Charlotte\u2019s Democratic mayor, Jennifer Roberts. \u201cThey give us no reason to trust them\u201d Charlotte's LGBT residents do not face any immediate legal consequences after city officials rescinded the changes to its anti-discrimination ordinance \u2013 those components of the ordinance were already overruled by HB2. Charlotte officials cannot introduce fresh LGBT protections as the state law precludes local authorities from introducing such measures. \u201cWhile we are disappointed with this unfortunate outcome, our commitment to maintaining and protecting diverse and inclusive communities remains unchanged,\u201d the city of Charlotte said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to work with our partners at the state and local levels to develop a solution that protects the rights of individuals.\u201d The failure to repeal HB2 represents a blow not just to the LGBT community but to the entire state of North Carolina, said Chris Sgro, a Democratic representative and executive director of Equality NC. \u201cWith HB2 still on the books and the Charlotte Ordinance fully repealed we will only continue to lose businesses and put LGBTQ North Carolinians in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe North Carolina General Assembly Leadership has made clear today that North Carolina remains closed for business.\" On Thursday, LGBT advocacy groups and civil rights organizations vowed to ratchet up political and economic pressure on the state. The leader of the North Carolina branch of the NAACP said he planned to request a national NAACP economic boycott of the state after the General Assembly\u2019s failure Wednesday to repeal HB2. \"Some people like to say this is Democrat versus Republican, but this is extremism,\" North Carolina NAACP President William Barber said, noting that HB2 was just one of many conservative moves by Republicans in the last month. \"This is an out of control, extremist legislature, and we have to resist it in North Carolina before it spreads through the South and across the rest of the country.\u201d HB2 orders school and public agencies to require people to use multiple-occupancy restrooms based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.\u00a0The law, which also prevents cities from extending anti-discrimination laws to LBGT people and from passing any increase in the $7.25 minimum wage, generated economic boycotts and strong condemnation from major corporations including Apple, Google and Microsoft. PayPal abandoned its plan to bring 400 jobs to the state;\u00a0entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam canceled concerts;\u00a0and major sporting leagues such as the NBA, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference\u00a0pulled championships and games from Charlotte. \u00a0 Two months after the bill was signed, Charlotte\u2019s Chamber of Commerce estimated the law\u2019s economic impact on Mecklenburg County at $285 million, in addition to a loss of more than 1,300 Charlotte-area jobs. Republicans and Democrats appear divided on the possibility of a future repeal. \"I think today was our best shot,\" said Brian Turner, a Democratic representative. \"I don't think there's going to be another opportunity.\" The problem, he said, was that Republican leaders could not seem to control their representatives. \"Through gerrymandering, there are now Republican seats that are so safe that the leadership has lost the ability to control them. It's almost like a Frankenstein's monster.\" Still, some Republican leaders said they would be committed to working out a solution in the new year. \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for me, and it\u2019s a priority for many Republicans,\u201d House Rules Chairman David Lewis said after the House adjourned. \u201cWe in the state of North Carolina are going to find a way to respect everyone\u2019s basic human rights. \u201cYou know, I am a Republican, and our party was founded and grew under the belief that everyone\u2019s entitled to equal protection under the law,\u201d he added. \u201cSomehow we can find a way to craft legislation to find a solution.\u201d Some political experts expect the issue ultimately will  be resolved by federal courts rather than local and state politicians. In May, the Department of Justice filed a civil rights lawsuit against the state. \u201cThe courts are going to have the final say on HB2,\u201d said Bitzer. \u201cPolitically, both sides are so bitterly divided and don\u2019t seem to trust the other side at this point. At this point, I would be stunned if they came to any kind of compromise.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Toy shopping \u00a0around Christmas, a 78-year-old climbs Mt.

On some days it was just his wife, Carol, by the aging lawman\u2019s side.\u00a0 He chose not to testify in his defense, unlike Tanaka, who took the stand in his own obstruction trial earlier this year and sought to lay the blame squarely at Baca\u2019s feet. Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before convicting Tanaka, who has since been sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the obstruction plot. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors struck a deal with Baca, in which the retired sheriff\u00a0pleaded guilty to a single charge of making false statements to federal investigators. In exchange, he was to receive\u00a0a sentence of no more than six months in prison. U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson\u00a0rejected the deal, calling it\u00a0too lenient, and Baca and his attorneys chose instead to withdraw his plea and put his fate in the hands of 12\u00a0fellow citizens. Although prosecutors told the six-man, six-woman jury at the outset of the trial that Baca was the \u201cheartbeat,\u201d the \u201cleader\u201d and the \u201cdriving force\u201d of the conspiracy, few of the government\u2019s witnesses testified to direct interactions with Baca during the time of the alleged interference with federal authorities. A former L.A. Times reporter testified that Baca said in an interview that he directed two sergeants to go to the home of FBI agent Leah Tanner, then known as Leah Marx. The sergeants confronted her and falsely informed her they were obtaining a warrant for her arrest. Prosecutors alleged\u00a0the move was an attempt to intimidate Tanner\u00a0and get the FBI to back off. A former U.S. attorney, now a federal judge, recalled phone calls and meetings with Baca in which the\u00a0then-sheriff seemed to be in the know about developments in the case.\u00a0 Jurors also heard a recorded conversation between an FBI supervisor and Sgt. Maricela Long, who has also been convicted in the obstruction case, in which the supervisor asked\u00a0whether Baca was aware his subordinates had threatened Tanner\u00a0with arrest.\u00a0 \u201cThe\u00a0sheriff knows this, sir,\u201d Long said on the recording. Two other deputies who have been convicted of playing a part in the conspiracy told jurors that while they had little to no contact with Baca, it was made clear to them the orders came all the way\u00a0from the top.\u00a0One said he watched a nervous supervisor walk into Baca\u2019s office to notify him that deputies had mistakenly allowed FBI agents to meet with the inmate who was working as a federal informant. The prosecution presented jurors with phone records, emails and meetings scheduled on calendars to show that Baca was in contact with Tanaka as the machinations played out. But Hochman countered that his client could have been discussing any number of issues he dealt with as the head of the department's sprawling operation. In more than 100 emails presented by prosecutors as evidence of the obstruction plot,\u00a0Baca\u00a0was directly involved in only two, Hochman said. And while Tanaka was exchanging dozens of calls with the subordinates charged in the case,\u00a0Baca\u00a0was on only one. \u201cThe sheriff never knew about this;\u00a0the sheriff was out of the loop,\u201d Hochman said. He asked jurors to instead look at the rest of Baca\u2019s\u00a0lengthy career to decide whether he would be the type of leader to evade federal scrutiny. He\u00a0pointed to steps Baca took to better conditions in the jails, and put on the stand Baca\u2019s high-powered friends \u2014\u00a0including two former district attorneys \u2014\u00a0who called him \u201claw-abiding\u201d with an \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cvery solid\u201d reputation. Prosecutors, Hochman argued, were \u201cthrowing some spaghetti against the wall to see if anything sticks against Sheriff\u00a0Baca.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Toy shopping \u00a0around Christmas, a 78-year-old climbs Mt.

    "text": "advertisement The Obama administration has eliminated a dormant Bush-era program that could have been used by Donald Trump to implement his promised Muslim registry, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The tracking program, called the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, was created by the Justice Department in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It required men from 25 countries considered to be at \"higher risk\" of extremist activities to register in person and submit to questioning and fingerprinting at an Immigration and Naturalization Service office. Civil rights groups complained that it targeted residents of Muslim- and Arab-majority countries. Related: Trump Immigration Adviser Kris Kobach Wrote the Book on Muslim Registry NSEERS hasn't been used since 2011, but it could potentially be revitalized. Obama apparently wants to avoid that happening. By removing regulations that provided a legal framework for the program, Obama aims to prevent Trump from using it, U.S. officials told NBC News on Thursday.

Peter Foley / EPA The Department of Homeland Security filing , posted in the Federal Register Thursday, calls NSEERS \"outdated,\" \"obsolete\" and \"redundant\" due to updated rules and systems that allow the department to accomplish its security goals with more efficiency. A 2012 report by the department's inspector general found the program to be \"inefficient and ineffective,\" and with new tracking measures in place, \"NSEERS and its regulatory structure serve no public benefit,\" the DHS said in a statement.

Peter Foley / EPA He pledged a ban on Muslims entering the country during the presidential campaign, and his aides have since stressed the need for \"extreme vetting\" of them. One of his immigration advisers is Kris Kobach, an architect of NSEERS. After the election, a photograph of the two men together captured Kobach's briefing papers, which put the reinstatement of NSEERS as a top bullet point. Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said in a conference call Friday that the incoming administration would have a response to the dismantling of NSEERS as part of a broader plan on executive orders.

Despite farmers pledging to reduce or stop antibiotics use, a new report finds that sales of antibiotics for use on farms are going up. Don Ryan/AP hide caption toggle caption Don Ryan/AP Antibiotic- and growth-hormone-free cattle gather at a farm in Yamhill, Ore. Despite farmers pledging to reduce or stop antibiotics use, a new report finds that sales of antibiotics for use on farms are going up. Don Ryan/AP It's a continuing paradox of the meat industry. Every year, more restaurants and food companies announce that they will sell only meat produced with minimal or no use of antibiotics. And every year, despite those pledges, more antibiotics are administered to the nation's swine, cattle and poultry. According to the latest figures , released this week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, antibiotic sales for use on farm animals increased by 1 percent in 2015, compared to the previous year. The increase was slightly greater \u2013 2 percent \u2014 for antibiotics used as human medicine. The FDA and other public health agencies have been pushing farmers to rely less on these drugs. Heavy use of antibiotics both in human medicine and in agriculture has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, complicating the task of treating many infections. But the FDA finds a glimmer of good news in the latest figures, pointing out that the rate of increase has slowed. In the previous year, antibiotic use had increased by 4 percent, and a total of 22 percent from 2009 to 2014. Article continues after sponsorship The poultry industry has made the most ambitious promises to reduce antibiotic use. Perdue Farms says that 95 percent of its chickens already are raised with no antibiotics at all. Tyson Foods, the largest producer, has announced that it is \"striving\" to end the use of antibiotics that also are used in human medicine. Tyson will continue to deploy a class of antibiotics called ionophores, which can't be used on humans. The new report, however, doesn't shed any light on the impact of these moves, because it doesn't show how much of each drug is used on cattle, swine or poultry. In a statement, David Wallinga, from the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that \"this report further underscores how urgently we need more and stronger government action\" to reduce antibiotic use. Ron Phillips, from the Animal Health Institute, which represents veterinary drug manufacturers, says that the FDA's data on drug sales tell us little about what's most important \u2014 whether the use of those drugs is leading to more drug-resistant bacteria. He says that another recent government report , from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, shows \"very encouraging trends.\" According to that report, bacteria found on meat at slaughter have not shown increasing resistance to most antibiotics in recent years. There are some concerning trends, however. Some species of bacteria found on cattle have shown increasing levels of resistance to ciproflaxin, and turkey samples showed a big increase in Salmonella that's resistant to several different drugs.

The five suspects, between age 21 and 26, were expected to appear in court Friday to be charged with acts in preparation of a terrorist event. They are believed to have been \"self-radicalized\" and inspired by ISIS, police said. Four of the five suspects were born in Australia. The fifth is from Egypt. They were arrested in a series of overnight raids at properties in Melbourne's northern suburbs. Two other people initially arrested in the raids -- a 26-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman -- were released without being charged, a police statement said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton told reporters that police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device,\" he said. Ashton said the suspects had planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and nearby St. Paul's Cathedral.\u00a0 \"If this had got under our guard this would have been a significant attack,\" Ashton told reporters.\u00a0\"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" Ashton said police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, adding that intelligence suggested no threats to any other events. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. The arrests were made days after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people in the latest terror attack to strike Europe this year.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 8:37 PM EST CANBERRA, Australia - Police in Australia have detained five men suspected of planning a series of Christmas Day bomb attacks in the heart of the country\u2019s second-largest city, officials said Friday. The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne\u2019s Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Victoria state Police\u00a0 Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. A manhunt is underway for the person behind that attack, which prompted increases in security around the world. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne - a 26-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman - were released without being charged, police said. Five men between the ages 21 and 26 remained in custody and would be charged later Friday with preparing a terrorist attack. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives, knives and a gun, Ashton said. Police believed the threat had been neutralized through the raids on five Melbourne premises, he said. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cThis is one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years.\u201d \u201cIslamist terrorism is a global challenge that affects us all. But we must not be cowed by the terrorists,\u201d Turnbull told reporter. \u201cWe will continue to go about our lives as we always have. What these criminals seek to do is to kill. But they also seek to frighten us, to cow us into abandoning our Australian way of life. They want to frighten Australians. They want to divide Australians. They want us to turn on each other. We will not let them succeed,\u201d he added. Since Australia\u2019s terrorist threat level was elevated in September 2014, the government says there have been four extremist attacks and 12 plots foiled by police. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the plotters had moved very quickly from a plan to develop a capability to attack. \u201cIn terms of events that we have seen over the past few years in Australia, this certainly concerns me more than any other event that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cWe believe that we have removed the bulk of this particular cell, this group,\u201d he said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. About 400 police officers were involved in the raids. Ashton described those arrested as \u201cself-radicalized\u201d and inspired by Islamic State propaganda. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Former NSA contract worker Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information on government surveillance, made his case to President Obama for a p... The report sends a strong message to President Barack Obama during his final days in office: Do not pardon Edward Snowden. Mr. Obama has not offered any indication that he is considering pardoning Snowden for the leaks that embarrassed the U.S. and angered allies. Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama\u2019s adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, said last year that Snowden \u201cshould come home to the United States and be judged by a jury of his peers - not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime.\u201d However, there has been a push by privacy advocacy groups to pardon the former NSA contractor who they herald as a whistleblower for leaking documents that disclosed the extent of the data the U.S. collects on Americans in its efforts to fight terrorism. After the disclosures, Mr. Obama reined in some of the surveillance authorities and put in place additional measures to provide more transparency to the classified programs. The House intelligence committee released the report to provide what the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called \u201ca fuller account of Edward Snowden\u2019s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U.S. national security.\u201d The 33-page unclassified report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliament\u2019s upper house, who asserted that \u201cSnowden did share intelligence\u201d with the Russian government. The report said, \u201cSince Snowden\u2019s arrival in Moscow, he has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services.\u201d The following sentence was redacted, and there is nothing in the unclassified report that explains why the committee believes Snowden is still sharing intelligence with the Russians. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden isn\u2019t a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. \u201cMost of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans\u2019 privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America\u2019s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,\u201d Schiff said. Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer, dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. \u201cThe House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThe report wholly ignores Snowden\u2019s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.\u201d The Congressional report has also come under fire from Barton Gellman, one of the four reporters who originally met Snowden and received the leaked material in 2013.\u00a0 \u201cThe report is not only one-sided, not only incurious, not only contemptuous of fact. It is trifling,\u201d Gellman wrote back in September after reading a three-page executive summary of the report.\u00a0 Gellman, who is now a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, challenged multiple claims in the report, including the fact that Snowden \u201cfled to Russia\u201d (he tried to fly to Ecuador, but the U.S. government trapped him in Moscow when they revoked his passport) and that Snowden exaggerated his duties as an entry-level computer technician (he had multiple information security roles with the CIA, including one that deployed him to Geneva under diplomatic cover and another that involved regular meetings with the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the CIA\u2019s technical branches, Gellman said.)\u00a0 Three years later, the Snowden leaks continue to reverberate. One of the programs that came under great scrutiny is set to expire in a year, and it will be a top priority for the House committee, among others in Congress, to get it renewed. Under that program, the NSA sweeps up communications of non-Americans outside the U.S., and it can also capture the domestic communications of any American in contact with the terror suspect, even if those contacts have nothing to do with terrorism. The resulting sweeps are likely to have included emails and other data from tens of thousands of Americans over the past decade, experts have said. Three years ago, Snowden revealed U.S. government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

DEC. 22, 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December It was a year to be confounded, shocked, humbled. Donald J. Trump won the American presidency, defying polls, mockery and fear to defeat Hillary Clinton. Britons jolted their country and the world by voting to leave the European Union. Syria\u2019s agony played out before a largely indifferent world, its children staring into the camera with eyes wide in terror, blood flecking their clothing. The president of the Philippines unleashed a merciless war on drugs, boasting of killing drug dealers himself when he was a mayor, and many of his citizens cheered him on. Climate change created a new class of refugees, even as climate-change skeptics were nominated to key United States cabinet posts. And talk about shocking: The Chicago Cubs won the World Series after a drought of 108 years. It was a year so unexpected, so tumultuous, that the fight has just begun over which narrative might possibly explain it. For some, it was the comeuppance of the elites and the rebellion of the forgotten white working class. Or it was the triumph of resentment, rage and racism. Or payback for identity politics. Or perhaps it was a rallying cry for identity politics. One lesson was clear: Economic and cultural upheavals have consequences. Free trade and globalization, many economists argue, are inexorable forces. But in the United States as in Europe, the exodus of high-paying manufacturing jobs has taken a political as well as an economic toll. Chancellor Angela Merkel lifted many hearts and outraged others when she opened Germany\u2019s doors to desperate refugees. But as in Britain, France, and Italy, there was a backlash from those who conflate Muslim refugees with terrorism, and migrants with economic competition. After terrorist attacks from Paris to Nice, Berlin to Brussels, a frightened world is further barring its doors. Was there ever such an American election? The spectacle that was the Trump campaign riveted the world. The images are indelible: Mr. Trump in silhouette drawing thousands to ecstatic rallies where he pledged to bring back jobs, but also of crowds spewing hate. Hillary Clinton raced to make history as the first female president, allowing herself a brief moment of exultation, arms thrown wide. Then the surprise of her narrow defeat: Women pasted \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers on Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave, while soon after, President Obama welcomed President-elect Trump to the White House. Violence struck in Orlando, with gay revelers attacked at the Pulse nightclub, and in Dallas and Baton Rouge, where the targets were law enforcement officers. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were gunned down by the police. Rape, as ever a tool of war, was deployed by the Islamic State against Yazidi sex slaves. Mexican women, sexually assaulted by the police, broke their silence. Meanwhile, Zika continued to ravage its victims. Cholera was the latest of the scourges visited on Haiti. Empty shelves and emaciated mental patients showed the worsening toll of Venezuela\u2019s failing economy. It was a year in desperate need of grace notes. Simone Biles and American gymnastics team entranced the world at the Olympic Games in Brazil. Vienna waltzes soared at the New York City Ballet. And then there was Zarifeh Shalabi, elected prom queen in Fontana, Calif., with her crown atop her hijab. So much to absorb. Yet if 2016 was a world turned upside down, as the cast of the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton\u201d sings of the American Revolution, just wait until next year. \u2014 SUSAN CHIRA Speaking at the White House, President Obama condemned gun violence with tears in his eyes.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) President-elect Donald J. Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon\u2019s most sophisticated aircraft\u00a0on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in favor of an alternate plane due to high costs. In a message on Twitter, Trump said that\u00a0cost overruns in\u00a0Lockheed Martin\u2019s $400 billion program to develop the stealth aircraft had prompted him to ask Boeing, another major defense manufacturer, to \u201cprice-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.\u201d Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump has blasted the F-35 before, saying the cost is \u201cout of control\u201d and promising that his administration would find savings in military hardware purchases. His criticism of Bethesda-based Lockheed and another major aircraft\u00a0firm has roiled the defense industry and laid a marker for a hard line from the White House in dealings with major players doing business with the government. Even before Trump launched his public assault, the F-35, the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons program , has come in for widespread criticism for design flaws and spiraling costs. After President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth jet project, two of the $100 million fighter jets landed in Israel. They were greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Dec. 12. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP) This fall, Pentagon and officials from the Lockheed\u00a0failed to agree on a mutually acceptably price for the latest batch of planes. And last month,\u00a0Canada said it might buy F/A-18 Super Hornets until it decides whether to go ahead with planned F-35 purchases. A number of U.S. allies,\u00a0including Israel, have agreed to buy F-35s. Trump has also assailed \u00a0Boeing , another major aircraft manufacturer,\u00a0over the high cost of a new Air Force One plane. Its chief executive later met with the president-elect and promised to give the U.S. government a break on the aircraft. Carol Morello and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report. Read more: ",

The mayor turned the offer down. (Jose M.

And yet Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who has worked hard to give himself a more cuddly persona \u2014 has so far turned down the offer of a warm puppy, according to his pal, 1871 CEO Howard Tullman. Buried among the trove of emails released by Emanuel's lawyers Wednesday is a note Tullman sent the mayor in July 2011, offering him a \"Chocolate Lab puppy\" from the PAWS Chicago shelter and the chance to go to a Cubs game with Larry King. \"No thanks to Larry King,\" Emanuel replied. \"Is the dog pure-bred?\" PAWS Fur Ball James C.

But \"we continue to lobby him to get a dog,\" Tullman said, adding that his wife, Judy, is an active supporter of PAWS and that the Tullmans have three dogs, \"all mutts.\" ",

Top Trump surrogate and adviser Sean Spicer will serve as the next White House press secretary. Spicer, a Washington veteran, is no stranger to Republican politics. He has served six years as communications director for the Republican National Committee and was a chief strategist for the committee for almost two years. Trump Leaves Press Behind to Dine With Family in New York Unlike some others involved in the transition, Spicer is seen by many in the press corps as among the more accessible members of Trump's team. Though combative at times, Spicer makes regular television appearances and hosts a daily briefing call for reporters about the presidential transition. Also participating in the briefing call is Spicer's colleague Jason Miller, who will serve as Trump's director of communications. The president-elect also announced that the transition press secretary, Hope Hicks, will be director of strategic communications and Dan Scavino will serve as director of social media for the White House. \u201cSean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition. I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will 'Make America Great Again,'\u201d Trump said in a press release. Spicer as press secretary is considered likely to be responsible for easing any tension between reporters and the White House. 0 Shares ",

By Karen DeYoung December 22 at 7:22 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Before lunchtime Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump said he would expand the U.S. nuclear arsenal , upending a reduction course set by presidents of both parties over the past four decades, and called for the United States to veto a pending U.N. resolution that criticized Israel\u2019s settlements policy. The policy prescriptions, communicated in morning tweets, followed calls since last month\u2019s election to reconsider the arms-length U.S. relationship with Taiwan and to let China keep an underwater U.S. vessel seized by its navy. Trump declared within hours of this week\u2019s Berlin terrorist attack that it was part of a global Islamic State campaign to \u201cslaughter Christians\u201d and later said it reaffirmed the wisdom of his plans to bar Muslim immigrants. Late Thursday, Trump suggested in another tweet that the U.S. military\u2019s years-in-the-making plans for a new stealth fighter, Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 , might be reconsidered, saying he had \u201casked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\u201d With weeks to go before he becomes president, Trump has not hesitated to voice his opinions on national security issues of the day and to publicly advise the current president on what to do about them. Ultimately, the nuclear statement was tempered by a Trump spokesman. And the likely fallout from a tentative decision by the Obama administration to break years of precedent and abstain on the Israel resolution was avoided when Egypt, its sponsor, abruptly postponed it just hours before a scheduled Security Council vote. But the president-elect\u2019s pronouncements have privately riled a White House that has repeatedly insisted in public that the transition has been smooth sailing. Asked last week whether he was trying to help Trump, a professed admirer of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, understand Russia\u2019s responsibility for the civil-war carnage in Aleppo , Syria, President Obama said he would \u201chelp President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he\u2019s sworn in, can make a decision.\u201d \u201cBetween now and then,\u201d Obama said firmly, it was up to him to decide what to do. \u201cThese are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations that I have with our military and the people who have been working this every day.\u201d Even as the White House has held its tongue, however, others have not. Trump provided no details in his tweet calling for the United States to \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.\u201d But \u201cif he means what he says,\u201d said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a Washington-based security foundation, \u201cthis could be the end of the arms-control process that reduced 80\u00a0percent of our Cold War arsenal.\u201d Former congressman John Tierney (D-Mass.), executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in a statement, \u201cIt is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet.\u201d Under New START, the treaty negotiated by Obama with Russia and ratified by the Senate in 2010, the United States and Russia by February 2018 must have no more than 1,550 strategic weapons deployed. While there is widespread agreement that the U.S. deterrent must be modernized, little enthusiasm has been expressed elsewhere for increasing the number of nuclear warheads. Trump spokesman Jason Miller later said that was not precisely what Trump meant. Rather than calling for more nuclear weapons, Miller told Yahoo News, he was referring to \u201cthe threat of nuclear proliferation\u201d and \u201cthe need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s U.N. tweet was more explicit and more immediate. \u201cThe resolution being considered . . . should be vetoed,\u201d he said in a pre-dawn tweet referring to the Egyptian measure. The resolution condemned \u201cthe construction and expansion of settlements\u201d in the West Bank and mostly Palestinian East Jerusalem, along with \u201cthe transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians.\u201d Saying the settlements have \u201cno legal validity,\u201d it demanded that Israel \u201cimmediately cease all settlement activities.\u201d Although consideration of such a measure has been circulated at the United Nations for weeks \u2014 and similar measures have for years brought a consistent U.S. veto \u2014 it was not until Wednesday night that word began to circulate that the United States might abstain and allow it to pass. While successive administrations have considered the settlements an impediment to an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Obama administration has grown increasingly irate over what it feels is Israel\u2019s flouting of its concerns. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A July announcement that 770 new homes were to be built in the East Jerusalem settlement of Gilo drew particularly sharp U.S. criticism. At the same time, right-wing voices in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are pushing for legislation that would legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. The \u201clegalization bill\u201d stems from a court-ordered demolition of the Amona settlement, which sits on land owned by a Palestinian farmer. Amona was meant to be demolished next week, but on Thursday it received an additional month of reprieve from the court. Residents brokered a deal with the government to move their homes to a nearby location, essentially creating a new settlement. During the campaign, Trump frequently criticized what he described as the administration\u2019s failure to fully support Israel. Last week, he named David Friedman \u2014 a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has given strong financial support and other backing to the Israeli settlement movement and has said Trump supports Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory \u2014 as his ambassador to Israel. During the campaign, Trump also charged that Obama had helped promote terrorism by supporting \u201cthe ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt\u201d \u2014 that of long-standing autocrat Hosni Mubarak \u2014 and more recently by failing to fully back the military government that overthrew Mubarak\u2019s elected replacement. In an interview last weekend with a Portuguese news agency, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi said that Trump \u201chas shown deep and great understanding of what is taking place in the region as a whole and Egypt in particular. I am looking forward and expecting more support and reinforcement of our bilateral relations.\u201d Once it became clear late Wednesday that the settlements vote was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, Trump officials said the transition gave the administration a \u201cheads-up\u201d that the president-elect was going to publicly call for a U.S. veto. At the end of the day Thursday, it was not entirely clear what led Egypt to withdraw the resolution. At the State Department, spokesman John Kirby said that Egypt had pulled it back in order to have \u201cdiscussions with its Arab League partners\u201d over the wording of the text. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who supported an abstention and was clearly expecting to deliver a pre-vote speech announcing it, along with an outline of future prospects for Middle East peace, canceled his plans. Elsewhere within the administration, officials said Israel had twisted Egypt\u2019s arm and threatened to work against its interests in Congress. Several Arab officials said they were convinced that the United States had pressured Egypt to postpone the vote. In Israel, where a late-night cabinet meeting was convened Wednesday to consider the possibility of a U.S. abstention, Netanyahu sent out a dead-of-night tweet calling for a U.S. veto. It was quickly followed by Trump\u2019s own, near-identical tweet. Deriding \u201cthe imposition of terms set by the United Nations,\u201d Trump said in a later statement that passage of the resolution would put Israel \u201cin a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201d Later in the day, a transition official told the Reuters news agency, Trump spoke by telephone with Sissi.

    "text": "Dec 22 2016, 4:09 pm ET Trump Tweets Apparent Call for More U.S. Nuclear Weapons by Ken Dilanian advertisement Donald Trump stunned nuclear experts Thursday by proclaiming in a tweet that the U.S. should \"expand its nuclear capability,\" something no president has called for in decades. While President Barack Obama has proposed a $500 billion plan to modernize the aging U.S. nuclear triad, no mainstream voices are arguing to increase the numbers of nuclear weapons beyond the 4,500 the U.S. currently possesses, several experts told NBC News. \"The thrust of U.S. nuclear policy for decades now has been to trim the fat off the U.S. nuclear arsenal,\" said James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"At a certain point, you are just making the rubble bounce higher.\" Play Trump: 'Can't Take Anything Off the Table' with Nuclear Weapons 0:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161223013559if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/773727811553\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump tweeted, \"The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" \"Can a tweet start an arms race? This one may just have done that,\" said Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement to NBC News that \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes. He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\" The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Miller did not respond to a follow-up question asking whether that meant Trump was not, in fact, calling for more nuclear weapons. The U.S. can deliver nukes by bomber, intercontinental missile and submarine \u2014 the three legs of the so-called nuclear triad. Under Obama, the Pentagon has been moving forward with a hugely expensive program to modernize many aspects of the aging weapons and delivery systems. Some experts question whether the U.S. needs all legs of the triad anymore. One who has raised that issue is James Mattis, the retired Marine general who is Trump's choice for defense chief. \"You should ask, 'Is it time to reduce the triad to a diad, removing the land-based missiles?'\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in January 2015, as the AP reported earlier this month. \"Can a tweet start an arms race? This one may just have done that.\" Keith Payne, a former Defense Department official and longtime nuclear expert, argues that modernization is badly overdue. But even Payne doesn't argue for expanding the number of nuclear weapons or launchers, he told NBC News in an interview. He declined to say whether he was advising the Trump team. Acton called Trump's tweet unprecedented, not only for its content, but for the notion that a president-elect would make a pronouncement about something so sensitive as nuclear weapons policy over a medium as casual as Twitter. \"Nuclear policy is not made on the hoof,\" he said. \"Because of the extraordinary implications, it is always the result of serious interagency review and careful deliberations. Allies are consulted, presidential statements pored over, words checked and double checked, crafted and re-crafted.\" But Trump doesn't appear to do business that way. \"I have no doubt in my mind that Trump's Twitter feed is monitored extremely closely by foreign governments and that this will cause significant heartache,\" Acton said.

The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne \u2014 26-year-old man and 20-year-old woman \u2014 were released without being charged, a police statement said. Five men between ages 21 and 26 remained in custody. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship, police said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said. Police believed the threat had been neutralized through the raids Thursday night and Friday morning, he said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. Ashton said police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device ,\" Ashton said. He added: \"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" About 400 police officers were involved in the raids. Ashton described those arrested as \"self-radicalized\" and inspired by Islamic State propaganda. 0 Shares ",

Shares of Lockheed Martin fell Monday, Dec. 12, 2016, as President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that making F-35 fighter planes is too costly and that he will cut \"billions\" in costs for military purchases. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump has taken to Twitter again to express his displeasure about the price tag of an aircraft. \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\" he tweeted Thursday. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump's tweet comes the day after he met with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin to discuss the F-35 fighter and the new Air Force One . In recent weeks Trump has tweeted about the high costs of the new Air Force One and the F-35 that is intended to become the main fighter aircraft for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps . On Wednesday Trump met separately with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida to discuss both programs. Those meetings were followed by a separate meeting with senior military officials involved with the development of both aircraft. The Pentagon is in the process of purchasing 2,443 F-35 fighters that will become the standard fighter aircraft for the military. The F-35 has stealth capability and is one of the most highly computerized aircraft to ever fly. Each F-35 costs about $112 million to produce, but Lockheed Martin estimates that costs will go down as more aircraft are produced so that by 2019 each F-35 will cost $85 million. The F/A-18 is a fighter aircraft that went into use in the 1980s by the Navy and Marine Corps as a carrier-based aircraft. It is not flown by the Air Force. The Navy and Marine Corps are in the process of modernizing their F/A-18 aircraft until they are all eventually replaced by the F-35. \"I had a productive meeting with President-elect Trump this afternoon,\" Marillyn Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed Martin, said in a statement following her meeting Wednesday with Trump. \"I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 program and the progress we've made in bringing costs down. The F-35 is a critical program to our national security , and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our U.S. military and our allies.\" Trump later met with Air Force generals and Navy admirals involved with both programs. He told reporters the meeting was focused on \"trying to get costs down cost primarily the F-35 trying to get the costs down cause it's a program that's very very expensive.\" \"We are going to get the costs down and get it done beautifully,\" he added. He described the senior military officials he met with as \"great people, amazing people, I'm very impressed with them and very good negotiators.\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg described his meeting with Trump about the new Air Force One as a \"very productive\" discussion. Muilenberg said that they could produce the new Air Force One \"affordably\" for less than the $4 billion price tag that Trump has described for the aircraft that will go into service in 2024. \"We will get it done for less than that,\" Muilenberg told reporters. The Air Force has projected that over the next five years the new Air Force One could cost $2.78 billion, but there is no full contract with Boeing yet. For now, the Air Force has spent almost $170 million on three small contracts with Boeing related to the project. 0 Shares ",

Donald Trump faces a struggle proving himself to white, suburban women, who could be crucial in the November general election.</p> Close AP Photo/Ted S. Warren Donald Trump\u2019s transition team asked the State Department this week for information on its \u201cgender-related staffing, programming, and funding,\u201d raising questions over whether the incoming administration will slash U.S. efforts promoting women\u2019s equality worldwide. A one-page memo, obtained and published by the New York Times, was sent to senior State Department staffers Wednesday requesting that the offices provide further information \u201coutlining existing programs and activities to promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women\u2019s participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.\u201d Trump team wants names of Energy Dept. staff who worked on climate change While the document did not request specific names of employees working on these programs, it asked for the specific positions dedicated to gender parity issues and more information about funding amounts to these programs over the last year. Employees were instructed to respond by 5 p.m. on the same day it was sent out, according to the Times. The president\u2019s transition team explained it in a statement as a way to find methods to better such programs.\u00a0 \u201cPresident-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected,\u201d the team said in a statement to CBS News. \u201cTo help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participation\u2014finding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests.\u201d During a State briefing Thursday, department spokesperson John Kirby said that \u201cit is normal, it is usual, it is typical, it is expected\u201d for such questions on the bureaucracy to be asked during a presidential transition period. \u201cIn helping any new team get a grip on a new organization that as they try to understand bureaus and how they\u2019re manned that there is going to be a discussion, there needs to be a discussion about what positions will remain open for them to fill and what positions they might not have to worry about filling,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen a new captain comes aboard a ship, you tell him who\u2019s on board and what jobs they have and how the ship operates. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d Still, though Kirby suggested there was nothing unusual about the memo, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that the document unnerved some State Department employees who feared that some would be singled out over work they\u2019d done on gender-related issues. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top ranking woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was equally wary of the Trump transition team request, calling it \u201cconcerning\u201d and requesting the transition \u201cclarify their intent.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI pledge to work with the incoming Administration to advance policies that support and protect women and girls worldwide,\u201d Shaheen wrote in a statement to CBS News, \u201cbut I can promise that if the next administration intends to roll back programs designed to lift women up, it will very quickly meet stiff opposition in the Senate.\u201d During Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, she prioritized women\u2019s issues as an important facet of America\u2019s foreign policy agenda. \u201cI want to pledge to you that as secretary of state I view [women\u2019s] issues as central to our foreign policy,\u201d Clinton said at her confirmation hearing, \u201cnot as adjunct or auxiliary or in any way lesser than all of the other issues that we have to confront.\u201d Shortly after, she created the Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues within the department, appointing a U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for global women\u2019s issues. While Mr. Trump has pledged to be \u201cthe best for women\u201d when it comes to domestic policy, it isn\u2019t known yet how much emphasis his secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, will place on women\u2019s issues at the State Department. The Trump transition team has also been questioned over similar memos to the Energy Department and the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. In those cases, the Trump team seemed focused on climate change and environmental conservation policies. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",
