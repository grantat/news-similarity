    "text": "Report: Costly wind turbines projected to yield $1.39 in daily savings Published               December 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A small Washington state city spent\u00a0more than $100,000 on three \u201cwindmill-like turbines\u201d \u2013 but any hopes for big savings appear to be blowing in the wind. The Peninsula Daily News reported that the Port Angeles turbines, which haven\u2019t yet been turned on, are expected to generate $1.39 per day in electricity, or roughly $42 per month. The turbines were meant to help illuminate a local park. Now, some city council members are having second thoughts about their unanimous approval for the project. \u201cI did not realize they would produce so little energy. I wouldn\u2019t have voted for it knowing it was that little,\u201d City Councilwoman Sissi Bruch told\u00a0 The Peninsula Daily News . Bruch said she was disappointed in the savings, though did \u201cappreciate\u201d the fact it \u201cwould educate folks about wind power.\u201d The city, though, challenged some details in the newspaper report. Nathan West, director of Community and Economic Development for the city, told FoxNews.com in an email that daily savings could be as high as $5.44 \u201cat peak windspeed\u201d but cautioned that \u201cdetermination of actual benefit in dollars at this time would be speculative because the spires are not yet operational.\u201d He also defended the city\u2019s investment in the turbines, saying: \u201c[T]he City did not purchase these spires for the purpose of energy creating infrastructure but rather as a park element. There are however many other \u00a0thoughts that went into the decision making regarding purchase of the spires.\u201d He said they add to a \u201cpositive aesthetic\u201d in the park and \u201csymbolize energy creation.\u201d\u00a0 The city council voted in October 2015 to approve $107,516\u00a0out of a total $285,952 county funding grant to purchase the turbines from Urban Green Energy. While they were supposed to be turned on two months ago, a dispute over safety inspection of the project has resulted in delays. The electricity that is produced would be used to power 31 lights in the newly built Waterfront Park. The lower-than-anticipated savings could be even lower depending on the eventual cost of maintaining the turbines in the harsh and salty environment, Port Angeles Deputy Power Systems Manager Shailesh Shere told the\u00a0newspaper. Though some members of the council may not be sold on the alternative energy initiative, there were those who never bought into the promised cost savings in the first place. \u201cMy fundamental objection to these is that they are not cost-effective and it\u2019s a waste of money,\u201d former deputy director of power systems Phil Lusk told the paper.

Donald Trump speaks to a crowd in Cincinnati as part of his \"thank you\" tour. (Evan Vucci / AP) Becky Yerak Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune In the list of potential risk factors that companies include in their regulatory filings, a new one has surfaced: Donald Trump . Methode Electronics, a Chicago-based designer and maker of parts for automotive, appliance and other industries, on Thursday added the president-elect to its list of potential \"risk factors.\" Disclosures of a wide range of concerns that public companies face are common in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and some of the risks never materialize. But Methode, in a filing about its financial results for the quarter ended Oct. 29, said it was adding Trump's comments on the North American Free Trade Agreement as a cause for concern. \"Any attempt by President-elect Trump to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA and certain other international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,\" said Methode, in bold letters. \"A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and China.\" Methode isn't the first publicly held company to mention the incoming Trump administration as a risk factor. Arizona-based wind blades-maker TPI Composites mentioned Trump by name in a Nov. 9 filing that included new risk factors. \"Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, as well as the Republican Party maintaining control of both the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States in the congressional election, may create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector and wind energy sector,\" TPI said. \"During the election campaign, President-elect Trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail global warming.\" The hard-eyed view along the Tug Fork River in West Virginia coal country is that President-elect Donald Trump has something to prove: that he'll help bring back Appalachian mining, as he promised time and again on the campaign trail.

The hard-eyed view along the Tug Fork River in West Virginia coal country is that President-elect Donald Trump has something to prove: that he'll help bring back Appalachian mining, as he promised time and again on the campaign trail. Nobody thinks he can revive it entirely \u2014 not economists, not... Read the story That same day, Texas-based Adeptus Health also mentioned Trump's possible repeal of Obamacare as a risk. Of Methode's $809 million in sales in the fiscal year ended April 30, more than 60 percent was in the U.S., according to its most recent annual report. About 15 percent was in China. The company identifies its major manufacturing locations as Shanghai; Cairo; Mriehel, Malta; and Monterrey, Mexico. \"During the campaign, President-elect Trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including NAFTA,\" Methode said. It's unclear, however, whether any changes will in fact be made to international trade agreements, the company said. Methode, whose annual report also mentions Chicago as one of its manufacturing locations, couldn't be reached for immediate comment. The company has about 4,345 workers, of which about two-thirds are in Malta and Mexico. The election also has been mentioned in some recent SEC filings. ",

    "text": "John Glenn dies at 95; hero was first American to orbit Earth John Glenn on past, future of space program Former astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his past missions and the future of the U.S. space program. (AP) Former astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his past missions and the future of the U.S. space program. (AP) Geraldine Baum and Valerie J. Nelson When his bell-shaped capsule splashed into the ocean after orbiting Earth again and again, John Glenn emerged an instant hero \u2014 the fighter-jock pilot of few words who in just five hours of circling the planet helped cement America\u2019s faith that it could lead the race into outer space. He walked across the deck of the aircraft carrier where Friendship 7 had been lowered as casually\u00a0as a guy who\u2019d just returned from running a crosstown errand, exuding a confidence and swagger later mythologized in Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d Decades later, at the age of 77, Glenn would return to space on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery after selling himself as a human guinea pig who would demonstrate the effects of space travel on the elderly. \u00a0 Glenn, who also served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Ohio, died Thursday at the age of 95 after being hospitalized Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cWhen John Glenn blasted off from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas rocket in 1962, he lifted the hopes of a nation. And when his Friendship 7 spacecraft splashed down a few hours later, the first American to orbit the Earth reminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there\u2019s no limit to the heights we can reach together,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. Glenn was the last surviving astronaut of the original Mercury 7 group, preceded in death by Alan B. Shepard Jr., Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton and Scott Carpenter. In his first historic flight, Glenn circled Earth for nearly five hours in a tiny spaceship on Feb. 20, 1962, the first American to orbit the planet. When he returned to space in 1998, his voyage did nearly as much to revive interest in America's space program as his first pioneering voyage had to ignite the country's fascination\u00a0in space exploration. Glenn first earned broad public attention in 1962 in the bell-shaped space capsule Friendship 7 \u2014 a flight that NASA 's mission control worried might burn up upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere. A war hero and test pilot who earned fame even before he was named to the Mercury team, Glenn seemed to have the right stuff and more. Not only did Glenn \u201chave courage and ambition, but he also had supreme confidence in himself and his own abilities,\u201d qualities that distinguished him from most mortals, said Frank Van Riper, who wrote the 1983 biography \u201cGlenn: The Astronaut Who Would Be President.\u201d \u201cThat type of confidence can let him sit atop a rocket and have his blood pressure not change at all.\u201d The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. Associated Press The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. (Associated Press) After his first space flight, Glenn, then 40, was elevated to celebrity status as much by his personal charm and heroics as he was by the pioneering era that he helped define. Before Glenn made his three loops around Earth in a four-hour, 56-minute flight, only Soviet astronauts, test dummies and dogs had made historic \u201cfirsts\u201d in space. Almost a year before Glenn defied gravity, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first man in space. Glenn was neither the first nor second American in space. Those distinctions belonged to Shepard, whose entire voyage lasted 15 minutes and who was followed months later by Grissom. Yet Glenn's flight raised the most passion and publicity in America. Glenn stayed aloft for hours, focusing Americans' rapt attention on his every orbit and ultimately restoring America's confidence in its technological prowess. President Kennedy was apparently so relieved that Glenn helped put America back in the space race, and so concerned about the astronaut's well-being, that he vetoed a return to space by Glenn. Rather, Kennedy marked Glenn as an American with a political future. After a few early political defeats, the astronaut was elected to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1974. Although Glenn remained a supporter of NASA, he tried to steer clear of being seen as the Senate \u201castronaut,\u201d preferring to make his mark in other areas. He was perhaps best known as the author of bills to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. He also helped pass legislation to clean up radioactive waste at the nation's nuclear weapons sites. Yet his drive to return to space never fully abated, and he relentlessly lobbied the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for another space flight. Glenn insisted that he was not driven to return to space for the thrill of the ride or as a passenger with a congressional free pass but as a scientist-explorer. What you're up there for is to accomplish something for the country that may break us into some new areas of research that may benefit an awful lot of people. \u2014 John Glenn \u201cWhat you're up there for,\u201d he said, \u201cis to accomplish something for the country that may break us into some new areas of research that may benefit an awful lot of people.\u201d After his late-in-life flight, dozens of tests done on his body showed that he handled the rigors of space as well as astronauts roughly half his age, NASA scientists said when results were released in 2000. In 2012, Glenn and Carpenter received a hero\u2019s welcome when they returned to the Cape Canaveral launchpad to mark the 50th anniversary of Glenn\u2019s orbital flight. The national attention after the 1962 flight was \u201calmost unbelievable,\u201d Glenn said at the event, and added that he and his colleagues learned to live with the acclaim \u201cor tried to anyway.\u201d John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio. His mother, Clara, a teacher, and father, John, soon moved to the tiny town of New Concord, where his father opened a plumbing business. At 3, he met Anna \u201cAnnie\u201d Castor, the 4-year-old daughter of the town dentist. The pair started dating in high school and married in 1944. In high school, Glenn was an honors student who excelled in sports and student politics \u2014 and played the lead in the senior class play. A religious young man, Glenn enrolled in Muskingum College, a small Presbyterian school in New Concord, where he sang in the church choir and played football. While there, Glenn learned to fly through a civilian program run by the Navy. When it came time to enlist, he joined the Marines, leaving college behind after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he rose to the rank of captain and decided to make a career in the military. By the end of the war, he had flown 59 missions with F-4U fighters, and was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and 10 Air Medals. The Korean War meant 90 more missions for the Marine aviator, and many more medals, including a third and fourth Distinguished Flying Cross. \u201cGlenn grew up with the archetypal Protestant work ethic and the idea that good things happen to people who work hard,\u201d Van Riper said. \u201cAdd to this sense of confidence and the idea in the military that you succeed if you work hard, and it explains why he pursued tougher and tougher assignments.\u201d As a test pilot, Glenn pushed his bosses to let him attempt a transcontinental flight in an F8U-1 Crusader fighter aircraft. On July 16, 1957, he set a speed record of 3 hours 23 minutes and 8.4 seconds flying from Los Angeles to New York, picking up a fifth Distinguished Flying Cross and a taste for fame. Two years later, Glenn volunteered for an elite corps of pilots who would become the country's first astronauts, riding rockets into space. NASA pared an original list of about 500 test pilots down to 110 and then to the Mercury Seven. Training was rigorous and tedious. In addition to studying astrophysics and biology, the new astronauts were exposed to high heat, strong forces of gravity and the sense of weightlessness. Glenn became a pacesetter in training and moral leadership. He would run extra miles in a morning workout and lecture the others against carousing. When Glenn took his pioneering turn in space, astronaut Carpenter spoke for all Americans when he radioed from launch control just before liftoff, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn.\u201d Carpenter later said he had tried to keep the mood light by playfully telling Glenn: \u201cRemember, John, this was built by the low bidder.\u201d NASA cut the flight short \u2014 Glenn was supposed to orbit Earth seven times \u2014 when mechanical failure created concern that Friendship 7's heat shield might fall off during re-entry and cause the capsule to burn up. Although he remained calm, Glenn later told Life magazine that he had been prepared to die. The heat shield held. After Glenn's safe return, he became a national hero. Bathed in the spotlight, Glenn was typically low key. \u201cIt's been a long day,\u201d he said after being fished out of the Atlantic Ocean by helicopter, \u201cbut it has been very interesting.\u201d Back on Earth, Glenn was greeted by Kennedy; 4 million New Yorkers showered him and his family with ticker tape; and the New York Times called him \u201cAmerica's first flesh-and-blood Buck Rogers.\u201d John Glenn parade Associated Press Astronaut John Glenn in car at left, the first American to orbit the Earth, got a massive ticker tape parade welcome along lower Broadway on March 1, 1962.

A partly constructed building at right served as a grandstand for a cheering crowd. Sitting beside the astronaut is Annie Glenn, his wife.\u00a0 (Associated Press) Reflecting on that moment decades later while sitting in his third-floor office at the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at Ohio State University , Glenn was at a loss to explain the adulation: \u201cIt\u2019s true we got more attention. It wasn\u2019t something we planned. Truth is, I just don\u2019t know why it happened.\u201d After his ambition to fly again was scratched, Glenn retired from the military in 1965 and entered private business, serving first as vice president of corporate planning and then as president of the Royal Crown Cola Co. He also made a fortune with business investments that included building Holiday Inns in Florida. But within a few years, he decided to try politics. After losing the 1970 Democratic primary in Ohio for a U.S. Senate seat to Howard Metzenbaum, Glenn ran against him again in 1974. During the campaign, Metzenbaum contrasted his business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials, saying his opponent had \u201cnever worked for a living.\u201d Glenn's reply came to be known as the \u201cGold Star Mothers\u201d speech. He challenged Metzenbaum to tell wounded veterans \u201cthey didn't hold a job\u201d and tell any Gold Star mother \u2014 women with a child who died while serving in the military \u2014 that \u201cher son did not hold a job.\u201d Glenn won the nomination and the general election. Jimmy Carter considered making Glenn his running mate in the 1976 presidential race but after Glenn gave an uninspired address to the Democratic National Convention, Carter chose Walter Mondale. A decade later, Glenn ran for president and racked up $3 million in debt but didn't make it out of the primaries. \u201cHe was never really a coalition builder,\u201d Van Riper said. And if he was considered a bit of a square by the other Mercury astronauts, that image intensified in the U.S. Senate, where he served until 1999. His relationships with others on Capitol Hill was always cordial if not distant. But in Glenn's post-Watergate class of 1974, he was always a respected colleague, considered a sincerely decent man. His Norman Rockwell character and reputation for unparalleled principle were\u00a0severely tested in 1989 during the so-called Keating Five scandal. He was one of five senators investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for using clout to keep federal regulators out of the way of savings-and-loan mogul Charles Keating Jr. The committee said Glenn used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting a $200,000 donation from Keating but cleared the senator of wrongdoing. Through all the years after his famous flight in space, Glenn continued flying. Almost every weekend he would escape Washington for Ohio in his Beechcraft Baron, with his wife as his co-pilot. When he sold his plane in early 2012, Glenn noted that he still held a valid pilot\u2019s license. In 1995, he had started campaigning to return to space. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aging, he had learned that the aging process on Earth, in many ways, is similar to the effects of weightlessness, and he decided he wanted to know why. Glenn approached NASA chief Dan Goldin and pressed to serve as a crew member on a Discovery flight as a test subject for geriatric experiments. Goldin gave the go-ahead after aging experts insisted that Glenn's mission might produce good science and NASA's own doctors found Glenn in good health. He had kept fit throughout the decades, running in his youth and power-walking in his later years around his Bethesda, Md., neighborhood. He lifted weights, ate well, took vitamins and kept trim. The day after returning to Earth on the space shuttle, Glenn admitted he had felt \u201ca little woozy\u201d upon landing but relayed a message aimed at other senior citizens. \u201cOld folks have ambitions and dreams too, like everyone else. ... Why don't they go for them? Don't sit on a couch someplace,\u201d he said. But age did catch up. Glenn sold off his airplanes and stopped flying in 2013 and then last year, he gave up driving\u00a0too.

    "text": "CBS News Dec 8, 2016 7:18 PM EST The remarkable thing is that in November, we had widespread record warm across nearly all North America. At the same time, major cold and snow descended on Siberia and Russia, reports CBS Boston chief meteorologist Eric Fisher. Now all that air that was cooking in the dark and the cold is moving across the Pole and heading right into the spots that were warmest last month. It\u2019s a complete 180 degree change in the pattern. How cold are we talking? Low temperatures, certainly subzero in the Plains, the 20s all the way down to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia Thursday night. By Saturday morning, we could be seeing 20s all the way down to North Florida and freeze warnings will likely be needed there.\u00a0 At the same time, another winter storm is moving to the Northwest, and this one isn\u2019t just bringing mountain snow, but lowland snow. We\u2019re getting snowfall into the cities of Seattle and Portland Thursday evening. As we look toward next week, there\u2019s another blast of cold and it might be even colder than what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u00a0 Freezing Arctic air heading for much of U.S. The dangerously cold weather that\u2019s been blowing across the country this week turned deadly on Thursday, CBS News\u2019 Omar Villafranca reports. Blinding snowstorms caused major pileups in the Midwest. A snow squall and slick roads are being blamed for the deadly pileup of mangled cars, trucks and eighteen-wheelers. Three people were killed and 11 people injured after dozens of vehicles careened off of Michigan\u2019s I-96 just north of Lansing . A pile-up caused by inclement weather on Dec. 7, 2016. Close CBS News Three hundred miles east in Lake County, Ohio, another pileup, with \u00a0as many as 50 vehicles occurred after a truck jack-knifed due to icy road conditions.\u00a0 Farther east in upstate New York, the moving system dropped nearly 17 inches of thick, sticky, lake-effect snow an hour north of Syracuse, New York. Roads quickly became treacherous, testing the skills of any driver who dared to get behind the wheel. Wintry weather moved across the country on Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016. Close CBS News North Dakota residents are still cleaning up after the one-two punch of snow and howling wind tore through the state. Icy roads were too slippery for even the toughest four-wheelers. Dan Boschee\u2019s truck slid into a ditch, but luckily his dad Reed showed up to pull him back on track. Tim Kunz of Ace 24-hour towing starting working earlier this week pulling dozens of cars and even Big Rig trucks off of the roads around Bismarck. \u201cThe ones that are empty, winds pushes the trailer off, and they get jack-knifed and stuck,\u201d Kunz said.\u00a0 Since Monday, tow trucks have pulled roughly 400 stranded or damaged vehicles into this yard alone. They expect to stay busy because there is more snow and sub-zero temperatures in the forecast. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story And any scaling back of fuel-economy goals by the Trump administration, if Mr. Pruitt\u2019s climate change skepticism and embrace of fossil fuels translates to policy, could also influence the types of vehicles the industry plans to build in coming years \u2014 and where it builds them. Bigger models like sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are less fuel-efficient than cars but more profitable for automakers. And their steeper price tags can help pay for the higher labor costs of making them in the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a move that underscored the new psychology since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ford Motor \u2014 which had been a target of his criticism \u2014 in mid-November decided to keep building a Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky rather than Mexico. And yet, for a capital-intensive industry that routinely makes billion dollar bets on new factories and products, the uncertainty is unnerving. \u201cOur membership is just perplexed right now,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, vice president for public affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen carmakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota, on safety and environmental issues. \u201cThis is all uncharted territory.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was studded with promises that could upend the status quo, including some to relax policies intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has yet to detail any coming changes. But pursuing policies similar to those he promoted in his campaign could change the entire manufacturing industry by penalizing companies for investing overseas or by stifling free-flowing global trade. Mr. Trump has yet to specify changes he might make to Nafta or other industrial policies. But his cabinet appointments, particularly the selection for commerce secretary of the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. , who has suggested that he is receptive to some of the antitrade views favored by Mr. Trump, indicate that the incoming president may take an aggressive approach to modifying trade deals and other tenets of the outgoing Obama administration. One industry analyst, Ron Harbour of the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said many voters in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio backed Mr. Trump primarily because of his promises to restore manufacturing jobs in the United States. \u201cSo there probably will be pressure to do something,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t do anything, they probably are not going to be too thrilled.\u201d Mr. Trump will inherit an auto industry that is far healthier than when President Obama took office and industry officials could push back strongly on disruptive changes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But auto executives generally support Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of a former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, Elaine Chao \u2014 who is also the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell \u2014 to head the Transportation Department. The department oversees fuel-economy and safety rules that affect the types of vehicles that automakers produce. \u201cWe all have a common interest, and that is to maximize the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy,\u201d the auto alliance said in response to Ms. Chao\u2019s appointment. No change would be more consequential to the auto industry than applying steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and elsewhere. Companies could be forced to radically change how and where they get commodity parts, the production of which has been migrating to low-wage nations for decades. Consumers could see a change in the types of cars available. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, the American automotive industry and auto jobs have been buoyant since the Obama administration\u2019s bailout. Since 2010, vehicle production has doubled in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been hired. Last year, a record 17.4 million cars and trucks were sold in the United States, and analysts forecast strong demand for several years. \u201cYou have record levels of production and record levels of demand,\u201d said Mike Jackson of the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThere is every reason for the industry to emphasize that it\u2019s in a very strong position.\u201d Still, the industry is anticipating changes from Mr. Trump. Ford, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker after General Motors, uncharacteristically made public a decision to keep production of the Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky, after Mr. Trump had singled out the company for its growing investments in Mexico. Ford, like G.M., Fiat Chrysler and nearly every foreign automaker, has a huge stake in protecting the interlocking network of factories and parts suppliers made possible by Nafta. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Plants in Mexico are crucial to meeting surging demand for new vehicles in the United States. Beyond that, automakers have already committed big investments to new plants in Mexico to take advantage of its cheaper labor and export-friendly trade agreements. While Mr. Trump has yet to specify how he would renegotiate Nafta, his emphasis has been on increasing American jobs and discouraging automakers from using foreign plants to supply the American market. His proposal to put tariffs of as much as 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico has stunned auto executives who have built their business models on open borders for cars, trucks and the thousands of parts in them. \u201cA tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Mark Fields, chief executive of Ford. Imported vehicles are an integral part of the American market and account for more than 40 percent of its annual volume. Last year, about eight million cars, trucks and sport utilities sold in the United States were built elsewhere, primarily in Mexico, Canada, Japan and Korea. Nearly all of them enter the market free of tariffs that would increase sticker prices significantly. Increasing the price of an imported vehicle with tariffs could reduce overall vehicle sales and exert economic pressure on manufacturers as well as on freight haulers, dealerships and independent service centers. And if Mr. Trump chooses to impose tariffs on auto parts produced abroad and shipped to plants in the United States, the impact will spread further. Last year, auto parts worth $143 billion were imported into the United States, about 35 percent of them from Mexico, compared with $81 billion in parts that were exported, according to the Commerce Department. Many big suppliers, however, are global and make parts in every region of the world. The parts industry\u2019s largest American trade group, the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, said its member companies employed more than 734,000 workers in the United States, and generated another 2.9 million jobs in related businesses. The industry is acutely sensitive to changes in trade policies that could have a ripple effect on its ability to ship parts in and out of the country. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And like automakers, parts manufacturers are anxious to know what Mr. Trump has in store for them. \u201cNow that the election is over, we can begin to explore what to expect in the months to come,\u201d the trade group\u2019s president, Steve Handschuh, wrote in a letter to its members, adding that he was eager \u201cto express our priorities\u201d to the Trump transition team. In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on trade issues, the industry is expecting policies that diverge from the Obama administration\u2019s enthusiastic support of electric cars, including the $7,500 tax credits that encouraged consumers to buy them, and for the testing and development of self-driving vehicles. In a Nov. 10 letter to the Trump transition team, the auto alliance asked for clarity on policy changes as soon as possible. \u201cAuto manufacturing is a highly capital-intensive business, and because of that we rely on long-term certainty,\u201d Ms. Bergquist wrote. Yet the industry has proved to be adaptable to shifts in government, whether by building more fuel-efficient vehicles to meet new regulations, or increasing investments in Mexico because of Nafta. It is also more focused on self-interest than politics. In its eight-page letter, the auto alliance laid out several goals \u2014 including repeating its position that the government re-evaluate its timetable for automakers to achieve fleetwide fuel economy of 54.5 miles a gallon. But while the letter was perceived as tailored to Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, Ms. Bergquist said it was composed before the election and would have been sent to an incoming Clinton administration had the outcome been different. \u201cOur position was the same, no matter who won,\u201d she said.

    "text": "By Karoun Demirjian December 8 at 6:55 PM Follow @karoun Congress is doubling down on promises to investigate Russia, after President-elect Donald Trump dismisses evidence that Russia was involved. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Leading\u00a0Senate Republicans are preparing to launch a coordinated and wide-ranging probe into\u00a0Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the U.S. elections and its potential cyberthreats to the\u00a0military, digging deep into\u00a0what they view as corrosive interference in the nation\u2019s\u00a0institutions. Such an aggressive approach puts them on a direct collision course with President-elect Donald Trump, who downplays the possibility \u00a0Russia had any role in the November elections\u00a0\u2014 arguing that a hack of the Democratic National Committee emails\u00a0may have been perpetrated by \u201csome guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d The fracture could become more prominent\u00a0after Trump is inaugurated and begins setting\u00a0foreign policy. He has already indicated the country should \u201cget along\u201d with Russia since the two nations have many common strategic goals. But some of Trump\u2019s would-be Republican allies on Capitol Hill disagree. Senate Armed Services Chair John McCain (Ariz.) is readying a probe of possible Russian cyber incursions into U.S. weapons systems, and said he has been discussing the issue with\u00a0Select Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (N.C.) with whom he will be \u201cworking closely\u201d to investigate Russia\u2019s suspected interference in the U.S. elections, cyber threats to the military and other institutions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been apprised of the discussions.\u00a0Burr did not respond to requests for comment. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman\u00a0Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)\u00a0also said he intends to hold hearings next year into alleged Russian hacking. Corker is on Trump\u2019s shortlist for secretary of state, according to the Trump transition team. Trump transition officials could not be reached for comment. The loudest GOP calls for a Russia probe are coming from McCain and Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham (S.C.). Both have taken a hard line on Russia and have been highly\u00a0critical of Trump, particularly his\u00a0praise of President Vladimir Putin. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election, amongst claims that Donald Trump's rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \u201cThey\u2019ll keep doing more here until they pay a price,\u201d Graham said of Russia. He\u00a0plans to spearhead legislation and\u00a0hold a series of investigative hearings next year into \u201cRussia\u2019s misadventures throughout the world,\u201d including\u00a0Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. [ Republican lawmakers move to restrain Trump on Russia ] \u201cI\u2019m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia. I think they\u2019re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections and I want Putin personally to pay the price,\u201d Graham said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. McCain said his Armed Services Committee will launch a probe in the 115th Congress into Russia\u2019s cyber capabilities against the U.S. military and weapons systems,\u00a0\u201cbecause the real threat is cyber,\u201d he explained. But McCain said he expects the investigation will also dovetail with the topic of Russia\u2019s suspected hacking of the DNC and state-based election systems \u2014 which include a hack that took place in McCain\u2019s home state of Arizona. \u201cSee, the problem with hacking is that if they\u2019re able to disrupt elections, then it\u2019s a national security issue, obviously,\u201d McCain said Thursday. He added that the Armed Services Committee was \u201cstill formulating\u201d exactly how to address the issue during hearings. But despite Trump\u2019s dismissal, McCain said that \u201cthere\u2019s very little doubt\u201d Russia interfered in the U.S. elections, which he called \u201cvery worthy of examination.\u201d The U.S. government in October officially accused Russia of hacking the DNC\u2019s emails during the presidential campaign. The emails were posted on web sites like WikiLeaks, and caused embarrassment for the party, including forcing the resignation of the DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.). And U.S. military officials\u00a0officials are concerned about Russia\u2019s capacity to steal military secrets and corrupt operations: Officials already suspect Russian hackers are behind a major email breach at the Pentagon last year. And the military could be a target for backlash, after an NBC News report widely circulated by Russian media stated U.S. military hackers were ready to launch cyberattacks against Russia in the event of an obvious election hack. Trump continued to downplay Russian involvement in the elections\u00a0in an \u00a0interview released this week for\u00a0Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d feature. In the interview,\u00a0the president-elect disputed the Obama administration\u2019s accusation that Russia interfered in the election. [ U.S. government officially accuses Russia of interfering with elections ] \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.\u201d Some Republicans delicately demurred, while still defending Trump\u2019s ability to negotiate with Putin. \u201cThe Democratic National Committee \u2026 the intelligence community is of pretty much one mind that Russia was involved in that, was behind that,\u201d Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said in an MSNBC interview. King is a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and chairman of the Homeland Security subcommittee on intelligence and counter-terrorism. King added that he was \u201cconfident\u201d Trump \u201cwill not be taken in by Putin.\u201d Democrats have also taken issue with Trump\u2019s desire to pursue more friendly relations with Moscow, as well as his affinity for Putin. \u201cThe primary area of discomfort for the Republicans here and the Trump administration, in foreign policy and national security, is over Russia,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, who accused Trump of becoming \u201ca propaganda piece for the Kremlin\u201d on MSNBC this week.\u00a0\u201cThey may be giving him breathing space right now, but I don\u2019t expect that to last.\u201d Since\u00a0the election, Republican lawmakers have\u00a0voted to reestablish a U.S. hard line against Russia\u2019s global ventures, with a House-passed measure to\u00a0sanction anyone who supports the Syrian government in its ongoing civil war \u2013 a category that primarily includes Russia and Iran. There is also language\u00a0in the annual defense policy bill to provide millions of dollars in lethal aid to Ukraine, where the government in Kiev is engaged in open hostilities against Russian-backed separatists. But many Democrats are impatient with Republicans for not taking faster and more concrete steps against Russia after\u00a0the Obama administration\u00a0 officially accused Moscow of meddling in the elections. Corker expressed early interest in holding hearings on Russia. But months later, those hearings have not been held. \u201cWe\u2019re getting no pressure from anyone \u2013 we just feel like it\u2019s something we should do,\u201d Corker said in an interview Wednesday, when asked if there president-elect had pressured him not to raise the topic. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we attempted to set a classified briefing up this week.\u201d Obama administration officials maintain that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other officials were ready to brief senators about Russia\u2019s suspected role in the DNC hack on Thursday. Administration officials said that at the last minute, the committee dramatically broadened the scope of the hearing, forcing them to cancel. A spokeswoman for Corker said the hearing was postponed because State Department officials were unavailable due to previous travel commitments. She\u00a0added that Corker and Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, received a classified briefing on cyber threats prior to the election. Corker pledged on Wednesday that hearings investigating Russia\u2019s role in the elections would be forthcoming next year. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to look at it,\u201d he said. An aggressive probe of Russia\u2019s activities may not extend to the House, where leading Republicans say they have already been investigating Russia and will continue their efforts\u00a0regardless of Trump\u2019s stance. \u201c[Russia]\u2019s always been a priority for me and it will remain a priority for me,\u201d House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said. The House Armed Services Committee Mac Thornberry stressed that his committee has been looking at Russian cyber threats to the military for the last two years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to all pay more attention to cyber and to Russian activities to influence things through cyber,\u201d Thornberry said. Democrats, meanwhile, are going to use whatever power they have to ensure that suspected Russian activities in the elections and beyond get attention. Seven top-ranked Democrats sent a letter to President Obama on Tuesday asking for classified briefings \u201cregarding Russian entities\u2019 hacking of American political organizations,\u201d including the\u00a0DNC hack, emails released by WikiLeaks and fake news. \u201cRegardless of whether you voted for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else, Russia\u2019s attacks on our election are an attempt to degrade our democracy and should chill every American \u2013 Democratic, Republican, or Independent \u2013 to the core,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings,\u00a0the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Relations Committee. powerpost ",

(Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b South Korea\u2019s parliament introduced an impeachment motion against Park Geun-hye,\u00a0setting up a vote that will likely be delivered by the end of the week. ( AP ) Syrian government forces swept through the Old City of Aleppo, expanding Assad\u2019s control to some three-quarters of east Aleppo. The push comes as John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Germany to discuss a last-ditch agreement that would allow the city to be evacuated. ( Louisa Loveluck and Karen DeYoung ) Ohio lawmakers passed a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d that would prohibit abortion at the first sign of a fetal heartbeat \u2013 drastically reducing the legal time for abortion to just\u00a0six weeks (before many women even realize they are pregnant). Many\u00a0GOP lawmakers say they are energized by the promise of a more conservative Supreme Court that could actually overturn Roe v. Wade. ( Sandhya Somashekhar ) Life expectancy for Americans has declined for the first time in more than two decades, according to brand new health statistics, with a spike in fatalities caused by heart disease, strokes, diabetes, drug overdoses and more. In all, death rates rose for eight of the top 10 leading causes of death. ( Lenny Bernstein ) The surgeon general calls\u00a0the skyrocketing use of e-cigarettes among young people a \u201cmajor public health concern,\u201d urging policymakers to help keep the nicotine products away from young people as health officials continue to research possible detrimental effects.

( Politico ) Two juveniles have been charged with arson in the deadly Tennessee wildfires, leaving 14 dead and more than 1,700 buildings damaged or destroyed. ( J. Freedom du Lac, Sarah Larimer and Lindsey Bever ) A Michigan appeals court rejected Jill Stein\u2019s recount effort as unlawful, saying state canvassers should have never let her proceed because she had no chance to overturn the results and is thus \u201cnot an aggrieved candidate.\u201d The decision essentially ends the recount. ( Detroit Free Press ) Emotional testimony began in the Dylann Roof trial. One survivor recounted her harrowing tale of the Charleston church shooting, in which Roof sat in on a Bible study for nearly an hour \u2013 \u201cchuckling\u201d when the pastor said something funny \u2013 before gunning down both her son and aunt. By the time the judge ordered a short recess, even the sketch artist was in tears. ( Kevin Sullivan ) A Florida woman was charged with making death threats against the parent of a child who died in the Sandy Hook elementary school shootings because she thought the massacre was a hoax. Her arrest comes after years of conspiracy theories, with some claiming the tragic massacre was staged to prompt support for gun control legislation.\u00a0( AP ) Members of the House Transportation Committee approved plans for a new FBI headquarters, advancing plans to fully fund the 2.1 million square-foot facility next year. ( Jonathan O'Connell ) Pope Francis spoke out against fake news, comparing the spread of disinformation to a fascination with feces.\u00a0\u201cDisinformation is probably the greatest damage that the media can do, as opinion is guided in one direction, neglecting the other part of the truth,\u201d the pope said in an interview.

( Bryanna Cappadona ) Sadly, sexism is alive and well across the pond too: British Prime Minister Theresa May came under heavy fire for wearing a pair of $1,200 leather pants for a photo shoot, drawing outrage among some who suggested the item puts her \u201cout of touch\u201d with the common man.\u00a0But male politicians, such as predecessor David Cameron, often donned outfits that cost nearly four times as much. And no one complained.\u00a0( Adam Taylor ) A North Carolina mother is demanding that a mall Santa Claus be fired after he \u201cbody shamed\u201d her son, telling the nine-year-old to \u201clay off the burgers and french fries\u201d and driving him to tears.

Gen. John F. Kelly awards a Purple Heart to an injured Marine in San Antonio in 2011. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) TRUMP STOCKS HIS CABINET WITH GENERALS AND BILLIONAIRES: -- Trump selected retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security, recruiting a third former member of the military\u2019s brass to serve at the highest levels of his administration. From Philip Rucker and Mike DeBonis : \u201cTrump\u2019s choice of Kelly \u2014 and his continued deliberations about tapping as many as two more military figures for other posts \u2014 has intensified worries among some members of Congress and national security experts that the new administration\u2019s policies may be shaped disproportionately by military commanders. Despite making regular remarks on the campaign trail disparaging the nation\u2019s generals, Trump has long shown an affinity for them. In shaping his administration, Trump has prioritized what one adviser described as \u2018can-do, no-bull types,\u2019 which the president-elect sees as a deliberate contrast from the personnel choices President Obama has made.\u201d If confirmed, Kelly and defense secretary nominee James Mattis, a retired Marine general with the nickname \u201cMad Dog,\u201d would join retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for White House national security adviser. Meanwhile, retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus is under consideration for secretary of state, and Navy Adm. Michael S. Rogers is a contender for director of national intelligence. Other figures with military backgrounds are populating the administration as well, including Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who graduated from West Point and served in the Army in the Gulf War, is Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, while Stephen K. Bannon, a former naval officer, will serve the president in the West Wing as chief strategist and senior counselor. -- A chorus of Senate Democrats decried the reliance on former brass: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee: \u201cI\u2019m concerned. Each of these individuals may have great merit in their own right, but what we\u2019ve learned over the past 15 years is that when we view problems in the world through a military lens, we make big mistakes.\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.): \u201cFor a guy who got four or five deferments from the draft, he seems pretty impressed with the military.\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.): \u201cIt\u2019s the G&G cabinet. It does seem to be fairly limited to Goldman Sachs and generals.\u201d -- But William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a Democrat who served as a White House policy adviser to former president Bill Clinton, said the concerns about generals \u201ccharging ahead\u201d with no regard for legal or constitutional constraints \u2014 or without a willingness to challenge the president\u2019s decisions \u2014 are misplaced. He told Rucker that modern-day generals are trained to navigate a minefield of potential conflicts and legal concerns. \u201cThey\u2019re schooled to believe that if they or any subordinates receive an unlawful order, it\u2019s not to be obeyed,\u201d Galston said. \u201cIf you asked me, would I prefer a government of generals or a government of lawyers, that\u2019s not an easy choice. We\u2019ve experimented with a government of lawyers, and that hasn\u2019t been so fantastic, has it? Maybe it\u2019s time to give the generals a chance.\u201d -- Trump will nominate wrestling magnate and twice-failed Senate candidate Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. \u201cLinda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the country\u2019s top female executives advising businesses around the globe,\u201d Trump said in the announcement. \u201cAnd while McMahon won\u2019t have a \u2018titantron,\u2019 or video package that plays as wrestlers enter the ring, when she steps into the White House for the first time, if she did, it probably would not look all that different from the one she used at WWE,\u201d WaPo sports reporter Marissa Payne notes.

Trump told the crowd at Cipriani that his fellow real estate developers could have negotiated a better deal for the Air Force One program \u2026 At Wednesday's over-capacity fundraiser, which was expected to raise at least $4 million for the nonprofit running Trump's transition effort, the president-elect indicated that he will continue to use his post to put pressure on individual corporations. Trump told the audience that he urged Apple chief executive Tim Cook to build his next factory in the United States instead of overseas, saying that would make him happy.\u201d Attendees said Trump appeared cool to a suggestion that he kick off his inauguration with a Fifth Avenue parade before boarding a Trump-branded helicopter to Washington, noting how much a parade would snarl Manhattan traffic. -- \u201c Trump\u2019s deal to create 50,000 jobs in America looks a lot different on Day Two ,\u201d by Ana Swanson: \u201cWhen [Trump] announced Tuesday that Japanese corporate giant SoftBank had agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs, he presented it as a triumph for American workers. But economists and analysts \u2026 suggest it might be a bigger win for the Japanese telecom and Internet conglomerate, SoftBank, and its billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son. Analysts said the Japanese company could be angling for lucrative benefits, including the regulatory approval to carry out one of the largest telecom mergers in recent history, between Sprint, which SoftBank owns, and rival carrier T-Mobile. It could also be cultivating a friendly environment for further technology investments Son is seeking to make in the United States.

Dimon is a self-described Democrat and a member of [Trump's] economic advisory team. He appears likely to push the group to embrace the opportunities of the shifting political landscape, including possible cooperation with Trump \u2026 on lowering corporate taxes and rolling back environmental, financial and other regulations issued by the Obama administration. He also appears set to push the business community, and Trump, to work together on issues meant to help working-class Americans, such as investing in job-training programs. Dimon\u2019s champions inside the Roundtable say he is also likely to steer the group to confront Trump on several issues, most notably trade and immigration, where his campaign promises have broken with long-standing goals of the business lobby.\u201d Oklahoma Gov.

Biden, who for 36 years filled the chamber with voluble oratory, sat in the presiding officer\u2019s chair \u2026 as a bipartisan collection of colleagues poured out tributes for the outgoing vice president.

One longtime local reporter called it \u2018Hell night,\u2019 the worst he had seen in 25 years. \u2026 For locals, the news is especially painful because they believe Salisbury, about 50 miles north of Charlotte, should stand out not for violence, but for tolerance and creativity. The small and vibrant downtown boasts theaters, independent bookstores and a string of artist studios set up in an old railroad depot. When the Ku Klux Klan announced plans to hold a victory rally in North Carolina last weekend, city residents responded with a \u2018March for Love.\u2019 'You never hear Salisbury,' said Don Vick, who owns a candy store downtown.

He left \u2018Smallsbury,\u2019 a nickname for his hometown, for the 350-mile drive to Washington with the intention of giving the restaurant a \u2018closer look\u2019 and then returning home. Once he got to the pizzeria, there was an abrupt change of plans.\u201d What was he like?: \u201cMr. Welch was soft-spoken and polite, and said he liked the outdoors. He said he did not believe in conspiracy theories, but then added that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks needed to be re-examined. \u2026 He said he did not like the term fake news, believing it was meant to diminish stories outside the mainstream media, which he does not completely trust. He also said he was not political.\u201d What did he think when he discovered there were no children at the pizzeria?: \u201c\u2019The intel on this wasn\u2019t 100 percent,\u2019 he said.

It is also small by mega-party standards, holding a few hundred people.

Invitations to the party went out last week, and the remaining staff of the Clinton campaign has been fielding complaints ever since from donors who were not included \u2026 The Plaza's storied history includes a period of ownership by Trump, who had coveted the five-star historic property for years before buying it for more than $400 million in 1988. The businessman lost the hotel in bankruptcy several years later.\u201d PUNDITS WEIGH IN: -- New York Times columnist Frank Bruni \u00a0rips Ryan for his \u201cdangerous silence\u201d on the president-elect: \u201cOn the subject of Trump, Ryan has spoken out of so many sides of his mouth that it\u2019s less an oval than an octagon at this point. Last spring he even affirmed his endorsement of Trump while calling him out for racism. \u2026 Behold leadership at its most gelatinous. Discussing Trump on \u201860 Minutes,\u2019 he had a manner that was borderline coquettish. He said that Trump, with his tweets, was \u2018basically giving voice to a lot of people who have felt that they were voiceless.\u2019 Sometimes, yes. But many times, Trump is giving a green light to kooks and the finger to the dignity that Americans rightly expect of a president and that Ryan should demand of him. Ryan is sacrificing too much for too little, and it\u2019s time he rummaged through his wobbly endoskeleton and made fresh acquaintance with his spine.

This will be done partly as conservatism\u2019s challenge to liberalism\u2019s supremacy in the victimhood sweepstakes, telling aggrieved groups that they are helpless victims of vast, impersonal forces, against which they can be protected only by government interventions. Although the president-elect has yet to dip a toe into the swamp, he practices the calculus by which Washington reasons, the political asymmetry between dispersed costs and concentrated benefits. \u2026 What formerly was called conservatism resisted the permeation of society by politics, and particularly by the sort of unconstrained executive power that has been wielded by the 44th president. The man who will be the 45th forthrightly and comprehensively repudiates the traditional conservative agenda and, in reversing it, embraces his predecessor\u2019s executive swagger.\" -- New York Magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait says Trump has proven liberals right about the Tea Party movement:\u00a0\"When the tea party appeared on the scene in 2009, an intense partisan dispute broke out as to just what this movement represented. Conservatives insisted that what spurred protesters into streets and town halls were the timeless principles of conservative movement thought: advocacy of balanced budgets, adherence to a strict constructionist version of the Constitution, opposition to 'crony capitalism,' and skepticism of Keynesian economics. Liberals suggested a different explanation. The tea party was an expression of ethno-nationalist rage centered around a black president and the belief that his coalition stood for redistribution from older, white America ... One could not have devised a sequence of events more perfectly designed to prove the liberal theory of the case than the election of Trump. It\u2019s one thing to suspect tea-party rhetoric was phony, quite another to believe the entire GOP could disregard every single putative principle of the movement even before it had its hands on power.

    "text": "Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Two Chicago police officers have resigned in the face of firing over their off-duty beating of a restaurant patron on the Northwest Side more than a decade ago. Brian Murphy and Jason Orsa, both 12-year department veterans, stepped down effective Dec. 1, said police spokesman Frank Giancamilli. Their resignations came a little more than a week after the Illinois Supreme Court denied an appeal of their dismissals and before the Chicago Police Board could move to fire them as soon as its monthly meeting Thursday night. Even though the police board had originally dismissed the two officers in January 2011, both still remained on the force more than a decade after the incident because a Cook County judge had overturned their firings in 2012. They were reinstated on the force and given back pay. Murphy, Orsa and another officer, Daniel McNamara, had allegedly just been drinking at a nearby bar when they went to eat at the Taco Burrito King restaurant at Higgins and Harlem avenues during the early morning of March 24, 2006. The trio, along with a Marine friend who had just returned from Iraq, were sitting at a table when Obed \"OJ\" DeLeon walked inside the restaurant and complained about a car blocking the parking lot. Murphy jumped up from his seat, pointed his service pistol at DeLeon's head and shoved him against a wall, surveillance video shows. Orsa, McNamara and their friend also joined in. DeLeon was punched, knocked down twice, kicked, hit and held facedown on the floor of the crowded restaurant. His shirt was ripped off, revealing gang tattoos on his body. Five years later, the police board fired Murphy and Orsa after two eyewitnesses and video confirmed they had started the fight. Pantle reversed the board's decision, pointing to the delayed, four-year investigation by Chicago's police oversight agency, saying the officers were unable to track witnesses closer to the time of the attack. She also blasted DeLeon as a gang member. But in August, a three-judge panel of an Illinois appeals court upheld the dismissals, noting that Murphy could have been fired just for pulling out his service weapon \"unprovoked\" in the restaurant. The court held that Orsa had repeatedly and unjustifiably kicked DeLeon and that the two officers attempted to cover up what happened. The court also rejected their contention during the police board hearing that DeLeon started the conflict by yelling the gang slogans and boasting he was a cop killer. A front-page Tribune article about the appeals court reversal quoted two eyewitnesses who were also arrested as expressing surprise to learn from a reporter that both officers were still then on the force. The officers appealed to the state Supreme Court, but it was denied on Nov. 23, according to a spokesman for the court and Max Caproni, the police board's executive director. In its original ruling in 2011, the police board found insufficient evidence to prove McNamara took part in the beating but suspended him for 18 months for failing to tell supervisors of his and the other officers' involvement in the altercation. The board also gave one of two sergeants who responded to the restaurant, Louis Danielson, a six-month suspension for not going inside the restaurant or trying to find out who had a gun. But the city dropped Danielson's suspension after Murphy and Orsa won their jobs back, clearing his record and awarding him back pay. After the appellate court reversed the judge's decision, however, the city chose not to pursue Danielson's suspension, said Giancamilli, the police spokesman. A few days after the beating, DeLeon lodged a complaint against the police. But it wasn't until a year later that the officers were questioned by investigators for the Independent Police Review Authority , Chicago's much-maligned agency that investigates the most serious allegations of police misconduct. In those interviews, the officers alleged for the first time that DeLeon had threatened police and yelled gang slogans in the restaurant. Eighteen more months passed before IPRA tried to interview the sergeant who approved the criminal charges against DeLeon and two eyewitnesses, but he had retired by then, records show. Records also show the IPRA investigation limped along for years. One investigator asked supervisors for extensions on deadlines at least 23 times, according to the records. Finally, in 2010, four years after the incident, then-police Superintendent Jody Weis brought formal charges against the officers, seeking their dismissal, before the police board. ",

    "text": "AMERICUS, Ga. \u2013 The second officer shot responding to a domestic violence call in southern Georgia Wednesday has died, officials say. Georgia Southwestern State University Officer Jody Smith, 26, died Thursday at a Macon hospital where he was being treated for his injuries, according to a statement from the university\u2019s interim president. Smith was shot along with an Americus police officer, 25-year-old Nicholas Smarr, who died Wednesday. The officers were\u00a0 reportedly best friends \u00a0and had graduated from high school and the police academy together. The suspect in the shooting, 32-year-old Minquell Kennedy Lembrick, killed himself Thursday after barricading himself inside a home, officials said. Minquell Kennedy Lembrick CBS affiliate WMAZ \u201cWe have just received word that GSW Public Safety Officer Jody Smith has succumbed to his injuries and has passed away,\u201d the interim president, Charles Patterson, said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our deepest condolences to his family during this very difficult time. Officer Smith was a bright, young and energetic officer, and he will be sorely missed.\u201d Speaking Thursday before Smith\u2019s death, Americus police chief Mark Scott said that typically, two Americus police officers respond to domestic violence calls. Smarr was awaiting backup from another Americus officer when Smith heard the radio call and responded to assist, Scott said. \u201cHe took it upon himself to respond and back up his friend,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThey are model officers. They\u2019re heroes, in my opinion.\u201d Scott said Wednesday that Lembrick had an outstanding arrest warrant charging him with kidnapping and other counts when the two officers encountered him at an apartment complex where a domestic dispute had been reported. But officers didn\u2019t know whom they were dealing with when they responded to the 911 call. Scott said Thursday the domestic violence victim was a woman with whom Lembrick had a relationship and said there was \u201cclear evidence of violence\u201d inside the home. The woman and her child were taken to a safe place. After the shootings, Smith was airlifted to a hospital in Macon with critical injuries. Fellow officers who knew them weren\u2019t surprised that Smith, who worked on the college campus near the shooting scene, went to assist Smarr. The two men had been lifelong friends. \u201cThey\u2019ve been close friends since grade school,\u201d said Lt. Chuck Hanks of the Sumter County Sheriff\u2019s Office, where both officers had previously worked as deputies. Hanks said the two men were still roommates, sharing a home in the county. Sumter County Sheriff Pete Smith told reporters both officers were engaged to be married in the coming months. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Hanks said. \u201cWe\u2019re a small community. You see these people every day. You work with them every day.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Angeli Kakade (@angelikakade) has the story. Buzz60 On 'Broad City' and 'Girls,' the female stars clearly have pubic hair. (Photo: Patrik Giardino) 106 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE To shave or not to shave down there? It's usually a private question women ask, but it's one that's gotten attention this week in the wake of a recent study suggesting that those who remove all of their pubic hair are more likely to report having an STI than non-groomers. Possible health benefits aside, pubic hair has been a part of the public discourse lately.\u00a0At least when it comes to 20-somethings on TV. Broad City's\u00a0Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer certainly didn't want Ilana's character\u00a0to be seen with a hairless \"baby vagina,\" as Glazer termed  it. 'Broad City' stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, here at Comedy Central upfront, made sure their character didn't appear to have a bare vagina on TV. \u00a0(Photo: Bryan Bedder) \"I'm an adult. I have boobs, I have pubic hair,\" she said on\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel , hence her Broad City\u00a0persona's appropriately-colored blur over her genitals in a nude scene in\u00a0the show's\u00a0 Season 2 premiere . After talking with Comedy Central, Jacobson and Glazer got the OK to change the pixels from skin-color to dark brown. (\"In a way, you're not just doing a show, you're fighting for civil rights,\" Kimmel joked.) On\u00a0Girls,\u00a0Lena Dunham's character Hannah flashed her unshaven vagina on the fifth season of the show. Dunham's one regret for that scene?\u00a0\"I wish that I had a fuller bush, I just think it would look better, the whole thing would work better,\" she said on HBO's\u00a0Behind the Episode. Why Millennials are going braless Off-screen, other actresses have made their grooming habits known. In her\u00a0Body Book,\u00a0released three years ago, Cameron Diaz has an entire chapter\u00a0called\u00a0\"In Praise of Pubes.\" In it, she writes that maintaining a \"lovely curtain of pubic hair that surrounds that glorious, delicate flower of yours\" makes you more \"enticing and mysterious.\" That's a sentiment Miley Cyrus would likely agree with. A year ago, the singer proudly revealed her pink pubic hair in\u00a0Instagram photos of herself (and a\u00a0 doll outfitted in her likeness ) and in\u00a0a nude\u00a0Paper Magazine\u00a0photo shoot. Gwyneth Paltrow has also admitted that she works \"a '70s vibe\" which had \"everyone scrambling for a razor\" when she had to go commando on the runway three years ago. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore go makeup-free for 2017 Pirelli Calendar It's not just stars who are keeping hair down there. Laura Schubert, CEO of high-end pubic haircare company Fur, launched her brand last year when she saw that all Google searches of \"pubic hair\" led to sites about\u00a0removal. Now, her company's signature Fur Oil product , $39, is sold in dozens of stores in the U.S. and abroad, to customers who have varying grooming habits. High-end brand Fur sells pubic haircare products. \u00a0(Photo: Courtesy Laura Schubert) It's not necessarily that the full bush is back, Schubert says, but that pubic grooming is following the \"natural\" movement that has also recently influenced the\u00a0 braless trend \u00a0and\u00a0 makeup-free look . \"Modern beauty is really about redefining our old standards of care (and) moving\u00a0away from a world where bare is what you had to be,\" she says. \"You get to decide what\u2019s sexy.\" 106 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hpQIdQ ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story To the America of the 1960s, Mr. Glenn was a clean-cut, good-natured, well-grounded Midwesterner, raised in Presbyterian rectitude, nurtured in patriotism and tested in war, who stepped forward to risk the unknown and succeeded spectacularly, lifting his country\u2019s morale and restoring its self-confidence. It was an anxious nation that watched and listened that February morning, as Mr. Glenn, 40 years old, a Marine Corps test pilot and one of the seven original American astronauts, climbed into Friendship 7, the tiny Mercury capsule atop an Atlas rocket rising from the concrete flats of Cape Canaveral in Florida. The Cold War had long stoked fears of nuclear destruction, and the Russians seemed to be winning the contest with their unsettling ascent into outer space. Two Russians, Yuri A. Gagarin and Gherman S. Titov, had already orbited Earth the year before, overshadowing the feats of two Americans, Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom, who had been launched only to the fringes of space. What, people asked with rising urgency, had happened to the United States\u2019 vaunted technology and can-do spirit? Photo John Glenn with the Friendship 7 in 1962. He was hailed as a national hero and a symbol of the space age as the first American to orbit Earth. Credit NASA The answer came at 9:47 a.m. Eastern time, when after weeks of delays the rocket achieved liftoff. It was a short flight, just three orbits. But when Mr. Glenn was safely back, flashing the world a triumphant grin, doubts were replaced by a broad, new faith that the United States could indeed hold its own against the Soviet Union in the Cold War and might someday prevail. No flier since Lindbergh had received such a cheering welcome. Bands played. People cried with relief and joy. Mr. Glenn was invited to the White House by President John F. Kennedy and paraded up Broadway and across the land. A joint meeting of Congress stood and applauded vigorously as Mr. Glenn spoke at the Capitol . Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his political history of the space age, \u201c\u2026The Heavens and the Earth,\u201d the author Walter A. McDougall described Mr. Glenn\u2019s space mission as a \u201cnational catharsis unparalleled.\u201d \u201cIt seemed that he had given Americans back their self-respect,\u201d Mr. McDougall added, \u201cand more than that \u2014 it seemed Americans dared again to hope.\u201d Mr. Glenn was reluctant to talk about himself as a hero. \u201cI figure I\u2019m the same person who grew up in New Concord, Ohio, and went off through the years to participate in a lot of events of importance,\u201d he said in an interview years later. \u201cWhat got a lot of attention, I think, was the tenuous times we thought we were living in back in the Cold War. I don\u2019t think it was about me. All this would have happened to anyone who happened to be selected for that flight.\u201d Mr. Glenn did not return to space for a long time. Kennedy thought him too valuable as a hero to risk losing in an accident. So Mr. Glenn resigned from the astronaut corps in 1964, became an executive in private industry and entered politics, serving four full terms as a Democratic senator from Ohio and in 1984 running unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination. Finally, 36 years after his Mercury flight, in the last months of his final Senate term, he got his wish for a return to orbit. Despite some criticism that his presence on the mission was a political payoff, a waste of money and of doubtful scientific merit, the hero of yesteryear brought out the crowds again, cheering out of nostalgia and enduring respect as he was launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on Oct. 29, 1998. At 77, he became the oldest person to go into space. Photo After weeks of delays, Mr. Glenn climbed into Friendship 7 on Feb. 20, 1962, and at 9:47 a.m. Eastern time, the rocket achieved liftoff. Credit NASA In retirement from the Senate, Mr. Glenn lived with his wife of 73 years, Anna (he always called her Annie), in a suburb of Washington in addition to Columbus. Ohio State University is the repository of papers from his space and political careers. \u201cJohn always had the right stuff,\u201d President Obama said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cinspiring generations of scientists, engineers and astronauts who will take us to Mars and beyond \u2014 not just to visit, but to stay.\u201d The Making of a Hero John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the only son of a railroad conductor who also owned a plumbing business, and the former Clara Sproat. A few years later, the Glenns moved to New Concord, a small town in southeastern Ohio with a population of little more than 1,000. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt was small but had a lot of patriotic feeling and parades on all the national holidays,\u201d Mr. Glenn once said. \u201cWanting to do something for the country was just natural, growing up in a place like New Concord.\u201d Like most everyone else there, the Glenns lived through the hard times of the Depression, instilling in their son a rigid moral code based on their own God-fearing example and saw him through an apple-pie boyhood. He played trumpet, sang in the church choir, washed cars for pocket money and worked as a lifeguard. In high school (now named for him), he was an honor student and lettered in football, basketball and tennis. He still had time to court his high school sweetheart, Anna Margaret Castor, the doctor\u2019s daughter. It did not matter that she stammered; she was his girl, and he loved her. They married in April 1943, and he often called her \u201cthe real rock of the family.\u201d From the time they came to public attention, and throughout the turbulence of spaceflight and politics, John and Anna Glenn each seemed the other\u2019s center of gravity. Not until much later did she undergo intensive therapy that virtually cured her stammer, enabling her even to give speeches in public. Photo Mr. Glenn with President John F. Kennedy and General Leighton I. Davis during a parade in Cocoa Beach, Fla., after his spaceflight. No flier since Charles Lindbergh had received such a cheering welcome. Credit NASA Mr. Glenn is survived by his wife; two children, Carolyn Ann Glenn of St. Paul and John David Glenn of Berkeley, Calif.; and two grandsons, Daniel and Zach Glenn. Mr. Glenn began his journey to fame in World War II. In 1939, he enrolled at Muskingum College in his hometown to study chemistry, but he took flying lessons on the side. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he signed up for the Naval Aviation cadet program and after pilot training opted to join the Marines. As a fighter pilot, he flew 59 combat missions in the Pacific, earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and other decorations. Mr. Glenn saw more action in the Korean War, flying 90 combat missions and winning more medals. He put his life on the line again as a military test pilot in the early days of supersonic flight. In 1957, just months before the Soviet Union launched its first Sputnik satellite, he made the first transcontinental supersonic flight, piloting an F8U-1 Crusader from Los Angeles to New York in record time: 3 hours 23 minutes 8.4 seconds. Then, in 1959, newly promoted to lieutenant colonel, he heeded a call for test pilots to apply to be astronauts for the fledgling National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He and six other pilots were selected in April of that year. (The original Mercury 7 included Mr. Glenn, Mr. Shepard, Mr. Grissom, Walter Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton and Scott Carpenter. Mr. Glenn was the last surviving one.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story All seven men were eager, competitive and ambitious, but none more so than Mr. Glenn. Tom Miller, a retired Marine general and close friend since they were rookie pilots in World War II, recalled that Mr. Glenn was so determined to be an astronaut that he applied weight to his head to compress his height down to the 5-foot-11-inch maximum for the first astronauts. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to miss a trick,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019d be sitting down reading with a big bunch of books sitting on his head.\u201d But his determination did not win him the assignment to be the first American astronaut to fly. He had to wait out the suborbital flights by Mr. Shepard and Mr. Grissom in 1961 before his turn came. Patience, Then Liftoff In his 1999 memoir, written with Nick Taylor, he admitted he was sorely disappointed when Mr. Shepard was tapped for the first flight. As the oldest and most articulate of the astronauts, Mr. Glenn had attracted a big share of the publicity. He said that he had \u201cworked and studied hard dedicating myself to the program\u201d and that he thought he had a \u201cgood shot\u201d at being first. In a letter to a NASA official, Mr. Glenn wrote, \u201cI thought I might have been penalized for speaking out for what I thought was the good of the program.\u201d At this time, as Mr. Glenn often recalled, he never anticipated that his orbital flight would be the one that most excited the public, satisfying the nation\u2019s hunger for a hero. Tom Wolfe wrote of that time in the best-selling 1979 book \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d a phrase for coolness in the face of danger that has passed into the idiom. He described Mr. Glenn as excessively pious, scolding his fellow astronauts about their after-hours escapades while openly lobbying to be the first of them to fly. \u201cHe looked like a balding and slightly tougher version of the cutest-looking freckle-faced country boy you ever saw,\u201d Mr. Wolfe wrote. \u201cHe had a snub nose, light-hazel eyes, reddish-blond hair and a terrific smile.\u201d ",

Lockheed Martin and Boeing are the two major companies involved in discussions to build fighter aircraft production plants in India as part of that country\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, which is essentially a mirror-image of President-elect Trump\u2019s aggressive desire to keep manufacturing jobs within the United States. Trump has made retaining blue-collar jobs a post-election priority, and he\u2019s already had a high-profile success in preventing the loss of several hundred jobs at Indiana\u2019s Carrier plant. \u201cThe U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequences, is WRONG!\u201d Trump said in a series of Sunday tweets. BUDGET CUTS LEAVE MARINE CORPS AIRCRAFT GROUNDED Trump earlier this week also showed a willingness to go after jet maker Boeing, in particular, when he publicly sparred with the company over the cost of a new Air Force One fleet. The \u201cMake in India\u201d program, which is the brainchild of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to eventually increase the country\u2019s manufacturing base to a quarter of the gross domestic product. So when the Indian government required new jets to replace its aging fleet, any corporation that wanted to be involved knew the planes \u2013 an F-16 by Lockheed or F/A-18 by Boeing \u2013 would have to be built in India. \u201cBut this is not oursourcing socks here, this is outsourcing military fighter jets,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice. expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 Sekulow\u2019s group has already started a \u201cPetition to Stop Giving Control of our Fighter Jets to Foreign Nations,\u201d and he plans to deliver the demand to Congress later this week. Sekulow told FoxNews.com his office has already received calls from Lockheed workers in Fort Worth who\u2019ve said they\u2019re being given notice, offered severance packages or told they can apply to work on the F-35 program \u2013 though, with no guarantee of being accepted. A Lockheed spokesperson, however, told FoxNews.com the Fort Worth plant was ramping down production anyway as the U.S. Air Force moved on from the antiquated F-16 and switched to the newer F-35 jet. \u201cSo if you look at the big picture here, thousands of jobs have already gone away as we close out the building of F-16s. That\u2019s a given at this point; there\u2019s nothing we can do to change this,\u201d said Randy Howard, the director of business development for Lockheed\u2019s integrated fighter group. \u201cSo what our offer does is seek to mediate that. To remedy that. To bring back those jobs as much as possible. It adds jobs in India, but it also brings back jobs in Fort Worth and across the U.S.\u201d Howard said opening up a plant in India would actually reinstate about 500 Lockheed staff positions that support F-16 production, \u201cpredominantly\u201d in the United States. He also guaranteed \u201call F-16 workers will have a job available to them on the F-35 production line.\u201d Boeing, too, told FoxNews.com that it\u2019s F/A-18 production line in St. Louis \u201ccontinues to have a solid future.\u201d \u201cOur proposal to meet the needs of the Indian Air Force\u2019s fighter requirements entails creating a separate new Super Hornet production facility in India where Boeing has had a presence for more than seven decades,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the opportunity to continue our work in St. Louis and add a new production line in India which would also create more opportunities for our entire Super Hornet supply chain.\u201d The \u201cMake in India\u201d program is supported by President Obama\u2019s outgoing administration, which is looking to strengthen ties with India. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Thursday visited India and an official statement said the two countries\u2019 continued cooperation \u201cwill strengthen India\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.\u201d A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment more specifically on the program. Sekulow, who said he was first alerted to the India news by former military officers who are a part of his group\u2019s national security team, said he was all for increasing trade and relations with India, but that military manufacturing was a step too far. \u201cPresident [Obama] is not very good with lines in the sand,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cBut here\u2019s one he should draw.\u201d Advertisement ",

But he was more than a risk-taker and statesman. He was better than all of us. Here are some interesting facts about the American hero: He orbited\u00a0the globe more than 100 times Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, would do it more than 100 times. He first circled the globe in 1962, when he went around the world three times and then plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. In a later trip, he would circle the globe another 134 times. He's the oldest person to go into space In 1998, the\u00a077-year-old\u00a0climbed aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest\u00a0person ever to go into space.\u00a0NASA did a number of medical tests on Glenn in preparation for the flight and after the trip. He flew 149 military combat missions Glenn, who got his first taste of\u00a0flying\u00a0as an 8-year-old, flew 149 combat missions in World War II and the Korean War.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the dangers of the promulgation of fake news on Thursday after conspiracy stories involving her campaign spurred violence recently. \"The epidemic of malicious fake news and fake propaganda that flooded social media over the past year, it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences,\" Clinton said. Man Fires Rifle Inside D.C. Pizzeria, Cites Fictitious Conspiracy Theories She was referring to the \"Pizzagate\" incident in D.C. this weekend, which came to a terrifying head. A man believing a fake news story that Clinton and her aides were running a child sex ring out of a D.C. pizzeria entered the restaurant Sunday and fired a gun; no one was injured. \"This isn't about politics or partisanship \u2014 lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days, to do their jobs, contribute to their communities,\" Clinton said in a speech at the Capitol where she and other lawmakers were honoring retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Other businesses around Comet Ping Pong have also received threats after conspiracy theories were peddled online, including by Infowars' Alex Jones, whom President-elect Donald Trump has praised. Abdel Hammad, owner of neighboring Besta Pizza, said he has also received threats amid allegations his business is also involved in child trafficking, and he told NPR member station WAMU that even though he voted for Trump, he is now rethinking that decision. Article continues after sponsorship Radio Conspiracy Theorist Claims Ear Of Trump, Pushes 'Pizzagate' Fictions \"It's a danger that must be addressed, and addressed quickly,\" Clinton continued. \"Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda, and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news. It's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives.\" The pointed comments from Clinton came amid a rare public appearance for the former nominee over the past month since she lost the election. At the outset of her speech, she made a joking nod to her reclusiveness. \"This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be giving after the election, but after a few weeks of taking selfies in the woods, I thought it would be a good idea to come out,\" she said, laughing.

    "text": "Donald Trump's EPA Pick Has Repeatedly Challenged the Agency By Meghan Keneally Dec 8, 2016, 4:49 PM ET 0 Shares Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images WATCH President-elect Trump Picks Scott Pruitt to Head EPA 0 Shares Email The selection of Scott Pruitt as Donald Trump 's choice to lead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has raised concerns among some scientists and people who\u2019ve worked with the EPA. Pruitt, the Republican attorney general for Oklahoma since 2011, has interacted most directly with the EPA by suing it over what he sees as over-reaching federal regulations. Some scientists have also questioned his fitness to run the environmental agency considering he has publicly stated that he believes the debate over the cause of global warming is \u201cfar from settled.\u201d His nomination to now lead the agency is akin to putting \"someone in charge of the Defense Department who doesn't believe we should have a military, or someone in charge of the Transportation Department who doesn't like roads,\" said Dan Kanninen, a former White House liaison at the EPA. But Pruitt, 48, appears to pride himself on his work against the EPA, describing himself as a \"leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda\" in his biography on the official Oklahoma state website. \u201cI am deeply grateful and honored to serve as President-elect Trump\u2019s EPA Administrator,\u201d Pruitt said in in a Trump transition team statement today announcing his selection, which requires Senate approval. \"The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses.\u201d Here is where he falls on some of the issues: He Believes the Global Warming Debate Is Unsettled Pruitt co-authored a May op-ed piece for the National Review, a conservative publication, saying \"global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time,\" but \"that debate is far from settled.\" \"Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind,\" the article reads. But the vast majority of scientists in this field disagree, according to multiple studies cited by NASA. It says those studies claim 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that \u201cclimate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.\u201d Rob Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, told ABC News that it should come as no surprise that Trump's EPA pick has \"an anti-regulation\" stance, but that shouldn't automatically rule out established science\u2019s conclusion that mankind is contributing to global warming. \"The greatest concern that I have and that a lot of scientists have in response to this is the fact that this individual seems to have an anti-science agenda as well, and one can acknowledge the role that humans are playing in changing the chemistry of our atmosphere and changing the temperature on the planet and still disagree about what you do about it, and that's a policy discussion,\" Young said. Oklahoma Joined a Challenge to the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan Pruitt and his office this year helped prepare a lawsuit, which included other states and was led by the West Virginia solicitor general, in which the plaintiffs are fighting the EPA to stop its plan to reduce power plant carbon dioxide emissions (the Clean Power Plan). \"This administration continues to treat states as mere vessels of federal will, abusing and disrespecting the vertical separation of powers defined by our Constitution,\u201d Pruitt said after a day of hearings in the West Virginia v. EPA case in September. \u201cThat is why attorneys general, senators and congressmen from across the country have joined together today to maintain rule of law and checks and balances in this very process. I am committed to ensuring the ultimate payer in this matter is not overlooked \u2013 the consumers.\u201d This position is in keeping with his overarching commitment as Oklahoma attorney general to eliminate what he calls \u201cunwarranted regulation and overreach by the federal government,\u201d according to his biography on the state website. The case, West Virginia v. EPA, is still open and ongoing in the D.C. Court of Appeals. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt arrives at Trump Tower in New York, Dec. 7, 2016. Oklahoma\u2019s Own Lawsuit Was Dismissed Pruitt had filed a similar lawsuit pre-emptively last year trying to stop the EPA from enforcing the same Clean Power Plan, saying it exceeded the agency\u2019s authority and was already doing \"irreparable harm\" to Oklahoma. \"Whether the State of Oklahoma adopts a state plan to meet EPA\u2019s goals or EPA promulgates a federal implementation plan, the EPA Power Plan forces the State of Oklahoma to undertake substantial legislative, regulatory, planning, and other activities,\" the suit alleged. The case was dismissed in July 2015 and the appeal was dismissed in September 2015, according to the court docket. He Supports the Keystone XL Pipeline Pruitt released a statement in May saying the controversial pipeline would \"continue to create jobs\" and slammed President Obama and his administration for \"continu[ing] to interfere with the completion of the pipeline.\" \"The president\u2019s own State Department has concluded, after years of study, that the pipeline will do little to directly harm the environment or increase greenhouse gas emissions, so his actions to prohibit the pipeline are solely an attempt to place his 'legacy' and political ambition above our country\u2019s ability to move closer to energy independence,\" Pruitt said in a statement . He Has Ties to the Oil and Gas Industry Beyond taking a public stance against the EPA and raising doubts about the scientifically established cause of global warming, Pruitt has financial alliances to the oil and gas industry that trouble some opponents. The connection largely comes from the various oil and natural gas extraction projects that are underway in Oklahoma, which have come under scrutiny amid the rise in fracking and earthquakes in the landlocked state. While defenders of the projects argue that the increase in earthquakes is unrelated to fracking, Young, of Western Carolina University, says that when water released in the process is forced back into the ground, it frequently plays a major factor in causing earthquakes. J Pat Carter/Getty Images Oil field workers pull pipes from a fracking well, March 31, 2016, near, Crescent, Oklahoma. The New York Times reported on Pruitt's ties to oil and gas in 2014 when it claimed that a letter from Pruitt to the EPA that was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, an oil and gas company based in Oklahoma. In response to the Times report, Pruitt provided a statement to Oklahoma station KFOR : \"The article did not accurately reflect what motivates my service and how we seek to make decisions on advancing these cases,\" the statement read. \"Our responsibility is to protect Oklahoma\u2019s interest when any federal agency seeks to displace the authority granted to the state under federal law. This administration has given us plenty of opportunity to litigate those matters in regards to energy, the environment, and health care and that is what is driving us, nothing more or nothing less.\" \"It should come as no surprise that I am working diligently with Oklahoma energy companies, the people of Oklahoma and the majority of attorneys general to fight the unlawful overreach of the EPA and other federal agencies,\" the letter read. Kanninen, who has worked in several Democratic political positions, including his time at the Obama White House and working as a Wisconsin state director for Obama's campaign during the 2008 election, said Pruitt \"is someone who has been in the belly of the oil and gas industry; that\u2019s where he comes from.\" \"He's well known as an antagonist to the environmental community. Someone who's repeatedly taken the side of the oil and gas industry,\" Kanninen said. Campaign finance records show that Pruitt received $5,000 in contributions from the Koch Industries PAC during his 2010 campaign for attorney general, and BP donated $500. He also received contributions from the Marathon Oil Company Employee's PAC for $1,000, the Chevron Employees PAC for $1,000 and the OGE Energy Corp. Employee's PAC for $3,500, according to Oklahoma state records. Trump, however, praised Pruitt's work and said in a statement announcing his pick that Pruitt would \"reverse this trend\" of how he alleges the EPA spends \"taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs, while also undermining our incredible farmers and many other businesses and industries at every turn.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Dec 8, 2016 4:50 PM EST LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles prosecutors on Thursday sued four national retailers, accusing them of duping shoppers into believing they got bigger discounts than they actually did. The separate lawsuits alleging deceptive advertising were filed against J.C. Penney, Sears, Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, according to the Los Angeles city attorney\u2019s office. \u201cCustomers have the right to be told the truth about the prices they\u2019re paying - and to know if a bargain is really a bargain,\u201d Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. 9 retail sales tricks to get you to spend more Feuer said the retailers falsely advertised higher regular prices for merchandise so customers believed they were getting bigger bargains. California law bars retailers from advertising a higher original price unless the product was sold at that price within three months of the ad. Sears and J.C. Penney declined to comment. Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s did not immediately respond to messages for comment. The lawsuits seek civil penalties up to $2,500 for each violation and injunctions to stop so-called false reference pricing to increase sales.\u00a0 Prosecutors said thousands of \u201csale\u201d items were advertised at false reference prices. One of the lawsuits said\u00a0 J.C. Penney was selling a maternity bathing suit top online for $31.99 in February, down from a so-called original price of $46. The top was later marked down further but still compared to the $46 price point, even though the item was never actually sold for $46. 12 ways Amazon gets you to spend more Another suit claims that Kohl\u2019s last year adverstised a sale on belted cargo shorts at a price of $35.99, which the company said was down from an original price of $60. But Kohl\u2019s allegedly never priced the item at that higher price, according to prosecutors.\u00a0 Macy\u2019s is accused of claiming that a sterling silver necklace that the retailer advertised with a sale price of $30 was originally priced at $120. That, too, was a false reference price, the suit charges.\u00a0 Feuer wants to bar the retailers from using such tactics, and is also seeking civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation. Prosecutors said J.C. Penney and Kohl\u2019s previously faced class-action lawsuits alleging similar deceptive business practices and had agreed to stop. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, center, flanked by his attorney Nathan J. Hochman, left, and wife Carol Chiang, as he arrives at federal court this week for his obstruction of justice trial. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Joel Rubin and Victoria Kim Contact Reporters It\u2019s a tried and true technique of prosecutors to go after low-level criminals and turn them against their bosses. In federal court Thursday, a onetime Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy took the witness stand in the case against his former top boss: retired\u00a0Sheriff Lee Baca . Mickey Manzo, who now works at a Home Depot, said he was testifying in exchange for a potential reduction of the 24-month sentence he received in 2014 when he was convicted, along\u00a0with\u00a0five others, of\u00a0taking part in a plot to thwart an FBI investigation into abuse and corruption in the sheriff-run county jails. Manzo is expected to start serving his sentence early next year. Through Manzo and other witnesses, prosecutors are attempting to establish that Baca was personally aware of and involved in the events of the summer of 2011, when they allege the sheriff and his subordinates conspired to obstruct federal authorities. A lawyer for Baca told jurors this week that the evidence does not connect the former top lawman to any crimes committed by the rank-and-file deputies and pinned the blame on former Undersheriff Paul Tanaka , who has also been convicted in the case and sentenced to a five-year prison term. Manzo recounted from the witness stand the steps he took after deputies found a cellphone on an inmate at Men\u2019s Central Jail, who they discovered was feeding information to the civil rights squad at\u00a0the FBI office in Los Angeles. Manzo testified that he was ordered by a lieutenant to interview the inmate and to record the conversation, so that the lieutenant could play the tape for \u201cthe executives.\u201d \u201cWho did you understand the executives to mean?\u201d Assistant U.S. Atty. Brandon Fox asked. \u201cThe sheriff and the undersheriff,\u201d Manzo responded. When the recording was played at a meeting the following morning, Manzo recalled Tanaka becoming\u00a0enraged over the FBI\u2019s investigation.\u00a0Baca, he said, was not openly angry but did give a clear set of orders to the\u00a0group of subordinates before departing. The sheriff ordered that the inmate was to be \u201cisolated and protected\u201d and that the group should\u00a0learn \u201ceverything about the FBI investigation,\u201d Manzo testified. Speaking clearly and confidently, Manzo said Baca was kept in the loop as sheriff\u2019s officials tried to interfere with the FBI.\u00a0 After a sheriff\u2019s deputy did not adhere to an order from Tanaka restricting visits to the inmate and allowed FBI agents into the jail to speak with the man, Manzo said he watched as his supervisor\u00a0nervously walked into Baca\u2019s office to alert him of the mistake. Manzo testified that his supervisor later said Baca had not been upset by the news \u2014\u00a0a description defense attorneys indicated they will home\u00a0in on when they cross-examine Manzo on Friday. Throughout Manzo\u2019s testimony, Fox played audio excerpts from\u00a0the many interviews sheriff\u2019s officials conducted with the inmate informant as they tried to decipher what the FBI was investigating. While Baca was not present for the interviews and\u00a0is\u00a0never mentioned, Fox hopes jurors will conclude he had set the operation in motion and was guiding it. Earlier on Thursday, jurors heard from Bob Olmsted, a retired Sheriff\u2019s Department commander and an early whistleblower about problems with excessive force in county jails.\u00a0 Olmsted, who unsuccessfully ran to replace Baca after the sheriff announced his retirement in 2014,\u00a0testified that he spoke to Baca three times to alert the sheriff about \u201csignificant problems and force issues\u201d at Men\u2019s Central Jail in 2010 and 2011.\u00a0Baca brushed him off and never gave him a chance to fully lay out his concerns, Olmsted told jurors. \u201cThe force issues that are going on are out of control,\u201d Olmsted said he cautioned Baca in a 10-minute meeting in the sheriff's office. \u201cThere are going to be lawsuits like crazy.\u201d Under cross-examination by a defense attorney, Olmsted said Tanaka had told him of ambitions\u00a0to \u201cone day be sheriff and be sheriff for the next 15 years,\u201d and that the undersheriff and other department\u00a0brass sometimes colluded to keep Baca in the dark about goings-on in the department.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Many Oakland warehouse fire questions are still unanswered , how will Hollywood speak to Trump\u2019s America , meet Wilbur Ross, the man Trump has tapped him to lead the U.S. Department of Commerce , and the\u00a0 L.A.

    "text": "(Anna M. Phillips, Jack Dolan and Paige St. John) City spokeswoman Karen Boyd explained the discrepancy Thursday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear until later that there were two properties and that the inspector\u2019s inability to gain access referred to the lot, not the warehouse building,\u201d she said. Questions about the competence of Oakland\u2019s building inspection agency arose five years ago.\u00a0An Alameda County Grand Jury in 2011 released a scathing report accusing the city\u2019s building services division of mismanagement and having haphazard policies about conducting building inspections. The grand jury found that agency was riddled with \u201cpoor management, lack of leadership, and ambiguous policies and procedures.\u201d It added that the agency had inconsistent standards on code violations and that the violation notices sent to property owners were late and hard to understand. In addition, inspectors treated property owners in an \u201cunprofessional, retaliatory and intimidating\u201d manner. Schaaf, who was a city councilwoman at the time of that report,\u00a0said many of those concerns were quickly addressed, and she noted that the city also has been criticized in the past for being too aggressive with building code inspections. The Ghost Ship warehouse was\u00a0owned by\u00a0Oakland resident Chor N. Ng\u2019s trust and zoned exclusively for commercial use.\u00a0It housed an artists\u00a0collective and, according to former residents and those who frequented the building, had\u00a0unpermitted\u00a0living quarters inside and hosted concerts and other events. The catastrophic fire appears to have triggered a wave of warehouse inspections by Oakland code enforcers. Inspectors were sent to the addresses of five warehouses allegedly used as alternative housing. Most of the properties had records of past\u00a0complaints that included blighted conditions, unpermitted work\u00a0and illegal squatting. By Thursday, public records show, one of those properties had been cited for unspecified violations. The other buildings\u00a0include a 6,600-square-foot warehouse on Oakland\u2019s west end industrial center that local residents call \u201cDeath Trap\u201d \u2014\u00a0a label they said a city inspector used when inside the building in 2011. The records show the Magnolia Street property, built in 1925 and zoned for industrial use, was the subject of repeated complaints and investigations in 2011. It\u00a0had alleged alterations without permits, graffiti, trash and debris\u00a0and \u201csubstandard\u201d housing. The case regarding the blight complaints was closed in September 2011 when the property was cleaned up.\u00a0However, a housing habitability complaint remained open until January 2014 when it was closed as \u201cunable to verify.\u201d Building inspectors had not been inside Oakland warehouse in 30 years, officials say The city's planning and building department only goes into buildings when the owner seeks a permit or if officials receive a complaint. \u00a0 The city's planning and building department only goes into buildings when the owner seeks a permit or if officials receive a complaint. \u00a0 See more videos A new inspection was conducted Thursday after the city Fire Department filed a complaint. Oakland records show another warehouse blocks away also was listed for inspection Monday. On Wednesday the 1,000-square-foot building, a single-story green structure built in 1930, was found in violation of housing codes. A violation notice was mailed to the owner on Thursday.

Reached by phone in Canberra, Australia, Kelly told Fox News, \"I have been asked and would consider it an honor.\" In addition to three-star General Michael Flynn, a former Army Ranger, Trump has now chosen two Marines - both close friends - to lead the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. A third Marine, General Joe Dunford, is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Trump tapped Gen James Mattis to be Defense Secretary pending Senate confirmation and Thursday crossed a hurdle in Congress with the House passing language as part of a budget bill that would allow for a one-time exception to the law that states that a person needs to be off active duty for seven years before serving as Defense Secretary, a role typically reserved for civilians. Dunford ,now the chairman of the joint chiefs, is a longtime friend of Kelly's. In fact, Dunford delivered the news that Kelly's son, then 2nd Lieutenant Robert. M. Kelly, also a Marine, had been killed in Afghanistan six years ago. He appeared at Kelly's front door wearing his full dress uniform. Dunford was assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time. Kelly said when he saw his old friend at the door, he knew immediately his son was dead. Kelly is the highest ranking military officer to have a child killed in combat. Four days after his son was killed, he delivered an emotional speech in St. Louis to the Semper Fi Society, a speech that has become iconic within the military and among military families. He called out the fact that so few families serve and so few are protecting so many. \"We are in a life-and-death struggle, but not our whole country,\" Kelly said in the November 2010 speech. \"One percent of Americans are touched by this war. Then there is a much smaller club of families who have given all.\" Dunford and his wife Ellyn attended a gala dinner that Veterans' Day. Earlier in the day, they accompanied Kelly and his wife to Dover to retrieve their son's remains. There is no underestimating the bond that these two Marines feel for each other. They will now be in a very senior advisory role to President-elect Trump. When asked about losing his son at his final Pentagon press conference, Kelly spoke for all Goldstar families: \"I think the one thing they would ask is that the cause for which their son or daughter fell be -- be carried through to -- to a successful end, whatever that means, as opposed to 'this is getting too costly,' or 'too much of a pain in the ass,' and 'let's just walk away from it.' Because that's when they start thinking it might have been not worth it.\" Kelly served as then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates' senior military adviser when the current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson was General Counsel at the Pentagon. Kelly has been advising Johnson in recent months. He served as the commander of the U.S. Southern Command from 2012 to 2016, when he oversaw the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. southern border and worked with the DEA on drug interdictions. At his final press conference in the Pentagon, Kelly told reporters that one of his frustrations was having the military's hands tied in some ways when it came to interdicting drugs, including note enough helicopters and surveillance. \"I don't need an awful lot,\" Kelly told reporters at the Jan. 8 press conference. \"But drones would be nice, because they can stay up forever and they don't get tired, and they're less expensive to operate. But no, we have not seen anything, any increases -- certainly no drones.\" He expressed concerns at the time that the U.S. had rushed to release certain prisoners who might return to the battlefield. \"Well, I mean, they're all bad boys. We have dossiers on all of them. Some of them were more effective in being bad boys than others. You know, you -- we can -- I think we can all quibble on whether 13 or 12 or 8 years in -- in detention is enough to have them -- having paid for whatever they did, but they're -- they're bad guys,\" Kelly said. He is not afraid to speak his mind. Here's what Kelly said when asked about the military being told to open all combat positions to women last year: \"It will be the pressure for not probably the generals that are here now, but for the generals to come, and admirals, to lower standards because that's the only way it'll work in the way that I hear some people, particularly, the agenda-driven people here in Washington -- or in the land, the way they want it to work,\" Kelly told reporters Jan. 8 at the Pentagon.

Glenn was 95 when he died; he had been hospitalized in an Ohio State University medical center in Columbus since last week.

Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Glenn had been battling health issues since a stroke a few years ago. His death Thursday was confirmed by Hank Wilson, communications director of the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. President Obama said that Glenn's trailblazing showed \"with courage and a spirit of discovery there's no limit to the heights we can reach together.\" The president said, \"John always had the right stuff, inspiring generations of scientists, engineers and astronauts. ... On behalf of a grateful nation, Godspeed, John Glenn.\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, \"Senator Glenn's legacy is one of risk and accomplishment, of history created and duty to country carried out under great pressure with the whole world watching. The entire NASA Family will be forever grateful for his outstanding service, commitment and friendship.\" An early explorer On Feb. 20, 1962, when John Glenn rocketed into space, it was momentous and nerve-wracking. Space travel was in its infancy. Every launch and mission captivated the imagination of America. A few minutes after liftoff, Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule reached orbit. People listened in with excitement and awe. \"Roger, zero G and I feel fine,\" Glenn relayed from space. \"Capsule is turning around. Oh, that view is tremendous!\" Article continues after sponsorship So much about space in those days was unknown. Scientists designed experiments to study whether astronauts could eat or drink in space. Doctors were concerned that human eyes would change shape, making it hard to operate during re-entry. Then there was the technology. Rockets exploded during testing, sometimes with the astronauts watching. In 2012, on the 50th anniversary of his Mercury flight, Glenn reflected on the danger. \"It was important because of the Cold War,\" Glenn said at a Smithsonian forum. \"It was a new step forward, and we were proud to be representing our country there. And so ... you made it as safe as you possibly could, and what little bit of risk was left, we accepted that.\" Any trip to space is risky, and Glenn's mission was no exception. During his five hour, three-orbit flight, there were some tense moments after faulty warnings about his heat shield. At a post-flight news conference, Glenn was characteristically cool. \"So there were some moments of doubt there as to whether the heat shield had been damaged and whether it might be tearing up itself. And this ... this could have been a bad day all the way around if this had been the case.\" After the flight, he became a national hero. He befriended President John F. Kennedy and received a ticker-tape parade in New York City. \"I think John Glenn will be remembered as an actual hero at a time when heroes are often called heroes but are not,\" says Francis French, the author of many books on the space program's early days. French says Glenn was basically an all-American boy with a photogenic smile and a quick wit. \"I think John Glenn is one of those people that's going to stay in the history books,\" he says. \"And even the most cynical of history readers is going to go, 'This guy actually is what everybody says he was.' \" French says Glenn was \"exactly at the right place at the right time for when America needed somebody to not only become the first American to orbit the Earth but to actually project what it meant for America to put a person into space.\" A life in flight and politics Glenn was a highly decorated Marine who flew 59 combat missions in the South Pacific during World War II. During the Korean War, he flew 90 combat missions, using different models of new jet fighters. He remained in the military through the 1950s, testing supersonic aircraft and other military models. In all, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross five times. In 1958 he was one of 508 pilots tested for what became the Mercury program, an accelerated response to the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first satellite in 1957. Portrait Of U.S. Sen.

Glenn Jr. in 1998, when he served as Payload Specialist For Space Shuttle Sts-95. NASA/Getty Images He left NASA in 1964. Later he would learn that at the time, NASA and Kennedy had deemed him too valuable to fly in space again. In 1974, he was elected to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate. Two years later, Glenn's name was among those mentioned as a running mate for Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter, but Carter ended up picking Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Glenn campaigned in the Democratic primary for the 1984 presidential election, but ended up losing to Mondale. But he remained in the Senate, serving four six-year terms. During his Senate career he was noted for his attention to NASA and to national defense. He was also remembered for his support for the Panama Canal treaty in the late 1970s and for his resistance to the decision to televise the Senate floor debates on C-SPAN. He warned that the Senate's reputation for deliberation would suffer if it became, in effect, a TV show. He retired from politics in 1999. A pioneer once again But as his political career was ending, he wanted to go back into space. In 1998, he lobbied NASA to fly again. Glenn spent nine days aboard the shuttle Discovery \u2014 for science. \"For four days, I had 21 different leads \u2014 brainwaves and respiration and EKG \u2014 21 different body parameters being recorded and sent down to the ground,\" Glenn said in 2011. As a 77-year-old, he became the oldest person to fly in space. His flight revived public interest in NASA. When NASA canceled the shuttle program and scaled back its ambitious exploration efforts, Glenn lamented the loss. He spoke during a 2011 forum at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. \"The average person [was] better educated ... back years ago than most people in the world. And then we put more into basic research and learned the new things first,\" he said. \"That little combination is just as true today. If we lose that edge in research and education, we won't be a leading nation in the world. It's that simple.\" Ron Elving contributed to this story. ",

    "text": "By Jonnelle Marte December 8 at 5:16 PM Follow @jonnelle CKE Restaurants CEO Andrew Puzder, center, departs Trump Tower in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, as head of the Labor Department,\u00a0according to a Republican briefed on the decision.\u00a0 Puzder, who runs CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr., has been a harsh critic of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, arguing that it would increase costs for consumers and lead to fewer jobs. He also opposes the recently-delayed Labor Department rule that aimed to make millions more workers eligible for overtime pay. As the head of a fast-food company, Puzder is a supporter of the approach touted by Trump on the campaign trail that lowering taxes for corporations and the wealthy and loosening regulations for businesses can boost job creation. He is a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act , which he claims has hurt the restaurant industry because higher health premiums have left consumers with less money to spend. By bringing in Puzder, Trump is signaling that he may scale back some of regulations introduced by current Labor Secretary Tom Perez. If confirmed, he will have the potential to reverse some of the Obama administration\u2019s most notable efforts to bolster protections for workers, families and retirement savers. [ Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet ] His appointment could put\u00a0the future of the Labor Department\u2019s overtime rule into question. In a Forbes op-ed that ran after the Labor Department finalized the overtime rule in May, Puzder wrote that the rule would \u201cadd to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers,\u201d and that the rule would lead to fewer hours and reduced opportunities for workers. As Labor Secretary, Puzder could potentially decide not to defend the rule in court. He could also propose revisions to the rule, but any adjustments would likely require notice and\u00a0public comment. With the upcoming nomination of the fast-food executive, Trump would bring another top fundraiser into his cabinet. Puzder supported Trump\u2019s race to the White House financially and served as an economic adviser to his campaign. He and his wife, Deanna, contributed a total of $332,000 to helping Trump get elected, including money given to Trump\u2019s campaign, to joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. His anti-regulation stance is also viewed as a threat to another major rule finalized by the Labor Department earlier this year that would affect the investing advice given to retirement savers. The rule would require brokers and insurers to put their clients\u2019 interest ahead of their own. Financial firms opposed to the rule say it is \u201cburdensome\u201d and could limit their ability to work with small-time investors. While Puzder has not addressed the regulation specifically, his nomination increases the likelihood that implementation of that rule could be delayed,\u00a0according to an analyst report from the investment bank FBR & Co. The move could give lawmakers and the Trump administration more time to repeal or revise the rule. Puzder has said that government policies that increase labor costs, such as significantly raising the minimum wage , hurt small businesses and \u201c encourage automation .\u201d In March, he told Business Insider that he and other fast-food companies are investing in automation and considering machines that could tackle simple tasks such as taking customers\u2019 orders. \u201cIf you\u2019re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive \u2014 this is not rocket science,\u201d he said at the time, though he later added that he would never remove all front-line employees. Some business groups applauded Puzder\u2019s likely nomination Thursday saying that the fast-food executive understands the challenges faced by retailers and restaurants. \u201cAndrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,\u201d said David French, senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which also opposes the overtime rule. But some Democrats and consumer advocates are critical of Trump\u2019s expected pick, saying his approach may harm low-wage workers. \u201cThe Labor Secretary should be someone who wakes up every day thinking about how they can raise American wages and fight for American workers,\u201d Sen. Charles Schumer said in a statement. \u201cMr. Puzder\u2019s career has shown exactly the opposite.\u201d Puzder became the CEO of\u00a0CKE Restaurants in 2000. The company, which has more than 3,700 restaurant locations in 44 states and 39 countries, is in the process of relocating its headquarters from southern California to Nashville.\u00a0Prior to joining the fast-food business, he worked as a commercial trial lawyer in St. Louis, Mo.

Sanders told jurors about the horror of seeing her son and her aunt shot to death and sheltering with her granddaughter beneath a table. At one point, she looked across the courtroom toward Roof and called him \"evil, evil, evil.\" Bruck asked her on cross-examination whether she remembered Roof saying anything in the aftermath of the shootings. \"He said he was going to kill himself,\" she said. \"I was counting on that. There's no place on Earth for him other than the pit of hell.\" Related: Death Penalty Trial of Accused Shooter to Begin U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel denied the mistrial request and said he interpreted Sanders' testimony as \"a religious comment.\" He instructed jurors that any decision on guilt or a sentence is up to the jury \u2014 not the attorneys or witnesses in the case. Also Thursday, jurors watched surveillance footage of Roof leaving a Charleston church with a gun in his hand. Charleston police Sgt. Dan English showed the jury more than 20 video clips taken from cameras at the church on June 17, 2015. The clips showed many of the victims and Roof entering the church. Roof is seen leaving the church 52 minutes later, and a final clip taken about 25 minutes after that showed one of the victims carried out on a stretcher. Play ",
