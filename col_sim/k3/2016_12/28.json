Though Carrie Fisher is best known as Princess Leia from Star Wars, she has performed in many other acting roles and has had a successful career as a book author and screenplay doctor. Though Carrie Fisher is best known as Princess Leia from Star Wars, she has performed in many other acting roles and has had a successful career as a book author and screenplay doctor. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Carrie Fisher, a daughter of Hollywood royalty who gained pop-culture fame as Princess Leia in the original \"Star Wars\" and turned her struggles with addiction and mental illness into wickedly funny books, a hit film and a one-woman stage show, died Tuesday after falling ill aboard a flight last week. She was 60. \"Carrie was one of a kind ... brilliant, original. Funny and emotionally fearless. She lived her life, bravely,\" ''Star Wars\" co-star Harrison Ford said in a statement. Fisher, the daughter of actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, had been hospitalized since Friday, when paramedics responded to a report of a patient in distress at Los Angeles airport. Her family gave no details on the emergency, but media reports said she had suffered a heart attack. \"Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,\" Reynolds wrote on her Facebook page Tuesday. \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.\" Fisher made her feature film debut opposite Warren Beatty in the 1975 hit \"Shampoo.\" She also appeared in \"Austin Powers,\" ''The Blues Brothers,\" ''Charlie's Angels,\" ''Hannah and Her Sisters,\" ''Scream 3\" and \"When Harry Met Sally ...\" But Fisher is best remembered as the headstrong Princess Leia in the original \"Star Wars\" in 1977, her hair styled in futuristic braided buns. She uttered the immortal phrase \"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\" Actress and writer Carrie Fisher, who is perhaps best known for portraying Princess Leia Organa in the \"Star Wars\" films, died Dec. 27 . Most recently, Fisher published her eighth book, a memoir titled \"The Princess Diarist.\" She reprised the role in Episode VII of the series, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" in 2015, and her digitally rendered image appears in the newest installment, \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\" \"She was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved,\" ''Star Wars\" creator George Lucas said in a statement. \"In 'Star Wars' she was our great and powerful princess - feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think.\" Fisher long battled drug addiction and mental illness. She said she smoked pot at 13, used LSD by 21 and was diagnosed as bipolar at 24. She was treated with electroshock therapy and medication. In 1987, her thinly veiled autobiography \"Postcards From the Edge\" became a best-seller. It was adapted into a 1990 movie starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep. More books followed: \"Delusions of Grandma,\" ''Surrender the Pink,\" ''The Best Awful,\" ''Shockaholic\" and this year's autobiography, \"The Princess Diarist,\" in which she revealed that she and Ford had an affair on the \"Star Wars\" set. Fisher's one-woman show, \"Wishful Drinking,\" which she had performed across the country since 2006, was turned into a book, made its way to Broadway in 2009 and was filmed for HBO in 2010. Little was off-limits in the show. She discussed the scandal that engulfed her superstar parents (Fisher ran off with Elizabeth Taylor); her brief marriage to singer Paul Simon; the time the father of her daughter left her for a man; and the day she woke up next to the dead body of a platonic friend who had overdosed in her bed. \"I'm a product of Hollywood inbreeding. When two celebrities mate, something like me is the result,\" she said in the show. At another point, she cracked: \"I don't have a problem with drugs so much as I have a problem with sobriety.\" Ever ready to satirize herself, she played Carrie Fisher a few times, as in David Cronenberg's dark Hollywood sendup \"Maps to the Stars\" and in an episode of \"Sex and the City.\" In the past 15 years, Fisher appeared as a television guest star, perhaps most memorably as a has-been comedy legend on \"30 Rock.\" She also supplied the voice of a recurring character on the animated \"Family Guy\" for the past decade. \"Carrie Fisher was smart, funny, talented, surprising and always a hell of a fun time to be around. Family Guy will miss her immensely,\" show creator Seth MacFarlane tweeted. Fisher starred with her mother in a documentary set to air on HBO in 2017. \"Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher\" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. She endeared herself to the social-media generation with her quirky tweets, laden with crazy keyboard symbols and colorful typefaces. Her ever-present bulldog, Gary Fisher, had his own Twitter and Instagram account. (\"Saddest tweets to tweet. Mommy is gone. I love you @carrieffisher,\" the dog's Twitter feed read.) Besides her mother, Fisher is survived by her brother, Todd Fisher, and her daughter, Billie Lourd. In a 2009 interview with The Associated Press, Fisher wasn't coy about revealing details about her life. She hoped to remove the stigma from mental illness. \"People relate to aspects of my stories and that's nice for me because then I'm not all alone with it,\" she said. \"Also, I do believe you're only as sick as your secrets. If that's true, I'm just really healthy.\" Associated Press ",

Noonan, USA TODAY 11:15 p.m. EST December 27, 2016 Men and women are not equal...when it comes to heart attacks, at least. Wochit-All Heart disease is a top killer of women, but it can be prevented. (Photo: Miranda Pelligrino) Actress Carrie Fisher became a victim Tuesday of a threat to women that's bigger than cancer: Heart disease. Cancer does kill a lot of women. Four of every 10 women who die between ages 45 and 64 die of cancer. But more than 1 in 3 women \u2014 43 million \u2014 are living with cardiovascular disease, many without knowing it. \"Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women and is more deadly than all forms of cancer combined,\" said Dr. Jennifer Mieres, professor of cardiology and population health at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in Hempstead, N.Y. About once every minute a woman dies from a stroke,\u00a0heart attack or a lesser-known problem called a sudden cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association . Sudden cardiac arrest\u00a0differs from a heart attack. It's not caused by a blockage that stops blood flow to the heart; instead the heart's electrical system stops working properly and can't pump blood the way it should. 'Star Wars' icon Carrie Fisher dies at 60 Almost two-thirds of women who die suddenly from heart disease had no previous symptoms, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . And heart attacks seem to increase among women about 10 years after menopause \u2014 for reasons not entirely known. \u201cWomen tend to have more atypical symptoms,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Jay Stone, a cardiologist at Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. \u201cA burning pain, shortness of breath or weakness, fluctuating in the chest or palpitations \u2014 it\u2019s not the classic textbook that men tend to have.\u201d Posted!

That means not smoking, exercising regularly, eating healthy foods, drinking little alcohol and\u00a0maintaining proper\u00a0weight. \u201cWith most women, our focus is on our family, not ourselves,\u201d said Loretta Impastato, 59, of Freehold Township, N.J. \u201cWith the last of my children getting married, I decided, \u2018I\u2019m overweight, my cholesterol is creeping up and I\u2019m not feeling well. I have to do something.\u2019 \u201d Alarm raised on women's heart disease A stress test, echocardiogram and lab work determined that she was pre-diabetic and at a high risk for cardiovascular disease. \u201cIt was the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Impastato said. She could start doing something about the problem. One way for women to stay on top of heart health is to know the target numbers: \u2022 Blood pressure. High blood pressure can damage your heart as well as make you susceptible to stroke. Keep the systolic, top number, below 120 millimeters of mercury and the diastolic, the bottom number, at less than 80 mm Hg. \u2022\u00a0Blood sugar. Diabetes \u2014 which\u00a0results when the body doesn't make enough insulin or cells in muscles, liver and fat do not use insulin properly \u2014 can damage blood vessels over time, leading to heart disease.\u00a0A glycated hemoglobin test indicates average blood sugar levels for the past two to three months. Less than 5.7% on the A1C test is normal. Another test measures\u00a0blood sugar levels after an overnight fast. Less than 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood is considered normal. \u2022 Cholesterol. One type, low-density lipoprotein, is considered bad because it transports cholesterol particles throughout the body to build up on the walls of arteries. LDL levels should be 129 milligrams per deciliter of blood or lower.\u00a0High-density lipoprotein is the good cholesterol, transporting excess cholesterol particles back to the liver; HDL levels should be 60 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Triglycerides.\u00a0This type of fat circulates in your blood along with cholesterol, storing unused calories to provide your body with energy, but too much may contribute to hardening of the arteries. Normal is less than\u00a0150 mg/dL. \"A study found that high triglycerides were a dangerous risk factor for stroke in women (but) not necessarily in men,\" said\u00a0Charlotte Libov, author of books\u00a0including\u00a0A Woman's Guide to Heart Attack Recovery. New research into gender differences in heart disease has had a positive effect on prevention and treatment strategies for women, Hofstra Northwell's Mieres said. Carrie Fisher's frequent companion: French bulldog Gary \"We have seen a decline in deaths from heart disease,\" she said. In the decade\u00a0since the heart association's Go Red For Women campaign began raising women's awareness, a third fewer women have died from heart disease. Smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle, high blood pressure and obesity are risk factors for both sexes. But diabetes, lack of exercise and obesity are more potent risks in women, Mieres said. \u201cWith the last of my children getting married, I decided, \u2018I\u2019m overweight, my cholesterol is creeping up and I\u2019m not feeling well. I have to do something.'\u201d Loretta Impastato, Freehold Township, N.J. Now researchers know that some risk factors \u2014\u00a0such as menopause before age 50, inflammatory diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy complications and pre-term births \u2014 are unique risks\u00a0to women, she said. Pregnancy can be a stress test\u00a0on the body's vascular system that gives doctors \"a window into what may happen in the future,\" said Dr. Claire Boccia Liang, director of women's heart programs at Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute in Morristown, N.J. During pregnancy, high blood sugar, called gestational diabetes;\u00a0high blood pressure; or preeclampsia, characterized by high protein in urine and high blood pressure,\u00a0raise red flags for heart disease. Women who live with chronic stress and those who sleep fewer\u00a0than six hours a night have higher heart disease risk. Depression doubles the risk of heart attack, death or need for an artery-opening procedure in women age 55 and younger. Family history also accounts for about 20% of heart disease risk, Boccia Liang said. If a family member had a heart attack, stroke, bypass, stent or other major heart problem or procedure, the risk may be higher. The risk may increase at a younger age if the event happened to a parent or sibling\u00a0before age 55 in men or 65 in women. Both sexes can experience the classic heart-attack symptom of chest pain, but women instead can\u00a0feel discomfort or pain in the neck, jaw, shoulder or right arm. They may feel unusually tired, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded or nauseated and may vomit or sweat heavily. Women's symptoms may mimic other conditions. For example, unusual fatigue could be the flu. Profuse sweating could be a hot flash. A sore jaw could be temporomandibular joint disorder, better known as TMJ. If symptoms become worse when your heart works harder \u2014 you're running or walking fast, dancing or exerting in other ways \u2014 that's a tipoff to suspect heart disease, Boccia Liang said. \"Jaw pain that only relents with rest but gets worse with exercise is definitely a red flag,\" she said. Barbra Streisand calls for action on women's heart health Heart disease may seem unpredictable, but knowing the symptoms can help a woman\u00a0stay alert, Libov said. Studies show that people whose heart attacks \"seem to come out of the blue\" were actually having symptoms up to a month before the attack. And be aware that symptoms can sneak up. When a woman who always played two sets of tennis finds herself suddenly struggling to finish a game, \"that's not normal,\" she said. Don't blame aging or assume that a gradual decline happened because of lack of exercise, overwork, menopause, the blues or the blahs. It might be your heart's way of calling for help. \"We can't regenerate the muscle that's been damaged,\" after a heart attack occurs, Boccia Liang said. Seven biggest health problems Americans face Six months after Impastato's screening and subsequent exercise and diet regimen, she returned for a checkup and the results were impressive. Her total cholesterol level, once near 300 mg/dL, fell 65 points; 200 mg/dL or less is considered best. She lost 30 pounds and is no longer considered pre-diabetic. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re not feeling well until you start to feel well again, and now I feel fabulous,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone woman needs to have some kind of (cardiovascular) screening. With education, women are starting to understand more about this.\u201d 8473 CONNECT TWEET 38 LINKEDIN 35 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iBOEjr NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "At Pearl Harbor, Obama says 'we must resist the urge to demonize those who are different' Shinzo Abe, Barack Obama Marco Garcia / Associated Press President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Tuesday. President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Tuesday. (Marco Garcia / Associated Press) Christi Parsons Contact Reporter President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe scattered\u00a0petals together\u00a0on the waters of Pearl Harbor on Tuesday in a symbolic act aimed at laying to rest the enmity of the Japanese attack 75 years ago that drew the U.S. into World War II. In a moment consumed with history, both leaders were fixed on the future. They expressed\u00a0concern\u00a0that the lessons of the war might be forgotten amid a shifting world order and the anti-internationalist sentiment that has swept over politics around the globe, most notably with the ascendance of President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cEven when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\u201d The ceremony was conceived of as an affirmation of close U.S. relations with Japan, once a bitter wartime enemy, and\u00a0Obama and Abe underscored the importance of building bonds between nations and the risks of slipping into isolationism. Their remarks also appeared to be\u00a0warnings for\u00a0Trump, whose divisive campaign took aim at longstanding alliances and stoked fears with harsh rhetoric about immigrants and minorities. \u201cOurs is an alliance of hope that will lead us to the future,\u201d Abe said, speaking to World War II veterans after paying tribute at the Pearl Harbor memorial. \u201cWhat has bonded us together is the power of reconciliation, made possible through the spirit of tolerance.\u201d Obama, as has been his custom in public remarks since the election, argued for the merits of his own worldview\u00a0without naming Trump, saying,\u00a0\u201cThere is more to be won in peace than in war.\u201d During the campaign and since his election, Trump has\u00a0challenged assumptions about U.S. commitments to the security of Asia. One of the central tenets of Obama\u2019s foreign policy was a commitment of resources toward Asia with an eye toward countering the rise of China. But Trump has obliterated long-established protocols. He spoke with Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen\u00a0despite the U.S. policy of officially acknowledging no Chinese government other than the one in Beijing. And when he met with Abe last month in New York, Trump brought not a battalion of Asia experts but rather his daughter Ivanka. Trump also promised last week to expand America\u2019s nuclear arsenal after decades of a deliberate shrinking of the American and Russian stockpiles. \u201cLet it be an arms\u00a0race,\u201d he told an MSNBC host, unnerving leaders in Asia, where North Korea and China are growing more aggressive. Though the U.S.-Japan relationship has evolved considerably in recent decades, the healing over World War II has gone more slowly, making Abe\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor, and Obama\u2019s trip\u00a0in May to Hiroshima, Japan, the site of one of the two nuclear attacks that ended the war, significant gestures. Abe became the first Japanese prime minister to make a highly publicized visit to the USS Arizona Memorial, though three of his predecessors are thought to have visited Pearl Harbor more quietly. Under a bright, sunny sky, Abe and Obama rode a small boat to the white memorial building in the harbor that looks out over the sunken remains of the Arizona, attacked by the Japanese on Dec. 7, 1941, killing\u00a02,403 people and thrusting\u00a0the U.S. into World War II.\u00a0Abe laid a wreath in honor of the dead. Veterans of the war gathered across the harbor to hear Obama and Abe deliver their brief speeches. Among those in the crowd was Sterling Cale, 95, a sailor at Pearl Harbor on the day of the attack. Of those killed that day, 1,177 were crew members of the Arizona. It was Cale\u2019s job to pull bodies from the burning battleship. He\u00a0recalled watching ashes rising from the deck of the ship. He and his crew were able to remove about 100 bodies. On Tuesday, he looked across the water where the Arizona is submerged. He did not come hoping to hear Abe apologize, he said.\u00a0 \u201c\u2018Sorry\u2019 is just a word,\u201d Cale said. \u201cWhat matters more is the action of coming here and going out there with our commander in chief. That says more than words.\u201d ",

Fahrenthold and John Wagner December 27 at 10:56 AM Follow @Fahrenthold Follow @WPJohnWagner President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to defend the charitable foundation he has pledged to close, saying the media had not given him enough credit for his generosity and ignoring the legal issues that have ensnared the organization in controversy. The Donald J. Trump Foundation has come under intense scrutiny this year after reports in The Washington Post detailing its practices, including cases in which Trump apparently used the charity\u2019s money to settle lawsuits involving his for-profit businesses. [ Donald Trump plans to shut down his charitable foundation, which has been under scrutiny for months ] New York\u2019s attorney general is investigating the charity, and a spokeswoman for that office said Saturday that the foundation could not officially shut down until that probe is over. Among the issues at hand is whether Trump violated a \u201cself-dealing\u201d provision that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charities\u2019 funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. \u201cI gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won\u2019t report!\u201d Trump said in one Monday night tweet. (Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \u201cThe DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!\u201d the president-elect said in another. Trump and his companies gave about $6 million to his foundation since its launch in 1987, according to tax filings. The most recent tax filings go up to the end of 2015. Other people have collectively given about $9.5 million. The biggest outside donors were Vince and Linda McMahon, two pro-wrestling moguls, who gave the Trump Foundation $5 million between 2007 and 2009. Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. Trump himself gave nothing to his foundation between 2009 and 2014, according to filings. His businesses contributed in 2015 for the first time in several years. [ Trump Hotels has had its eye on China \u2014 but the door hasn\u2019t opened ] Experts on charities say it\u2019s rare for the founder of a private, name-branded foundation to give nothing to his own foundation while relying entirely on donations from others. That anomaly allowed Trump to take advantage of the idea that the money in the foundation was his. Trump\u2019s donations to his foundation are also small, by the standards of billionaires\u2019 philanthropy. 1 of 31 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team. Caption The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team. \u00a0Sean Spicer, press secretary Republican National Committee Chief Strategist and Communications Director Sean Spicer has been named Trump\u2019s press secretary. Cliff Owen/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Filmmaker George Lucas, for instance, who is tied with Trump at 324th place on Forbes\u2019s list of the world\u2019s billionaires, donated $925 million to his family foundation in 2012. In 2014, Lucas\u2019s foundation gave $55 million in donations to museums, hospitals, artistic groups and environmental charities. While much of the Trump foundation\u2019s money has gone to charity, there are some high-profile exceptions. In 2013, the Trump foundation gave a $25,000 gift to a campaign committee backing Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R), even though nonprofits like the charity are not allowed to give political gifts. [ Trump pays IRS a penalty for foundation\u2019s improper gift to aid Fla. attorney general ] That gift was made as Bondi\u2019s office was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. A consultant who worked on Bondi\u2019s reelection effort has said that Bondi was not aware of the allegations when she solicited the donation from Trump. Ultimately, Bondi\u2019s office did not pursue the fraud allegations. Trump also reported using foundation money to buy items for himself, which runs afoul of federal tax law. The Trump Foundation spent $30,000 to buy two large portraits of Trump, including one that was hung up in the sports bar at a Trump-owned resort. Trump also appears to have used $258,000 of his foundation\u2019s money \u2014 legally earmarked for charitable purposes \u2014 to settle lawsuits involving two of his for-profit clubs. [ How a Univision anchor found the missing portrait Trump bought with his charity\u2019s money ] The office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) announced its investigation of the Trump Foundation after reports in The Post described such apparent cases of self-dealing that date back to 2007. Trump\u2019s foundation has admitted in IRS tax filings for 2015 that it violated a prohibition against self-dealing that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charities\u2019 funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. In these tax filings, the charity checked \u201cyes\u201d in response to a question asking whether it had transferred any income or assets to \u201ca disqualified person\u201d \u2014 a description that could have meant Trump, a relative or a Trump-owned business. Trump has not said what exactly he did to violate the rule or what he has paid the IRS in penalty taxes as a result. The IRS has not commented when asked whether it was investigating the Trump Foundation. The New York attorney general\u2019s investigation is unlikely to lead to any kind of criminal charge. Instead, Trump may be required to repay his foundation the money it spent to help him, and he may have to personally pay penalty taxes worth 10 percent or more of the value of the self-dealing transactions. Trump\u2019s tweet was correct in that his foundation has low overhead. It has no paid staff and only a five-member board. It also has spent almost nothing on legal fees, raising the question of whether the organization was aware of the legal problems it created. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

President Barack Obama speaking during a troop rally after arriving at Bagram Air Field for an unannounced visit, north of Kabul, Afghanistan, on\u00a0May 25, 2014. (Evan Vucci / AP) Ellen NakashimaThe Washington Post The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U.S. officials. The administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week. The sanctions part of the package culminates weeks of debate in the White House about how to revise an executive order from last year meant to give the president authority to respond to cyberattacks from overseas, but which did not originally cover efforts to influence the electoral system. The Obama administration last year rolled the order out to great fanfare as a way to punish and deter foreign hackers who harm the United States' economic or national security. The threat to use it last year helped wring a pledge out of China's president that his country would cease hacking U.S. companies' secrets to benefit Chinese firms. But officials this fall concluded that it could not, as written, be used to punish the most significant cyber-provocation in recent memory against the United States - Russia's hacking of Democratic organizations, targeting of state election systems and meddling in the presidential election. With the clock ticking, the White House is working on adapting the authority to punish the Russians, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. President Barack Obama last week pledged there would be a response to Moscow's interference in the U.S. elections. One clear way to use the order against the Russian suspects would be to declare the electoral systems part of the \"critical infrastructure\" of the United States. Or it could be amended to clearly apply to the new threat - interfering in elections. Administration officials would also like to make it difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to roll back any action they take. \"Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,\" said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. (Ellen Nakashima) Obama issued the executive order in April 2015, creating the sanctions tool as a way to hold accountable people who harm computer systems related to critical functions such as electricity generation or transportation or who gain a competitive advantage through cybertheft of commercial secrets. The order allows the government to freeze the assets in the United States of people overseas who have engaged in cyber acts that have threatened U.S. national security or financial stability. The sanctions would also block commercial transactions with the designated individuals and bar their entry into the country. But just a year later, a Russian military spy agency would hack into the Democratic National Committee and steal a trove of emails that were released a few months later on WikiLeaks, U.S. officials said. Other releases followed, including the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta . \"Fundamentally, it was a low-tech, high-impact event,\" said Zachary Goldman, a sanctions and national security expert at New York University School of Law. And the 2015 executive order was not crafted to target hackers who steal emails and dump them on WikiLeaks or seek to disrupt an election. \"It was an authority published at a particular time to address a particular set of problems,\" he said. So officials \"need to engage in some legal acrobatics to fit the DNC hack into an existing authority, or they need to write a new authority,\" Goldman said. Administration officials would like Obama to use the power before leaving office to demonstrate its utility. Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Barack Obama issued a public warning to... FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Barack Obama issued a public warning to... (Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima) \"When the president came into office, he didn't have that many tools out there to use as a response\" to malicious cyber-acts, said Ari Schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council. \"Having the sanctions tool is really a big one. It can make a very strong statement in a way that is less drastic than bombing a country and more impactful than sending out a cable from the State Department.\" The National Security Council concluded that it would not be able to use the authority against Russian hackers because their malicious activity did not clearly fit under its terms, which require harm to critical infrastructure or the theft of commercial secrets. \"You would (a) have to be able to say that the actual electoral infrastructure, such as state databases, was critical infrastructure, and (b) that what the Russians did actually harmed it,\" said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"Those are two high bars.\" Though Russian government hackers are believed to have penetrated at least one state voter-registration database, they did not tamper with the data, officials said. Some analysts believe that state election systems would fit under \"government facilities,\" which is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security. Another option is to use the executive order against other Russian targets - say, hackers who stole commercial secrets - and then, in either a public message or a private one, make clear that the United States considers its electoral systems to be critical infrastructure. White House suggests Putin directly involved with Russian cyberattack White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved with \"malicious cyberactivity to erode public confidence in our democracy.\" Dec. 15, 2016.\u00a0 White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved with \"malicious cyberactivity to erode public confidence in our democracy.\" Dec. 15, 2016.\u00a0 See more videos The idea is to not only punish but also deter. \"As much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,\" a second official said. \"I am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, 'That worked pretty well in 2016, so let's keep going.' We have elections every two years in this country.\" Even the threat of sanctions can have deterrent value. Officials and experts point to the agreement Chinese President Xi Jinping reached with Obama last year that his country would stop commercial cyberspying. Xi came to the table following news reports last summer that the administration was preparing to sanction Chinese companies. Complicating matters, the Trump transition team has not yet had extensive briefings with the White House on cyber issues, including the potential use of the cyber-sanctions order. The slow pace has caused consternation among officials, who fear that the administration's accomplishments in cybersecurity could languish if the next administration fails to understand their value. Sanctions are not a silver bullet. Obama noted that \"we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians\" for their activities in Ukraine. So it is questionable, some experts say, whether adding new ones would have a meaningful effect in changing the Kremlin's behavior. But in combination with other measures, they could be effective. Criminal indictments of Russians might become an option, officials said, but the FBI has so far not gathered enough evidence that could be introduced in a criminal case. At one point, federal prosecutors and FBI agents in San Francisco considered indicting Guccifer 2.0, a nickname for a person or people believed to be affiliated with the Russian influence operation and whose true identity was unknown. Before the election, the administration used diplomatic channels to warn Russia. Obama spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Group of 20 summit in China in September. About a week before the election, the United States sent a \"hotline\"-style message to Moscow using a special channel for crisis communication created in 2013 as part of the State Department's Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. As part of that message, the officials said, the administration asked Russia to stop targeting state voter registration and election systems. It was the first use of that system. The Russians, officials said, appeared to comply. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The prospect of California\u2019s elevated role on climate change is the latest sign of how this state, where Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes, is preparing to resist the policies of the incoming White House. State and city officials have already vowed to fight any attempt by Washington to crack down on undocumented immigrants; Los Angeles officials last week set aside $10 million to help fund the legal costs of residents facing deportation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California\u2019s climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state\u2019s vast research community \u2014 including two national laboratories \u2014 which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards. \u201cThey could basically stop enforcement of the Clean Air Act and CO2 emissions,\u201d said Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco. \u201cThat would affect California because it would constrain markets. It would make them fight political and legal battles rather than scientific and technological ones.\u201d And some business leaders warned that California\u2019s embrace of environmental regulations \u2014 from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors \u2014 could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations. \u201cIf the other states pursue no-climate-change policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,\u201d said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. Photo Mr. Brown, center, signed landmark legislation in 2015 to combat climate change, including a goal of increasing the state\u2019s renewable energy use to 50 percent by 2030. Credit Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders. The bills \u201cimpose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone\u2019s daily lives or the fact that California\u2019s population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,\u201d the California Chamber of Commerce said. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment Democrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2.5 trillion. \u201cCalifornia more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,\u201d said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. \u201cWe will not deviate from our leadership because of one election.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The state has been at the forefront of climate and energy policy for more than half a century, beginning with setting appliance and vehicle emissions standards in the 1960s. Those policies will continue, analysts said, in no small part because they are overwhelmingly popular here: 69 percent of Californians said they supported the law requiring the state to roll back emissions in a July survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cThis is not something that\u2019s going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,\u201d said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThis will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science.\u201d Ms. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the fossil-fuel industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state\u2019s energy and climate initiatives. \u201cBut they would be fighting a very uphill battle,\u201d she said. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to really slow this train down.\u201d California\u2019s economy is powered by a high-tech industry and prominent research institutions that make it well placed to continue to lead on energy and climate. The state has already taken on an international role. Mr. Brown has spearheaded the Under 2 MOU initiative , backed by a coalition of state, local and regional governments in 33 countries \u2014 more than 160 jurisdictions with a total population of more than 1 billion \u2014 that have agreed to deep emissions cuts to try to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. California\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on cap-and-trade policies. Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight. More Reporting on Climate Change The clean-air initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very energy-efficiency policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California\u2019s economic reversal. \u201cIf the president-elect and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,\u201d Mr. de Leon said. \u201cThey will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G.D.P.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama. \u201cOur system works better \u2014 our cap-and-trade system and other ways of addressing climate change \u2014 if we have more company,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. \u201cThe more company we have, the better.\u201d Dan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can \u201ckeep doing what we are doing, leading the way.\u201d \u201cBut will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,\u201d he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an anti-Trump environmental movement. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the lawyers and we\u2019ve got the scientists and are ready to fight,\u201d Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to win.\u201d Mr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting. \u201cIn a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world.\u201d ",

    "text": "By Shanika Gunaratna CBS News December 27, 2016, 5:40 PM How climate change transformed the Earth in 2016 Polar bears, increasingly land-bound due to vanishing ice sheets in the Arctic, are a poignant example of climate refugees.\u00a0 Dustin Stephens/CBS News Email 2016 was a milestone year in the continued warming of the planet. From unstable agriculture to the drought in California to melting ice sheets to extreme weather events and heat waves, climate change has disrupted virtually every corner of the world. It\u2019s impossible to exhaustively list all the ways in which climate change was felt in 2016, but here\u2019s a guide to understanding the year that was for the planet: A carbon dioxide milestone \u201cIn the centuries to come, history books will likely look back on September 2016 as a major milestone for the world\u2019s climate,\u201d Brian Kahn of Climate Central wrote earlier this year. That\u2019s because, during September, a month in which atmospheric carbon dioxide \u2014 a heat-trapping greenhouse gas \u2014is usually at its lowest, the monthly value failed to drop below 400 parts per million. The 400 ppm mark has sad significance in the climate community, as it has long been considered a point of no return for the atmosphere by scientists.\u00a0 On pace to be the hottest year yet This year is poised to be the hottest year in the 137-year official record, with global temperatures climbing even higher than record-breaking 2015 , according to data released in November from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Temperatures were particularly high in the first half of the year due to the power of El Ni\u00f1o. People collect water at a slum area in Mumbai, India, April 30, 2016, during a week-long heat wave that decimated crops, killed livestock and left at least 330 million Indians without enough water for their daily needs.\u00a0 Rajanish Kakade, AP Though final data from December is not yet in, January to November 2016 was the warmest such period worldwide on record, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0 If 2016 ends up with the title of hottest year on record, as expected, that would mean that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred in this century. The only outlier was 1998, according to the WMO. Still need perspective? Research released this year shows that, if we take a much longer view of Earth\u2019s temperature history and consider temperature averages in 5,000 year increments, the Earth is now\u00a0 warmer than it has been in 120,000 years . Transforming the Arctic Global warming has had a particularly dramatic impact on the Arctic, which has been transformed by significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice , and more open water in recent years. NASA animation of Arctic sea ice cover, 1979-2015. NASA Scientific Visualization Studio Last month, the average Arctic sea ice extent \u2014 the measurement scientists use to represent the area of ocean where there is at least some sea ice \u2014 was 17.7 percent below the averages from 1981 to 2010, according to NOAA. That\u2019s the lowest November extent since the NOAA began keeping\u00a0 records \u00a0in 1979. \u201cFor the people in the Arctic, no one has to tell them an abrupt\u00a0 climate change \u00a0has hit,\u201d Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News in an interview last week. Continued\u00a0 melting of polar ice \u00a0could lead to\u00a0 catastrophic sea level rise \u00a0and flooding on coastlines around the world. Some 13 million Americans could become \u201cclimate refugees\u201d by the end of this century if the worst projections come to pass, one study this year warned. Scientists say human activities are directly linked to Arctic warming: driving a\u00a0 gas-powered \u00a0car about 90 miles \u2013 the distance between New York and Philadelphia \u2013 produces enough carbon pollution to melt about a square foot of\u00a0 Arctic sea ice \u00a0during the critical month of September, research shows. Around the world, instability in agriculture The continued warming of the planet in 2016 is having a destabilizing impact on agriculture worldwide.\u00a0 ",

Honolulu\u2019s Caf\u00e9 8 \u00bd gets rave reviews on Yelp for its \u201cRadiatore Verde\u201d and \u201cItalian stir fry,\u201d among other popular dishes at the eclectic mom-and-pop restaurant \u2013 but the response to its new 'policy' barring pro-Trump patrons has been decidedly more mixed. A bright yellow, handmade sign posted on the restaurant's front glass door declares: \u201cIf you voted for Trump you cannot eat here! No Nazis.\u201d A photo of the sign was shared with FoxNews.com. One also is proudly posted on the caf\u00e9\u2019s Facebook page, and was \u201cliked\u201d by some 40 people.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026The next time you're in Honolulu, eat lunch here, not only are they on the right side of things, the food is delicious and reasonable,\u201d one Facebook user wrote next to the photo. Others aren\u2019t so charmed. Honolulu resident and Donald Trump voter Susan Roberts\u00a0told FoxNews.com she found the sign in \u201cextreme poor taste.\u201d \u201cIt's childish and very unprofessional,\u201d she said in an email. \u201c\u2026 The restaurant owner doesn't have to worry ... I will not be stepping foot in that establishment.\u201d Willes Lee, former chairman of the Hawaii Republican Party and now president of National Federation of Republican Assemblies, told\u00a0FoxNews.com the sign is discriminatory, and harkens back to \u201cracist and hate-filled\u201d days\u00a0before statehood. \u201cRemember when\u00a0Filipinos couldn't go in certain places, or Japanese\u00a0wouldn't be\u00a0allowed [in] many\u00a0homes? And,\u00a0it didn't matter who they voted for,\u201d said Lee, who is of Japanese\u00a0descent.\u00a0 \u201cPeople should be able to get food without hearing a political message,\u201d one apparent former customer\u00a0 wrote on Yelp . \u201cI will never go back.\u201d\u00a0 According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, the caf\u00e9 was founded by Robert Warner, a former hair stylist for Vidal Sassoon in San Francisco and former restaurateur in Seattle, along with his wife Jali. Reached for comment Tuesday, Jali downplayed the sign's supposed ban. She told FoxNews.com the restaurant is not actually asking customers whether they voted for President-elect Trump, and said even if they see a customer with a Trump shirt,\u00a0\u201cwe don\u2019t put anything different [in] your food.\u201d \u201cRobert just wants to express how much he doesn\u2019t like Trump,\u201d Jali said. \u201cIf people take it personally or it hurts them, we cannot help. That\u2019s why we say they have [a] choice if they want to come or not come. We don\u2019t force them.\u201d She said three people called to complain about the sign when it first went up, \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create trouble,\u201d Jali said. \u201cThere is enough trouble in the world.\u201d\u00a0 While Jali is soft-spoken, Warner, some customers note, is known to channel the \u201csoup Nazi\u201d persona of New York City and \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fame -- \u201cthrowing pots and pans,\u201d \u201ctelling off customers,\u201d and \u201changing not-so-friendly reminders on butcher paper for his customers to read.\u201d\u00a0 But another Yelp reviewer took issue with the attitude and the sign, writing:\u00a0\u201cIt was funny on Seinfeld, but this place can rot away. Stay away. Hawaii ain't like this. There's a lot of better places on the island than to have deal with extra crap like this.\u201d\u00a0 Hawaii overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton during the Nov. 8 election, and historically has supported Democrats in local and national races.\u00a0In fact, just six Republicans are in the 51-member House, and the 25-member\u00a0Senate is GOP-free. Now that the election is over, however, Lee said most residents want to just get on with their lives. \u201cThe [restaurant] owners might want to make a better sign,\u201d he said, \u201csince Trump will undoubtedly be in office for eight years.\u201d Advertisement ",

It was the first formal visit to the memorial that rests above the USS Arizona by a Japanese leader. USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe place wreaths at the USS Arizona Memorial. (Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM, AFP/Getty Images) President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paid emotional tribute Tuesday to the thousands of Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, and said the strong relations between their two nations in the decades since prove the power of reconciliation. \"Even the deepest wounds of war can give way to friendship and lasting peace,\" Obama said after welcoming his Japanese counterpart to the site of the attack that drew the United States into the\u00a0Second World War, a conflict that transformed America into a global superpower. Describing Pearl Harbor as \"a sacred place,\" Obama said: \"Here, in so many ways, America came of age.\" Abe, the first Japanese leader to pay a formal visit to Pearl Harbor, all but apologized for the attack of Dec. 7, 1941,\u00a0offering his \"sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls\" of the more than 2,400 Americans who lost their lives in the surprise attack. \"We must never repeat the horrors of war,\" Abe said. The prime minister also thanked the United States for helping his nation recover\u00a0\u2014 and develop a democracy \u2014 in the years after World War II, which ended with the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Obama visited Hiroshima in May, a trip Abe reciprocated with the ceremony at Pearl Harbor. Before their public remarks, Obama and Abe toured the memorial above the sunken USS Arizona. They visited the \"shrine\u00a0room,\" placing wreaths of peace lilies\u00a0in front of a wall adorned\u00a0with the names of American service members killed in the attack.\u00a0They\u00a0later dropped purple flowers into the waters of the harbor. The leaders also had a private meeting about U.S.-Japan relations, an alliance they praised during their public remarks. \"It has helped underwrite an international order that has prevented another World War,\" Obama said, and the U.S.-Japanese alliance \"has never been stronger.\" Abe said the U.S. and Japan have become the kinds of allies \"rarely found anywhere in history,\" a development he attributed to the \"power of reconciliation.\" Changes in\u00a0the alliance could be imminent as Donald Trump prepares to become U.S. president on Jan. 20.\u00a0During the campaign, Trump said Japan and other countries are taking advantage of the U.S. when it comes to trade deals. He also talked about demanding that Japan and other nations pay more for U.S. defense assistance. Publicly, Obama and Abe largely laid modern politics aside in speaking of those who made the ultimate sacrifice at Pearl Harbor. \"Here in this quiet harbor,\" Obama said,\u00a0\"\u00a0we honor those we lost, and we give thanks for all that our two nations have won \u2014 together, as friends.\" Both Obama and Abe spoke of the sacrifices made by service members during the conflict that engulfed the world less than a century ago. The sight of\u00a0the Arizona, its gutted hull at the bottom of the harbor, is \"a place that brought utter silence to me,\" Abe said. At the time of the attack and over the years, some citizens in Japan described the Pearl Harbor attack as retaliation for a U.S. oil embargo on their energy-starved country.\u00a0A\u00a0previous Japanese prime minister made an unannounced visit to Pearl Harbor in 1951, but Abe became the country's first leader to participate in a ceremony at the attack site. Obama may have made a reference to current events when he said that, even at times \"when hatred burns hottest,\" people \"must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\" Such are among the lessons of war, he said. \"The fruits of peace always outweigh the plunder of war,\" Obama said. \"This is the enduring truth of this hallowed harbor.\" 75 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 48 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iBKKHh NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Carrie Fisher, best known as Princess Leia in Star Wars, dead at 60 Published               December 27, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Carrie Fisher, best known as the iconic double-bun hairdo-wearing Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise, died Tuesday following a heart attack, FoxNews.com confirmed. She was 60. \"It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning,\" a representative for Lourd told FoxNews.com. \"She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly.\" \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 27, 2016 Fisher's publicist also confirmed the news. SLIDESHOW: CARRIE FISHER THROUGH THE YEARS Fisher starred in a host of popular 1980s movies, was married or engaged to famous singers and actors, suffered from bipolar disorder and drug addiction and eventually became a mental health advocate. She had a medical emergency while on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23, during which she stopped breathing. She was later taken to an intensive care unit, but never recovered. \"Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,\" mother Debbie Reynolds wrote on Facebook. \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.\" Fisher was born on Oct. 21, 1956 with showbiz \u2013 literally \u2013 in her blood. The daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and Reynolds, a star actress, Carrie appeared, at the age of 15, in the Broadway show \u201cIrene,\u201d which Reynolds starred in. But the theater turn cost her school time and contributed to Fisher never finishing high school. She first appeared on the movie screen in 1975\u2019s \u201cShampoo,\u201d though her career took off when she was cast as Princess Leia Organa in the inaugural Star Wars film, which was released in 1977. She would go on to reprise the role in subsequent films, most recently appearing in 2015\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d Rest In Peace, Carrie Fisher. pic.twitter.com/fTy7fgj1gH \u2014 20th Century Fox (@20thcenturyfox) December 27, 2016 Fisher revealed in her 2016 autobiography that she had an affair with \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-star Harrison Ford for three months in 1976. In the 1980s, Fisher appeared in a string of Hollywood hits, including \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d \u201cThe \u2018Burbs\u201d and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u2026\u201d Her romantic life also heated up during the decade. Fisher dated Paul Simon until 1983 and about a year later married to the singer/songwriter, again for about a year. In between stints with Simon, she dated and was briefly engaged to \u201cBlues Brother\u201d co-star Dan Akroyd in 1980. She had a child, Billie Catherine Lourd, in 1992 with talent agent Bryan Lourd, though Lourd later left Fisher for a man. STARS REACT TO CARRIE FISHER'S DEATH Fisher appeared to reflect on the relationship with Lourd in her 2004 book, \u201cThe Best Awful There Is,\u201d in which the character Suzanne is loosely based on Fisher\u2019s life. \u201cShe\u2019d had a child with someone who forgot to tell her he was gay. He forgot to tell her, and she forgot to notice.\u201d I'm deeply saddened at the news of Carrie's passing. She was a dear friend, whom I greatly respected and admired. The force is dark today! \u2014 Billy Dee Williams (@realbdw) December 27, 2016 \u201cBest Awful\u201d was the fifth and final of Fisher\u2019s novels, though she later wrote three non-fiction works, including 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Princess Diarist.\u201d A talented writer, she helped rework screen plays for \u201cSister Act,\u201d \u201cLast Action Hero\u201d and \u201cThe Wedding Singer.\u201d Fisher also continued her acting career later in life, often appearing as herself in comedic turns on television shows. Somewhat out of character, she provided the voice of \u201cAngela\u201d on \u201cFamily Guy\u201d from 2005-2016. Her last projects were in two yet-to-be released films: \u201cWonderwall\u201d and as Leia in \u201cStar Wars: Episode VIII.\u201d Fisher also publicly struggled with bipolar disorder and abused pain killers and cocaine. She said in 2008 that she received electroconvulsive therapy treatments every six weeks at one point. Fisher became an outspoken advocate for those battling mental illness and received an Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism from Harvard in 2016. \u201cI find it unappealing,\" Fisher said of her mental illness in a 2004 Los Angeles Times profile. \u201cBut there is a part of this illness that is funny. I don't understand the stigma. I understand funny. It is what I do. Because I have the sense of humor I have, things don't prey on me long. And that's why I have it. If I didn't, I would be\u2026in pain. If my life weren't funny, it would just be true, and that would be unacceptable.\u201d In her book \"Wishful Drinking,\" Fisher wrote the beginning of her ideal obituary. The remark came as the punchline to an anecdote about \"Star Wars\" director George Lucas telling Fisher that Princess Leia couldn't wear a bra in space -- because, by his logic, it would kill the character. \"I think that this would make for a fantastic obituary,\" she wrote. \"I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\" Eddie Fisher died in 2010. Carrie Fisher is survived by her brother, Todd Fisher, and her mother and daughter. FoxNews.com's Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Carrie Fisher, best known for her role as Princess Leia in \"Star Wars,\" has also written several books and has become an advocate for mental-heal... \u201cI am truly a product of Hollywood inbreeding,\u201d Fisher wrote in her 2008 autobiography \u201cWishful Drinking.\u201d \u201cWhen two celebrities mate, someone like me is the result.\u201d Fisher made her film debut as a precocious teen in 1975\u2019s \u201cShampoo,\u201d starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn. But her big break came just two years later, when she starred as Princess Leia in the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy. Fisher revealed earlier this year that she and co-star Harrison Ford had a three-month affair while filming the first film, when she was just 19 years old and he was 33 years old -- and married with two children. \u201cIt was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend,\u201d she said in her 2016 memoir \u201cThe Princess Diarist.\u201d \u00a0 The scene in \u201cThe Return of the Jedi\u201d where she wore a gold metal bikini as a sex slave became one of the most famous pop-culture moments of a generation. She told Rolling Stone in 1983 that the films are \u201cbasically boys\u2019 fantasies.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNearly naked, which is not a style choice for me,\u201d Fisher said of the bikini in an interview with NPR earlier this year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my choice. When [director George Lucas] showed me the outfit, I thought he was kidding and it made me very nervous. I had to sit very straight because I couldn\u2019t have lines on my sides, like little creases. No creases were allowed, so I had to sit very, very rigid straight \u2026 What redeems it is I get to kill him, which was so enjoyable. ... I sawed his neck off with that chain that I killed him with. I really relished that because I hated wearing that outfit and sitting there rigid straight, and I couldn\u2019t wait to kill him.\u201d After \u201cThe Return of the Jedi\u201d in 1983, Fisher struggled with alcoholism, drug use and mental illness. She wrote in her memoir \u00a0\u201cThe Princess Diarist\u201d that she was first introduced to drugs at age 13. Fisher started dating singer Paul Simon while filming \u201cStar Wars\u201d in 1977, and they married in 1983 at their apartment in New York City. They divorced after just one year, but they continued to date on and off for a decade afterward.\u00a0 View Gallery Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford as Luke Skywaker, Princess Leia and Han Solo in scene from \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\u201d In 1987, she published her first book, \u201cPostcards from the Edge\u201d -- a thinly-veiled fictionalized telling of her drug use, time in rehab and her relationship with her mother. The book was turned into a film with the same name, starring Shirley MacLaine as Debbie and Meryl Streep as Fisher in 1990. She told CBS News in 2004 that writing had become her passion. \u00a0On her website, Fisher is credited as \u201cone of the top script doctors in Hollywood\u201d for polishing screenplays from 1991 to 2005.\u00a0 \u201cEverything worked out very well in books,\u201d Fisher told \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201c[It\u2019s] much more organized and ordered than everything out here.\u201d Fisher wrote six more books \u2013 \u201cDelusions of Grandma,\u201d \u201cSurrender the Pink,\u201d \u201cThe Best Awful,\u201d \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d which she adapted from her one-woman show, \u201cShockaholic,\u201d and the \u201cThe Princess Diarist.\u201d Fisher and Hollywood power agent Bryan Lourd were in a relationship in the 1990s and had a daughter, but Lourd eventually left her for a man. She described the situation as \u201chumiliating,\u201d although she said they kept a civil relationship for the sake of their daughter, Billie. \u201cI wanted Billie to see we could be friends, because I never had that with my own parents. I\u2019m glad I got Billie a good dad; he\u2019s everything my father wasn\u2019t \u2013 including gay!\u201d Fisher said in \u00a02011 . Billie, now 24, is also an actress, currently starring in the Fox series \u201cScream Queens.\u201d Actresses Carrie Fisher (L) and Billie Lourd embrace as they arrive at the premiere of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d in Hollywood, California, Dec. 14, 2015. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters Fisher has long been open about living with bipolar disorder. In 2005, she told CBS \u2019 \u201cThe Early Show\u201d she was diagnosed early in her life. \u201cI had a shrink say to me \u2026 \u2018Did you forget to tell me that you were hyperactive as a child?\u2019 Slipped my mind after four years. But Billie does not have any signs of having this thing. My father was one of four children and the only one that, you know, was lucky enough to have won the sweepstakes.\u201d\u00a0 Fisher remained on the stage throughout the years. She performed \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d as a one-woman show from 2006-07, and it later became an HBO special in 2010. \u00a0Fisher appeared in several films since \u201cStar Wars,\u201d including roles in \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and a cameo in \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery.\u201d In 2015, she and the other original stars of \u201cStar Wars\u201d reprised their roles in \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d \u00a0 Fisher told CBS in 2004 that the way she told her life story \u201cbetter be funny.\u201d \u201cIf my life wasn\u2019t funny,\u201d she said, \u201cit would just be true and that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Philip Bump December 27 at 9:41 AM Follow @pbump Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 21. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Donald Trump's depiction of the state of the American economy has consistently been as bleak as it is subjective. The unemployment numbers are fictional, he's claimed, with the real number perhaps as high as 42 percent! (It isn't anywhere close.) President Obama's never achieved 3 percent growth in a year, a first for a modern president! (True when you look at calendar years and presidents after Herbert Hoover .) But Americans don't often take the big picture view on the economy, either. How the country is faring economically is as subjective for us as it seems to be for Trump. Setting up a long-term question: When Trump's depiction of the Trump economy turns suddenly sunny, will America agree? That process began Monday evening, with another tweet from the president-elect. The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 There are three economic indicators in that tweet, by our estimation: economic confidence (the measure of hope, if you will), the Dow Jones industrial average and holiday spending. (Why \u201choliday\u201d vs. \u201cChristmas\u201d? We'll get to that, but it's not because we've declared war on the Christian holiday.) Here's how those numbers look. Economic confidence spiked after the election of Trump, according to data from Gallup . The effect is pretty remarkable, in fact. What's going on here? Last month, Gallup explained the switch in one simple word: partisanship. \u201cRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economy's outlook than they did before the election,\u201d Gallup's Justin McCarthy and Jeffrey M. Jones wrote. \u201cJust 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse.\u201d Put another way: More than 8 in 10 Republicans were pessimistic about the economy before the election \u2014 but immediately after, more were optimistic than pessimistic. The hope, in other words, had a partisan tinge, just like everything else . The Dow Jones industrial average reflects confidence, too. Trump's right that the index is up nearly 10 percent since Election Day. We looked at this surge earlier this month, putting it into historical context. It matches the post-election surges enjoyed by Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover (the president whose tenure overlapped with the Great Depression, meaning he, too, failed to hit Trump's arbitrary 3-percent-growth metric). The Dow has been flirting with the symbolic 20,000-point mark for some time; if it's surpassed, expect another Trump tweet. How much credit is due to Trump for the increase isn't entirely clear. The Dow is up 16 percent since the beginning of the year. At the end of March, relative to a month-and-a-half prior, the index was up 12.9 percent. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the Dow is up 107 percent \u2014 more than double \u2014 but he isn't usually described as the cause of that growth. What's more, Trump is setting up a risky connection: If the Dow does well thanks to him, what happens if and when it tanks? Last week, CNN Money reported that Trump probably deserves some credit for the improved Dow in the sense that a quarter of the spike is a function of Goldman Sachs's \u00a0improvement. Goldman's up nearly a third since Election Day, an improvement that overlaps with Trump tapping its president and several alumni for posts in his administration. The credit Trump claims for holiday spending, though, is far less due. The number he cites \u2014 a trillion dollars \u2014 appears to come from a Deloitte survey that projected holiday sales from November through January and reached that trillion-dollar number. Mind you, that survey was released in October, meaning that the projections had nothing to do with a Trump electoral win. Deloitte instead credited better household finances and the steadily improving economy for the figure. In fact, Deloitte's numbers specifically indicate that three-quarters of Americans didn't expect the presidential election to affect their spending at all. That tweet, though, offers another taste of what we can expect from President Trump, once he's inaugurated. Just as he railed against government figures during the campaign, we can expect him to isolate and exaggerate good economic news once he's in office. (Or, apparently, even before.) This isn't unique to Trump, of course; politicians, including Obama, aren't shy about highlighting the positives and downplaying the negatives. What makes Trump different is scale: His willingness to take credit or assign blame tends toward the extremes. In an article at Politico , AEI's James Pethokoukis neatly summarizes what President Trump's economic pronouncements might be like. \u201cThe president-elect judges his own personal wealth based on his own feelings,\u201d he said, referring to a comment Trump once made in a deposition . \u201cSo on any given day, he could just decide based on his feelings that America is great.\u201d The catch? If voters aren't convinced by November 2020 \u2014 if their subjective analysis of the economy doesn't match Trump's rhetoric \u2014 he's in for an awfully tough reelection. politics ",

Mark Lennihan/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP On an otherwise slow trading day, both the Nasdaq and Dow Jones indexes made notable gains. The Nasdaq closed at a record 5,487 points while the Dow inched closer to a 20,000 high. Mark Lennihan/AP Boosted by technology stocks and housing, major U.S. Stock indexes closed higher despite slow post-holiday trading. The Nasdaq ended the day breaking a record. By the market's close, it had reached 5,487 points, a gain of 0.45 percent. The Dow moved closer to a record 20,000 high reaching 19,945 by the time of the bell. The Associated Press notes that despite these gains, it was an otherwise slow day for the markets. In fact, the news service says it was the lightest trading day since October 2015. At the same time, signs point to an altogether healthy year for U.S. markets. \"Markets are moving toward 20,000 and bond yields are up; there's a little bit of buoyancy in oil prices,\" chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank, Erik Davidson, told the news service. Reuters adds that consumer and housing data, along with technology gains, pushed markets higher: \"Tuesday data showed American consumers' confidence shot to its highest in more than 15 years in December as they saw more strength ahead in business conditions, stock prices and the job market, while house prices continued their steady recovery in October. \"U.S. equities have been riding a post-presidential election rally, feeding on optimism that Donald Trump's plans for deregulation and infrastructure spending could bolster the economy. With the market priced for positive outcomes in various scenarios, some see the end-year rally as an opportunity to cash-in gains. ... \"About 4.13 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.27 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Volume this week last year averaged 5 billion stocks daily. \"The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 was Nvidia Corp, which rose 6.9 percent and boosted the chipmakers. \"Amazon rose 1.4 percent to $771.40.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story An investigator appointed by the World Anti-Doping Agency, Richard McLaren, published more extensive evidence this month that prompted the International Olympic Committee to open disciplinary proceedings against dozens of additional Russian athletes. Russia\u2019s drastic shift in tone may be motivated by a desire to reconcile with the regulators, who have stipulated that the nation accept the findings of the recent investigation before the country is recertified to conduct drug testing and be a host again of Olympic competitions. Photo Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency. The country\u2019s doping operation \u201cwas an institutional conspiracy,\u201d she said while emphasizing that the government\u2019s top officials were not involved. Credit Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press The officials, however, continue to reject the accusation that the doping program was state-sponsored. They define the Russian state as President Vladimir V. Putin and his closest associates. Ms. Antseliovich, who has not been directly implicated in the investigations, said she was shocked by the revelations. Vitaly Smirnov, 81, a top sports official whose career dates to the Soviet era and who was appointed this year by Mr. Putin to reform the nation\u2019s antidoping system, said he did not want \u201cto speak for the people responsible.\u201d Mr. Smirnov said he had not met most of the individuals implicated in a report by Mr. McLaren \u2014 emphasizing that they had been dismissed as a result \u2014 nor did he know where they were. \u201cFrom my point of view, as a former minister of sport, president of Olympic committee \u2014 we made a lot of mistakes,\u201d he said, echoing Mr. Putin\u2019s broad denials of a state-sponsored system and noting that he would defer to the global governing bodies of each sport to rule on the evidence. Mr. McLaren said Tuesday that he was pleased Russian officials were no longer disputing his findings, suggesting they may have been motivated to stop further investigations into the scope of cheating. \u201cIt\u2019s damage control,\u201d Mr. McLaren said. \u201cThere are a number of different labels you can put on the facts, and they take a different view of government, but it\u2019s a bit of a vocabulary game.\u201d The 2014 Olympics in Sochi were a pet project for Mr. Putin, who was closely involved in politicking for and preparing for them. Proud references to the Sochi Games overwhelm the Russian Olympic Committee\u2019s offices along the Moscow River, including a nesting doll standing roughly six feet tall in the building\u2019s lobby signed by Russian Olympians. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many of the athletes whose pictures decorate the Olympic committee\u2019s offices have been implicated in this year\u2019s doping scandal, with scores formally disciplined and more than 650 others now accused.

Credit Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press \u201cWe have to find those reasons why young sportsmen are taking doping, why they agree to be doped,\u201d Mr. Smirnov said, expressing eagerness to move forward rather than assign responsibility for previous violations. But even as he and other officials signaled their acceptance of the fundamental findings of Mr. McLaren\u2019s investigation, they were largely unconciliatory, suggesting that cheating to benefit Russia had served to offset what they perceived as preferential treatment for Western nations by global sports authorities. \u201cHave you seen the Fancy Bear records?\u201d Mr. Smirnov said, invoking medical records hacked by a cyberespionage group believed to be associated with G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence agency suspected of hacking computers at the Democratic National Committee. The medical records revealed that hundreds of Western athletes had been given special medical permission to take banned drugs for legitimate therapeutic reasons. \u201cRussia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,\u201d Mr. Smirnov said. \u201cThe general feeling in Russia is that we didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d he added, acknowledging that anabolic steroids like those taken by Russian athletes have never been deemed medically excusable by regulators. The supposedly tamper-proof bottles that held Russian athletes\u2019 doping samples in Sochi were manipulated \u2014 enabling officials to switch out their steroid-laced urine. Mr. Smirnov and his advisers suggested that the same thing had happened at other Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky that the WADA had Rodchenkov,\u201d said Victor Berezov, a lawyer for Russia\u2019s Olympic Committee. \u201cMaybe in China, London and everywhere \u2014 maybe the same things could happen. Because the system is broken.\u201d Now, as Russia\u2019s global track and field athletes remain barred from competition and its drug-testing operations decertified, Mr. Smirnov and a team of about two dozen people are focused on overhauling Russia\u2019s antidoping system to satisfy global authorities. The group , selected over the summer, includes Russian politicians, Olympians, business people and even a celebrated pianist.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Ellen Nakashima December 27 at 1:32 PM Follow @nakashimae The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U.S. officials. The administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week. The sanctions part of the package culminates weeks of debate in the White House about how to revise an executive order from last year meant to give the president authority to respond to cyberattacks from overseas, but which did not originally cover efforts to influence the electoral system. The Obama administration last year rolled the order out to great fanfare as a way to punish and deter foreign hackers who harm the United States\u2019 economic or national security. The threat to use it last year helped wring a pledge out of China\u2019s president that his country would cease hacking U.S. companies\u2019 secrets to benefit Chinese firms. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) But officials this fall concluded that it could not, as written, be used to punish the most significant cyber-provocation in recent memory against the United States \u2014 Russia\u2019s hacking of Democratic organizations, targeting of state election systems and meddling in the presidential election . With the clock ticking, the White House is working on adapting the authority to punish the Russians, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. President Obama last week pledged there would be a response to Moscow\u2019s interference in the U.S. elections. Russia had denied involvement in the hacking. One clear way to use the order against the Russian suspects would be to declare the electoral systems part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d of the United States. Or it could be amended to clearly apply to the new threat \u2014 interfering in elections. Administration officials would also like to make it difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to roll back any action they take. \u201cPart of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,\u201d said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Obama issued the executive order in April 2015, creating the sanctions tool as a way to hold accountable people who harm computer systems related to critical functions such as electricity generation or transportation or who gain a competitive advantage through cybertheft of commercial secrets. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a news conference in November 2014 in Beijing. (Feng Li/Getty Images) The order allows the government to freeze the assets in the United States of people overseas who have engaged in cyber acts that have threatened U.S. national security or financial stability. The sanctions would also block commercial transactions with the designated individuals and bar their entry into the country. But just a year later, a Russian military spy agency would hack into the Democratic National Committee and steal a trove of emails that were released a few months later on WikiLeaks, U.S. officials said. Other releases followed, including the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. \u201cFundamentally, it was a low-tech, high-impact event,\u201d said Zachary Goldman, a sanctions and national security expert at New York University School of Law. And the 2015 executive order was not crafted to target hackers who steal emails and dump them on WikiLeaks or seek to disrupt an election. \u201cIt was an authority published at a particular time to address a particular set of problems,\u201d he said. So officials \u201cneed to engage in some legal acrobatics to fit the DNC hack into an existing authority, or they need to write a new authority,\u201d Goldman said. Administration officials would like Obama to use the power before leaving office to demonstrate its utility. \u201cWhen the president came into office, he didn\u2019t have that many tools out there to use as a response\u201d to malicious cyber-acts, said Ari Schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council. \u201cHaving the sanctions tool is really a big one. It can make a very strong statement in a way that is less drastic than bombing a country and more impactful than sending out a cable from the State Department.\u201d The National Security Council concluded that it would not be able to use the authority against Russian hackers because their malicious activity did not clearly fit under its terms, which require harm to critical infrastructure or the theft of commercial secrets. \u201cYou would (a) have to be able to say that the actual electoral infrastructure, such as state databases, was critical infrastructure, and (b) that what the Russians did actually harmed it,\u201d said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThose are two high bars.\u201d Though Russian government hackers are believed to have penetrated at least one state voter-registration database, they did not tamper with the data, officials said. Some analysts believe that state election systems would fit under \u201cgovernment facilities,\u201d which is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security. Another option is to use the executive order against other Russian targets \u2014 say, hackers who stole commercial secrets \u2014 and then, in either a public message or a private one, make clear that the United States considers its electoral systems to be critical infrastructure. The idea is to not only punish but also deter. \u201cAs much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,\u201d a second official said. \u201cI am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, \u2018That worked pretty well in 2016, so let\u2019s keep going.\u2019 We have elections every two years in this country.\u201d Even the threat of sanctions can have deterrent value. Officials and experts point to the agreement Chinese President Xi Jinping reached with Obama last year that his country would stop commercial cyberspying. Xi came to the table following news reports last summer that the administration was preparing to sanction Chinese companies. Complicating matters, the Trump transition team has not yet had extensive briefings with the White House on cyber issues, including the potential use of the cyber-sanctions order. The slow pace has caused consternation among officials, who fear that the administration\u2019s accomplishments in cybersecurity could languish if the next administration fails to understand their value. [ Trump turning away intelligence briefers since election win ] Sanctions are not a silver bullet. Obama noted that \u201cwe already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians\u201d for their activities in Ukraine. So it is questionable, some experts say, whether adding new ones would have a meaningful effect in changing the Kremlin\u2019s behavior. But in combination with other measures, they could be effective. Criminal indictments of Russians might become an option, officials said, but the FBI has so far not gathered enough evidence that could be introduced in a criminal case. At one point, federal prosecutors and FBI agents in San Francisco considered indicting Guccifer 2.0, a nickname for a person or people believed to be affiliated with the Russian influence operation and whose true identity was unknown. Before the election, the administration used diplomatic channels to warn Russia. Obama spoke to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin at a Group of 20 summit in China in September. About a week before the election, the United States sent a \u201chotline\u201d-style message to Moscow using a special channel for crisis communication created in 2013 as part of the State Department\u2019s Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. As part of that message, the officials said, the administration asked Russia to stop targeting state voter registration and election systems. It was the first use of that system. The Russians, officials said, appeared to comply. Read more: ",

His mother makes sure of that, makes sure he feels his father\u2019s presence. His mother tells him what a selfless, caring man his daddy, Montrell Jackson, was, and how much he wanted a child \u2013 they tried for nearly two years. She tells Mason how ecstatic Montrell was when he came into the world in March. \u201cThat\u2019s what hurts the most,\u201d said Trenisha Jackson, \u201cthat he\u2019s not here for his son. He was so excited about being a father. He felt his responsibility was to make sure he raised a wonderful young man. [Montrell\u2019s] father was not in his life. He really wanted to be there for his son.\u201d Montrell Jackson, 32, was shot fatally in an ambush in July \u2013 when Mason was 4 months old \u2013 by a man targeting police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expand / Contract Baton Rouge Police Corporal Montrell Jackson, who was shot and killed by Gavin Long along with two other officers on July 17. (Officer Down Memorial Page) That gunman killed a total of three officers \u2013 just a fraction of the nearly 140 law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty this year, up from 130 in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a non-profit group founded and run by active and retired law enforcement officials. The most recent shootings of police officers took place on Friday. In Mt. Vernon, Washington, Mike \u201cMick\u201d McLaurghry, a 30-year veteran, was shot in the back of the head while responding to a call. Officials said he was \u201changing in there\u201d in critical condition after surgery . Later the same day, Sgt. Rob Hatchell, of Dallas, Oregon, was shot in the leg while attempting to arrest an intoxicated man. Of those men and women in blue who died in 2016, 62 were killed by gunfire \u2013 a marked rise from the 39 the year before \u2013 about a dozen of them shot by gunmen who set out to kill police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, this year, is a big increase in gunfire murders of police officers,\u201d Lt. Randy Sutton, a retired police officer and author who represents Blue Lives Matter, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe methodology, where they are targeted attacks or ambushes or where people are lured into attacks, is up too. We haven\u2019t seen that since the late \u201860s or \u201870s, when there was a tremendous amount of anti-police terrorism.\u201d Sutton, like many others in law enforcement, say that tension between police and minority groups like Black Lives Matter that have organized to focus attention on profiling and what they argue is unwarranted use of force has led some to see those in uniform as the enemy. \u201cIt legitimizes a call for terror, a call for violence,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt adds an element of danger for law enforcement.\u201d He added, \u201cOf course not everyone who is in the protests believes that. But when there\u2019s a mob in place and fervor builds up, people do things they wouldn\u2019t normally do independently. And it can inspire lone wolf attacks. There are weak-minded people, some mentally disturbed, who absorb this call to action and act upon it.\u201d The methodology, where they are targeted attacks or ambushes or where people are lured into attacks ... we haven\u2019t seen that since the late \u201860s or \u201870s, when there was a tremendous amount of anti-police terrorism. - Randy Sutton, retired police lieutenant who represents Blue Lives Matter The deadliest assaults occurred in July in Dallas and Baton Rouge amid protests over black men who had died in encounters with police. A black gunman in Dallas opened fire on officers at a Black Lives Matter protest, killing five officers and wounding four others. Tensions rose in Baton Rouge, where thousands of people were angry over the death of 37-year-old Alton Sterling, a black man killed by white Baton Rouge officers after a confrontation at a convenience store. Those in law enforcement say they know they are signing up for a potentially dangerous job when they enter the profession. \u201cThere are risks every officer knows going in,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThat includes everything from going up against an armed suspect who is going to resist and going to do everything to escape, including shooting to try and kill you, to being struck by a car during a traffic stop.\u201d He went on, \u201cBut what is particularly frightening and disturbing at this point are the assassinations and entrapments, where police officers are lured into situations [in order] to kill them.\u201d Before her husband\u2019s death, Ternisha Jackson just let the day-to-day risks of police work stay on the margins of her thoughts. \u201cMontrell loved his job,\u201d his widow said. \u201cWe put the risks out of our minds.\u201d The growing protests outside police departments across the country, however, concerned her. \u201cThat was the first time I became afraid, I was afraid for him, after everything taking place,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going out of my mind. I never feared for his life until the protests.\u201d She understands the anger many people feel toward police. She knows, too, that some of it could be justified. But the answer, she says, is not violence. \u201cI get pulled over, and it\u2019s for a reason,\u201d she said. \u201cA broken tail light, it\u2019s for [your] safety ... Police die protecting you. They chose to protect and serve, and they deserve respect.\u201d When someone encounters a police who acts unprofessionally, Jackson said, \u201cThey should call them out, file a report.\u201d In Texas, Cpl. Marcie St. John knew that a large but peaceful protest was underway in Dallas in response to fatal police shootings that week in Baton Rouge and suburban St. Paul, Minnesota. She had finished her shift at about 8:30 p.m. and was on her way home \u2013 looking toward starting vacation the next day -- when she received a phone call from a colleague in law enforcement. \u201cMy friend calls me and said, \u2018Something is going downtown,\u2019 something major,\u201d St. John recalled. Within minutes, she got an alert from her department, asking that everyone be ready to report to duty. At home, as she put on her tactical gear, she got a call from another friend who told her that her best friend, Michael Smith, her former partner, had been shot while on duty at the protest. \u201cHe was a sound cop, a strong cop,\u201d said St. John, whose brother, who also was a police officer, died in the line of duty when they both were rookies. \u201cI never, ever thought it would happen to Mike.\u201d Expand / Contract Sgt. Michael Smith was one of five Dallas police officers Micah Johnson killed on July 7. (Dallas Police Department) The killer was 25-year-old Micah Johnson, an Army veteran who told authorities he was upset about fatal police shootings and wanted to exterminate policemen, \"especially white officers,\" officials said. Johnson, who was killed by a robot-delivered bomb dispatched by Dallas police, had amassed a personal arsenal at his suburban home, including bomb-making materials, bulletproof vests, rifles, ammunition and a journal of combat tactics. The killings marked the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In all, 12 officers were shot. \u201cEverything that\u2019s going on in law enforcement, officers being ambushed,\u201d said St. John, \u201cin my 25-year career, I\u2019ve never seen this. All of our officers \u2013 their lives and their deaths \u2013 have to matter.\u201d She has been helping Smith's widow, Heidi, and their two young daughters put their lives back together. The youngest daughter, who was 9 at the time of Smith's killing, has thought back to her last conversation with her father before he went off to work. Smith asked his daughter for a kiss, but she said she was busy playing a game. He pressed again, saying \"This may be the last time,\u201d St. John said he told her. Ten days before his own death, Montrell Jackson felt deeply distressed over the contentious protests and Dallas ambush \u2013 both as a police officer and a black man. He said as much in a message he posted on his Facebook page. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote, according to screen shots of his post, which was taken down after his death. \u201cDisappointed in some family, friends and officers for some reckless comments, but hey, what\u2019s in your heart is in your heart. I still love you all because hate takes too much energy, but I definitely won\u2019t be looking at you the same. Thank you to everyone [who] has reached out to me or my wife \u2013 it was needed and much appreciated. I swear to God I love this city, but I wonder if this city loves me.\u201d Jackson saw himself as a bridge between police and black residents, saying he understood the difficulty of being in each group\u2019s shoes. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced so much in my short life, and the past 3 days have tested me to the core,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn uniform, I get nasty hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat.\u201d He appealed to protesters. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let hate infect your heart,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cThis city MUST and WILL get better. I\u2019m working in these streets, so any protesters, officers, friends, family or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer, I got you.\u201d In Missouri, Gavin Eugene Long, a black separatist, never saw, or cared about, Jackson\u2019s plea. He traveled to Baton Rouge to hunt for police officers. And that is where he ended the life of little Mason\u2019s father.

The Post moved to this new building on Washington's K Street in December 2015. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images The Washington Post expects to hire more than 60 journalists in the coming months \u2014 a sign of remarkable growth for a newspaper in the digital age. After a year of record traffic and digital advertising revenue, the Post newsroom will grow by more than 8 percent, to more than 750 people. The extent of the newsroom expansion was first reported by Politico. The Post will add a \"rapid-response\" investigative team, expand its video journalism and breaking news staff, and make additional investments in podcasts and photography. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos bought the Post in October 2013 and reportedly invested $50 million in the company last year. That investment is paying off, according to a memo from publisher Fred Ryan that said the Post is now \"a profitable and growing company.\" Ryan said the Post's online traffic had increased by nearly 50 percent in the past year, and new subscriptions have grown by 75 percent, more than doubling digital subscription revenue. Meanwhile, subscriptions at The New York Times have also surged. Times CEO Mark Thompson said on CNBC that the paper added 132,000 new subscribers in the 18 days after the election, a tenfold increase over the same period a year ago. The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal also reported record growth in subscriptions. Article continues after sponsorship In June, Donald Trump revoked the Post's press credentials at his campaign events, before lifting the ban on the Post and other news organizations two months later.

They are expected to generate enough energy to power 17,000 homes. \u201cWe see this being a big industry, we see offshore wind producing a lot of energy for the United States, particularly here in the Northeast where the winds are really strong,\u201d said Jeff Grybowski, CEO of Deepwater Wind, which built the wind farm. Wind turbines off of Rhode Island CBS News The turbines will most benefit Block Island. Because of its location, 45 minutes by boat from the mainland, it currently gets its oil and gas shipped in. Residents pay a premium; At peak times, nearly 60 cents per kilowatt. The wind farm is expected to cut that cost to about 24 cents. Steve Draper CBS News That is great news for 68-year old Steve Draper. His family runs the 1661 Inn, one of the oldest businesses on the island. \u201cOur bill last year was somewhere around $200,000,\u201d he said. \u201cYou try everything to cut your costs. It\u2019s a major factor in doing business here.\u201d While countries like Denmark have been using off-shore wind farms since the early 1990s, U.S.-based projects have been stalled due to court fights over environmental fears and protests over the turbines blocking beachfront views. \u201cIt took us eight years to build this project but we are finally here,\u201d Grybowski said. Boaters pass by the wend farm CBS News Other projects are in the works, potentially bringing 200 more wind turbines to the area within the next 10 years. Draper expects people will get used to the new scenery. \u201cWe all got used to telephone poles and telephone wires in our views and they\u2019re not beautiful,\u201d he said.

Jones , USA TODAY Sports 1:24 a.m. EST December 28, 2016 x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lindsay H. Jones breaks down the Buffalo Bills' reasoning for parting ways with Rex Ryan. USA TODAY Sports Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan gives a thumbs up as he leaves the field after beating the San Francisco 49ers at New Era Field. (Photo: Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports) The Buffalo Bills hired Rex Ryan\u00a0to make the team a contender and\u00a0true rival to the New England Patriots in the AFC East. But after nearly two full seasons, it became clear that vision wouldn't be fulfilled. After another year out of the playoffs (that\u2019s 17 straight seasons without a postseason appearance), Ryan\u2019s fate was sealed. With an undisciplined defense and major questions at quarterback moving into next year, the Bills are no closer to competing in the AFC East than they were when Ryan was hired. And Saturday\u2019s loss to the Miami Dolphins, who clinched a playoff berth in\u00a0Adam Gase's first year as coach, showed the Bills were indeed a team trending downward. When Ryan took over, the Bills\u00a0ranked No. 4 in total defense. The unit fell to 19th in his first season, and it stands in that same slot\u00a0this year upon his firing. NFL coaches' hot seat rankings: Who's feeling the most heat now? Two seasons may seem like a short lifespan for a head coach, but Ryan was a proven entity when he arrived in Orchard Park. The Bills knew they were getting a coach with a plus-size personality and a reputation for crafting a complicated and nasty defense. He promised playoffs and memorable battles with Bill Belichick\u2019s Patriots and was unable to deliver. The Bills\u2019 run defense (133.5 yards allowed per game) is the fifth-worst in the NFL,\u00a0in part because of poor tackling. Those struggles were evident\u00a0in the loss to the Dolphins, as running back\u00a0Jay Ajayi had his second 200-yard rushing day against the Bills this season. On a 57-yard run by Ajayi in overtime, the Bills' defense had just 10 men on the field. Ryan accepted responsibility for the error, calling it \"the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.\" When the Bills\u2019 offense struggled earlier this year, Ryan fired offensive coordinator Greg Roman just two weeks into the season. The offense rebounded under new coordinator Anthony Lynn, who on Tuesday was named interim head coach, but the defense continued to flounder. That was a sign that Ryan\u00a0and his twin brother Rob, who helped run the defense, were\u00a0on the hot seat. NFL playoff picture: Packers-Lions showdown could be play-in game The Bills also went 1-3 against the Patriots during Ryan\u2019s tenure in Orchard Park. The lone win came earlier this season while Patriots\u00a0quarterback Tom Brady was suspended. It will be interesting now to see the market for Ryan, 54, after two failed stints as a head coach. His personality makes him popular, but will another owner take a chance on a coach who has never won a division title? Or will Ryan be interested in taking a defensive coordinator job? In September 2015, Ryan told USA TODAY Sports that Buffalo would be his last coaching job, though he surely thought he would last more than two seasons with the Bills at the time. \u201cWhen my days are up, I\u2019ll turn it over to the younger generation. I\u2019m not going anywhere else,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan might now be best suited for television, and the networks should engage in a bidding war for his services. The Bills, meanwhile, once again are starting over. The new head coach will inherit a roster in flux, with more than 20 players set to hit free agency in March, including cornerback Stephon Gilmore, linebacker Lorenzo Alexander and wide receiver Robert Woods. But the biggest question is at quarterback. Will the new head coach want to move forward with Tyrod Taylor, who received a six-year, $90 million extension in August? The structure of Taylor\u2019s contract essentially made it a one-year deal, with a team option after this season. Regardless of who the Bills choose to hire, and whom that coach picks as quarterback, the Bills must find stability at those two key spots. Follow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjones .

Jail 0 Shares Email An inmate who is considered dangerous is still on the run after he and five others escaped from a Tennessee jail by removing a leaky toilet, officials said. Six inmates from the Cocke County Jail Annex in Newport made the escape Christmas Day at around 1:30 a.m., the Cocke County Sheriff's Office said in a statement; five of them have since been apprehended. Still on the run is David Wayne Frazier, 54, who is considered dangerous, according to the sheriff's office. Frazier was in custody for alleged aggravated robbery and possession of a weapon by a felon. He had not entered a plea. He was arrested Dec. 20 and had not yet had a preliminary hearing, Cocke County Sheriff Armando Fontes told ABC News today. 1 Fugitive Still at Large After 6 Inmates Escaped Tennessee Jail by Removing Toilet The early-morning Christmas escape was prompted by a water leak behind a toilet, the sheriff's office said. \"The bolts holding the unit rusted out, and there was prior damage to the concrete due to plumbing repairs,\" the sheriff's office added. The inmates removed the toilet from the wall, the sheriff's office said, and \"gained access to a hole, which led outside of the facility.\" Fontes said that his office is working with the U.S. Marshals Service to look for Frazier and that authorities have gotten several tips. The sheriff's office said Monday, \"We will do everything possible to capture this individual\" and \"we will not let up until he is back in custody.\" Anyone with information is asked to contact the Cocke County Sheriff's Office at 423-623-3064 or the jail at 423-613-9128.

Marco Garcia/AP hide caption toggle caption Marco Garcia/AP Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (right), strums a pineapple-shaped ukulele presented to him by Hawaii Gov. David Ige at a dinner on Monday in Honolulu. Abe and President Obama visited Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, 75 years after the surprise Japanese attack that drew the U.S. into World War II. Marco Garcia/AP In a somber ceremony Tuesday, the two leaders touted the U.S.-Japan alliance that arose in the aftermath of the bitter conflict and became a \"cornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Obama said. \"The U.S. and Japan chose friendship and they chose peace,\" Obama said. \"It has helped underwrite an international order that has prevented another World War.\" Abe, for his part, offered his condolences, but stopped short of an apology for the Dec. 7, 1941, air raid that killed more than 2,300 service members. \"As the prime minister of Japan, I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place,\" Abe said through an interpreter.

The Arizona was hit in the air raid. Marco Garcia/AP But while both leaders spent significant time memorializing the dead, it was the current relationship between the two nations that took center stage. Abe said \"the spirit of reconciliation\" was at work in U.S. efforts to aid the war-wrecked Japan following its surrender. He also credited the U.S. for allowing Japan to transition from an imperial nation to a peaceful democratic one. \"On behalf of the Japanese people, I hereby wish to express once again my heartfelt gratitude to the U.S. and the world for the tolerance extended to Japan,\" the prime minister said. Article continues after sponsorship Abe's visit also marks the first time a Japanese prime minister has made an official visit to the site of the surprise aerial attack, and takes place just seven months after Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to travel to Hiroshima , the Japanese city where the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in 1945, hastening the end of the war. While Abe is not the first Japanese leader to visit this World War II landmark, he's the first do so publicly and alongside a U.S. president. Three Japanese prime ministers made low-key visits in the 1950s, including one in 1957 by Nobusuke Kishi \u2014 who was Abe's grandfather. Those visits received scant attention, so little that Abe himself was apparently unaware his grandfather had been to Pearl Harbor. At the time, the trauma of World War II was still vivid for millions of Americans and Japanese and neither side appeared eager to advertise the unofficial visits by the Japanese leaders. With Obama down to his final weeks in office, the two leaders held their last bilateral meeting and reviewed the state of the U.S.- Japan alliance. Obama has sought to increase the U.S. focus on the broader region with his \"pivot to Asia\" at a time of growing Chinese military and economic might. President-elect Donald Trump's approach has so far been marked by provocative statements about China, and also by calls for Japan to pay more for security assistance. However, he hasn't yet spelled out the details of his plans. Abe was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump. The two sat down at Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 18, though few specifics emerged from the discussion. ",

Carrie Fisher, seen in June 2013, at Supanova Pop Culture Expo at Homebush in Sydney, Australia. TRACEY NEARMY / EPA During a Nov. 21 appearance on TODAY, Fisher showed no sign of being ill while she bantered with the hosts and dished about her affair with co-star Harrison Ford. Photo Gallery: Carrie Fisher: Actress, Author and 'Princess' \"It was a three-month one-night stand,\" she said. But on a flight from London back home to Los Angeles last Friday, Fisher went into cardiac arrest. Sources said members of the United flight crew, joined by a doctor and a nurse on board, performed emergency measures on her. Lucas said in a statement that Fisher \"was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved.\" \"In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess \u2014 feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think,\" he said. \"My heart and prayers are with Billie, Debbie and all Carrie's family, friends and fans. She will be missed by all.\" Co-star Harrison Ford echoed the sentiment, and said in a statement that \"Carrie was one-of-a-kind ... brilliant, original. Funny and emotionally fearless. She lived her life, bravely.\" So many thanks to the United flight crew who jumped into action, and the awesome doctor and nurse passengers who helped \u2014 Anna Akana (@AnnaAkana) December 23, 2016 Born October 21, 1956, Fisher was Hollywood royalty before she became a member of the fictional Organa royal family in the \"Star Wars\" movies. The daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds, Fisher was just two when her parents divorced and she went to live briefly with starlet Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds thanked those who \"embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter\" in a post on Facebook following Fisher's death, adding, \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop.\" Post by NBC News . Following in her mother's footsteps, Fisher made her film debut in the 1975 movie \"Shampoo.\" But it was her turn as the tough-talking princess who defies the Evil Empire in \"Star Wars\" two years later that rocketed her into fame and turned her into a feminist icon at the tender age of 19. And she relished the role. \"And as much as I may have joked about 'Star Wars' over the years, I liked that I was in those films,\" she later wrote in her autobiography. \"Particularly as the only girl in an all-boy fantasy. They were fun to make. It was an anecdote of unimaginable standing.\" In 1983, Fisher became a sex symbol for a whole generation of \"Star Wars\" fans when she appeared in a memorable metal bikini chained to the villainous Jabba the Hutt in \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi.\" \"What's funny is I wish I had known I was a sex symbol,\" she later told The New York Daily News. \"That's so odd. Because I don't think that way. I don't look at myself even remotely that way.\" Carrie Fisher on the set of \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\" directed by Welsh Richard Marquand. Sunset Boulevard / Corbis via Getty Images Fisher went on to appear in other movies, landing scene-stealing supporting roles in \"The Blue Brothers,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\" and \"The Burbs.\" Recently, Fisher played the annoying mother in a British TV comedy called \"Catastrophe\" that streams on Amazon. In 1987, Fisher published her first novel \"Postcards from the Edge,\" a semi-autobiographical book that drew on her real-life battles with drug addiction, bipolar disorder and her fraught relationship with her mother. It was a bestseller that was turned into a 1990 movie starring Meryl Streep and Shirley Maclaine. Fisher continued making movies and became one of Hollywood's most in-demand script doctors. She also found a new generation of fans with appearances on shows as varied as \"Entourage,\" \"30 Rock,\" and \"Sex and the City.\" She also was the voice of Peter Griffin's boss Angela on \"Family Guy.\" In 2014, Fisher confirmed that she was reuniting with Ford and Mark Hamill in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" Carrie Fisher on the set of \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" directed by Irvin Kershner. Sunset Boulevard / Corbis via Getty Images But after the movie came out, the actress was barraged with hateful tweets from body shamers who said she'd aged badly. Fisher fired right back at them. Two years later, Fisher released her tell-all book, that included her claim of an affair with Ford and the admission that she thought her days as Princess Leia were over. \"I was surprised. As surprised as you can be and still be so far over forty,\" she wrote. \"I mean, I thought they might make more Star Wars movies \u2014 not that I thought it all that much \u2014 but I doubted that I would find myself in them. And now it looked like I would! Hallelujah!\" Fisher was in a long-term relationship with musician Paul Simon and married to him for a year before they divorced in 1984. From 1991 to 1994, she was involved with talent agent Bryan Lourd \u2014 a relationship that produced her one child, actress Billie Lourd. She was also briefly engaged to comedian and actor Dan Aykroyd, whom she met on the set of \"The Blues Brothers.\" Funeral plans are not yet finalized. Andrew Blankstein ",

Under the terms of the deal secured by the U.S. Justice Department and announced Tuesday, prosecutors in Chicago and Columbus, Ohio, will not prosecute Redflex Traffic Systems if the company continues to cooperate with the two federal probes. In announcing the agreement, the Chicago U.S. attorney's office cited Redflex's \"extensive and thorough cooperation over recent years.\" The scandal, first reported by the Chicago Tribune, centered on then-city transportation official John Bills steering $100 million in contracts to Redflex in exchange for $2 million in bribes. As part of the nonprosecution agreement, Redflex will have to pay restitution to the city that will be determined as part of pending civil lawsuit City Hall brought against the company. The scheme helped grow the city's camera program to the largest in the nation. At its peak, 384 cameras were operating across the city, raking in more than $600 million in automated traffic fines. ",

During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 2,403 Americans were killed on Dec. 7, 1941. It also comes seven months after Obama became the first sitting American president to visit the Japanese memorial dedicated to the more than 200,000 people killed when American forces dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Other Japanese primer ministers have made the trek before in the years just after the war. Former leader Shigeru Yoshida went there just six years after the country's World War II surrender. Related: Thousands Pay Tribute at Pearl Harbor, 75 Years After Attack Yoshida signed the San Francisco peace treaty with the U.S. and others in 1951, allowing Japan back into international society after its war defeat. His Pearl Harbor visit, which he made on his way home from San Francisco, was largely eclipsed by the historic treaty.

Hugh Gentry / Reuters Former PM Nobusuke Kishi, Abe's grandfather, also made the trip in 1957. And Ichiro Hatoyama visited the year before. \"While not the first Japanese Prime Minister to visit the site of the infamous attack, Shinzo Abe's trip to Pearl Harbor ... is a meaningful measure in a much larger effort to enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance,\" Harry Kazianis, a director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington D.C. foreign policy think tank, said in a statement. There is also another important and more pragmatic reason for Japan and U.S. cooperation, Kazianis said, \" an increasingly aggressive China. \" Halimah Abdullah ",
