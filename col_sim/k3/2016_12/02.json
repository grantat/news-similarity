Bana al-Abed On Wednesday, al-Abed tweeted a direct appeal to President Obama and \"the world,\" begging for help to get her and her family \"far away from the battlefield.\" But it was the message shared late Thursday that sent ripples of shock and sadness through their online community of supporters.

    "text": "Not long after Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence departed for the airport and to another rally in Ohio to celebrate his victory, workers coming in for the night shift received a letter titled \u201cCompany Update on Indianapolis Operations.\u201d Photo \u201cIt sets a great tone,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview as he toured the Carrier factory after the announcement that 1,100 jobs would remain there. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is great for America.\u201d Credit A J Mast for The New York Times \u201cWhile this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with the expected completion by the end of 2017.\u201d United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent, saw the writing on the wall as soon as Mr. Trump declared victory last month. Offering to preserve jobs, even at the cost of some of the $65 million savings the company expected from the move, could serve its larger corporate interests. \u201cEvery penny counts, but if we step back and I\u2019m looking at earnings of $6.60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-elect listens to some of the company\u2019s bigger concerns,\u201d said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York. And Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, while providing a carrot through the state incentives and promises of future business tax cuts, held an implicit stick: the threat of pulling federal contracts from Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies. Mr. Trump and his team were well aware that the amount United Technologies stood to lose in those contracts dwarfed the savings from moving some of its operations to Monterrey from Indiana. Despite only accomplishing half of what had been promised in the campaign, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence predicted that the number of jobs ultimately preserved could rise as Carrier follows through on its promise to invest more than $16 million in the state. That provision, plus the incentives, were worked out between Carrier and officials from the state of Indiana\u2019s economic development office, with Mr. Pence overseeing the process. Trump and the Carrier Factory In February, Carrier told its workers in Indiana that it would move 1,400 jobs making furnaces and heating equipment to Mexico. Donald J. Trump, then a candidate, seized on the issue and made the planned move a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade. The vice president-elect insisted that the incentives did not represent a giveaway on Mr. Trump\u2019s part, and claimed United Technologies had turned down a similar-size package of breaks in March. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What made the difference, he said, was Mr. Trump\u2019s public pressure, as well his promise to cut corporate taxes and ease regulation. \u201cThese jobs were gone,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cI sat the executives down in my governor\u2019s office in the statehouse in early March. They said we aren\u2019t in a position to reconsider this in any way, shape or form.\u201d Mr. Trump, too, played down the role of the incentives. And he said he did not directly raise the $5 billion to $6 billion in federal contracts United Technologies receives, much of it from the Pentagon. But company officials are acutely aware that its Pratt & Whitney unit, among other things, supplies jet engines to the Air Force\u2019s most advanced fighter and many other planes, making it much more vulnerable to political pressure than other, lesser-known manufacturers that have been steadily closing shop in the Midwest and moving production south of the border. \u201cIt may have a played a role in their equation,\u201d Mr. Trump allowed. \u201cI never mentioned it. I didn\u2019t feel I had to.\u201d What about the fact that Mr. Trump frequently sourced products for his properties overseas, along with some popular Trump-branded merchandise? Will he lead by example and buy more goods made in the U.S.A.? \u201cI buy thousands and thousands of TVs,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to, but they essentially don\u2019t make them in the U.S. You know the hats I do? It took us forever to find a company that can make a hat in the U.S.\u201d ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Matt Zapotosky December 1 at 4:46 PM Follow @mattzap Donald Trump, on the campaign trail, would occasionally compare the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information with the case of former CIA director David Petraeus. In Trump\u2019s view, Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information, was pursued unfairly, while Clinton deserved to be treated more harshly. \u201cThe system is rigged,\u201d Trump tweeted after the FBI recommended that Clinton not be charged. \u201cGeneral Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.\u201d That assessment has long irked Clinton supporters and even the FBI \u2014 which feels that Petraeus\u2019s case was a clear-cut example of criminal wrongdoing with aggravating factors, while Clinton\u2019s was not. Now, Petraeus is under consideration for a job in Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 possibly even as secretary of state, the job Clinton used to hold. Petraeus and Trump met this week, and Trump wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cvery impressed!\u201d [ Unlike Petraeus and others, Clinton\u2019s case lacked malicious intent or other nefarious elements ] Retired Army general David Petraeus has emerged as a potential pick for secretary of state in the upcoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) If nominated to be secretary of state, Petraeus would have to undergo a potentially bruising confirmation hearing that would probably reexamine the lurid case that led to his conviction and dredge up old comparisons to Clinton. His and Clinton\u2019s cases both involve investigations of mishandling of classified information, but under dramatically different circumstances. Petraeus pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information, admitting that he gave sensitive materials to his former lover and biographer, Paula Broadwell. He was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $100,000. His probation includes several restrictions that could complicate his holding a Cabinet position \u2014 for instance, he must have work-related travel approved by the U.S. Probation Office, and he must submit to warrantless searches by his probation officer at any time. Petraeus\u2019s probation expires in April 2017, and Trump, upon taking office, could commute his sentence. Jeffrey H. Smith, an attorney for Petraeus, said that his client has made frequent international trips in the past 19\u00a0months, and all have been approved by the probation office. Smith said it would be \u201cpremature and wrong, in my judgment \u2014 simply because he admitted to this one mistake and was convicted of a federal misdemeanor \u2014 that he cannot serve as secretary of state.\u201d \u201cFrom his point of view, he admitted his mistake, he\u2019s paid the price, and the Senate and the country ought to view him in that regard,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe stood up and took his medicine, and given everything he\u2019s done for the country, and given the potential that he could be secretary of state and what he could bring to the table, he wants all that to be considered as a whole.\u201d [ The full probation conditions for David Petraeus ] Those involved in the Petraeus case at one point contemplated much more serious charges of lying to the FBI and violating a section of the Espionage Act. Officials have said the information contained in the eight notebooks Petraeus gave to Broadwell could have caused grave damage to national security, if disclosed. The information included war strategies and the identities of covert officers, the officials said. Petraeus also told agents that he had not provided classified information to Broadwell or facilitated her obtaining it, which FBI Director James B. Comey said was a lie. Smith said Petraeus realized soon after he gave the journals to Broadwell \u201cthat was a mistake,\u201d and he asked for them back. He said Broadwell had agreed that she would not use classified material in her book, and none was included. Smith also disputed that Petraeus intentionally misled investigators, saying that Petraeus \u201chad forgotten about the journals\u201d when the FBI asked him whether he gave Broadwell classified information. At a congressional hearing this year, Comey asserted forcefully that the Petraeus case was worthy of prosecution, while the Clinton case was not. He said the Petraeus case \u201cillustrates importantly the distinction\u201d with the Clinton matter. \u201cSo the question is, do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, \u2018got in trouble for far less,\u2019 end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?\u201d Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) asked the FBI director. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the reverse,\u201d Comey said. \u201cAnd what do you mean by that?\u201d Cummings said. \u201cHis conduct, to me, illustrates the categories of behavior that mark the prosecutions that are actually brought. Clearly intentional conduct. Knew what he was doing was a violation of the law. Huge amounts of information that \u2014 even if you couldn\u2019t prove he knew it \u2014 it raises the inference that he did it. An effort to obstruct justice. That combination of things makes it worthy of a prosecution, a misdemeanor prosecution, but a prosecution nonetheless.\u201d [ How David Petraeus avoided felony charges and possible prison time ] Smith declined to comment on the direct comparison of Petraeus\u2019s case and Clinton\u2019s. FBI agents investigated Clinton to determine whether classified information was mishandled because of her use of a private server while she was secretary of state. Comey said Clinton and her staffers were \u201cextremely careless\u201d in how they handled sensitive material, and there was \u201cevidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.\u201d But Comey said that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would actually bring a case against her. Classified material did traverse Clinton\u2019s private server. Information in 110 emails contained information sensitive enough to be classified at the time it was sent or received, and eight email chains included information properly classified as \u201ctop secret,\u201d the highest level of classification, Comey said. But Comey said agents could find no substantive evidence that Clinton intended to mishandle classified information, that she lied during her interview with agents, or that she made any efforts to obstruct justice. Clinton has said using the private server was a mistake and one she wishes she had not made. Comey did not fully clear Clinton of wrongdoing. Were an FBI employee to do what she did, Comey said, the employee might face professional consequences, such as a loss of a security clearance, suspension or even termination. But he said he did not feel she should be charged with a crime. Petraeus \u2014 a retired Army general and former CIA director who left the agency amid revelations about his relationship with Broadwell \u2014 would need a security clearance to serve as secretary of state. The CIA suspended his security clearance after his conviction and it remains suspended, U.S. officials said. A CIA spokesman declined to comment. Smith said that Petraeus does not hold a security clearance. A criminal conviction would not automatically preclude Petraeus from obtaining a clearance. He would have to pass a background check that assesses his \u201cstrength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and a willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information,\u201d according to information on the State Department\u2019s website . Whether to grant a clearance is a \u201cdiscretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel,\u201d according to the site. A State Department official said the department would \u201cnot speculate on prospects for that process.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Petraeus\u2019s lawyer.

Police dispatchers received a 911 call form a Mueller Park Junior High School teacher around 8:15 a.m. who stated that there was an individual in the school firing a weapon, according to Bountiful City Police Chief Tom Ross. The teen's parents had gone to the school to look for their son and arrived before the shot was fired, Ross said. After they heard the gun go off, they were able to find and disarm him, Ross said. An officer arrived on scene within two minutes of the initial 911 call, and the teen was then taken into custody. Active Shooter at Muller Park Jr. Suspect in custody, no injuries reported. Officers conducting clear of school now. \u2014 BountifulCityPD (@bountifulcityPD) December 1, 2016 Police said the teen entered a classroom with 26 students and fired a shot to the ceiling. He did not speak to anyone in that instance, they said. A shotgun and a handgun were recovered from the scene, as well as additional ammunition, police said. It is unclear which weapon was discharged. The teen's parents went to the school because they were \"worried\" about their son and were \"concerned that there were weapons missing from the home,\" Ross said. Police said that they also believed their son had been acting strangely. Someone had also tried to talk him out of carrying out the act, police said. A motive is not known at this time. No others were involved in the ordeal, and the it is unclear if there were any targets, police said. The teen is being held in a juvenile detention center. No charges have been filed as of yet. ",

Fernando Avila kneels at a makeshift memorial for Charly Leundeu Keunang a day after the 43-year-old was shot and killed by LAPD officers on skid row in 2015. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Kate Mather Contact Reporter Prosecutors have concluded that Los Angeles police officers were legally justified in shooting a homeless man last year on skid row, a videotaped killing that attracted international attention and renewed the local debate over interactions between police and L.A.\u2019s homeless population. The district attorney\u2019s office found\u00a0that the officers \u2014 Sgt. Chand Syed and Officers Francisco Martinez and Daniel Torres \u2014\u00a0reasonably believed Charly Leundeu Keunang posed a lethal threat during the March 1, 2015 shooting. Their decision was outlined in a 22-page memo obtained by The Times on Thursday. Prosecutors said video from a body camera worn by the sergeant\u00a0showed that\u00a0Keunang had wrapped his fingers around the butt of\u00a0a rookie officer\u2019s holstered gun while wrestling with police, saying he was \u201crapidly gaining control\u201d of the weapon.\u00a0Even if he didn\u2019t have complete control of the gun, they wrote, it could have easily fired as the struggle continued. The officers \u201cacted lawfully in self-defense and in defense of others,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the Nov. 9\u00a0memo explaining why they were not charging the officers. \u201cKeunang posed a high likelihood of killing officers and civilians at the very instant that he was shot.\u201d Read: Prosecutors explain why they won\u2019t charge LAPD officers in skid row shooting Open link It is rare for prosecutors to charge law enforcement officers in connection with on-duty shootings. The L.A. County district attorney\u2019s office hasn\u2019t pursued charges in such a case\u00a0 since 2000 . The death of Keunang, a 43-year-old Cameroonian national known on skid\u00a0row\u00a0as \u201cAfrica,\u201d was seen around the world after\u00a0a bystander posted video of the shooting on Facebook, drawing millions of views. The recording\u00a0shows police struggling with Keunang on the ground before at least five gunshots echo loudly. The shooting underscored the challenges police face when patrolling the sprawling tent encampments of skid row, where mental illness and drug use are common. It also renewed\u00a0complaints among those who live on skid row and their advocates, who have long accused police of too quickly resorting to heavy-handed tactics. Nevertheless, after reviewing the video and other evidence, the Police Commission decided earlier this year that the officers did not violate the LAPD\u2019s rules for using deadly force. The panel did, however, fault the rookie cop \u2014 Joshua Volasgis \u2014 for failing to maintain control of his gun and baton. The events leading up to Keunang\u2019s death began when someone called 911 and reported an attempted robbery and assault along South San Pedro Street, authorities said. There, the caller identified Keunang as the suspect, telling officers he had also threatened him with a baseball bat. Keunang became aggressive during the encounter, according to reports from the LAPD\u2019s chief and inspector general made public earlier this year. He clenched his fists and raised his voice, ignoring commands from officers and repeating, \u201cLet me express myself.\u201d The officers repeatedly warned Keunang he would be Tased if he did not calm down, the reports said. At one point, Keunang walked back into his tent. Two sergeants pulled the tent open as Keunang grabbed a cellphone from inside. One officer then used a Taser, the reports said, but it didn't appear to have an effect. Instead, Keunang charged an officer and began swinging his arms, the reports said. One officer punched Keunang in the face, and he was taken to the ground. A Taser was used on Keunang  again. At some point, the rookie officer said, he felt Keunang grab his holstered pistol. \u201cHe's got my gun,\u201d the officer yelled. \u201cMy gun, he's got my gun.\u201d Keunang was stuck by gunfire six times, according to his autopsy report. His family has filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the officers, accusing police of using excessive force.

By Dan Lamothe December 1 at 7:52 PM Follow @danlamothe President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis to be secretary of defense, according to people familiar with the decision, selecting a former senior military officer who has said that responding to \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d is the major security issue facing the United States. Mattis, who retired as chief of U.S. Central Command in 2013, has often said that Washington lacks an overall strategy in the Middle East, opting to instead handle issues in an ineffective one-by-one manner. \u201cIs political Islam in the best interest of the United States?\u201d Mattis said at the Heritage Foundation in 2015, speaking about the separate challenges of the Islamic State and Iranian-backed terrorism. \u201cI suggest the answer is no, but we need to have the discussion. If we won\u2019t even ask the question, how do we even recognize which is our side in a fight?\u201d To take the job, Mattis will need Congress to pass new legislation to bypass a federal law stating that defense secretaries must not have been on active duty in the previous seven years. Congress has granted a similar exception just once, when Gen. George C. Marshall was appointed to the job in 1950. An announcement is likely by early next week, according to the people familiar with the choice. Jason Miller, a spokesman with the Trump transition team, tweeted Thursday evening that no decision had been made. Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr., meanwhile, retweeted a report saying that Mattis got the job. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet The retired general, contacted Thursday evening by The Washington Post, said only, \u201cI\u2019m remaining silent.\u201d [ How Trump Mattis as Pentagon chief would break with 65 years of history ] Mattis, 66, served more than four decades in the Marine Corps and is known as one of the most influential military leaders of his generation, serving as a strategic thinker while occasionally drawing rebukes for his aggressive talk. Since retiring, he has served as a consultant and as a visiting fellow with the Hoover Institution, a think tank at Stanford University. Like Trump, Mattis favors a tougher stance against U.S. adversaries abroad, especially Iran. The general, speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in April, said that while security discussions often focus on terrorist groups such as the Islamic State or al-Qaeda, the Iranian regime is \u201cthe single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.\u201d [ What Trump may not know about the generals he\u2019s eyeing for top positions ] Mattis said the next president \u201cis going to inherit a mess\u201d and argued that the nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration last year may slow Iran\u2019s ambitions to get a nuclear weapon but will not stop them. But he added that \u201cabsent a clear and present violation,\u201d he did not see a way that Washington could go back on it, because any unilateral sanctions issued by the United States would not be as valuable if allies were not on board. \u201cIn terms of strengthening America\u2019s global standing among European and Middle Eastern nations alike, the sense is that America has become somewhat irrelevant in the Middle East, and we certainly have the least influence in 40 years,\u201d Mattis said. President-elect Donald Trump walks out with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis after a meeting at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Nov. 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) But Mattis may break with Trump\u2019s practice of calling out allies for not doing enough to build stability. Mattis served from November 2007 to August 2010 as the supreme allied commander of transformation for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, focused on improving the military effectiveness of allies. Trump called NATO \u201cobsolete\u201d earlier this year before saying later that he was \u201call for NATO\u201d but wanted all members to spend at least 2\u00a0percent of their gross domestic product on defense, a NATO goal. \u201cThe president-elect is smart to think about putting someone as respected as Jim Mattis in this role,\u201d said a former senior Pentagon official. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior, scholar and straight shooter \u2014 literally and figuratively. He speaks truth to everyone and would certainly speak truth to this new commander in chief.\u201d [ Trump is surrounding himself with generals. That\u2019s dangerous. ] But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump\u2019s personnel choices, said: \u201cIf there\u2019s any concern at all, it\u2019s the principle of civilian control over the military. This role was never intended to be a kind of Joint Chiefs of Staff on steroids, and that\u2019s the biggest single risk tied to Mattis. For Mattis, the biggest risk for him personally is that he will have a national security adviser in the form of Mike Flynn whose management style and extreme views may arch Mattis\u2019s eyebrows and cause conflict over time. It\u2019s no fun to be secretary of defense if you have to constantly feud with the White House.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] Mattis, whose nicknames include \u201cMad Dog\u201d and the \u201cWarrior Monk,\u201d has had a leading hand in some of the U.S. military\u2019s most significant operations in the past 20 years. As a one-star general, he led an amphibious task force of Marines that carried out a November 2001 raid in helicopters on Afghanistan\u2019s Kandahar province, giving the Pentagon a new foothold against the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Using the call sign \u201cChaos,\u201d he commanded a division of Marines during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and returned there the following year to lead Marines in bloody street fighting in the city of Fallujah. Mattis continued to rise through the ranks and establish his credentials as a military thinker, co-authoring the U.S. military\u2019s new counterinsurgency manual with then-Army Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus while Mattis was a three-star general at Quantico, Va. He was considered a leading contender to become commandant of the Marine Corps in 2010 but was bypassed in favor of Gen. James F. Amos. Instead, Mattis replaced Petraeus as the chief of Central Command, overseeing U.S. military operations across the Middle East. Even though Central Command did not encompass Israel, Mattis made a concerted effort to reach out to his Israeli military counterparts, according to Steven Simon, who worked with Mattis when he served on Obama\u2019s National Security Council. Simon, who now teaches at Amherst College, said Mattis made frequent stops in Israel during trips to the region, part of an effort to encourage the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors to work together to counter Iranian influence. \u201cThey respected Mattis because they saw him as a straight shooter and a good listener,\u201d Simon said of the Israelis and Arabs. The general retired from that position in 2013, about five months earlier than expected, prompting speculation that he was forced out after clashing with some in the Obama administration on Iran policy. U.S. officials denied that was the case at the time, and Mattis declined to comment. [ Trump signals intent to keep hard-line positions with national security picks ] Mattis occasionally has come under scrutiny for impolitic remarks. Most notably, he said in 2005 during a panel discussion in San Diego that \u201cit\u2019s fun to shoot some people\u201d and \u201cI like brawling,\u201d drawing criticism from the Marine commandant at the time, Gen. Michael Hagee. But Hagee also later backed Mattis, saying the general often spoke with candor to reflect the horrors of war. Other supporters noted that he often stressed to his troops that it was important to treat civilians in a combat zone with care. It is unclear whether the legislation required to make Mattis the Pentagon chief will be difficult to obtain from Congress. A 1947 national security law said that a general must wait 10 years from leaving active duty before becoming defense secretary. An exception was granted on a one-time basis for Marshall, with lawmakers saying in special legislation at the time that it was the \u201csense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of Secretary of Defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.\u201d The 10-year period was reduced to seven years in 2008 for several senior civilian defense positions, including defense secretary. Congress could follow the model set by Marshall\u2019s nomination to similarly waive restrictions for Mattis, and leaders may try to vote on legislation paving the way for Mattis\u2019s nomination early next year, before Trump formally takes office. In years past, Senate committees have also held confirmation hearings for Cabinet secretaries before incoming presidents deliver their formal nominations following inauguration.

Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration.  (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 683308689 ORIG FILE ID: 624448490 (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) James Mattis, a retired four-star general, achieved almost mythic status within the Marine Corps as an aggressive combat commander and innovative strategist whose speeches and writings defined the warrior ethos for the latest generation of military men and women. Donald Trump\u2019s reported decision to name Mattis to head the Defense Department would be a strong signal that the president-elect is looking for a wartime leader at the Pentagon and not someone to just manage budgets. Several media outlets reported Thursday that\u00a0Trump has selected Mattis, though the Trump campaign has denied that a decision has been made. During the campaign, Trump said he would overhaul the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State. Trump has said\u00a0the current plan isn\u2019t working and suggested\u00a0some military leaders had been cowed by the Obama administration. \u201cYou could easily imagine that Trump believes the advice of generals has been muted and diluted,\u201d said Gregory Newbold, a retired Marine lieutenant general and friend of Mattis. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for somebody who is the antidote to that. You certainly get that in Jim Mattis.\u201d Reports: Trump picks Mattis for Defense secretary If confirmed by the Senate, Mattis would be a departure from previous Defense secretaries\u00a0who have come from the ranks of civilian government service or politics. He would replace Ash Carter, a physicist who rose through the ranks of the Defense Department. Mattis\u2019 appointment as Defense secretary would require\u00a0a congressional waiver\u00a0because federal law requires a seven-year gap between retirement from the military and assuming the Cabinet post, a statute designed to safeguard the principle of civilian control over the military. The last retired general to head the Defense Department was George Marshall in 1950. Mattis interview: Syria would fall without Iran's help Mattis, 66, retired in 2013 after 44 years in the Marine Corps. He led an infantry battalion in the Persian Gulf War in 1990-91 and commanded a task force that struck deep into Afghanistan after the 9/11\u00a0attacks. In 2003, he led a division that raced across the desert toward Baghdad in the initial assault into Iraq. His call sign was \u201cchaos.\u201d On and off the battlefield, Mattis developed a reputation as a blunt speaker whose language sometimes harkened to an earlier time, capturing the ethos of being a warrior. He avoids military jargon like exit strategy and instead speaks unapologetically about \"victory,\" \"ferocity\" and \"slaughtering\" the enemy. He sprinkles his talk with historic references, often reaching back to the ancient Romans and Greeks. When he was preparing his troops to head into Iraq, he cited an epitaph from Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla to explain counterinsurgency to his troops: \"No better friend, no worse enemy.\" \"There was always a sense that we had to put things into words that would touch our troops' hearts \u2014 not just their heads,\u201d Mattis said in a 2013 interview with USA TODAY. Speaking to newly minted infantry officers at the Marine base in Quantico, Va.,\u00a0several years ago, he described the affection that leaders feel for their troops and the need to maintain authority despite those emotions.\u00a0He worked in references to Little Big Horn and Valley Forge. He left no room for doubt about their role if they find themselves at war with America's enemies. \"You are to annihilate them,\" he said.\u00a0\"You are to make them recoil back and say, 'We don\u2019t ever want to take on the U.S. Marines.'\" Those who have worked with him say he is more than a battle commander.\u00a0As head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East,\u00a0he traveled the region, cultivating ties with foreign military leaders and helping shape strategy in the area. \"I know he has this reputation as a\u00a0'war fighter,'\u00a0and it certainly is earned, but he really is a clear, precise strategic thinker, more so than any man I have ever worked for,\" said Jim Howcroft, a retired Marine officer who served as Mattis' intelligence officer during the Iraq invasion in 2003. Since retiring, Mattis has lamented the lack of strategy in Washington. Testifying before Congress last year, he said the United States should \u201ccome out from our reactive crouch and take a firm, strategic stance in defense of our values.\u201d Strategy is often defined as an overarching set of principles and goals that guide policy decisions. In 2013, Mattis left his position as head of Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East, amid reports the White House squeezed him out. Asked about the reports at the time, Mattis said he provided the unvarnished truth to his civilian leadership. \"The idea that you should moderate it before you give it to them is not showing respect to your civilian leadership,\" Mattis said at the time. As Pentagon chief Mattis would also guide the military\u2019s personnel policies, possibly wading into the controversial order by the Obama administration to open\u00a0all military jobs to women, including the infantry and special operations. The Marine Corps had asked for an exemption for its infantry units, following a study that showed mixed-gender infantry squads did not perform as well as all-male units. Carter denied the exemption request, and the Marine Corps is taking steps to open the infantry to women. Trump\u00a0during the campaign derided \u201cpolitically correct\u201d military personnel policies, though he has not said whether he would change it. Mattis has also not publicly stated his position on opening the jobs to women, but he has said the decision should be based on what impact it would have on combat effectiveness. He has talked about what makes jobs like the infantry distinct. \u201cThere is a great difference between military service in dangerous circumstances and serving in a combat unit whose role is to search out, close with and kill the enemy at close quarters,\u201d Mattis testified last year before Congress. 1531 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gRg3wK ",

(Illinois State Police) Warning: graphic content. Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect, struck Illinois State Trooper Michael Cokins on Sept. 6, 2014. Cokins, who was conducting a traffic stop along I-294 near Elmhurst when he was hit, suffered 15 broken bones and had eight surgeries. On Dec. 1, 2016, Thurow, who previously pleaded guilty to aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, was sentenced to 13 years in prison. (Illinois State Police) Ted Gregory Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A chronic drunken driver who struck and nearly killed an Illinois state trooper in 2014 on Interstate 294 was sentenced to 13 years in prison Thursday after pleading guilty to aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries. Leslie Thurow wept through much of the hourlong hearing at the Maywood courthouse. Guidelines requiring her to serve a specified percentage of her sentence mean the Park Ridge woman likely will end up serving nine years in prison. \"My thing with this is I don't want to see her hurt anybody else again,\" Trooper Michael Cokins, 30, said of the sentence. \"Hopefully nine years prevents her from killing someone else or herself. She obviously has no regard for human life.\" A crying Thurow, 61, said she was \"truly sorry\" for striking Cokins about 2:45 p.m. Sept. 6, 2014, when he had stopped a motorist on the northbound Tri-State shoulder near Elmhurst. The trooper broke his shoulder blade, vertebrae, arm, leg, ankle, ribs and knees, among other injuries. He was confined to a wheelchair for three months, then crutches for five more months. Leslie Thurow Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect. Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect. (Cook County sheriff's office) \"I didn't do everything I should have done to help myself,\" Thurow added. \"I pray for you every day.\" Law enforcement records show that the 2014 incident was Thurow's third drunken driving crash in nine months. Two days before striking Cokins, Thurow was released on probation for a May DUI arrest in Brookfield. After striking Cokins, Thurow continued driving north on I-294, hitting a retaining wall. That failed to stop her. Two miles farther along the interstate, she struck an SUV with seven occupants, including a 3-year-old boy.

    "text": "Email PITTSBURGH -- A Pittsburgh-area high school principal has been placed on administrative leave after a recording surfaced of him allegedly berating a student, CBS Pittsburgh reports .\u00a0 On Wednesday, Woodland Hills Superintendent Alan Johnson confirmed that Kevin Murray was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. The 14-year-old student said the principal often harasses him and allegedly speaks to him in a threatening manner and uses expletives. On one occasion, the teen recorded it. That recording was made back in April, while the boy was being reprimanded for a previous incident. During the incident, the principal is allegedly caught on the recording saying among other things, \u201cI\u2019m going to [expletive] punch you in the face. Man-to-man, bro. I don\u2019t care if you are [expletive] 14 years old or not. I will punch you in your face, and when we go down to court, it\u2019s your word against mine, and mine wins every time.\u201d \u201cObviously, what I heard there is not something that we would condone as a school district,\u201d Johnson said. According to the family\u2019s attorney, Todd Hollis, there were several other incidents involving the boy and Murray. Hollis says the threats and harassment have gone on throughout the school year against the \u201cspecial education\u201d student. \u201cThe cultural problem at Woodland Hills has to be changed, and I don\u2019t think that simply placing the principal on administrative leave is going to change that,\u201d said Hollis. But Johnson says it\u2019s standard to place an employee on paid leave during an investigation. Hollis isn\u2019t happy. \u201cI am getting calls from parents, educators, even some police officers who are saying to me this behavior is not unusual and it seems apparent to me that the superintendent is aware of it,\u201d said Hollis. \u201cBeing on paid administrative leave isn\u2019t termination, it\u2019s a vacation. That\u2019s not enough.\u201d Hollis says his client remains in school. \u201cThe child is in school, but the child was apparently being harassed by some teachers in the school and ran to his counselors office today,\u201d Hollis said. He is urging others to come forward. \u201cI am reaching out to every parent that is aware of this. Call my office, get in touch with me, email, Facebook, I will be happy to address the problem,\u201d Hollis said. He says he has not had a sit-down meeting with the superintendent yet. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print In a recent interview in that reprehensible wad of trash called Rolling Stone, President Obama pinpointed why the Democrats lost the election. He blamed it on Fox News. He initially blamed his own party for its inability to connect with voters, but then he couldn't help himself. He did what he's done in the past when faced with denial or defeat: He targeted my place of employment. 8 Years Later: The #1 name in news, still giving Mr. Obama the blues? #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/uuHOMhw5xm \u2014 Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) December 1, 2016 Yes, his party sucks for losing, he says. But then he adds: \u201cPart of it is Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country.\u201d So, where to begin? \u00a0 First, let's call BS on this observation. If Barack Obama actually traveled the United States, he'd laugh at his own words. It's true that \"big chunks\" watch Fox News, but they don't have it on in their bars and restaurants, because those who are not leftists are usually not outwardly political. They have no desire to enforce their views on you.\u00a0 And perhaps they're used to keeping their views to themselves because people like Obama often mock them for having them. Trump's outgoingness may have changed this, but for the most part, the average non-liberal would rather talk pets than politics. President Obama is a victim of the very disease that he accuses others of having: divisideria. In the Rolling Stone interview, he accuses Fox News and others of lying to foment division. That\u2019s ironic, given that he's saying these things in Rolling Stone, the rag that peddled a massive lie (the UVA rape hoax) that ruined lives, and the same rag that put the Boston Bomber in heroic pose on its cover. You can't get a better mix of deceit and divisiveness than that. For the left, it's always been the reverse. For them, the personal is always political, and they have no choice but to infect every arena in life with their strident opinions. Whether it's in the work cafeteria, at Thanksgiving dinner or at a play date with assorted brats \u2026 if you're a strong, dedicated progressive, every moment in life is simply an opportunity for proclaiming evidence of your heroic, sensitive belief system.\u00a0 Those of us who aren't liberals have no such reflex. When I'm among friends or strangers and politics comes up, I generally find a way to subvert or deviate from debate. I tell a joke. I say something stupid. I comment on my assorted body aches. It's essentially what I do on The Five. True, as you enter the political season, this changes. People talked more politics in the back half of 2016, because that's when this subject's Super Bowl hits. People were talking Trump, because it was no different from talking about the next heavyweight champion, or a leading NASCAR driver. It's not political, it's just the season for it. It\u2019s a topic for friendly or pointless conversation to pass time while ordering a sandwich. But because Obama is a progressive, and because he\u2019s surrounded by progressives, he projects their sense of political urgency and identity onto his political adversaries. He assumes we're all just like him, only in reverse. But we aren't, and he can't see it, because he is a victim of the very disease that he accuses others of having: divisideria. In the Rolling Stone interview, he accuses Fox News and others of lying to foment division. That\u2019s ironic, given that he's saying these things in Rolling Stone, the rag that peddled a massive lie (the UVA rape hoax) that ruined lives, and the same rag that put the Boston Bomber in heroic pose on its cover. You can't get a better mix of deceit and divisiveness than that. The bottom line: The division began decades ago, when the left made politics a measure of your morality. (It\u2019s no surprise it sprang up when Rolling Stone did, too.). If you weren't like them, you were immoral. You were not simply wrong, as the saying goes, you were evil \u2014 a point made often by Charles Krauthammer and Dennis Prager. This began after World War II, when young Americans had the time to turn politics into an all-consuming hobby of emotional activity.\u00a0 No one on the right ever pulled this kind of stuff on the left. True, some held on to bad ideas, but some on the left did, too. We just assumed they were wrong. They saw us as damned. Or as Hillary said, irredeemable. That paved the way for her excruciating loss. You can't win over people you just sentenced to a life of being deplorable. This narrow, highly destructive sensibility exists still, even after Trump's beatdown. Comedians, singers and assorted talking heads continue to crap on Trump voters, reducing them to some braying, mindless, bigoted mob. But the more they do this, the more Trump supporters they create. Their simplistic, single-minded arrogance reveals the debilitating irrelevance they feel when the country no longer listens to their whine. Oh, yes \u2026 in the good old days, it used to be that you could call someone a bigot, a sexist or simply evil \u2014 and it mattered. But the left called it all too much, abusing their power, so it's no longer believable. It's as if a superhero had only one single gift (call it \"bigot-smearing\"), and Trump arrived with the kryptonite.\u00a0 So you're left with a President Obama \u2014 a smart, gifted man \u2014 ending his tenure bitterly chatting to a pathetic, marginal magazine about a network he believes gave the country President-elect Trump. He's lost the plot. All Trump did was galvanize and organize a group of people tired of being villain-shamed by the arrogant and the elite. The fact that this group happened to watch Fox News is simply a correlation, not a cause.\u00a0 But by blaming Fox News, it at least helps the outgoing president achieve one thing: not having to blame himself.

    "text": "Trump, Pence tour Carrier plant to tout job-saving deal Published               December 01, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump touched down in wingman Mike Pence's home state Thursday to take a bow for their dramatic, job-saving deal with Carrier air conditioning. The stop, in the state Vice President-elect Pence still serves as governor, came amid a \"thank you\" tour of the Midwestern states that helped propel their ticket to victory. \"I will tell you that United Technologies and Carrier stepped up, and now they're keeping over 1,100 people,\" Trump said. \"It's so great.\" Trump said he got involved after seeing a report on Carrier's announcement it would leave for Mexico. Trump said he was moved by a Carrier employee and Trump supporter who promised his co-workers that Trump wouldn't let the company leave. \"It's because of that guy,\" Trump said, scanning the assembled throng and explaining how he reached out to the company's top brass. \"Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,\" Trump thundered, before tempering the threat with pledges for deregulation and lower taxes. \"We're going to do great things for businesses,\" Trump said. \"There's no reason for them to leave anymore.\" Before Trump spoke, Pence told his fellow Hoosiers they had cause to celebrate. \"It\u2019s a great day for working people all across the U.S.A.,\" Pence said, speaking before Trump. \"The State of Indiana is proud. \"Since the 1950s, Carrier has been a part of Indiana\u2019s success story, and thanks to our president-elect, Carrier has decided to stay and grow right here in Indiana. We are so grateful.\" Trump and Pence were at the factory on the west side of Indianapolis, where they toured the facility they helped keep in the U.S., thanks in part to a $7 million tax break from the Hoosier State. In February, the heating and air conditioning company said that it would shutter the plant and send jobs to Mexico, and video of angry workers being informed about the decision soon went viral. \u201cBig day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks, Carrier,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday. Trump threatened to impose sharp tariffs on any company that shifted its factories to Mexico. And his advisers have since promoted lower corporate tax rates as a means of keeping jobs in the U.S. By enabling the plant to stay open, the deal spares about 800 union workers whose jobs were going to be outsourced to Mexico, according to federal officials who were briefed by the company. This suggests that hundreds will still lose their jobs at the factory, where roughly 1,400 workers were slated to be laid off. Also, neither Trump nor Carrier has yet to say what the workers might have to give up or precisely what threats or incentives were used to get the manufacturer to change its mind. The company attributed its decision to the incoming Trump administration and financial incentives provided by Indiana, which is something of a reversal, since earlier offers from the state had failed to sway Carrier from decamping to Mexico. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is possible because the incoming Trump-Pence administration has emphasized to us its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate,\u201d the company said in a statement released Wednesday. Trump will later hold a campaign-style rally in Cincinnati, the first of several stops on the \u201cUSA Thank You Tour 2016\u201d planned this month to revisit the states that helped him capture the White House. Trump, who has long spoken of feeding off the energy of his raucous crowds, first floated the idea of a victory tour just days after winning the election, only to instead prioritize filling some of his Cabinet positions.

Mattis to head the Defense Department. This decision fills a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Gen. James N. Mattis to head the Defense Department. This decision fills a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. W.J. Hennigan Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump has chosen James N. Mattis,\u00a0a highly respected retired Marine four-star general, to head the Defense Department , filling in a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. Mattis served 44 years in the Marine Corps before he retired in 2013. He headed U.S. Central Command in his final three years and oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as other military operations in the Middle East. Trump announced his pick Thursday night at a rally in Cincinnati, urging his supporters to keep the news quiet. \"We're not announcing it until Monday so don't tell anybody,\" he joked. He compared Mattis to Gen. George Patton, the legendary front-line general who helped liberate Europe in World War II. \u00a0\u00a0 Unmarried all his life, Mattis, 66, was known as a hard-charging but scholarly figure who issued heavy reading lists to his subordinates and who carried \u201cMeditations\u201d by Marcus Aurelius on his deployments. In speeches, he was as likely to quote from Shakespeare or an ancient Greek poet as from\u00a0traditional military strategists Carl von Clausewitz or\u00a0Sun Tzu. His nicknames included \u201cMad Dog\u201d and \u201cWarrior Monk.\u201d White House with\u00a0such\u00a0wealthy\u00a0individuals\u00a0that his Cabinet\u00a0was mockingly referred to as \"nine millionaires and a plumber.\"\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is about\u00a0to\u00a0do him one better.\u00a0 Trump won the election\u00a0by appealing to America's disaffected working... Dwight Eisenhower surrounded himself\u00a0in\u00a0the White House with\u00a0such\u00a0wealthy\u00a0individuals\u00a0that his Cabinet\u00a0was mockingly referred to as \"nine millionaires and a plumber.\"\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is about\u00a0to\u00a0do him one better.\u00a0 Trump won the election\u00a0by appealing to America's disaffected working... (Don Lee) \u201cHe is the combination of strategic thinker and successful operator at all levels of warfare,\u201d said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Arnold Punaro and author of \u201cOn War and Politics: The Battlefield Inside Washington's Beltway.\u201d \u201cHis entire life has been learning about and implementing a strong national defense.\u201d The GOP-led Congress would need to grant Mattis a waiver to confirm him as head of the Pentagon because he has not been out of uniform for seven years. The limit was set under a law intended to maintain civilian control of the military. Winning a waiver\u00a0shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Mattis has powerful backers in Congress, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who chairs the Armed Services Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the confirmation process. \u201cGen.\u00a0Mattis is one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops,\u201d McCain said after Mattis first emerged as a candidate. Mattis clashed with White House aides before he retired over the Obama administration\u2019s outreach to Iran, which he considered unwise. He was openly critical of the Iran nuclear deal that was signed after he left the military. Mattis shares a deep distrust of Iran with Trump and Michael Flynn, a retired Army general who Trump has named as White House national security advisor. During the campaign, Trump called for ripping up or revising the nuclear deal. \u201cAmong all the issues facing us in the Middle East, I think Iran is actually foremost,\u201d Mattis said in April at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank\u00a0in Washington. \u201cAnd yet at the same time, it appears here in Washington that we've forgotten how to keep certain issues foremost.\u201d But more recently Mattis has said that it\u2019s too late to rip up the Iran deal because it\u2019s being implemented by the world powers who negotiated it with Tehran: the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. Whether he and Trump share the same world view in other areas is unclear. Trump pledged during the campaign to scale back America\u2019s military involvement around the globe; Mattis has always espoused a muscular role to advance U.S. interests overseas. Mattis has embraced diplomatic efforts to craft a two-state solution in Israel, backed Obama administration efforts to provide weapons to Syrian rebels, and he supports the NATO military alliance, all issues where he and Trump may disagree. \u201cWe need to stay engaged in the world and resist isolationism,\u201d Mattis\u00a0said in August in a speech at Washington State University. Mattis already has had an impact on Trump's thinking. In a recent interview with the New York Times, \u00a0the president-elect indicated he was reconsidering his calls for waterboarding terrorism suspects after talking to Mattis. \u201cHe said \u2014 I was surprised \u2014 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve never found it to be useful,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.\u2019 And I was very impressed by that answer.\u201d If confirmed, Mattis would oversee a Pentagon that is battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has lost ground to a renewed insurgency in Afghanistan, is grappling with Russian aggression in Ukraine and is facing a growing Chinese presence in the South China Sea. Trump has vowed to boost Pentagon spending for more soldiers, ships and aircraft, and in a video this week, said he would seek a new strategy for cyberdefense. A native of eastern Washington state, Mattis enlisted in the Marines in 1969 and was commissioned a second lieutenant through the ROTC program in 1972. He commanded an assault battalion during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He led the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the 1st Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. ",

    "text": "Email An unmanned Russian cargo spaceship heading to the International Space Station broke up in the atmosphere over Siberia on Thursday due to an unspecified malfunction, the Russian space agency said. The Progress MS-04 cargo craft broke up at an altitude of 190 kilometers (118 miles) over the remote Russian Tuva region in Siberia that borders Mongolia, Roscosmos said in a statement. It said most of spaceship's debris burnt up as it entered the atmosphere but some fell to Earth over what it called an uninhabited area. Local people reported seeing a flash of light and hearing a loud thud west of the regional capital of Kyzyl, more than 3,600 kilometers (2,200 miles) east of Moscow, the Tuva government was quoted as saying late Thursday by the Interfax news agency. The Progress cargo ship had lifted off as scheduled at 8:51 p.m. (1451 GMT) from Russia's space launch complex in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, to deliver 2.5 metric tons of fuel, water, food and other supplies. It was set to dock with the space station on Saturday. Roscosmos said the craft was operating normally before it stopped transmitting data 6 ? minutes after the launch. The Russian space agency would not immediately describe the malfunction, saying its experts were looking into it. This is the third botched launch of a Russian spacecraft in two years. A Progress cargo ship plunged into the Pacific Ocean in May 2015, and a Proton-M rocket carrying an advanced satellite broke up in the atmosphere in May 2014. But both Roscosmos and NASA said the crash of the ship would have no impact on the operations of the orbiting space lab that is currently home to a six-member crew, including three cosmonauts from Russia, two NASA astronauts and one from the European Union. Orbital ATK, NASA's other shipper, successfully sent up supplies to the space station in October, and a Japanese cargo spaceship is scheduled to launch a full load in mid-December. NASA supplier SpaceX , meanwhile, has been grounded since a rocket explosion in September on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company hopes to resume launches in December to deliver communication satellites. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This version corrects the spelling of the region to Tuva, not Tyva. \u2014\u2014 Aerospace Writer Marcia Dunn in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Joe McKnight rushed for more than 2,200 yards in his USC career. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Zach Helfand Contact Reporter Former USC running back Joe McKnight was shot and killed in Terrytown, La., a town outside New Orleans, on Thursday afternoon, according to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. The incident is being investigated as a possible road rage incident, said Colonel John Fortunato, a police spokesman. Fortunato said police have identified the suspect as Ronald Gasser, a 54-year-old white male, who remained on the scene and is being questioned by homicide detectives. According to a report by the NOLA.com, an eyewitness in Terrytown saw two men in an argument near an intersection. One man was yelling at a second man trying to apologize. The eyewitness said the man who had been yelling shot the second man multiple times, then said, \"I told you don't you f--- with me,\" before firing on the man again. Fortunato said the incident took place at 2:43 p.m. CST. McKnight, 28, committed to USC under then-coach Pete Carroll from River Ridge, La., as the next in the line of USC playmakers like Reggie Bush . He played at USC for three seasons before turning professional. McKnight amassed\u00a02,755 yards and 15 touchdowns rushing and receiving and another two touchdowns as a returner. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL draft by the New York Jets , where he spent three up-and-down seasons before moving to the Kansas City Chiefs and then the Miami Dolphins in 2013. A torn Achilles\u2019 tendon in 2014 ended his NFL career. In 2016, he played for the Edmonton Eskimos and Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. McKnight is the second NFL player this year to die as a result of a possible road-rage incident. Saints player Will Smith was killed in April.\u00a0 McKnight\u2019s relationship with USC was somewhat strained after he was not allowed to play in the final game of his junior season, in 2009, while USC investigated him for allegedly receiving improper benefits. He would leave USC soon afterward. USC\u2019s current and former players and coaches have reacted with notes of shock and sadness on social media. USC Coach Clay Helton posted, \"Saddens me to hear the news about Joe McKnight. Our prayers go out to the McKnight family.\" Brian Cushing , one of McKnight's USC teammates, wrote, in part, \"I'm absolutely crushed to hear the news today about you being gone. I'll never forget what you accomplished and how far you came as a player and a person.\" Bush said on Twitter, \"this one hurts bad.\u201d ",

But Barnett said the \u201cstateless\u201d category is most worrisome. \u201cThese could be Burmese Muslims, who have posed assimilation issues for every nation which has taken them,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous precedent which says, \u2018We\u2019ll take any ethnic group with which you don\u2019t get along.\u2019\u201d Australia has been under fire for paying poor surrounding island nations to house detention centers for refugees. Australia created the camps in an effort to curtail \u201cpeople smuggling\u201d and has long had a policy which prevents individuals seeking asylum from entering the country before being vetted. The Goodlatte-Grassley letter also asked why Australia and other countries refused to take in the refugees. \u201cIf they\u2019ve been vetted and deemed inadmissible, the U.S. can\u2019t say, \u2018You don\u2019t want them, so we\u2019ll take them,\u2019\u201d said Barnett. Speaking at a Nov. 14 press conference, Turnbull said, \u201cNobody is taking any more refugees, but what the Americans are doing is assisting these individuals on Nauru and Manus by bringing them in within their existing quota.\u201d The Obama administration increased the quota for the 12-month period that began in October to 110,000 refugees, up from 85,000 the previous year. Turnbull\u2019s announcement that his country would be \u201ctaking more refugees from Central America\u201d as part of some \u201ccommitments at President Obama's Refugee Summit\u201d has also sparked speculation that the deal is a trade of refugees from the most dangerous areas of the world for ones from Central America. In July, Costa Rica agreed to set up a detention center for those wishing to enter the United States through a new program the administration established initially for children to reunite with U.S. -based parents. The program has been expanded to include those fleeing gang violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. It also created a special category for female heads of households. \u201cAll you have to do is say is you\u2019re a single mother and you\u2019re in,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cThere is all sorts of twisting of the law here.\u201d A \u201cparticular social group,\u201d is one of the five categories applicants must meet to obtain refugee or asylum status. The designated group could be a religion, nationality, race or political group whose members have a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution for belonging. While U.S. law stipulates refugee status should not be granted based on generalized violence, according to officer training materials obtained by FoxNews.com, status can be considered for women heads of households who are vulnerable to crime, economic hardships or could be a victim of \u201cMachista,\u201d described in materials as a \u201ccultural pattern where men father children, [then] abandon [their] family.\u201d The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 146,000 individuals will apply to enter the U.S. through the Costa Rican Center. In a July 26, 2016 press release the State Department laid out the logistics in which after pre-screening and transfer to Costa Rica, \u201cthey will undergo refugee processing before being resettled to the United States or another third country.\u201d Representatives from the Grassley-Goodlatte committee are set to receive a classified briefing on the Australian refugee deal next week. However, numerous questions could remain shielded from public view including costs, timing, benefit to the U.S. and perhaps most importantly why it was done in secret. Advertisement ",

Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR The Tri-Pro Forest Products facility in Orofino, Idaho, closed in October after operators said they didn't have a steady enough supply of logs to keep the sawmill running and profitable. Kirk Siegler/NPR A few weeks before the election, the Tri-Pro lumber mill in north Idaho shut down . It was the second mill to close in the area in six months, putting more than a hundred people out of work. While that's big economic loss for any community, it was especially tough for the tight-knit town of Orofino and its 3,000 or so residents. \"It's going to be a struggle, quite honestly,\" says Mike Reggear, the supply manager and only employee left on the Tri-Pro payroll. The mill officially closed Oct. 4, after operating on the site in one incarnation or another for nearly 60 years. The shuttered lumberyard is now eerily quiet as Reggear ties up some loose ends; the old mill, kilns and saws are ready to be hauled out. \"There were living-wage jobs [with good benefits] that have now been lost,\" Reggear says, shaking his head. Enlarge this image Like most people in Clearwater County, where Orofino is located, Mike Reggear has spent his entire life working in the timber business. \"Clearwater County has taken a double shot to the nose,\" he says, following the closure of two mills that left more than a hundred people out of work.

Kirk Siegler/NPR The story behind Tri-Pro's closure is an all-too-familiar one lately in north Idaho: Reggear says there just wasn't a steady enough supply of logs available locally to keep the sawmill running and profitable. The amount of federal land open to logging has dwindled since the 1980s, and imports from Canada are cheaper. Article continues after sponsorship But just like any economic story in rural America today, it's more complicated than that. And even in Idaho's deeply conservative timber country, there are mixed feelings over whether President-elect Donald Trump can do much to turn things around. Changing Times Timber towns like Orofino, situated along railroad lines and rivers, were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when it seemed like there was a limitless supply of timber in the Northwest woods. The federal government \u2014 and specifically the U.S. Forest Service, run as an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 was in the business of actively promoting logging. Enlarge this image Timber mill towns like Orofino were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when the timber supply in national forests seemed limitless. Today many federal lands are closed to logging, and unemployment rates in these towns are among the highest in Idaho.

Today many federal lands are closed to logging, and unemployment rates in these towns are among the highest in Idaho. Kirk Siegler/NPR The environmental mood of the country is significantly different today. So is the economy \u2014 mechanization, for instance, has meant that fewer people are needed to log in the woods or work in the mills. At best, logging is a seasonal occupation, says Jerry Spencer, \"so you try to diversify a little bit \u2014 because you can't live on [work] eight months a year.\" One night over Coors Lights at the Ponderosa Restaurant, Spencer says he feels lucky he still can find work as an independent contractor, logging in the woods when he can. Spencer and one of his buddies had been splitting time between north Idaho and the oil fields in North Dakota and Wyoming, where they drove trucks. Then oil prices tanked. He's not too eager to talk politics, but Spencer says he's glad Donald Trump won. ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachs luminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E. Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican, in 2006. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father, Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm. While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broader financial community it is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s track record at hedge and private equity funds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, that makes him appealing. \u201cMnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers \u2014 Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak their language,\u201d said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. \u201cHe comes from a trading desk, and that\u2019s something that is very strong,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, added. While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of Wall Street, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years of experience managing people and organizations under their belt. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing of IndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in 2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions. After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted by protesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a small-business lender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain. Photo The president-elect with Todd Ricketts, another investor, who will be a deputy at Commerce. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted the deal. \u201cHe purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital,\u201d he said of Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan, were sued over their mother\u2019s early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, an investor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme . The lawsuit, filed by a trustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3.2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from his mother\u2019s account shortly after she died belonged to other victims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit. Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin. In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company Dune Entertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox. It was a successful partnership; Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune\u2019s money) like \u201cAvatar,\u201d which took in $2.8 billion worldwide in 2009. After breaking with Mr. Seelig in 2012, Mr. Mnuchin teamed up with a company called RatPac, owned by the rowdy filmmaker Brett Ratner and the Australian billionaire James Packer. Mr. Ratner was then notorious in Hollywood; he resigned as a producer of the Academy Awards in 2011 after using an anti-gay slur at a public event and making frank remarks about his sex life on Howard Stern\u2019s radio show. (He apologized .) But together the three men formed a vehicle to invest $450 million in an extensive array of Warner Bros. movies. Some have been major hits, like \u201cGravity,\u201d which took in $723.2 million. But there have also been money losers, including \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea.\u201d Still, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attending celebrity-filled parties at the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the Cannes Film Festival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50 jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo \u2014 playing a Merrill Lynch executive \u2014 in Warren Beatty\u2019s new movie \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners are decidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is Louise Linton, a 34-year-old actress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan real estate: Trump Tower for the president-elect and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin. But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin is described by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command a room. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professional acquaintances than close friends. The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates for Treasury, according to a fund manager close to the president-elect\u2019s economic brain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor who has been close to Mr. Trump for decades. Brooks Barnes and Neil Irwin contributed reporting.

James 'Mad Dog' Mattis as Secretary of Defense by Hans Nichols and Halimah Abdullah Share advertisement President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to head the Department of Defense, a move that could signal the incoming administration's tougher positioning with nations such as Iran. Trump made a surprise announcement of the expected appointment during a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday night, as the crowd cheered wildly. \"We are going to appoint Mad Dog Mattis as our secretary of defense,\" Trump said theatrically. He then added: \"But we're not announcing it 'til Monday, so don't tell anyone \u2014 Mad Dog. He's great. He is great.\" BREAKING: Trump announces James Mattis pick for Secretary of Defense during Cincinnati \"Thank You\" rally https://t.co/8g1P3El17G \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) December 2, 2016 Mattis, a tough talking retired Marine general nicknamed \" Mad Dog \" who during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 famously led the 1st Marine Division's rapid drive into Baghdad. Among his peers, Mattis has a reputation as a blunt military strategist. During a 2005 panel discussion in San Diego, Mattis once said that he enjoyed \"brawling\" and enjoyed killing the enemy in war. \"Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot,\" Mattis said. \"It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.\" Gen. Mattis testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 9, 2010. Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP Mattis, a former commander of U.S. Central Command, which covers the Middle East, is considered a hardliner on Iran. His confrontational style on the matter was frowned up by the Obama administration, U.S. officials told NBC News. He once accused \"the highest levels\" of the Iranian government of being involved in an assassination plot against the Saudi ambassador at a Washington, D.C. restaurant. James M. Mattis (2R), aboard the USS Peleliu in the Arabian Sea on 24 November 2001. JIM HOLLANDER / EPA \"On Iran, General Mattis takes a very hard line view,\" said James George \"Jim\" Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and the current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \"He would say we need to use hard power to prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon. He is also considered a \"warrior monk,\" who thinks deeply about military strategy. He once told his Marines \"The most important six inches on the battlefield is between your ears.\" Mattis' confirmation by the Senate is not assured. Only three years out of uniform, he would also need a Congressional waiver for a 1947 law that requires a seven year wait. Hans Nichols ",

Bruce Rauner's office during veto session at the state Capitol on Thursday. Speaker of the House Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, center, leaves Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's office during veto session at the state Capitol on Thursday. (Seth Perlman / AP) Privacy Policy The deep distrust between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who run the General Assembly boiled over Thursday on an unusual final day of the fall session that featured a testy veto message, a lawsuit against the governor and several lawmakers knocking off before the heavy lifting was done. And as legislators zoomed up interstates to get home, it was a massive energy bill that emerged as the major accomplishment. Republicans and Democrats united to raise electricity rates on Illinois residents and businesses to bail out a pair of Exelon's nuclear power plants. On average it'll cost ComEd customers an extra 25 cents or $4.54 a month, depending on who is doing the math. The governor plans to sign the bill. Left by the wayside once again was just about anyone who relies on state government. Lawmakers and the governor didn't agree on a new state budget as many social service agencies teeter on the brink of financial collapse and public universities are in bad shape. Legislators left in limbo whether they would overturn Rauner's move to yank $215 million in teacher pension help from an already shaky Chicago Public Schools. And Mayor Rahm Emanuel's plan to shore up two city worker pension funds didn't clear the Senate due to lawmaker absences, although the governor has strongly suggested he'll veto it anyway. One suburban Democratic lawmaker described the frustration with state government when he took to the microphone during the debate on the energy bill. \"What are we doing you guys? What are we doing listening to this bill? We don't have a budget and our so-called stopgap budget is just weeks away from expiring,\" said Rep. Sam Yingling, a Democrat from Grayslake who narrowly won re-election last month and has again been targeted for defeat by Republicans in 2018. \"Instead, we are talking about a multibillion dollar corporate bailout for one of the most profitable energy companies in the state. And how are we going to finance this? This is going to be financed on the back of the rate payers.\" Despite the bad political optics, neither side wanted to be blamed if the legislation failed. Rauner didn't want to take the heat for the loss of jobs associated with the plants closing, particularly as his economic agenda remains on hold amid Democratic opposition. At the same time, Democrats feared alienating unions who stand to gain more jobs under the legislation, particularly as Democrats rely on organized labor to fend off campaign challenges from Rauner and his wealthy allies in business. Bruce Rauner to raise rates on consumers to help two struggling nuclear power plants. The last-minute attempt to resolve the long-festering electricity issue came on a day the Republican... As lawmakers prepare to wrap up the fall session, Exelon and ComEd on Wednesday announced an agreement with Gov. Bruce Rauner to raise rates on consumers to help two struggling nuclear power plants. The last-minute attempt to resolve the long-festering electricity issue came on a day the Republican... (Monique Garcia) Even with the shared interest in passing the legislation, the process was not without the usual political fireworks. After announcing a tentative deal a day before, Rauner's office on Thursday morning accused House Democrats led by Speaker Michael Madigan of inserting several \"poison pills\" into the energy measure. Among their complaints, Rauner aides pointed to requirements that new renewable energy projects follow prevailing wage laws, which the governor repeatedly has sought to weaken saying the rules lead to higher construction costs. Madigan dismissed those accusations, telling reporters \"the governor's administration says a lot of things and you people seem to eat it right up.\" Ultimately, the bill won approval following a flurry of negotiations between Rauner's office and supporters, including a change that pushed back the bill's effective date until next summer, a move that lowered the number of votes required to pass it. (Kim Geiger) Under the revamped proposal, the utilities would collect about $235 million a year from customers to keep open nuclear plants in Downstate Clinton and the Quad Cities. That's lower than the $285 million called for in previous versions of the legislation. Exelon said the legislation would cap rate increases at an average of 25 cents a month for ComEd customers, though opponents say the hike could cost more than $4 a month. The adjustment would allow ComEd to spend about $400 million a year on energy efficiency programs. While that's less than the $500 million earmarked for energy efficiency in the initial legislation, the funding has helped build support among backers of clean energy. That includes the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argues the legislation will help expand wind and solar projects and in turn create new jobs. The power bill is a stripped-down version of an earlier measure that at one time also included subsidies for Downstate coal plants. That was abandoned following opposition from Rauner, along with a controversial provision that would have changed how customers are charged for their monthly energy use. That plan would have allowed billing based on an average of a customer's top 30 minutes of usage on weekdays. Supporters said the measure would shield customers from higher rate hikes that would result if the plants closed and the power supply dropped. \"This isn't a bailout, this is a stabilization of our supply,\" said Rep. Michael Tryon, a retiring Crystal Lake Republican. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan's office opposed the bill, citing the rushed manner in which the final deal was put together. The office said it continued to have concerns about the impact on consumers, saying further study was needed. The bill morphed several times with hard-to-track changes and lawmakers had little time to read the final version. The lengthy debate produced a joke from Rep. Jaime Andrade, D-Chicago, who noted the army of lobbyists hired to help pass the bill and \"probably made a lot of money this last year or two.\" \"Maybe they can do some pro bono work and help us get a budget deal on behalf of the citizens,\" Andrade said. The measure passed the House on a 63-38 vote, with just three votes to spare as more than 40 Democrats and around 19 Republicans voted in favor. In the Senate, it passed 32-18 with only two votes to spare. GOP leader Christine Radogno of Lemont joined 24 Democrats in voting for the plan. Rauner issued a statement saying his administration worked to protect jobs, ratepayers and taxpayers and that the measure \"shows that when all parties are willing to negotiate in good faith, we can find agreement and move our state forward.\" One area where agreement remains elusive is a bill to provide $215 million in pension relief to struggling Chicago Public Schools. Sitting on Rauner's desk for nearly a month, the bill suddenly was inserted into the action following a closed-door meeting between Rauner and legislative leaders that was supposed to focus on the budget. Instead, it resulted in a fight between Rauner and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton after Cullerton encouraged Rauner to sign the legislation even though a broader overhaul for the state's highly indebted employee retirement system has yet to emerge. Rauner accused Cullerton of going back on a June agreement in which Republicans supported the bailout for CPS only \"on condition that Democrats reengage in serious, good faith negotiations.\" He vetoed the bill less than an hour after the meeting ended. The Senate voted to override that measure, but the House left town before voting. The House has 15 calendar days to take up the override, but the chamber is not scheduled to return to Springfield until Jan. 9. In addition to the CPS pension money veto, Emanuel was unable to win approval of a plan to fix two troubled city worker pension systems. The House easily passed the measure aimed at shoring up the municipal worker and laborers retirement funds, but the Senate did not take up the bill after several members left early. The Emanuel administration hopes the Senate will vote in January during the final days of the lame-duck session, but Rauner has strongly suggested he might veto the measure. \"The governor cannot support this bill without real pension reform that protects taxpayers,\" Rauner spokesman Lance Trover said. Time is on Rauner's side \u2014 if he waits to act until the current General Assembly's final adjournment next month, the newly-sworn lawmakers would not be able to vote on whether to override him. The mayor's pension bill would require newly hired city workers to put 11.5 percent of their salaries toward pensions instead of 8.5 percent. City taxpayers also would pay more, in the form of already-approved tax hikes on water and phone bills. As all of this unfolded in the Capitol, the state's largest employee union went to court in Downstate St. Clair County to ask a judge to prevent Rauner from imposing his contract terms after negotiations were declared deadlocked. The request from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees comes as the Rauner administration has begun to put in place its changes, including merit pay which the union says fosters favoritism, and drug and alcohol testing for those suspected of using on the job. The union says the administration can't put the changes in place yet because the Illinois Labor Relations Board has not issued a written decision on the impasse. Once that happens, the union can accept the governor's terms, strike or go to court. \"Gov. Rauner should negotiate, not dictate. By forcing confrontation instead of seeking compromise, the governor bears responsibility for this litigation and the threat of a disruptive strike,\" union spokesman Anders Lindall said in a statement. The administration contends its changes, including sharp increases in employee health care costs, are aimed at saving taxpayers money. Meanwhile, there was little public talk Thursday of the state's most pressing issue: the lack of a complete budget. A temporary spending plan is set to expire Jan. 1, meaning the state will no longer be able to cut checks for universities and social service providers who care for the state's elderly. While both sides continue to meet, they remain sharply divided. Rauner wants a comprehensive agreement that includes several economic reforms such as a cut in costs associated with workers compensation insurance employers must pay for employees hurt on the job. But the governor says he's open to another stopgap plan if Democrats would agree to term limits and giving cities the ability to freeze property taxes. Madigan-led Democrats have long opposed those ideas, saying they would harm workers and force schools to cut budgets as tax dollars dried up. Madigan, who was first elected in 1970, contends the state already has term limits in the form of elections. While Rauner didn't emerge publicly Thursday, he ended the day the same way he began it: Posting a video on his Facebook page. The first one called on Madigan to negotiate on a budget. The second was a short clip announcing he'd postponed a live webcast with wife Diana Rauner. The event was billed as a casual \"hangout\" from the Executive Mansion, and was one in a series of appearances Rauner has done in recent months as he seeks to control his public image during the budget stalemate. \"There's so much going on here in Springfield we've got to focus on getting some things done,\" Rauner said. \"We'll reschedule, looking forward to it, happy holidays.\" mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com ",

Lionel Bonaventure/AP France's embattled president, Francois Hollande, has announced that he will not seek a second term. The surprise announcement from the socialist leader marks the \"first time in 60 years that a sitting French president has not run for re-election,\" as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from Paris. \"Terrorist attacks and a sagging economy beset Hollande and made him one of the most unpopular presidents ever.\" Hollande made the announcement in a televised address, where he spoke for about 10 minutes and defended his record since taking office in 2012, Eleanor adds. \"I am aware today of the risk that going down a route that would not gather sufficient support would entail, so I have decided not to be a candidate in the presidential election,\" Hollande said, according to Reuters. This opens up the candidate field for Hollande's Socialist Party, which is deeply divided, as it prepares for France's presidential election next spring. A few days ago, \"Prime Minister Manuel Valls ... said he was 'ready' to compete in the Socialist primary,\" according to The Associated Press. A former economy minister named Arnaud Montebourg \"has already submitted his name,\" the AFP reports .

According to AFP, \"voter surveys currently tip rightwing Republicans party candidate Francois Fillon to win the election, with the far-right National Front candidate Marine Le Pen seen as his closest challenger.\" On the other hand, a recent poll saw Hollande winning just 7 percent of the votes in the first round of the two-stage election. Fillon said after today's announcement that \"Hollande had been 'lucid' about what he called 'his clear failure,' \" according to Reuters. ",

First, Trump leaves New York City for an event at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indianapolis alongside Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Both will announce their agreement reached with Carrier executives to keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S., which the company said is due in part to Trump's and Pence's personal lobbying as well as state tax incentives. Both Trump's transition team and the company have refused to publicly disclose the full details of the deal, while the president-elect's close aides have openly touted it as just the start of what Americans can expect from a Trump presidency. Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2016 Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 After Indianapolis, Trump then heads to Cincinnati, Ohio, where his tour kicks off at 7 p.m. ET. The rally will be Trump's first since his victory speech on Nov. 9. It is being held at U.S. Bank Arena, the site of one of Trump's largest rallies during the campaign. Trump's often boisterous behavior during rallies defined a large part of his campaign, though it's unclear whether he will use the same approach with his tour. In recent interviews, Trump has signaled some awareness of real divisions in the country following his surprise victory, though his Twitter feed has also revealed his frustration with both the recount effort in three states pushed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton 's wide lead in the popular vote. As he continues working with aides on the massive transition effort, Trump plans to visit states that he won and some where he didn't prevail, according to a Trump official. ",

By Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker December 1 at 9:07 PM Follow @ktumulty Follow @PhilipRucker CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 The raw, lingering emotion of the 2016 presidential campaign erupted into a shouting match here Thursday as top strategists of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign accused their Republican counterparts of fueling and legitimizing racism to elect Donald Trump. The extraordinary exchange came at a postmortem session sponsored by Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, where top operatives from both campaigns sat across a conference table from each other. As Trump\u2019s team basked in the glow of its victory and singled out for praise its campaign\u2019s chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, who was absent, the row of grim-faced Clinton aides who sat opposite them bristled. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri condemned Bannon, who previously ran Breitbart, a news site popular with the alt-right, a small movement known for espousing racist views. \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am proud to have lost,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather lose than win the way you guys did.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications director Jennifer Palmieri and campaign manager Robby Mook speak to the traveling press corps aboard the campaign plane above Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, fumed: \u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d \u201cYou did, Kellyanne. You did,\u201d interjected Palmieri, who choked up at various points of the session. \u201cDo you think you could have just had a decent message for white, working-class voters?\u201d Conway asked. \u201cHow about, it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, she doesn\u2019t connect with people? How about, they have nothing in common with her? How about, she doesn\u2019t have an economic message?\u201d Joel Benenson, Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, piled on: \u201cThere were dog whistles sent out to people. . . . Look at your rallies. He delivered it.\u201d At which point, Conway accused Clinton\u2019s team of being sore losers. \u201cGuys, I can tell you are angry, but wow,\u201d she said. \u201cHashtag he\u2019s your president. How\u2019s that? Will you ever accept the election results? Will you tell your protesters that he\u2019s their president, too?\u201d The session was part of a two-day forum that the school\u2019s Institute of Politics has sponsored in the wake of every presidential election since 1972. It gathers operatives from nearly all of the primary and general election campaigns, as well as a large contingent of journalists, with the stated goal of beginning to compile a historical record. Generally, the quadrennial gatherings are frank but civil ones, in which political operatives at the top of their game accord each other a measure of professional respect. This year, in the wake of a brutal campaign with a surprise outcome, it was clear that the wounds have not yet begun to heal. The animosity of the campaign aides mirrors the broader feelings of millions of voters on both sides. Campaign officials lashed out at each other, and also against the media \u2014 which neither side believed had treated it fairly. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook also acknowledged that her operation had made a number of mistakes and miscalculations, while being buffeted by what he repeatedly described as a \u201chead wind\u201d of being an establishment candidate in a season where voters were eager for change. He noted, for example, that younger voters, perhaps assuming that Clinton was going to win, migrated to third-party candidates in the final days of the race. Where the campaign needed to win upward of 60\u00a0percent of young voters, it was able to garner something \u201cin the high 50s at the end of the day,\u201d Mook said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we lost.\u201d He and others also faulted FBI Director James B. Comey for deciding in the waning days of the campaign to revive the controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Trump officials said Clinton\u2019s problems went beyond tactics to her weaknesses as a candidate and the deficits of a message that consisted largely of trying to make Trump unacceptable. David Bossie, Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, taunted Mook: \u201cYou call it \u2018head winds,\u2019 I call it self-inflicted wounds.\u201d Conway added, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference for voters between what offends you and what affects you,\u201d arguing that Trump was speaking more directly to people\u2019s anxieties and needs. Strategists for Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who waged a strong challenge against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, agreed. \u201cThere was a large part of the Democratic primary electorate who had concerns about the secretary\u2019s veracity and forthrightness,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019s campaign manager. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides insisted, again and again, that their candidate had been held to a different standard than the other contenders \u2014 as evidenced by the controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Palmieri said that many political journalists had a personal dislike for the Democratic nominee and predicted that the email issue will go down in history as \u201cthe most grossly overrated, over-covered and most destructive story in all of presidential politics.\u201d \u201cIf I made one mistake, it was legitimizing the way the press covered this story line,\u201d Palmieri said. Mook added that Trump deftly used his rally speeches to \u201cswitch up the news cycle.\u201d \u201cThe media by and large was not covering what Hillary Clinton was choosing to say,\u201d Mook said. \u201cThey were treating her like the likely winner, and they were constantly trying to unearth secrets and expose.\u201d For instance, Mook posited that the media did not scrutinize Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns as intensively as the issue of Clinton\u2019s private email server. Conway retorted: \u201cOh, my God, that question was vomited to me every day on TV.\u201d The strangest criticism of the media, however, was by Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. His complaint: Journalists accurately reported what Trump said. \u201cThis is the problem with the media. You guys took everything that Donald Trump said so literally,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cThe American people didn\u2019t. They understood it. They understood that sometimes \u2014 when you have a conversation with people, whether it\u2019s around the dinner table or at a bar \u2014 you\u2019re going to say things, and sometimes you don\u2019t have all the facts to back it up.\u201d At a dinner the previous evening, CNN chief executive Jeff Zucker was heckled during a panel discussion about the media by operatives from several losing Republican campaigns, who accused the network of showering Trump with free publicity. To win the GOP nomination, Trump vanquished a highly credentialed field of 16 other Republicans, some of whom were backed up by tens of millions of dollars in outside spending. What his opponents failed to recognize, until it was too late, was that 2016 would be a year unlike any other, in which the standard rules would not apply. \u201cThe uniqueness of this cycle made it such that some of those traditional kind of avenues became less effective,\u201d said Danny Diaz, who managed the campaign of the presumed early front-runner, former Florida governor Jeb Bush. \u201cMoney and mechanics matter, but passion about a candidate matters more,\u201d added Mike DuHaime, a strategist for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), another establishment figure in the race. Barry Bennett, the campaign manager for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, said of voters: \u201cWhat they wanted more than anything else was strength, and Donald Trump was supplying it every day.\u201d Clinton consultant Mandy Grunwald had a darker interpretation, which she expressed in an icy backhanded compliment to the Trump team on Thursday: \u201cI don\u2019t think you give yourself enough credit for the negative campaign you ran.\u201d She noted that the murky corners of the Internet were rife with false stories that Clinton was in dire health, and on the verge of going to prison. \u201cI hear this heroic story of him connecting with voters,\u201d Grunwald said. \u201cBut there was a very impressive gassing of her.\u201d Benenson, meanwhile, served notice that the election may be over but that the battles it spawned are not. \u201cYou guys won, that\u2019s clear,\u201d Benenson said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest. Don\u2019t act as if you have a popular mandate for your message. The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump.\u201d At which point Conway turned to her side and said: \u201cHey, guys, we won. You don\u2019t have to respond. He was the better candidate. That\u2019s why he won.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch December 1, 2016, 4:41 PM Longtime Starbucks chief Howard Schultz to step down as CEO Email Last Updated Dec 1, 2016 7:30 PM EST Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz -- the expansion-minded Seattle espresso fanatic who turned a local coffee house into a global brand with 25,000 stores and $21 billion in sales -- announced Tuesday he will be stepping down as chief executive in the spring. In 2006, the Starbuck's CEO told 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley of his humble beginnings. Today, he announces plans to offer college degrees to employe... Schultz, 63, will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer, the company said in a statement. Schultz will remain executive chairman of the Starbucks board, the company added, noting that that no other executive changes are planned. Johnson -- a technology executive at Juniper Networks and Microsoft before joining Starbucks -- has overseen the coffee giant\u2019s global supply chain, its human resources department, and its marketing and technology efforts, including launches of digital and mobile sales platforms. He\u2019s also been a member of the Starbucks board for seven years. According to Schulz, Johnson is better qualified than he is to lead the company.\u00a0 \u201cThis move ideally positions Starbucks to continue to profitably grow our business around the world,\u201d Schulz said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Thursday, adding that the two years since Johson became President have been the best financially in the company\u2019s history. \u00a0\u201cKevin deserves a tremendous amount of credit for those results.\u201d For years, Starbucks has struggled to prepare food that its customers find appealing. John Blackstone reports how the company is betting big on a... After he becomes Starbucks\u2019 barista-in-chief, Johnson will certainly have his work cut out for him. Starbucks, once one of the fastest-growing and most profitable private enterprises in U.S. history, faces significant challenges to deliver the kind of growth investors have been used to from the Seattle-based company. Shares plunged 3.3 percent to $56.57 in after-hours trading after the news was released. The company\u2019s stock already had been down 3 percent so far this year on disappointing earnings that have raised concerns among many investors about future growth prospects. Meanwhile, rival Dunkin\u2019 Brands (DNKN) has surged more than 27 percent so far this year. Wall Street analysts are forecasting sales will hit $23 billion in 2016 and earnings of $2.14 per share. The sales growth represents a 9 percent gain, but that pales in comparison with the double-digit gains investors enjoyed in years past. Schulz has left Starbucks before, in 2000, only to return 8 years later as the chain and the rest of the U.S. economy faced the fallout from the financial crisis. During the conference call, Schulz noted that the company\u2019s circumstances are far different today than they were then. Moreover, Schulz is retaining his ties to Starbucks be keeping his board seat. ",

They're not going to be taking people's hearts out,\" Trump said at an appearance at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Indiana. \"They're not going to be announcing, like they did at Carrier, that they're closing up and they're moving to Mexico.\" The air-conditioning manufacturer had planned to move production at its Indianapolis plant to Mexico, where operations would be cheaper, taking some 1,400 jobs out of the state. Under the deal worked out by the Trump administration \u2014 which Vice President-elect Mike Pence took a leading role in shaping \u2014 Carrier will keep about 1,000 of those jobs in the state. Related: Trump Reaches Deal to Keep Nearly 1,000 Jobs in Indiana Trump spoke to Carrier employees after touring the plant, saying he was struck by an employee featured in a news story about the shuttering plant who said he was confident Trump would save his job. It was his first public event since being declared the president-elect on November 9. \"I never thought I made that promise. Not with Carrier. I made it for everybody else. I didn't make it really for Carrier. And I said, 'What's he saying?' And he was such a believer,\" Trump said. \"And then they played my statement. And I said, 'Carrier will never leave.' But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in.\" \"Thanks to the initiative and the leadership of President-elect Donald Trump that Carrier has decided to stay and grow right here in America,\" Pence said. To note in this: Carrier will still close its Huntington plant and move the 700 jobs at that facility to Mexico. One worker: pic.twitter.com/Fs8mKP9uA7 \u2014 Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) December 1, 2016 A source with knowledge of the state's negotiation with United Technologies said the deal would grant the parent company of Carrier Corp. $7 million in financial incentives over 10 years in exchange for a guarantee that the air and heating conditioning company would retain at least 1,000 jobs and invest $16 million into its Indiana operation. Carrier confirmed Thursday that \"the state of Indiana has offered Carrier a $7 million package over multiple years, contingent upon factors including employment, job retention and capital investment.\" The deal, however, did include Carrier's plant in Huntington, Indiana, where CNBC reports 700 jobs will be lost when a plant there closes. Employees from the Huntington facility protested the Trump event with signs reading \"What about our jobs in Huntington?\" A top member of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. \u2014 which will have to approve the Indianapolis deal offered to Carrier to keep them in the state \u2014 said the tax cuts are likely not the biggest reason Carrier's keeping its plant in Indiana.

Ted S. Warren/AP hide caption toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Howard Schultz, who is stepping down as CEO of Starbucks, speaks at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March. Ted S. Warren/AP Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks CEO: Can You 'Get Big And Stay Small'? Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Shares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. During a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. Schultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. ",

Wabash Ave., and Early College, 1135 N. Cleaver St., were formerly privately run contract schools that were put under district management this year. Marshall Middle School, at 3900 N.
