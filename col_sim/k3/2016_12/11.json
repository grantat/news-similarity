President-elect Donald Trump attends the 117th Army-Navy football game with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in Baltimore on Dec. 10, 2016. (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Tensions between Donald Trump and U.S. intelligence officials boiled over Saturday\u00a0as Trump's transition team mockingly compared a\u00a0secret CIA assessment that Russia\u00a0tried to sway the U.S. election in Trump's favor to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgments on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction.\u00a0\u00a0 The widening public rift\u00a0between the incoming president and the\u00a0nation\u2019s powerful intelligence community\u00a0could pose high-risk problems both\u00a0for his administration and for national security. \u00a0 CIA leaders at agency headquarters in Langley, Va., are bracing for a potentially adversarial relationship with Trump\u2019s White House, especially over what the spy agency sees as Russia\u2019s malign role on multiple\u00a0fronts, according to two officials who requested anonymity in speaking about internal discussions. \u201cIt sets up one of the great crises in the history of the executive branch,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a former senior CIA officer who spent more than two decades as a spy before retiring in 2007. \u201cAll the agency can do short of insurrection is to present the facts when allowed to the executive we serve.\u201d Trump has received only a handful of classified intelligence briefings since his upset victory last month,\u00a0and CIA officials now believe it is because Trump has rejected their assessments\u00a0on Moscow\u2019s\u00a0aggression in Ukraine, its pressure on\u00a0Eastern Europe and its computer hacks\u00a0to boost\u00a0Trump's chances against Hillary Clinton .

The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals... (Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller) Some compared the current tensions\u00a0to the distrust that marked relations with Vice President Dick Cheney before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, when he was widely seen as cherry-picking raw intelligence and pushing\u00a0agency analysts\u00a0to support his views. President Nixon had a famously frosty relationship with the CIA, which he considered too powerful and too\u00a0independent. President Clinton\u2019s\u00a0first CIA director, R. James Woolsey, was so disliked in the White House that he could barely get an appointment to see the president.\u00a0 Still, no other\u00a0incoming president has publicly\u00a0rejected\u00a0a major CIA\u00a0assessment about a\u00a0security threat, or declined regular classified briefings from officials representing\u00a0America\u2019s $70-billion-a-year global espionage and surveillance\u00a0apparatus.\u00a0 Nor has a transition team issued a statement\u00a0like the one it emailed\u00a0Saturday after the Washington Post reported that the CIA had concluded\u00a0that Russian President\u00a0 Vladimir Putin \u2019s government had authorized the hacking and leaking of Democratic Party emails this year in a deliberate effort to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances.\u00a0 \u00a0\"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said, referring to the\u00a0misjudgments and mistakes used to justify the invasion of Iraq, a systemic intelligence failure that badly tarnished the\u00a0CIA\u2019s reputation. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. \u2014 Trump transition team on reports of Russian interference to help them win the 2016 election The Trump team\u2019s\u00a0statement went on to say that the Nov. 8 election \u201cended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history,\u201d a claim that is untrue.\u00a0 Eight of the 12 most recent presidential\u00a0elections\u00a0have been decided with a larger electoral college victory. And unlike most elections, Trump lost the popular vote.\u00a0 Inside the CIA, career analysts have been mystified by Trump\u2019s repeated dismissal of evidence that Russia hacked into Democratic National Committee emails and copied communications from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Trump\u2019s pick for national security advisor, retired three-star Army Gen.\u00a0 Michael Flynn , whom the Obama administration\u00a0fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\u00a0 Flynn\u2019s tenure there was rocky, in part because he ordered aides to chase pet theories that quickly became known as\u00a0\u201cFlynn facts,\u201d since they were not grounded in reality. Trump\u2019s choice to run the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), an aerospace entrepreneur and former Army officer, could get caught in the middle.\u00a0 ",

By Philip Bump December 10 at 2:58 PM Follow @pbump ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson is a potential nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) So far, President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives\u00a0or retired generals. In that context, it's probably less of a surprise that Trump may be close to selecting \u00a0ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state , elevating a dark-horse prospect who may surge past seasoned political actors like Mitt Romney and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) in the stretch. Tillerson's hardly an unknown character on the world stage, but he's probably not too familiar to Americans. As such, we've put together a brief profile of the man who may soon be in charge of the United States' international diplomacy. Tillerson has no experience in the public sector, a first in modern history for a potential secretary of state. Tillerson, 64, joined ExxonMobil in 1975 , after receiving a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas. He worked his way up through the ranks, beginning as a production engineer and becoming chairman and chief executive in 2006. Over his decades at the company, Tillerson's work took him all over the world, including to Yemen and Russia. That, along with his experience as CEO, apparently provides the basis of his familiarity with international diplomacy. On Twitter, a former ExxonMobil employee who is now at Brookings Institution defended Tillerson's experience. \u201cOil folks know stuff: anyone who manages multibillion dollar, multi-decade projects needs deep, nuanced understanding of political context,\u201d Suzanne Maloney wrote \u00a0on Twitter. \u201c\u2026 Tillerson rose to top of a company that prizes technical excellence, rock-solid financials, hard work and integrity. State could do a lot worse.\u201d Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. Tillerson's work with ExxonMobil included a stretch working for Exxon Neftegas Ltd., putting him in charge of the subsidiary's fields in Russia and the Caspian Sea. Two years before receiving the award, ExxonMobil won a contract to explore for oil in a Russia-controlled portion of the Arctic Ocean, which was made more economically viable for drilling in part thanks to the sea ice decline that's followed global warming. Putin himself announced the deal at a meeting in Sochi (where the Winter Olympics would be held the next year). Tillerson's stake in ExxonMobil will certainly raise questions at a confirmation hearing. Once Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the United States instituted sanctions against Russia that froze ExxonMobil's Arctic agreement. Were those sanctions to be lifted, the deal would probably move forward \u2014 making Tillerson's shares of ExxonMobil stock much more valuable. (The Wall Street Journal noted \u00a0that he'd probably have to divest from that stock if appointed to run the State Department.) Tillerson's position on climate change may be to the left of Trump's. ExxonMobil understood the connection between greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and the warming climate as early as 1977, according to recent reporting . It then proceeded to combat the idea, recognizing the risk posed to its industry by curtailing fossil fuel use. Only fairly recently did it acknowledge that link publicly, and the company is now on record in support of accepting the established science and identifying solutions to the problem of climate change. That shift happened under Tillerson's leadership. The issue of climate change will be a potent one for whoever takes over the State Department, given the long-standing international diplomacy efforts to address the issue. Shortly before this year's election, ExxonMobil issued a statement in support of the sweeping agreement reached in Paris at the end of last year aimed at cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions internationally. Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he opposed the Paris agreement and has regularly expressed his opposition to taking action to address climate change. Tillerson, as CEO, promoted positions contrary to that. His most recent personal comments echoed the sentiment of his company, calling the threat of climate change \u201creal\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d \u2014 though the extent to which he was speaking as a representative of ExxonMobil vs. his own views is worth asking. Tillerson is a lifelong Boy Scout. Tillerson was an Eagle Scout in his youth and eventually became president of the national organization. It was under his leadership \u2014 and through his advocacy \u2014 that the organization embraced the membership of young men who identified as gay. Tillerson's positions on a variety of other political issues are largely unknown. Climate change is central to what we know about Tillerson, thanks to the industry of his long-term employer. The Wall Street Journal noted \u00a0that Tillerson supports free trade \u2014 which, as a CEO of a major international corporation, is probably a\u00a0natural position. Beyond that, it's not clear where Tillerson's politics align with or differ from his possible boss's. His political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities. So it\u00a0probably isn't a surprise that... ... Tillerson originally supported Jeb Bush for president. He gave Bush the maximum allowable contribution in September 2015. politics ",

    "text": "CBS News December 10, 2016, 6:07 PM Who is Rex Tillerson, Exxon chief and Donald Trump's top secretary of state candidate? Email Who is Rex Tillerson, the CEO, president and chairman of Exxon Mobil Corp. that has emerged as the distinct front-runner in the race to be President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state? The 64-year-old executive is the head of the largest oil company in the world. It operates in dozens of countries -- including Russia, which has sparked controversy recently for the Kremlin\u2019s alleged involvement in the U.S. elections -- and has oil and natural gas interests on six continents. Tillerson began his career at Exxon in 1975 as an engineer. (He graduated with a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas in Austin). Eventually, he worked his way up through the ranks to become president and join the Board of Directors in 2004. He was made CEO two years later.\u00a0 Rex Tillerson, chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, testifies about the company\u2019s acquisition of XTO Energy before the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington January 20, 2010.\u00a0 REUTERS The Texas native, a multi-millionaire, has experience entirely in the private sector, with no past work in government. But Tillerson, as the chief of one of the most valuable publicly traded energy corporations, certainly knows his way around international deal-making. His money, Texas swagger and board room moxie (in 2008 he defeated an attempt to separate the chairman and CEO titles he held) are all qualities that Mr. Trump admires and respects. Earlier this week on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Mr. Trump called Tillerson a \u201cgreat, great gentleman\u201d who had built a \u201ctremendous company...with great style.\u201d In a clip from an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that was released Saturday, Mr. Trump also called Tillerson a \u201cworld-class player.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of a - an oil company that\u2019s pretty much double the size of its next nearest competitor. It\u2019s been a company that\u2019s been unbelievably managed,\u201d the president-elect said.\u00a0 Tillerson, however, could face significant pushback during a Senate confirmation hearing for his significant business connections to Russia and for his potential conflicts of interest. Here are the key things to know about Tillerson:\u00a0 Business ties to Russia If Tillerson is nominated, the oil executive may face further scrutiny before the Senate because of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 Tillerson and Putin met in the 1990s when Tillerson worked for Exxon in Russia during Boris Yeltsin\u2019s presidency and Putin worked for Yeltsin\u2019s KGB with an eye toward Russian economic revitalization. Tillerson, in the \u201890s, was president of Exxon Neftegas Limited, which operated the Sakhalin-1 project, located in far eastern Russia. In 2011, Tillerson negotiated Exxon access to drilling rights in the Arctic. As part of the deal, Russia\u2019s state-owned oil company, Rosneft, became an investor in Exxon global operations, specifically concessions. In 2014, U.S. sanctions against Russia put the brakes on the deal. Tillerson has spoken out repeatedly in general terms against economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and European Union after the incursion and subsequent seizure of Crimea in Ukraine. At Putin\u2019s behest, the Kremlin conferred on Tillerson Russia\u2019s\u00a0 Order of Friendship in 2013 . The state decoration rewards foreign nationals whose work has been aimed at bettering relations with Moscow. John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where Tillerson is a board member, noted to the Wall Street Journal recently that the Exxon chief has had significant contact with the Russian president.\u00a0 \u201cHe has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably any other American with the exception of Henry Kissinger,\u201d Hamre, who was also a former deputy defense secretary under President Clinton, told the Journal. Mr. Trump acknowledged Tillerson\u2019s connections to Russia in his interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d noting them as positive qualifications.\u00a0 \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players. And he knows them well,\u201d the president-elect said in the clip released Saturday. \u201cHe does massive deals in Russia, he does massive deals for the company. Not for himself. For the company.\u201d Conflicts of interest Tillerson, whose career at Exxon spans over four decades, also holds 2.5 million shares of the oil company\u2019s stock. About 1.8 million of these shares are not vested and cannot be sold now, leading to questions over what the oil executive can do to avoid conflicts of interest as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Climate change stance Tillerson himself is not a climate change skeptic, publicly calling the threat \u201creal\u201d and \u201cserious.\u201d But Exxon is being probed by several state attorneys general for allegedly misleading the public on climate change. Exxon has denied the charges.\u00a0 In the case of the New York attorney general\u2019s office, the company is also under investigation for its accounting practices, particularly on the issue of not writing down the value of its assets. \u201cOur results are in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards of the SEC\u201d and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an Exxon spokesman told the Reuters news agency. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Karoun Demirjian December 10 at 6:59 PM Follow @karoun Senior Democratic lawmakers are calling for a full investigation of the CIA\u2019s claims that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Donald Trump, demanding that the intelligence community turn over all its evidence to Congress. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) released a strongly worded statement Saturday morning, saying CIA conclusions that Russia\u2019s hacking and other election interference had the goal of electing Trump \u2014 first reported Friday night in The Washington Post \u2014 are \u201cstunning and not surprising.\u201d \u201cThat any country could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core,\u201d Schumer stated. \u201cSenate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this.\u201d Schumer\u2019s demands were echoed by outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who charged that FBI Director James B. Comey was aware of the intelligence about Russia\u2019s aims before the election and deliberately kept it private. Reid called on Comey to resign. \u201cOf course. Yes,\u201d he said when asked whether the FBI director should go. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He has his term there. And I\u2019m sure the new administration, they should like him, he helped them get elected,\u201d Reid said on MSNBC. CIA briefers told senators in a closed-door briefing it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal, according to officials. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Democrats immediately embraced the conclusions of the secret CIA report, which asserted that the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails \u2014 and their release to WikiLeaks \u2014 was the work of Russian operatives with ties to the government of President Vladi\u00admir Putin, all intended to help elect Trump. Key Republicans did not automatically accept that conclusion, despite many of them believing that Russia was behind the DNC hacks and other election interference. For Republicans, giving credence to the CIA assessment probably would cause them to anger Trump even before the president-elect has been inaugurated. Party leaders began deflecting that sort of intelligence well before the election. According to officials present during a September CIA briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed doubts about the intelligence tying the Russian hacks to Trump. McConnell did not comment after the news report surfaced, but his spokesman, David Popp, called the allegations \u201cdisturbing.\u201d \u201cI do not have any readout of what did or didn\u2019t happen in a classified briefing,\u201d Popp said. \u201cBut obviously any foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and the White House has just announced an investigation to see if that has occurred and will formulate a response.\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he could not be certain of the CIA\u2019s claims given its track record, echoing Trump\u2019s reaction to the report in which he said: \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to have a briefing before I could judge it and who\u2019s doing it,\u201d McCain said in an interview late Friday night, once The Post\u2019s report was published. \u201cBut the CIA has not always been exactly right, to say the least.\u201d The CIA\u2019s conclusions that Russia hacked the election to aid Trump has put Republicans in a political bind. On the one hand, the charges of election hacking are a perfect, galvanizing platform from which to go after Russia for what they see as a global pattern of dangerous meddling, not just in the American elections, but also in the wars in Ukraine and Syria. But on the other hand, they now risk unearthing more evidence giving credence to the charges that Trump\u2019s campaign benefited from the hacks. Such evidence could seriously undermine the president-elect before he takes office and beyond. Other Republican senators also expressed doubts about the CIA\u2019s charge. \u201cI\u2019d be very concerned if a foreign government were doing that \u2014 we don\u2019t have any evidence of that yet, and I haven\u2019t seen the CIA report, so I\u2019ll reserve judgment,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said late Friday night. And still others are questioning why anyone is talking about Russian hacking at all. \u201cAll this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) tweeted Saturday morning. \u201cSerious, but hardly news.\u201d Nonetheless, even before the latest report, McCain and other senior Republican senators were planning to launch a wide-ranging, coordinated probe into alleged Russian interference in the elections in the next Congress. Such an effort could run directly counter to Trump\u2019s foreign policy plans, including a repeatedly stated desire to warm relations with Putin\u2019s Russia. McCain\u2019s Senate Armed Services Committee intends to establish a dedicated subcommittee to probe cyberthreats that will hold hearings on the how the United States would respond to an attack as well as investigate allegations of election hacking. \u201cEverybody that I know, unclassified, has said that the Russians interfered in this election. They hacked into my campaign in 2008; is it a surprise to anyone?\u201d McCain said. \u201cEvery expert I respect said the Russians engaged in that campaign.\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) has said : \u201cI\u2019m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia. . . . I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want Putin personally to pay the price.\u201d He intends to spearhead legislation and hold a series of investigative hearings next year into \u201cRussia\u2019s misadventures throughout the world,\u201d including its intervention in the elections. \u201cClearly a lot of the information was selectively leaked,\u201d Graham said. \u201cRather than try to tank the election in terms of an outcome, I want to go after the country that dared to interfere.\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who had been a candidate for Trump\u2019s secretary of state before the transition team reportedly moved toward ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, said early Saturday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to do the work that we need to do to understand what\u2019s happened.\u201d [Trump expected to pick ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state] He noted that other senators, particularly those on the Senate\u2019s Select Committee on Intelligence, had approached him on the Senate floor during the last roll call votes of the session to \u201cshare their concerns\u201d about the issue of Russian hacking. \u201cThey can tell it\u2019s warranted and that I should, like other committees are doing, pay a lot of attention to the issue,\u201d Corker said. But the Tennessee Republican declined to comment directly about hacks potentially favoring Trump. Trump is relying on Republican doubts to avoid speculation that his win was directly aided by Moscow as he continues to assemble his Cabinet. In a recent interview for Time , Trump said he doesn\u2019t believe Russia interfered in the election, reasoning: \u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d He called the steady stream of allegations tying Russian hacking to his campaign \u201cnot a talking point, a laughing point.\u201d \u201cWhy not get along with Russia? And they can help us fight ISIS . . . and they\u2019re effective and smart,\u201d Trump also said during that interview. Such statements could cause Senate Republicans to take a second look at Trump\u2019s nominees. Senate Democrats cannot filibuster Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, but they are now likely to face more questioning about any ties to Russia. Tillerson, who has been decorated with Russia\u2019s Order of Friendship, is causing special concern. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then we\u2019re gonna have some talkin\u2019. We\u2019ll have some questions,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy, but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Trump's transition team cautioned that no announcement was expected over the weekend. USA TODAY Rex W. Tillerson (Photo: REX C. CURRY, EPA) NEW YORK \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is zeroing in on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of State nominee. Tillerson had his second interview with the president-elect Saturday at\u00a0Trump Tower and has emerged as the favorite in the long-running competition to lead the State Department, a person familiar with the transition deliberations\u00a0told USA TODAY on\u00a0condition of anonymity\u00a0because Trump has yet to announce his pick. \"In his case, he's much more than a business executive,\" Trump said in an interview to be broadcast on Fox News Sunday. \"I mean, he's a world-class player.\" In the excerpt released by Fox News on Saturday, Trump stopped short of confirming Tillerson as his pick, but praised the 64-year-old executive. \"He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It\u2019s been a company that's been unbelievably managed,\" he said. \"To me a big advantage is that he knows many the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals \u2014 not\u00a0for himself, but for the company.\" It's those deals in Russia that are likely to draw the most scrutiny, especially given his personal relationship with the president of Russia, who\u00a0awarded him the Order of Friendship, the top Russian honor for a foreign citizen,\u00a0in 2013. \u201cI have obviously concerns of reports of his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,\u00a0told CNN. \"We will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined.\u00a0That\u2019s the time to make up your mind as to whether to vote yes or no.\u201d News of Tillerson's emergence came as government officials accuse\u00a0the Russian government of seeking to intervene in the recent U.S. election, including hacks of Democratic officials' e-mails \u2014\u00a0all in an effort to boost Trump's chances. Trump bashes CIA, dismisses Russian hacking report Putin and Russia have denied the allegations, while Trump has questioned the idea of Russian interference. And with Trump promising to cancel the Paris climate agreement negotiated by President Obama, the nomination of an oil executive would send a powerful signal that the United States is prepared to buck the global consensus on greenhouse gas emissions. Trump's weeks-long search for secretary of State has included multiple interviews with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor and top adviser Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, and retired general and ex-CIA director David Petraeus. Giuliani, who said Friday he was withdrawing from the State Department competition, accompanied Trump to the Army-Navy game Saturday. Giuliani removes himself from Cabinet consideration After Trump aides said the list had been narrowed to those four, the president-elect decided to expand his list \u2014 a decision that brought his attention\u00a0to Tillerson. Trump transition adviser Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Tillerson is a \"very intriguing pick to many people. He's already active in Russia, and China and Yemen and the developing world, across our globe. He has the kind of business experience that Donald Trump values.\" Tillerson\u00a0has worked for Exxon since graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1975, climbing the ranks until he was named CEO in 2006. He\u00a0has no previous governmental or diplomatic experience. But as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has negotiated with countries all over the world for oil exploration rights, particularly in the Middle East and Russia. Exxon record in spotlight as Trump interviews CEO Of particular interest in his Senate confirmation hearings would\u00a0be the $2.2 billion Exxon investment in Russian oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean, which Tillerson negotiated in 2011. That agreement, which also allowed Russian investment in other Exxon ventures around the world, was eventually scuttled after U.S.-imposed sanctions following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. At Exxon, Tillerson has been critical of international sanctions, saying they\u2019re difficult to impose fairly. He has acknowledged that climate change has been caused by human activity, and has endorsed a carbon tax as \u201cthe most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions.\u201d Vladimir Putin: Russia seeking friends, not enemies But environmental groups are expected to oppose his Senate confirmation if he's nominated. The New York Attorney General is investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to investors and consumers about the risks of climate change from burning fossil fuels. \u201cIn this position, Tillerson will try his hardest to silence global initiatives and the right of state attorney generals to hold fossil fuel companies legally accountable for climate change,\" said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA. The secretary of State is also responsible for advancing U.S. policy on human rights. Tillerson, himself an Eagle Scout, was president of the Boy Scouts of America at the time when it began allowing gay scouts, and in 2015 ExxonMobil changed its anti-discrimination policy to include gays and lesbians. But the Human Rights Campaign remains skeptical of the company's policy, saying it was prompted by Obama's 2014 executive order targeting federal contractors, not a change in corporate values.

    "text": "Privacy Policy He has promised hearings, saying the Russian activity was \u201ca call to action,\u201d as has Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the few senators left from the Cold War era, when the Republican Party made opposition to the Soviet Union \u2014 and later deep suspicion of Russia \u2014 the centerpiece of its foreign policy. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said there was little doubt that the Russian government was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee. \u201cAll of the intelligence analysts who looked at it came to the conclusion that the tradecraft was very similar to the Russians,\u201d he said. Even one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, said on Friday that he had no doubt about Russia\u2019s culpability. His complaint was with the intelligence agencies, which he said had \u201crepeatedly\u201d failed \u201cto anticipate Putin\u2019s hostile actions,\u201d and with the Obama administration\u2019s lack of a punitive response. Mr. Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the intelligence agencies had \u201cignored pleas by numerous Intelligence Committee members to take more forceful action against the Kremlin\u2019s aggression.\u201d He added that the Obama administration had \u201csuddenly awoken to the threat.\u201d Like many Republicans, Mr. Nunes is threading a needle. His statement puts him in opposition to the position taken by Mr. Trump and his incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has traveled to Russia as a private citizen for RT, the state-controlled news operation, and attended a dinner with Mr. Putin. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Nunes\u2019s contention that Mr. Obama was captivated by a desire to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia is also notable, because Mr. Trump has said he is trying to do the same \u2014 though he is avoiding that term, which was made popular by Mrs. Clinton in her failed effort as secretary of state in 2009. There are splits both within the intelligence agencies and the congressional committees that oversee them. Officials say the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. have not always shared their findings with the F.B.I., which they often distrust. The question of how vigorously to investigate also has a political tinge: Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, for example, are pushing hard for a broad investigation, while some Republicans are resisting. Intelligence can also get politicized, of course, and one of the running debates about the disastrously mistaken assessments of Iraq that Mr. Trump often cites is whether the intelligence itself was tainted or whether the Bush White House read it selectively to support its march to war in 2003. But what is unfolding in the argument over the Russian hacking is more complex, because tracking the origin of cyberattacks is complicated. It is made all the harder by the fact that the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. do not want to reveal human sources or technical abilities, including American software implants in Russian computer networks. This much is known: In mid-2015, a hacking group long associated with the F.S.B. \u2014 the successor to the old Soviet K.G.B. \u2014 got inside the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer systems. The intelligence gathering appeared to be fairly routine, and it was unsurprising: The Chinese, for instance, penetrated Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mr. McCain\u2019s presidential campaign communications in 2008. In the spring of 2016, a second group of Russian hackers, long associated with the G.R.U., a military intelligence agency, attacked the D.N.C. again, along with the private email accounts of prominent Washington figures like John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Those emails were ultimately published \u2014 a step the Russians had never taken before in the United States, though the tactic has been used often in former Soviet states and elsewhere in Europe. That moved the issue from espionage to an \u201cinformation operation\u201d with a political motive. One person who attended a classified briefing on the intelligence said that the investigators had explained that the malware used in the cyberattack on the D.N.C. matched tools previously used by hackers with proven ties to the Russian government. That sort of \u201cpattern analysis\u201d is common in cyberinvestigations, though it is not conclusive. But the intelligence agencies had more: They had managed to identify the individuals from the G.R.U. who oversaw the hacking efforts. That may have come from intercepted conversations, spying efforts, or implants in computer systems that allow the tracking of emails and text messages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In briefings to Mr. Obama and on Capitol Hill, intelligence agencies have said they now believe that what began as an effort to undermine the credibility of American elections morphed over time into a much more targeted effort to harm Mrs. Clinton, whom Mr. Putin has long accused of interfering in Russian parliamentary elections in 2011. But to hedge their bets before the election, according to the briefings, the Russians also targeted the Republican National Committee, Republican operatives and prominent members of the Republican establishment, like former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. However, few of those emails have ever surfaced, save for Mr. Powell\u2019s, which were critical of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign for trying to draw him into a defense of her use of a private computer server. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Sean Spicer, disputed the report in The Times that the intelligence community had concluded that the R.N.C. had been hacked. \u201cThe RNC was not \u2018hacked,\u2019\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThe @nytimes was told and chose to ignore.\u201d On Friday night, before The Times published its report, the committee had refused to comment.

Here are the names of those who have been confirmed dead by the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office Coroner\u2019s Bureau or immediate family members. Did you know one of the victims... (Los Angeles Times Staff) The fact that the warehouse was not on the fire inspection system is puzzling because the city Fire Prevention Bureau is required to conduct annual inspections of all commercial buildings and multifamily residences, according to city ordinance. Some former residents described the warehouse as a cluttered \u201cdeath trap\u201d lacking fire sprinklers and filled with debris and exposed wires. Some said they made complaints to the city. People rented space in the building even though it was zoned only for warehouse use. The death toll from the fire was so high because the warehouse was hosting an unpermitted concert that night. Experts said Oakland has a variety of questions to answer about how it handled the warehouse. \u201cThere are legitimate issues here about why the city of Oakland didn\u2019t use more resources to go into this property,\u201d said Michael Colantuono, a municipal attorney and expert on code enforcement and planning. Others said that Oakland is far from alone in struggling with code enforcement, especially at a time of rising property values that have pushed lower-income residents into substandard housing like the Ghost Ship. Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said her department was still in the process of looking for records related to the warehouse. \u201cI can\u2019t answer how that warehouse slipped through the cracks and that it bypassed our system \u2014 or how it bypassed the city\u2019s system,\u201d Reed told CNN in an interview. \u201cBut everybody is at the table right now trying to figure out what happened.\u201d The city\u2019s Planning and Building Department investigated at least three of the complaints at the warehouse over the past three years. The complaints appear to assert that structures had been built inside without permits or that the property was being used as a residence. Most of the other complaints cited illegal parking and mounds of debris piled up on the sidewalk and in an adjoining vacant lot. A building code inspector visited the warehouse 15 days before the fire to investigate complaints of trash piled outside and an \u201cillegal interior building structure.\u201d But the inspector was unable to get inside, triggering questions about whether a more aggressive investigation would have identified the multiple building code violations inside the structure and possibly prevented the tragedy. Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories Questions about the competence of Oakland\u2019s building inspection agency arose five years ago. An Alameda County Grand Jury in 2011 released a scathing report accusing the city\u2019s building services division of mismanagement and having haphazard policies about conducting building inspections. The grand jury found that agency was riddled with \u201cpoor management, lack of leadership, and ambiguous policies and procedures.\u201d On Friday, investigators ruled out a faulty refrigerator as the cause of last week\u2019s fire. Earlier in the week, officials had said the refrigerator and other appliances were being examined as possible causes. But Jill Snyder, a federal agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\u00a0Firearms and Explosives, said\u00a0that electronics engineers had ruled out the refrigerator. The cause remains under investigation, but Snyder said it\u2019s possible a definitive cause might never be known. She also said there was no evidence the blaze was intentionally set. Questions over the inspection records of the warehouse sparked mixed reactions in Oakland. Some residents feared that the fire will lead to a crackdown on housing like the Ghost Ship, causing low-income residents to be evicted with nowhere to go. \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible lack of housing here,\" said Hannah da Cruz, 27, a fifth-generation Oakland resident. \u201cIt\u2019s really pushing out our true community members.\u201d Cruz, a student working on her doctorate in\u00a0clinical psychology who also works with traumatized children through art, said artists\u00a0are increasingly being priced out of traditional housing\u00a0and have little choice but to live in places like warehouses. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more expensive here,\u00a0and you get less and less. It leads to people living in a place like that,\u201d\u00a0she said.\u00a0 \u201cA huge culprit in this is the gentrification here. It's not just one inspector\u2019s fault.\u201d Nancy Lopez, 40, lives in an apartment building off International Boulevard just two streets away from the Ghost Ship. Lopez said she is concerned that the warehouse was not inspected more often. \u201cI know they\u2019re understaffed;\u00a0I know they\u2019re underbudgeted,\u201d\u00a0Lopez said. \u201cBut you have to have priorities.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Who\u2019s to blame for one of the worst fires in California history , Dakota Access pipeline opponents have claimed a big victory for now , Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , how will Hollywood speak to Trump\u2019s America , meet Wilbur Ross, the man Trump has tapped him to lead the U.S. Department of Commerce , and John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 .

Arlington police said in a statement Friday that three other officers resigned before the investigation was finished. Four other officers remain under investigation. The fired officers have the right to appeal the department\u2019s decision. The officers had been suspended in May after a review of officer activity in the field identified several individuals who claimed to have made traffic stops that actually never occurred. The department says its investigation confirmed that no fictitious citations were issued. Officials did not indicate why the traffic reports were falsified. The police department says its findings have been sent to the Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Stream these classic Kirk Douglas films for his 100th birthday The speeches: Son Michael Douglas praised his famous father. \"One of the things that I find most incredible about dad is the third act of his life,\" said Douglas, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0\"After all he accomplished in his professional career and what he's given for his country, at the point in his life where he's faced adversity, losing a son, having a helicopter crash, having a stroke, and what he's accomplished in this third act in his life, I find quite extraordinary.\" Kirk Douglas kept his remarks brief. \"I wonder who he was talking about? He said some nice things about someone I don't know,\" he said, joking that Michael Douglas was chosen to organize the proceedings because \"he has the most money.\" Comedian Don Rickles, left, laughs with actor Kirk Douglas at Douglas' 100th birthday party at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Friday. \u00a0(Photo: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) Rickles burn: Comic legend Rickles, 90, knocked Douglas'\u00a0good looks and physique saying that he had to hear the \"I'm Spartacus crap\" every day.

The Stanford band performs during halftime in a game against USC in Palo Alto in 2004. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Rong-Gong Lin II Contact Reporter The notoriously irreverent Stanford band will be suspended through next spring after administrators found \u201c a systemic cultural problem \u201d in the student group that has \u201cnot been taken seriously by the band or its leadership.\u201d The punishment requires the band to stop all activities, both on and off campus. Students who flout the order could be disciplined individually. \u201cNothing more will be accomplished without extreme consequences,\u201d a Stanford Organization Conduct Board panel concluded, finding that the band has failed to reform even after a probation period of more than a year. \u201cWe do not feel that the current leadership or membership is capable of creating the necessary cultural change,\u201d the panel said. \u201cWe feel there is a total lack of accountability and responsibility in the current organization.\u201d The Stanford band has been\u00a0infamous since the 1960s\u00a0and has been suspended before \u2014 in 1986, for urinating on the field , and in 2006, after being accused of\u00a0 trashing the trailer that had been its home. Before Friday\u2019s letter, the band\u00a0already had been under scrutiny over its behavior since 2012. In the spring of 2015 , Stanford barred the band from performing at away athletic events after finding it had violated university rules on alcohol, controlled substances, hazing and sexual harassment. \u201cViolations included a tradition in which a band member was given an alcoholic concoction intended to make that individual vomit publicly; an annual trip in which some band members used illegal substances; and a band selection process in which individuals were asked a number of inappropriate questions on sexual matters,\u201d a university statement said at the time. But violations have continued, and administrators are steaming. \u201cWe are concerned about the risk and liability to the university community, and to Stanford\u2019s reputation, if Band\u2019s conduct and behaviors continue,\u201d the panel wrote. The panel had urged a more severe punishment \u2014 suspending the band through 2018 \u2014 but Stanford Vice Provost Greg Boardman said in a letter that such a sentence could permanently cripple the student group and make it unable to recover. Boardman said he wants to end the current student-managed band structure and introduce a professional music director who will have final control over the organization. He said such a model was used for more than 30 years without stifling the band\u2019s unique character. The band can appeal Boardman\u2019s decision on the punishment with the Stanford provost. An editorial posted on the Stanford Review website, a student political magazine, called Boardman\u2019s decision unfair\u00a0and quoted anonymous band members disputing the university\u2019s accusations and arguing it had worked to reform its ways. \u201cIf the administration continues to eviscerate our traditions, what campus culture will even remain?\u201d the editorial board wrote.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper briefed senators on the latest intelligence in a closed-door meeting last week, and he described the latest findings on the intentions of the Russian government with regard to the hacks and other interference in the U.S. presidential election, according to the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence. A Washington Post report published online Friday night first described how the intelligence community has reached a \"consensus\" that Russia intervened in the presidential election to help Trump win \u2014 not just try to sow chaos and undermine the electoral process. The New York Times confirmed the story, as has NBC News. Related: U.S. Intel Agencies Preparing Dossier to Prove Russian Hacks The president-elect's transition team responded by impugning the CIA's integrity in a statement Friday, calling the spy agency \"the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Trump has repeatedly said he does not accept the findings of the spy agencies he will soon lead. They say Russia was behind hacks of Democratic email accounts and other efforts that appeared to harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy. In October, the U.S. government said that all 17 intelligence agencies agreed Russia was behind the cyber-attacks just before the November election, and that the goal was \"to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" Now, the Congressional official told NBC News, new intelligence suggests that Russia's goal was to elect Trump, who broke from Republican orthodoxy during the campaign with several sympathetic statements about a Russian regime that has seized a neighbor's territory and is accused of killing political opponents. Senators were briefed last week on the secret CIA assessment, the source said, confirming reports in the Post and Times. In an interview Saturday with MSNBC's Joy Reid, outgoing Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who was among those briefed, accused FBI director James Comey of withholding information about the Russian campaign from the public. He said Comey should resign. Play ",

The 64-year-old veteran oil executive has no government or diplomatic experience, although he has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The pick would put to rest weeks-long speculation of who would earn the post as the U.S.'s top diplomat, and would place Tillerson fourth in line to the presidency. He will also be paired with former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton as his deputy secretary of state, one of the sources added, with Bolton handling day-to-day management of the department. Chairman and CEO of US oil and gas corporation ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, speaks during the 2015 Oil and Money conference in central London on Oct. 7, 2015. Ben Stansall / AFP/Getty Images The sources cautioned that nothing is final until the president-elect officially announces it, which could happen as early as next week. Tillerson, who was once dubbed \"T.Rex\" by Sarah Palin, met Saturday with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, the president-elect's spokesperson confirmed. In a pre-taped interview set to air Sunday on Fox News, Trump discussed why a businessman such as Tillerson would be a good fit as America's chief diplomat. \"Well, in his case, he's much more than a business executive, I mean he's a world-class player,\" Trump said, acknowledging Tillerson's relationship with Russia through his business dealings. \"To me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\" Trump added. \"He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company \u2014 not for himself, for the company.\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said no official announcement on the secretary of state pick is expected until \"next week at the earliest.\" Transition Update: No announcements on Secretary of State until next week at the earliest. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain \u2014 Jason Miller (@JasonMillerinDC) December 10, 2016 Tillerson, of Wichita Falls, Texas, has already notified his corporate board about taking on the new role, sources told NBC News. He is set to retire from ExxonMobil next year since the company has a mandatory retirement age of 65, Reuters reported. He has never previously worked in government, but reportedly holds conservative political views. Tillerson has made tens of thousands of dollars worth of political donations over the past two decades to Republican groups and candidates, including to President George W. Bush and former Texas Gov. Jeb Bush, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tillerson backed Jeb Bush during the GOP presidential primary and did not donate to Trump's campaign. Little is known about where he stands on foreign policy, and as secretary of state, he would have to hit the ground running on major issues. Among them: handling the nuclear agreement with Iran that the Obama administration made in 2015; the sanctions imposed on Russia; disputes with China and North Korea; the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria; and rebuilding Afghanistan and Iraq.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 10, 2016 7:17 PM EST ISTANBUL --\u00a0Two explosions hit Saturday night outside a major soccer stadium in Istanbul, after fans had gone home. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement saying \u201cunfortunately we have martyrs and wounded\u201d but did not specify the number. A Turkish government source told CBS News that 15 were dead and 69 wounded. Report: At least 13 dead in Istanbul bombings The private NTV channel reported that the target of the first attack was a bus for riot police. One of the blasts was thought to be a car bomb, while the second appeared to be a suicide bomber.\u00a0 Police cordoned off the area as smoke rose from behind the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium, known colloquially as Besiktas Stadium after the local team and neighborhood. Witnesses also heard gunfire after the explosions. The first and larger explosion took place about 10:30 p.m. after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Officials gave no immediate details on the nature of the second explosion, which sounded like it came from the same area. A video posted on social media appeared to show the moment of the blast with a fireball rising from the ground in the distance. It was followed several seconds later by a series of violent booms. \u00a0 Patlama an\u0131 amat\u00f6r kameraya b\u00f6yle yans\u0131d\u0131. #patlama pic.twitter.com/YniRkDWuKX \u2014 Be\u015fikta\u015f \u00e7Ar\u015f\u0131 (@BesiktascArsi) December 10, 2016 The big question is who might be responsible if it is indeed what it looks like: a terror attack, CBS News\u2019 Holly Williams reported from Istanbul. Turkey over the last couple of years has suffered a spate of suicide and car\u00a0 bombings -- some attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) and others carried out by Kurdish militants. ISIS released an audio recording earlier this week calling on its followers to attack Turkish interests wherever possible, including security, military and the media, Williams reports. The U.S. Consul General in Istanbul, Jennifer L. Davis, issued a statement to CBS News calling the bombings acts of terrorism. \u201cThe United States condemns tonight\u2019s cowardly attack and stands with the people of Turkey in the fight against terrorism,\u201d the statement read.\u00a0 However, there was no immediate claim of responsibility either from ISIS or any other group or individual. In cases of terror attacks carried out by Kurdish militants over the last couple of years, security forces and the police have been a frequent target. \u201cIt is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left,\u201d Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying by Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency. He said the explosion took place on a hill adjacent to and overlooking the stadium. Turkish policemen at the site of an explosion in central Istanbul, Turkey, Dec. 10, 2016. Close REUTERS Television images showed more than a dozen ambulances on a street hugging the stadium and a police helicopter flying overhead with its searchlights on. The window glass of nearby buildings was shattered by the blasts and coated the pavement. Investigators, including Istanbul Police Chief Mustafa Caliskan, were quickly on the scene. The Besiktas sports club \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d terrorism and the attack in a statement posted on its website. Bursaspor said none of the wounded were fans and issued a statement saying \u201cwe wish a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\u201d Turkey\u2019s radio and television board issued a temporary coverage ban citing national security concerns. It said \u201cto avoid broadcasts that can result in public fear, panic or chaos, or that will serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\u201d \u00a0 Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin were also notified about the attack, Anadolu said.\u00a0 Police arrive at the site of an explosion in central Istanbul, Turkey, Dec. 10, 2016.

President-elect Donald Trump speaks to a crowd in Cincinnati on Dec. 1. (John Minchillo / Associated Press) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Tensions between Donald Trump and U.S. intelligence officials boiled over Saturday\u00a0as Trump's transition team mockingly compared a\u00a0secret CIA assessment that Russia\u00a0tried to sway the U.S. election in Trump's favor to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgments on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction.\u00a0\u00a0 The widening public rift\u00a0between the incoming president and the\u00a0nation\u2019s powerful intelligence community\u00a0could pose high-risk problems both\u00a0for his administration and for national security. \u00a0 CIA leaders at agency headquarters in Langley, Va., are bracing for a potentially adversarial relationship with Trump\u2019s White House, especially over what the spy agency sees as Russia\u2019s malign role on multiple\u00a0fronts, according to two officials who  requested anonymity in speaking about internal discussions. \u201cIt sets up one of the great crises in the history of the executive branch,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a former senior CIA officer who spent more than two decades as a spy before retiring in 2007. \u201cAll the agency can do short of insurrection is to present the facts when allowed to the executive we serve.\u201d Trump has received only a handful of classified intelligence briefings since his upset victory last month,\u00a0and CIA officials now believe it is because Trump has rejected their assessments\u00a0on Moscow\u2019s\u00a0aggression in Ukraine, its pressure on\u00a0Eastern Europe and its computer hacks\u00a0to boost\u00a0Trump's chances against Hillary Clinton . Some compared the current tensions\u00a0to the distrust that marked relations with Vice President Dick Cheney before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, when he was widely seen as cherry-picking raw intelligence and pushing\u00a0agency analysts\u00a0to support his views. President Nixon had a famously frosty relationship with the CIA, which he considered too powerful and too\u00a0independent. President Clinton\u2019s\u00a0first CIA director, R. James Woolsey, was so disliked in the White House that he could barely get an appointment to see the president.\u00a0 Still, no other\u00a0incoming president has publicly\u00a0rejected\u00a0a major CIA\u00a0assessment about a\u00a0security threat, or declined regular classified briefings from officials representing\u00a0America\u2019s $70-billion-a-year global espionage and surveillance\u00a0apparatus.\u00a0 Nor has a transition team issued a statement\u00a0like the one it emailed\u00a0Saturday after the Washington Post reported that the CIA had concluded\u00a0that Russian President\u00a0 Vladimir Putin \u2019s government had authorized the hacking and leaking of Democratic Party emails this year in a deliberate effort to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances.\u00a0 \u00a0\"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said, referring to the\u00a0misjudgments and mistakes used to justify the  invasion of Iraq, a systemic intelligence failure that badly tarnished the\u00a0CIA\u2019s reputation. The Trump team\u2019s\u00a0statement went on to say that the Nov. 8 election \u201cended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history,\u201d a claim that is untrue.\u00a0 Eight of the 12 most recent presidential\u00a0elections\u00a0have been decided with a larger electoral college victory. And unlike most elections, Trump lost the popular vote.\u00a0 Inside the CIA, career analysts have been mystified by Trump\u2019s repeated dismissal of evidence that Russia hacked into Democratic National Committee emails and copied communications from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Trump\u2019s pick for national security advisor, retired three-star Army Gen.\u00a0 Michael Flynn , whom the Obama administration\u00a0fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\u00a0 Flynn\u2019s tenure there was rocky, in part because he ordered aides to chase pet theories that quickly became known as\u00a0\u201cFlynn facts,\u201d since they were not grounded in reality. Trump\u2019s choice to run the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), an aerospace entrepreneur and former Army officer, could get caught in the middle.\u00a0 Pompeo developed a rapport with CIA leaders as a member of\u00a0the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0panel that oversees the agency. Pompeo, who graduated first in his class at West Point,\u00a0has a reputation as a\u00a0quick study and an advocate for the CIA. Now he will take over an agency that\u00a0has been openly criticized by his\u00a0future boss, the president-elect. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be in an awkward spot when he is called to give a lay-down on Russia or some other topic,\u201d\u00a0a former senior national security official who has advised Trump\u2019s transition team said in an interview.\u00a0 CIA analysts will expect Pompeo to relay their unvarnished\u00a0view\u00a0but Trump may not want to hear it, the former official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u00a0 Trump has repeatedly said that he doesn\u2019t believe that\u00a0Russia tried to interfere in the election, has praised Putin and has called for closer relations with the Kremlin. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week. The hacking, he said, \u201ccould be Russia. It could be China. And it could be some guy in New Jersey.\u201d U.S. agencies believe they have identified\u00a0who in the Russian government was involved in ordering operations to disrupt the U.S. election\u00a0and how they were\u00a0orchestrated. They\u00a0are reluctant to make the information public because that\u00a0could compromise how the intelligence was gathered, a U.S. official said, speaking on\u00a0condition of anonymity.\u00a0 The FBI is still investigating the Russian\u00a0hacks\u00a0and have yet to find that\u00a0a U.S. citizen\u00a0assisted them, the official said. Rep. Adam B. Schiff \u00a0(D-Burbank), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump is not disregarding\u00a0the intelligence because he has examined the information and\u00a0disagrees with how\u00a0it was interpreted. Rather, he said, Trump\u00a0has rejected it because \u201cit doesn't fit with the political narrative he wants to tell.\u201d That doesn't bode well for how Trump will act as president. \"He is willing to disparage the intelligence community when it benefits him,\" Schiff said.\u00a0 On Friday, the White House said that\u00a0President Obama had\u00a0ordered the CIA and other intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of foreign-based digital attacks aimed at influencing the election. Obama ordered the review completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20, in what appeared to be an attempt to ensure the incoming administration doesn\u2019t kill the inquiry.

Obama has ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review on suspected election-season hacking by Russians. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Russian President President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 28, 2015, at United Nations headquarters. Obama has ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review on suspected election-season hacking by Russians. (Andrew Harnik / AP) Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, Greg MillerThe Washington Post The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton's chances. \"It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,\" said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. \"That's the consensus view.\" President Barack Obama 's administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton's campaign. In September, during a secret briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell \u00a0of Kentucky voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to officials present. The Trump transition team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again,' \" the statement read. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community's findings about Russian hacking. \"I don't believe they interfered\" in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, \"could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now \"quite clear\" that electing Trump was Russia's goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The CIA presentation to senators about Russia's intentions fell short of a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U.S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency's assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered. For example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin \"directing\" the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U.S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were \"one step\" removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability. Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the \"Russian government is not the source.\" The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. On Friday, the White House said President Obama had ordered a \"full review\" of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process. \"We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,\" Obama's counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office Jan. 20, Monaco said. During her remarks, Monaco didn't address the latest CIA assessment, which hasn't been previously disclosed. Julian Assange Markus Schreiber / AP WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange participates via video link at a news conference marking the 10th anniversary of the secrecy-spilling group in Berlin, Germany, on Oct. 4, 2016. Assange denied Nov. 3 that the Russian government or any other \"state parties\"\u009d were his group's source for more than 50,000 hacked emails from the files of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.

(Markus Schreiber / AP) Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation. Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIA's presentation. This week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House also sent a letter to Obama, asking for briefings on Russian interference in the election. U.S. intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russia's motivations, reflecting the United States' long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on Russian President Vladimir Putin and those closest to him. In previous assessments, the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscow's aim was to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect Trump. On Oct. 7, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of \"political organizations.\" Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the computers of the DNC and other Democratic groups and individuals. Some key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement. Lisa Monaco Jeff Chiu / AP Homeland security and counterterrorism presidential adviser Lisa Monaco speaks Feb. 13, 2015, at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection in Stanford, Calif. Monaco says President Obama has ordered a review of the email hacking that rattled the presidential campaign and says intelligence and national security officials will report their findings to the president before he leaves office on Jan. 20, 2017.

Monaco says President Obama has ordered a review of the email hacking that rattled the presidential campaign and says intelligence and national security officials will report their findings to the president before he leaves office on Jan. 20, 2017. (Jeff Chiu / AP) \"I'll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there's clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence \u2014\u00a0even now,\" said Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. \"There's a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that's it.\" Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U.S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Moscow has attempted through cyber-means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaign. Within the administration, top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond. White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia, with sophisticated cybercapabilities, might have less to lose than the United States, with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructure. The White House's reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more limited measures, including the \"naming and shaming\" approach of publicly blaming Moscow. By mid-September, White House officials had decided it was time to take that step, but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposes.

(Mindaugas Kulbis / AP) Instead, officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12 \u2014\u00a0a group that includes House and Senate leaders, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers' committees on intelligence and homeland security. Obama dispatched Monaco, FBI Director James Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a \"show of solidarity and bipartisan unity\" against Russian interference in the election, according to a senior administration official. Specifically, the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusions. Though U.S. intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way, the White House feared that Russia would attempt to do so, sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow. In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U.S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia's role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals. And they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as \"the threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process.\" The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests. According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics.

    "text": "Trump team says 'move on,' after Obama calls for cyber-hacking probe Published               December 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition team late Friday criticized President Obama's order for a full-scale review of campaign-season cyber-attacks allegedly linked to Russia, saying it\u2019s \u201ctime to move on.\u201d Trump has been repeatedly dismissive of the intelligence community's determination that Russia sought through hacking to disrupt the U.S. election, which he won in a stunning upset over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and `Make America Great Again,\u2019 \u201d the transition team said. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d The investigation ordered by Obama will be a \"deep dive\" into a possible pattern of increased \"malicious cyber activity\" timed to the campaign season, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday. On Saturday, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, the next Senate minority leader, called for the Republican-led Congress to address the issue. \u201cReports of the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Russia actively sought to help elect Donald Trump are simultaneously stunning and not surprising, given Russia\u2019s disdain for democracy and admiration for autocracy,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cSenate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this.\u201d The administration probe will include looking into the email hacks that rattled the presidential campaign. It also will look at the tactics, targets, key actors and the U.S. government's response to the hacks, as well as incidents reported in past elections,. The president ordered the report earlier in the week and asked that it be completed before he leaves office next month, Schultz said. The Washington Post reported Friday that the CIA has concluded that Russia aimed specifically to help Trump, a Republican, win the presidency. The Kremlin has rejected the hacking accusations. In the months leading up to the election, email accounts of Democratic Party officials and a top Clinton campaign aide were breached, emails leaked and embarrassing and private emails posted online. Many Democrats believe the hackings benefited Trump's bid. Schultz said the president sought the probe as a way of improving U.S. defense against cyberattacks and was not intending to question the legitimacy of Trump's victory. Obama's move comes as Democratic lawmakers have been pushing Obama to declassify more information about Russia's role, fearing that Trump, who has promised a warmer relationship with Moscow, may not prioritize the issue. The White House said it would make parts of the report public and would brief lawmakers and relevant state officials on the findings. It emphasized the report would not focus solely on Russian operations or email hacks involving Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and Democratic National Committee accounts. The emails were made public by WikiLeaks. Schultz said intelligence officials would be reviewing incidents going back to the 2008 presidential campaign, when the campaigns of Sen. John McCain and Obama were breached by hackers. The intelligence community has already concluded that Russia-backed actors likely were involved in breaching and releasing the Democratic Party emails. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied the Russian government or any other \u201cstate parties\u201d were the source for the 50,000 emails, which fueled weeks of embarrassing coverage for the Clinton campaign detailing behind-the-scenes discussions and arguments among advisers and family members. Many Democrats believe the disclosures in emails stolen from Democratic Party officials and Podesta\u2019s account benefited Trump.\u00a0 Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Friday that Democrats \u201cwon\u2019t learn the lessons\u201d from the 2016 race. \"A little self-awareness would do for a team that is blaming everybody but themselves for this. It\u2019s Bernie Sanders\u2019 fault \u2026 It\u2019s the alt-right\u2019s fault,\" she said. \"It\u2019s \u2026 fake news\u2019 fault. It\u2019s Russian interference. It\u2019s James Comey. ... How about you had no message?\" Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson and Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story His connections to Russia are sure to come under scrutiny during a Senate confirmation hearing. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on Saturday that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s ties to Mr. Putin were \u201ca matter of concern to me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to examine it,\u201d he said on Fox News, adding that \u201cVladimir Putin is a thug, bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Tillerson\u2019s success in business gives him a major credential with Mr. Trump, who values that background, along with loyalty, above other traits. He would be one of several wealthy business executives in top administration jobs. Mr. Tillerson met with Mr. Trump for more than two hours on Saturday at Trump Tower in New York, and two of the president-elect\u2019s key advisers, his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Tillerson is in a \u201cdifferent league\u201d from his other options. But Mr. Trump is famously mercurial and could change his mind before making his final decision public. A transition spokesman, Jason Miller, declined to comment. Among the other contenders have been Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has discussed the possibility of appointing as deputy secretary John R. Bolton, a highly conservative and combative veteran of the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Trump has also spoken with Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a far more centrist figure. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest List. Mr. Tillerson, 64, has spent the past 41 years at Exxon, where he began as a production engineer and went on to strike deals around the world for a company that explores, buys and sells oil and gas in some of the globe\u2019s most troubled corners. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Tillerson will deal with many of the world leaders he encountered at Exxon, but with a very different agenda. In addition to an increasingly aggressive Russia, he will have to manage a raging war in Syria that has consumed the last year of diplomatic efforts by Secretary of State John Kerry, a rising China that is staking claims in the South China Sea, and a North Korea that is growing closer to being able to launch a nuclear-armed missile at the United States. The kind of deal-making diplomacy that Mr. Tillerson has excelled at is far different from the alliance-building required of a secretary of state, often without the incentive of profits for negotiating partners. Mr. Tillerson assumed the role of chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil in January 2006, and during his tenure the company acknowledged, for the first time, the science underlying climate change . It has said it supports the creation of a carbon tax, which most Republicans have opposed, and it also supported the Paris climate agreement, a major focus of Mr. Kerry\u2019s time in office. Mr. Trump has vowed to abandon the climate pact. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In May, Mr. Tillerson told shareholders that \u201cwe believe that addressing the risk of climate change is a global issue,\u201d adding that it would require the cooperation of governments, businesses and individuals. Executives at Exxon describe Mr. Tillerson as a strong leader, accustomed to making decisions and giving orders. Some have expressed surprise that he would be interested in the job of secretary of state, because he would not be the final decision maker. A native of Wichita Falls, Tex., Mr. Tillerson speaks with a strong Texas twang and is known for quoting Boy Scout creeds. If he has faced a failure as a leader of Exxon, it was that he was slow to invest in the oil and gas shale fields around Texas and North Dakota. Preferring to invest in big, expensive projects around the world, he left the shale fields open to smaller, more nimble independent companies. When he finally bought TXU, a shale gas-producing company, in 2009 for over $30 billion, he did so when natural gas prices were at a peak. After paying a premium for the company, Exxon\u2019s earnings have suffered in recent years. Still, in total, Mr. Tillerson has excelled in the somewhat rigid atmosphere inside Exxon. Steve Coll, the author of \u201c Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power ,\u201d noted in 2012 that Mr. Tillerson presided over a company that had succeeded \u201cwhere the question is numbers, or engineering effectiveness, or worker safety performance.\u201d \u201cBut when the question involves the human factor, building trust with your communities where you\u2019re drilling, or convincing people that fracking is not going to ruin their water, or dealing with political environments in 150 different countries with lots of supply problems, or dealing with violence on the ground around your oil fields in Africa \u2014 in all of those areas, I think they have a habit of not really taking anybody\u2019s advice,\u201d Mr. Coll said.

    "text": "Credit Shaw Nielsen How the Twinkie Made the Superrich Even Richer Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era. By MICHAEL CORKERY and BEN PROTESS DEC. 10, 2016 As fans gathered on Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, Al Roker pulled up in a big red delivery truck, ready to give America what it wanted: Twinkies. The snack cakes flew through the air into the crowd pressed against metal barriers. One man shoved cream-filled treats into his mouth. Another \u201cToday\u201d host tucked Twinkies into the neckline of her dress. Across the nation in the summer of 2013, there was a feeding frenzy for Twinkies. The iconic snack cake returned to shelves just months after Hostess had shuttered its bakeries and laid off thousands of workers. The return was billed on \u201cToday\u201d as \u201cthe sweetest comeback in the history of ever.\u201d Nowhere was it sweeter, perhaps, than at the investment firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, which spent $186 million in cash to buy some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake bakeries and brands in early 2013. Less than four years later, they sold the company in a deal that valued Hostess at $2.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos have now reaped a return totaling 13 times their original cash investment. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives like those at Apollo have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era. Deals like Hostess have helped make the men running the six largest publicly traded private equity firms collectively the highest-earning executives of any major American industry, according to a joint study that The Times conducted with Equilar , a board and executive data provider. The study covered thousands of publicly traded companies; privately held corporations do not report such data. Continue reading the main story Meet These Very High-Earning Private Equity Executives A joint study by The New York Times and Equilar, a board and executive data provider, examined the annual take-home pay of the top-ranking executives at the six private equity firms that are publicly traded. The findings were compared with a number of other industries, including large technology firms and banks. On average, the heads of the private equity firms earned nearly 10 times as much as the heads of banks. 2015 earnings for each top executive from his private equity firm DIVIDENDS AND For the eight executives above $138,947,699 For six chief executives of top banks\u2020 $23,365,197 The median and average for the eight executives above 2015 earnings for each top executive from his private equity firm KKR SALARY, BONUS, STOCK AND PERKS Antony P.

Blankfein (Goldman Sachs); John G. Stumpf (Wells Fargo); James P. Gorman (Morgan Stanley); Michael L. Corbat (Citigroup); Brian T. Moynihan (Bank of America) Source: Equilar | By Karl Russell/The New York Times Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone, took home the largest haul last year: nearly $800 million. He and other private equity executives receive more annually than the leaders of Facebook and Apple, companies that revolutionized the way society communicates. The top executives at those six publicly traded private equity firms earned, on average, $211 million last year \u2014 which is about what Leon Black, a founder of Apollo, received. That amount was nearly 10 times what the average bank chief executive earned, though firms like Apollo face less public scrutiny on pay than banks do. Private equity firms note that much of their top executives\u2019 wealth stems from owning their own stock and that they have earned their fortunes bringing companies back to life by applying their operational and financial expertise. Hostess, a defunct snack brand that was quickly returned to profitability, is a textbook example of the success of this approach. Yet even as private equity\u2019s ability to generate huge profits is indisputable, the industry\u2019s value to the work force and the broader economy is still a matter of debate. Hostess, which has bounced between multiple private equity owners over the last decade, shows how murky the jobs issue can be. In 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy under the private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. Months later, with Ripplewood having lost control and the company\u2019s creditors in charge, Hostess was shut down and its workers sent home for good. Without investment from Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess brands and all those jobs might have vanished forever after the bankruptcy. The way these firms see it, they created a new company and new jobs with higher pay and generous bonuses. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the new Hostess employs only 1,200 people, a fraction of the roughly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs at Hostess\u2019s snack cake business during the 2012 bankruptcy. And some Hostess employees who got their jobs back lost them again. Under Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess shut down one of the plants they reopened in Illinois, costing 415 jobs. The collapse and revival of Hostess illustrates how even in a business success, many workers don\u2019t share in the gains. The episode also provides a snapshot of the economic forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the White House.

Credit Laura McDermott for The New York Times Such frustrations stem from broader shifts in the economy, as all types of companies turn to automation to cut costs and labor unions lose their influence. While these changes have helped keep companies profitable, private equity has used these shifts in the workplace to supercharge wealth far beyond that of the typical chief executive. And yet, Mr. Trump did not focus on private equity on the campaign trail, instead blaming the plight of the American working class on a shadowy cabal of elitist Democrats and Wall Street bankers who support trade deals that ship jobs overseas. \u201cPeople understand jobs going to China,\u201d said Michael Hillard, an economics professor at the University of Southern Maine. \u201cBut no one has ever heard of these private equity firms that come in and do all this financial engineering. It is much more complicated and less visible.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The industry\u2019s trade group, the American Investment Council, says it is sensitive to these issues as private equity\u2019s role in the economy expands. The industry now controls huge swaths of the American work force: 4.4 million employees at over 7,500 companies, according to PitchBook, a private financial data platform. By some measures, Blackstone is one of the nation\u2019s 10 largest employers and one of its biggest landlords. The firm\u2019s co-founder, Mr. Schwarzman, is advising Mr. Trump on job creation. \u201cAt a time when many Americans are concerned about the country\u2019s economic viability, private equity has proven itself in communities throughout the United States as an effective solution,\u201d said James Maloney, the American Investment Council\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSustainable growth strategies, adherence to responsible investments and a long-view approach are all a part of the present-day private equity model.\u201d The Times investigation of the Hostess deal shows that today\u2019s private equity also uses another set of tactics, like special dividends and tax arrangements, that maximize profits in creative, yet financially risky ways. Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life. A year after the layoffs at the Hostess plant in Illinois, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for the company to borrow about $1.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos used most of that sum to pay themselves, and their investors, an early dividend on their investment. The firms also found a way to make money even after the company was sold. The firms, The Times investigation found, struck a deal to collect as much as $400 million over the next 15 years, based on what Hostess\u2019s future tax savings might be. These winnings do not come without risk to the private equity firms, which are often taking a gamble on troubled companies, and when they fail, the firms probably lose out. And this is not a simple story of powerful investors enriching themselves while some workers struggle. Teachers and firefighters also benefit from private equity. Pension funds that pay retirement benefits to public servants now depend on private equity to generate huge returns. Without it, taxpayers could bear more of the costs.

Cheese\u2019s. Photo Hostess Brands marked the resurrection of Twinkies in July 2013, handing out the snacks free from a truck in New York. Credit Scott Eells/Bloomberg Hostess\u2019s new owners rode a wave of nostalgia for the company\u2019s snack cakes, a euphoria that even spread to a sprawling Long Island estate . At a wedding there in 2013, packaged cupcakes were offered to guests. It may seem an unusual choice, but this party had a special affinity for the snack cake. The bride\u2019s father is an executive at Apollo. The \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019 Leon Black grew up in a family that had a home in Westport, Conn., and an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard Business School. But when Mr. Black traveled to Lubbock, Tex., to speak to a group of retired teachers, he emphasized a humbler side of his pedigree. \u201cYou should know,\u201d Mr. Black said, according to a video recording of the February 2012 meeting, \u201cmy mother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my brother-in-law is a teacher. We have a lot of teachers in our family.\u201d Mr. Black had good reason to flatter the retirees: Pension funds for teachers and other public workers are some of the biggest investors in Apollo\u2019s funds and have helped make Mr. Black a very rich man.

This year, he bought the $38 million house in Beverly Hills that had belonged to the actor Tom Cruise. Private equity\u2019s relationship with pension funds is mutually beneficial. As countless baby boomers reach retirement at a time of historically low interest rates, public pension funds need to achieve returns that match their liabilities \u2014 and private equity has delivered. Nearly half of private equity\u2019s invested assets now come from public and private pensions around the world. Private equity uses this pension fund money to place bets on companies like Hostess, and Texas teachers have shared in the profits from the deal. Photo Fran Plemmons is a former president of the retired teachers association in Texas. The state\u2019s teacher retirement system has invested in the fund that owns Hostess Brands and done very well, a boon to retirees at a time of rock-bottom interest rates. Credit Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times The Teacher Retirement System of Texas has invested in the fund that bought Hostess. And that fund has reaped 27 percent net during the three years it owned Hostess, significantly more than the stock market returned in that period. \u201cYou need to get people in whom you trust and who will keep up our fund,\u201d said Fran Plemmons, a former president of the Texas Retired Teachers Association who was a teacher and principal for 25 years. \u201cIf they do that, you need to get out of the way.\u201d Ms. Plemmons said her $31,200 yearly pension allows her to live modestly but comfortably. High returns from private equity investments, she said, help keep pension payments flowing to retired school workers across Texas, which trickles down into the local economy. For the teachers in Lubbock, Mr. Black described the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind its success: buying the debt of financially troubled companies or purchasing an entire company. The investments, he said, are \u201cvalue-oriented, if not contrarian.\u201d Hostess fit that formula. Not only were Americans turning to healthier snacks and eating less junk food, but Hostess had its own challenges. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2012, the baking company had gone through a bruising bankruptcy, its second in a decade. The company laid off most of its 18,500 unionized drivers, loaders and bakers, not long after the bakers\u2019 union voted for a companywide strike rather than accept another round of concessions. The Rich History of Twinkies Continue Reading \u00bb But what was disaster for previous owners looked like treasure to Apollo and Metropoulos. When Hostess lenders auctioned off the company in early 2013, Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake brands, which included Twinkies and Ding Dongs. Snack cakes still produced some of the highest profit margins in the food industry and Hostess cakes were particularly well-known. The bankruptcy also provided Apollo and Metropoulos a clean slate, liberating them from union contracts, labor rules and debt and pension payments. One group of workers who had no place at the new Hostess: the unionized drivers, who transported snack cakes and bread to grocery stores nationwide. Now, Hostess would send its baked goods to warehouses, where retailers like Walmart would ship to individual stores. Ronald Litland, 44, delivered Hostess products in Illinois for 10 years. After he was laid off in 2012, he enrolled in a for-profit college in hopes of finding a new career in information technology. When his unemployment benefits ran out, he delivered pizzas. He never finished school, but is still paying back student loans and taking care of his son. \u201cI have a hard time making ends meet,\u201d said Mr. Litland, who earns about $24,000 a year. Like the drivers, Hostess\u2019s baking operation was also cut back. Apollo and Metropoulos chose to buy only a handful of its roughly one dozen snack cake bakeries. Other parts of the former Hostess baking empire were scaled back as well. Food companies picked off some of Hostess\u2019s bread brands, but reopened only a small fraction of the bakeries. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before being laid off from Hostess, Mr. Popovich made about $20 an hour. Every year, he went on vacation in the Bahamas or St. Martin. His health insurance covered the $385,000 cost when his wife needed major surgery. \u201cI lived a good life,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, whose most recent job driving a forklift at a solar panel plant paid about $16 an hour. Mr. Popovich is also entitled to a pension, which he was promised after working more than two decades at Hostess. But he recently received a letter at his home in Toledo, Ohio, warning that the pension fund was nearly insolvent. Apollo and Metropoulos are not obligated to contribute to the pension fund, which is managed by a labor union. Nor do they have to pay the severance that Hostess was obligated to pay Mr. Popovich when he was laid off. Those liabilities were wiped out in the bankruptcy. New Shoes and Dashed Hopes At a brick bakery in Schiller Park, Ill., Twinkies started rolling off the line nearly a century ago. And when Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s cake plants and brands out of bankruptcy in 2013, Schiller Park\u2019s plant was one of the fortunate few to reopen. Photo C. Dean Metropoulos, in suit, celebrated the comeback of Twinkies with workers at the plant in Schiller Park, Ill., in July 2013.

The celebration was short-lived. Just over a year after the plant\u2019s grand reopening, Hostess shut it down. The fallout was swift. All 415 employees were fired, some for the second time in two years. Schiller Park lost one of its largest employers, creating a ripple effect through this tiny working-class suburb of Chicago. The plant itself, an institution so old that it predated nearby O\u2019Hare International Airport, was suddenly vacant. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe got our hopes up again,\u201d said the town\u2019s mayor, Barbara J. Piltaver. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, we had a big hit.\u201d The story behind the rise and fall \u2014 and fall again \u2014 of the Schiller Park plant encapsulates private equity\u2019s relationship with workers and labor unions. It\u2019s a complicated issue. A prominent study of investments across the country concluded that private equity has increased productivity while leading to a minor overall decline in jobs relative to the broader economy. Private equity\u2019s trade group says its o wn analysis of county demographics found that private equity investment increases jobs growth in local economies, though the data was limited. In Schiller Park, Janice Ryan worked at the Hostess plant for about 20 years before the 2012 bankruptcy. She walked to work from her nearby home. And she was relieved to return, after several months of unemployment, to be part of what many workers believed was the company\u2019s long-term comeback. Schiller Park was a starting point for getting Twinkies back on the shelves by summer 2013. As part of that push, many Schiller Park employees worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, and could volunteer for a seventh day. Photo Mayor Barbara J. Piltaver of Schiller Park, Ill., a working-class community of 12,000.

What the workers were never told, however, was that Apollo and Metropoulos had no plans to keep Schiller Park in operation over the long term. \u201cSchiller, in essence, was a contingency plan, opened only to ensure that initial demand could be met,\u201d Hannah Arnold, a Hostess spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added that the setup of the bakery \u2014 its low ceilings and lack of a loading dock \u2014 was not conducive to the company\u2019s future plans. The company says it could not tell workers of its plans because of labor rules. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The expendability of Schiller Park reflects Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s plans to run a more efficient operation than their predecessors did. And that model requires far fewer workers than the one that existed for decades. In 2012, Hostess had about 8,000 employees and eight bakeries dedicated exclusively to snack cakes. Six other plants produced at least some desserts. Today, the new Hostess has only three plants and 1,200 workers. At Schiller Park, some workers earned a dollar less per hour than what workers were paid under the previous owners. Others earned more, the company said. Still, they qualified for bonuses, owed no union dues and received health insurance and dental care. Instead of pensions, they were enrolled in 401(k) plans. Former employees recalled grueling shifts when temperatures inside the plant neared 110 degrees. The workers were given Gatorade to rehydrate.

She said she wore scarves and heavy gloves under her work garments. Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, noted that prospective employees answered a questionnaire about whether they were willing to work in \u201cextreme seasonal temperatures.\u201d The company said it spent about $100,000 upgrading the heating and air-conditioning system, but stopped short of a total overhaul. There were other hazards as well. In 2014, Todd Kemp was injured after heaps of Twinkie mix spilled on the factory floor, causing him to slip and injure his shoulder, back and knee. He has since had four operations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Arnold said Apollo and Metropoulos inherited old equipment, some of it in disrepair, adding that Schiller Park \u201cwas in the worst condition of the four bakeries by far.\u201d C. Dean Metropoulos, the billionaire Greek immigrant whose firm has invested in other well-known food brands like Vlasic pickles and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, personally oversaw the upgrading and cleaning of the facility, Ms. Arnold said. \u201cHe also focused on ensuring workers had new uniforms and better shoes, to make long days standing more comfortable,\u201d she said. Over the long term, Apollo and Metropoulos looked outside Schiller Park to generate profits. Hostess employed \u201cextended shelf-life technology\u201d to make the Twinkie, already jokingly thought to be capable of surviving nuclear war, even more everlasting. The company perfected its secret recipe until it contained the right amount of enzymes to better retain moisture. The enzymes extended shelf life of some products to 65 days from 26 days.

Bukaty/Associated Press The company also turned to automation. At a plant in Emporia, Kan., Hostess installed an automated baking system that churned out more cakes with fewer workers. William Toler, Hostess\u2019s chief executive, said the company spent more than $140 million \u201cto get the business up and running, and certainly our results suggest we made very good choices.\u201d The Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga., had another advantage: government subsidies. The state\u2019s economic development agency provided Hostess with tax credits to push along the deal. The Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs.

Hostess said it also received incentives from Emporia, the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis. Employment totals at those plants have since increased. Hostess did not receive any incentives in Illinois. Three workers interviewed by The Times said they believed that the final straw for Schiller Park was when they voted to rejoin a union. Hostess fought the effort. The company plastered the plant with posters urging workers to vote \u201cno.\u201d The union prevailed, but not for long. Around the time union officials had planned to start contract negotiations in August 2014, Hostess announced it was shutting down the Schiller Park plant.

Credit Tannen Maury/European Pressphoto Agency Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, said the unionization vote did not factor into the decision to close Schiller Park. Employees, she said, were provided severance and an opportunity to apply for a Hostess job in another state. Union officials declined to comment. Since then, unions have made limited inroads at Hostess. Whereas 83 percent of the work force was unionized in 2012, Hostess recently said in a securities filing that about 30 percent of employees belonged to a union in Indianapolis and Columbus. Its flagship facility, Emporia, is not unionized. \u201cBoth Apollo and Metropoulos have owned and operated numerous companies that had union employees,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, adding that \u201cMetropoulos has always enjoyed good, working relations with unions and their members.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Money-Making Machine For all the profits Apollo and Metropoulos squeezed out of the Hostess factories, a deal hatched in a hotel room on Fifth Avenue in New York shows how private equity can have its snack cake and eat it, too. There, in the Versailles Room at the St. Regis, Apollo and Metropoulos began the process of extracting returns from the company, less than a year after shutting the Schiller Park plant. Most investors seeking profit have to wait for the right moment to sell a company or take it public. But private equity uses a different playbook. First, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for Hostess to borrow money from the banking giant Credit Suisse. The two firms then pocketed about $900 million of that money for themselves and their investors. Hostess, meanwhile, is stuck repaying the debt. This type of deal is known as a dividend recapitalization, and it is a staple of private equity\u2019s money-making strategy. These deals provide private equity firms an opportunity to profit before they even sell a company, an added bonus to the firms and their investors, including public pensioners. Since 2012, private equity firms have arranged hundreds of such deals, totaling over $148 billion in debt, according to Thomson Reuters. Hostess\u2019s dividend deal was the third largest of 2015. This financial engineering is crucial to private equity\u2019s success \u2014 and to building the personal fortunes of the industry\u2019s executives. With each dividend recapitalization, more money pours into Apollo, which then flows to the firm\u2019s executives. Photo The demolition of the Schiller Park, Ill., Hostess plant in October. The bakery was closed for good in 2014. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times It comes with risks. Of all the companies that carried out dividend recapitalizations since 2012, about 10 percent have faced a credit rating downgrade within six months of the deal, according to LCD/S&P Global Market Intelligence and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings, which notes that many factors could lead to a downgrade, including excessive debt. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Although Hostess has not been downgraded, it now describes itself in public filings as \u201chighly leveraged.\u201d Mr. Toler, the Hostess chief, said that even after the dividend payout, the company \u201chad plenty of capital to work with.\u201d At the same time it was paying dividends to investors, Hostess earmarked $8 million to pay bonuses to workers, including those in the bakeries. A few months after the dividend deal, Apollo and Metropoulos entered into negotiations to sell the company. Instead of being sold outright, Hostess would be acquired by a shell company , created by another private equity firm, the Gores Group. And still, they arranged more ways to profit. Apollo and Metropoulos retained a combined 42 percent stake in the company, which is now publicly traded. After investing only $186 million in cash when they bought the company in 2013 (they took out debt to help finance the rest of the $410 million deal), Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s investment is now worth 13 times that initial cash investment. Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black\u2019s pocket is a byzantine task. Mr. Black collected a $100,000 salary and no bonus in 2015. How did Mr. Black, on such a relatively modest salary, come to acquire an art collection that is said to include one of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201c Scream\u201d series, which he bought in 2012 for about $120 million, then the highest price ever paid for a painting? Advertisement Continue reading the main story The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries. Mr. Black\u2019s share of the Hostess profits, from the partial sale and the $900 million in cash they pulled out of the company, will be reflected in a series of distributions he collects from Apollo\u2019s publicly traded stock. The size of the distribution depends on the size of the profits from deals like Hostess. Last year, Mr. Black\u2019s distributions totaled $181 million. Photo Leon Black, chief of Apollo Global Management. Credit SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg Other shareholders in Apollo \u2014 which include money managers like Fidelity \u2014 also receive these distributions. But Mr. Black, as the largest shareholder of a company he co-founded in 1990, gets the largest payout. While Mr. Black receives the most money at Apollo, one of his partners and co-founders, Joshua Harris, took home $121 million last year. Mr. Harris is part owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils. Mr. Black has noted that if Apollo\u2019s investments fail to make money, then its executives also miss out. Like most private equity firms, Apollo collects a management fee from investors and earns 20 percent of profits from the firm\u2019s investments, once its investors recoup their original money and reap profits of their own. Private equity\u2019s advantages don\u2019t end there. Apollo\u2019s share of the profits on Hostess or any deal ultimately flows to Mr. Black and his fellow shareholders in the company in ways that lower their tax burden. The industry\u2019s 20 percent cut of profits \u2014 also known as carried interest \u2014 is taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is roughly half the 40 percent ordinary income rate for the nation\u2019s highest earners. And since private equity executives receive much of their money from carried interest \u2014 or in the case of Mr. Black, distributions largely made up of carried interest \u2014 they enjoy a tax advantage over workers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is what\u2019s known as the \u201ccarried-interest loophole\u201d \u2014 a tax treatment held up during the presidential campaign as evidence that the rich fail to pay their fair share. Private equity managers argue that this treatment is not a loophole or even unique to private equity. Its use originated from the cut of profits that ship captains reaped for \u201ccarrying\u201d goods. In the Hostess deal, Apollo and Metropoulos found even more ways to use the tax code to their advantage. Continue reading the main story Photo The Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga.

Credit Melissa Golden for The New York Times The firms are entitled to collect a large portion of tax benefits that Hostess could earn well into the future. The idea is that by selling a stake in Hostess before they could realize these benefits, Apollo and Metropoulos could leave money on the table. These arrangements, which are now commonplace in private deals, allow the firms to collect cash from a company they may no longer own. The Hostess \u201ctax-receivable\u201d benefits, according to previously unreported securities filings and estimates by the Apollo spokesman, could provide Apollo and Metropoulos up to $400 million for the next 15 years or more. Looking out over those next 15 years, nothing seems guaranteed to Mr. Popovich, the former Hostess worker from Toledo. Right before Thanksgiving, Mr. Popovich was laid off from his most recent job at the solar panel plant. The idea of searching for work at age 58 is daunting. He has been sending out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but has not received a call back. \u201cIt\u2019s been four jobs in four years,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d Leslie Picker, Kitty Bennett and Sara Olkon contributed reporting.

The activist-run Palmyra Coordination network said the militants had nearly encircled the city and entered its northern and northwestern neighborhoods. The group, which maintains contacts inside the city, said ISIS fighters were approaching the city's UNESCO heritage site as well. Osama al-Khatib said government soldiers were fleeing Palmyra. \"The army as an institution has dissolved,\" he said. Some soldiers and militiamen remain in the city, along with 120 families who have not been able to leave, Khatib said. He spoke to The Associated Press from Gaziantep, Turkey. \"There is strong fighting on all sides,\" he reported. \"There is no exit except through a corridor to the west.\" The dramatic reversal in Palmyra comes days after ISIS militants in the Iraqi city of Mosul launched a major counterattack that surprised Iraqi soldiers, killing at least 20 and halting their advance. Iraqi special forces units have entered the eastern outskirts of the largest remaining ISIS-held city, but their advance has been greatly slowed by both a desire to limit civilian casualties and the resilience of the ISIS fighters. On Saturday U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that an additional 200 U.S. soldiers would be dispatched to Syria to accelerate the push on the self-declared ISIS capital of Raqqa. The 200, to include special operations troops, are in addition to 300 already authorized for the effort to recruit, organize, train and advise local Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces to fight ISIS. \"These uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL,\" Carter said, using an alternative acronym for the extremist group. \"By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we've been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum.\" In Palmyra, Mohammad Hassan Homsi of the Palmyra News Network reported that a military division withdrew from the city earlier Saturday without leaving a way out for civilians. According to Homsi, only 350 families had returned to the city of its original 30,000 inhabitants after the government retook the city to great fanfare in March. ISIS militants were shelling the government's military airport to the east of the city, according to the Coordination group. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militants reached the city's Tadmor Hospital and its wheat silos. The militants advanced on Palmyra after seizing several government positions, oil fields, and strategic hilltops in the surrounding countryside in a lightning three-day campaign. Earlier Saturday, the militants' Aamaq News Agency claimed the group shot down a government warplane in the Jazal oil fields west of the city. The Observatory said the jet had crashed for reasons unknown. It reported the militants had taken the oil fields. During the 10 months that ISIS held Palmyra, from May 2015 to March 2016, the militants dynamited several of the city's famed ancient Roman monuments and executed its archaeological director. After the city was retaken, the Russian government staged a classical music concert in the city's soaring Roman amphitheater last May to celebrate the success. The Syrian and Russian government maintain they are defending the global community against Islamic terrorism in the country's devastating five-1/2-year war. After taking Palmyra, the two states turned their attention to wiping out the internal opposition in Damascus and Aleppo, leaving the historic city relatively unguarded. Syrian state media had no comment. Advertisement ",

In photographs on social media, smoke was seen rising from behind the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium, known as Besiktas Stadium, after the local team and neighborhood. At least 20 people wounded by an explosion outside a football stadium in #Istanbul - Turkish interior minister says https://t.co/qNoFuHdMw3 \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) December 10, 2016 The blasts struck hours after the end of a match between two of Turkey's top teams, Reuters reported, quoting Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The first and larger explosion took place about 10:30 p.m. after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Officials gave no immediate details on the nature of the second explosion, which sounded like it came from the same area. \"A terrorist attack has been carried out against our security forces and our citizens. It has been understood that the explosions after the Besiktas-Bursaspor football game aimed to maximise casualties. As a result of these attacks unfortunately we have martyrs and wounded,\" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying it was a \"cruel plot.\" Soylu also said he would give a statement about the death toll later. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Istanbul has been the site of attacks attributed to ISIS and also to Kurdish militants in the last year.\u00a0 \u201cIt is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left,\u201d the Associated Press quoted Soylu as informing Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency. \u201cWe have no information on the number of dead. God willing we hope there won't be any. The wounded are police.\u201d Turkish Transport Minister Ahmet Arslan called the attack an act of terrorism on Twitter, Reuters reported.\u00a0 Armed police sealed off streets around the Vodafone Arena, home to the Besiktas soccer team. Related Image Turkish police officers block roads leading to where Saturday night's bombing took place (AP) Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Bursaspor said none of the wounded were fans and issued a statement saying \"we wish a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\" Witnesses said police were deployed and had cordoned off the area as smoke rose from the newly built stadium.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin had been notified, the agency said. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

By Steven Mufson and Philip Rucker December 10 at 7:11 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @PhilipRucker President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, who has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday. Tillerson\u2019s nomination could face intense scrutiny in the Senate, considering his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational petroleum company. Already, two leading Republican hawks, Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), have voiced concerns about Tillerson\u2019s serving as the nation\u2019s top diplomat because of his ties to Putin. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday that there would be no official announcement about a secretary of state until this coming week \u201cat the earliest.\u201d But three officials briefed on Trump\u2019s deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the pick would be Tillerson, barring a late and unanticipated shift in Trump\u2019s thinking. NBC News first reported that Trump has settled on Tillerson. Trump is considering nominating for deputy secretary of state John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a combative hawk whose tenure in the George W. Bush administration was controversial, two of the officials said. View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Trump spent a month deliberating over the secretary of state position and interviewed an array of candidates, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who was opposed by some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers because he had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy. Other contenders included former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The search at times resembled Trump\u2019s reality television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d with the hopefuls parading before journalists \u2014 and, in the case of Giuliani, publicly campaigning for the job before announcing Friday that he had withdrawn himself from consideration. [ Trump\u2019s advisers clash over Mitt Romney as secretary of state ] Tillerson\u2019s stock rose late in the process, after he met with the president-elect on Tuesday and again on Saturday morning at Trump Tower in New York. Trump settled on Tillerson, 64, because he projects gravitas, is regarded as a skillful manager and personally knows many foreign leaders through his dealings on behalf of the energy giant, people close to Trump said. In an excerpt of an interview with Fox News , which will be aired in full Sunday, Trump praises Tillerson, although he does not reveal his decision. \u201cHe\u2019s much more than a business executive; he\u2019s a world-class player,\u201d Trump says. \u201cHe knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia \u2014 for the company, not for himself.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s nomination would fit the pattern of other Trump appointments \u2014 wealthy business leaders with little experience in policymaking. But Tillerson has spent years dealing with the complexities of one of the world\u2019s biggest enterprises, spanning six continents and about six dozen nations. 1 of 20 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Caption President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder Andrew Puzder, a fast-food executive who has been a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, is the nominee to lead the Labor Department, according to a Republican briefed on the decision. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The company\u2019s deep ties to Russia would potentially serve Tillerson well, given Trump\u2019s desire to repair relations with the Kremlin. But Tillerson\u2019s close relationship with Putin could also become a flash point during confirmation hearings, especially in light of a recent CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. [ Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House ] \u201cFew corporate titans are closer to Putin than Tillerson,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, founder of Columbia University\u2019s center for global energy. \u201cSo his pick, along with Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, would suggest a sharp shift in U.S. policy toward Russia.\u201d McCain told Fox News on Saturday that Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Putin \u201cis a matter of concern to me.\u201d \u201cYou want to give the president of the United States the benefit of the doubt because the people have spoken,\u201d McCain said. \u201cBut Vladi\u00admir Putin is a thug, a bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying.\u201d During the 1990s, Tillerson oversaw an Exxon project on Russia\u2019s Sakhalin island and developed a working relationship with Putin. In 2011, the company signed an agreement with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to work jointly on oil exploration and development in the Arctic and Siberia. After inking the deal in New York, Tillerson and Rosneft chairman and Putin confidant Igor Sechin dined on caviar at the luxury Manhattan restaurant Per Se, according to one account. The next day, they gave oil analysts black pens with the date of the agreement engraved in gold. Two years later, the Kremlin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, an honor reserved for foreigners. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man much at all, but let\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, [an] Order of Friendship, then we\u2019re gonna have some talkin\u2019,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some questions. I don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy, but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d Exxon discovered oil in a well it drilled in the Kara Sea, but the joint partnership was put on ice after Russian intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea led to international economic sanctions. As secretary of state, Tillerson, who has been critical of the sanctions, would be in a position to argue for easing them, which could allow Exxon to resume operations. And for a company the size of Exxon, few countries outside of Russia hold sufficient potential to bolster the oil giant\u2019s reserves. In addition to the Arctic, Exxon wants to drill in the deep waters of the Black Sea and search for shale oil in West Siberia. In each case, the company would be providing expertise and technology that Russia lacks. \u201cRussia is critical for Exxon,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. Robert McNally, president of the consulting firm Rapidan Group and a director for energy on President George W. Bush\u2019s national security council, said, \u201cThe closest thing we have to a secretary of state outside government is the CEO of Exxon.\u201d Tillerson has spent his entire working life at ExxonMobil, joining the company in 1975 with a degree in civil engineering. His career has taken him from Oklahoma and Texas to Yemen and Russia, and as ExxonMobil\u2019s top executive, he has cultivated relationships, meeting regularly with world leaders such as Putin, the Saudi oil minister, and the emir of Qatar. He will retire with a nest egg of about $300\u00a0million, including stock options and pension benefits. Yet Tillerson\u2019s track record \u2014 during a decade in which crude oil prices lurched from under $30 to nearly $150 a barrel \u2014 has been mixed. The company has managed some of the world\u2019s biggest infrastructure projects, often in forbidding locations, but it has spent heavily on share buybacks and has borrowed heavily to maintain both capital spending and dividend payments. Wall Street analysts say ExxonMobil overpaid for XTO Energy, a domestic shale gas company, and it has failed to meet the production targets Tillerson himself set. In April, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the company\u2019s gold-plated triple-A credit rating to double-A plus, the first time Exxon had lost its triple-A rating since the advent of color television. Tillerson\u2019s nomination is likely to draw strong opposition from environmentalists. The secretary of state takes the lead in international climate talks, meaning that Tillerson could play a role in unwinding U.S. commitments under the recent Paris accord. Environmental groups allege that ExxonMobil\u2019s scientists knew about the impact the use of fossil fuels was having on climate change, and that the company suppressed internal research instead of sharing it with investors and the public. The New York and Massachusetts attorneys general have issued broad subpoenas to ascertain whether ExxonMobil\u2019s failure to disclose that information violated Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. ExxonMobil has fought back in federal court in Texas. \u201cCovering up climate science and deceiving investors qualifies you for federal investigation, not federal office,\u201d May Boeve, executive director of the climate group 350.org, said in a statement. When Tillerson took the helm at ExxonMobil a decade ago, he was seen as moderating the company\u2019s position on climate change. Whereas his predecessor opposed any action on climate change, Tillerson said in 2009 that he favored a carbon tax and proposed an initial price \u201csomewhere north of $20\u201d a ton. And he reduced ExxonMobil\u2019s own emissions. Tillerson has acknowledged that climate change is caused by humans, and under his leadership, ExxonMobil curtailed funding for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose energy and climate expert Myron Ebell played down the extent of climate change. Ebell is the head of the Trump transition team on environmental issues. Yet Tillerson has insisted that oil use is essential. He chaired the American Petroleum Institute and once told Fortune magazine, \u201cTo say that you\u2019re addicted to oil and natural gas seems to me to say you\u2019re addicted to economic growth.\u201d ExxonMobil has important relationships throughout the Middle East. It relies on Saudi Arabia for oil supplies and is a partner in refinery projects. It has enormous projects in liquefied natural gas export in Qatar. It has also managed to carry out exploration and production ventures in the semiautonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq and in southern Iraq, transcending rivalries between Baghdad and the Kurds. But under Tillerson, ExxonMobil has walked away from other countries. It left Venezuela after contract disputes with the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and it ended its onshore operations in Nigeria, where local insurgents sabotaged infrastructure. Tillerson was born in Wichita Falls, Tex., the son of a Boy Scout administrator. He still lists the rank of Eagle Scout on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and he has remained active in the organization. In 2012, he was instrumental in pushing the Boy Scouts board to admit openly gay youths. The ExxonMobil chief also chaired the $50\u00a0million campaign to restore Washington\u2019s Ford\u2019s Theatre, where President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Tillerson has been a major donor to the Republican Party and its candidates, including to former Florida governor Jeb Bush during this year\u2019s presidential primaries, federal campaign finance filings show. There appears to be no record of Tillerson\u2019s giving to Trump\u2019s campaign. Within the oil industry, ExxonMobil has been regarded as the most button-downed company, conservative and sometimes arrogant. But even Tillerson\u2019s critics admire his leadership abilities. \u201cRex is a very, very, very honorable man,\u201d Gheit said. \u201cHe is smart, levelheaded. He has tremendous resolve and very strong character.\u201d Karoun Demirjian, Matea Gold and Carol Morello contributed to this report. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

One of the blasts was thought to be a suicide bomber. \"We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror which tramples on every value and decency,\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement. The official who gave the toll of 15 dead and dozens wounded spoke on condition anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly on the issue, The Associated Press reported. He cited health ministry figures. Reuters reported the number of injured was 69. Turkish security forces confirmed to NBC News that law enforcement were attacked as they left the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium after they had finished policing the soccer match. The first blast went off at approximately 10:30 p.m. Police arrive at the site of an explosion in central Istanbul on Dec. 10. Murad Sezer / Reuters One of the blasts was thought to be a car bomb and the second appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. This year Istanbul has witnessed bombings attributed by authorities to the ISIS terror group or claimed by Kurdish militants. \"It is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left.\" Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying by Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency. Speaking later to reporters in Istanbul, he said the first explosion took place on a hill adjacent to and overlooking the stadium. The second explosion struck Macka Park and was believed to be a suicide bomb. Witnesses said additional police were deployed and had cordoned off the area and gunfire could be heard in what appeared to have been an armed attack on police. Rescue services work at the scene of explosions near the Besiktas football club stadium after attacks in Istanbul, late Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016. AP The private NTV channel said the target of the attack was a bus for riot police. Images broadcast on television showed more than a dozen ambulances on a street hugging the stadium and a police helicopter flying overhead with its search lights on. One witness reported hearing over 100 shots after the explosions. Turkey's radio and television board issued a temporary blackout on coverage of the explosion that occurred Saturday in Istanbul citing public order and national security reasons. The order asks media organizations to refrain from broadcasting and publishing anything that may cause \"fear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin had been notified, Anadolu said.

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump to Keep Role on 'Celebrity Apprentice' 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump declared in a tweet this morning that he will spend \"zero time\" working on the reality TV show \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" despite plans that he remain as an executive producer on the program while he is president. Trump said on the tweet that although he has a \"big stake\" in the show he won't commit time to it. I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016 He also this morning deleted a tweet pertaining to \"Celebrity Apprentice\" which contained a typing or spelling error. \"Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are rediculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!\" Trump tweeted early this morning, misspelling the word \"ridiculous.\" He later deleted that tweet and posted a new one with the correct spelling of the word. Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway on Friday defended Trump's decision to stay on as an executive producer for the show. She said on CNN that Trump is conferring with experts about \"what he is allowed to do and not do as president of the United States ... If [serving as executive producer on 'Celebrity Apprentice'] is one of the approved activities, then perhaps he\u2019ll consider staying on.\" \u201cWere we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course by the current president? I mean presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time. I mean nobody objects to that,\" Conway said. \u201cWhether it's President Obama or President Donald Trump, the idea that these men are going to be all work and nothing else all the time is just unrealistic because it's never happened in our lifetimes.\" Earlier this week, a representative for MGM, which holds a majority stake in Mark Burnett Productions, the company that owns \"The Apprentice,\" said Trump is set to remain as an executive producer of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" When asked about Trump's role on the show, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told ABC News, \"Mr. Trump has a big stake in the show and conceived of it with Mark Burnett. Additional details regarding his business interests will be shared Dec. 15.\" 0 Shares ",

Santa Clara County agreed to settle a wrongful death and civil rights violation claim brought by the family of 31-year-old Michael Tyree, who was found dead in his cell last year. The settlement will be paid to Tyree's two sisters and his 7-year-old daughter. \"The family would much rather have their brother than any amount of money. It's the most bittersweet money,\" attorney Paula Canny told the San Francisco Chronicle (http://bit.ly/2gKD30X). Three correctional officers were charged with murder in Tyree's death and will face trial in January. Tyree died from internal bleeding and suffered significant liver and spleen damage. An investigation determined he had been beaten hours before he was found in his cell. Tyree, who was serving time for misdemeanor theft and drug possession, had been housed by himself in a section of the jail reserved for inmates who are in protective custody or have special needs . Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith had said the three guards were the only people with access to Tyree's cell the night he died. Several inmates told police they could hear Tyree screaming for several minutes. 0 Shares ",

ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, shown here on March 27, 2015. (Evan Vucci/AP) Steven Mufson, Philip Rucker, Carol MorelloThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil who has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Russian President Vladimir Putin, as his secretary of state, three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday. Tillerson's nomination could face intense scrutiny in the Senate considering his years of work in Russia on behalf of the multinational petroleum company and his close ties to Putin. Already, two leading Republican hawks, Sens. John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina), have voiced concerns about Tillerson serving as the nation's top diplomat. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday that there would be no official announcement until this coming week \"at the earliest.\" But three officials briefed on Trump's deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that the pick would be Tillerson barring a late shift in Trump's thinking. NBC News first reported that Trump has settled on Tillerson. Trump spent a month deliberating over the secretary of state position and interviewed an array of candidates, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and onetime critic who was the face of the Republican resistance to Trump's candidacy. Donald Trump Patrick Semansky / AP President-elect Donald Trump greets Army Cadets and Navy Midshipmen before the Army-Navy NCAA college football game in Baltimore, Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016. President-elect Donald Trump greets Army Cadets and Navy Midshipmen before the Army-Navy NCAA college football game in Baltimore, Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016. (Patrick Semansky / AP) The president-elect settled on Tillerson because he projects gravitas, is regarded as a skillful manager and personally knows many foreign heads of state through his dealings on behalf of the energy giant, people close to Trump said. In an excerpt of an interview with Fox News, which will be aired in full Sunday, Trump praised Tillerson, though did not reveal his decision. \"He's much more than a business executive; he's a world-class player,\" Trump said. \"He knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia - for the company, not for himself.\" Tillerson's nomination would fit the pattern of other Trump appointments, installing a wealthy business leader with little experience in policymaking. But Tillerson, 64, has spent much of his career dealing with the complexities of one of the world's biggest enterprises, spanning six continents and about six dozen nations. The company's deep ties to Russia would potentially serve Tillerson well given Trump's desire to repair relations with the Kremlin. But Tillerson's close relationship with Vladimir Putin could also become a flashpoint during confirmation hearings, especially in light of a recent CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. \"Few corporate titans are closer to Putin than Tillerson,\" said Jason Bordoff, founder of Columbia University's center for global energy. So far, President-elect Donald Trump 's Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives or retired generals. In that context, it's probably less of a surprise that Trump is expected to select Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, elevating... So far, President-elect Donald Trump 's Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives or retired generals. In that context, it's probably less of a surprise that Trump is expected to select Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, elevating... (Philip Bump) During the 1990s, Tillerson oversaw an Exxon project on Russia's Sakhalin island and developed a working relationship with Putin. In 2011, the company signed an agreement with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to work jointly on oil exploration and development in the Arctic and Siberia. After inking the deal in New York, Tillerson and Rosneft chairman and Putin confidante Igor Sechin dined on caviar at the luxury Manhattan restaurant Per Se, according to one account. The next day they gave oil analysts black pens with the date of the agreement engraved in gold. Two years later, the Kremlin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, honoring foreigners. \"I don't know the man much at all, but let's put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, [an] order of friendship, then we're gonna have some talkin',\" Graham said. \"We'll have some questions. I don't want to prejudge the guy but that's a bit unnerving.\" Exxon discovered oil in a well it drilled in the Kara Sea, but the joint partnership was put on ice after Russian intervention in Ukraine and annexation of the Crimea led to international economic sanctions. As secretary of state, Tillerson, who has been critical of the sanctions, would be in a position to argue for an easing them, which could allow Exxon to resume operations. \"Russia is critical for Exxon,\" said Fadel Gheit, oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. \"Not only for how much production it has there, but the potential growth is huge.\" He said once sanctions are lifted, \"Exxon will go back to develop the Arctic business at a rapid pace.\" Tillerson and former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney were two of the finalists, along with former New... ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson has emerged as the top candidate for secretary of state, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. Tillerson and former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney were two of the finalists, along with former New... (Abby Phillip) As Secretary of State, which takes the lead in international climate talks, the oil industry veteran could also play a role in unwinding U.S. commitments under the recent Paris accord. \"The closest thing we have to a secretary of State outside government is the CEO of Exxon,\" Robert McNally, president of the consulting firm Rapidan Group and a director for energy at President George W. Bush's national security council. Because ExxonMobil invests in huge, long-term projects, it is concerned \"by nature with enduring interests, vulnerabilities, and opportunities,\" McNally said. His selection ends one of the most high-profile contests for a top cabinet post, whose losing candidates included former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, Romney and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Tillerson has spent his entire working life at ExxonMobil after earning a civil engineering degree and joining the company in 1975. His career has taken him from Oklahoma and Texas to Yemen and Russia, and as ExxonMobil's top executive he has cultivated relationships, meeting regularly with world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Saudi oil minister, and the emir of Qatar. He will retire with a nest egg of about $300 million including stock options and pension benefits. Yet Tillerson's track record - during a decade in which crude oil prices lurched from under $30 to nearly $150 a barrel - has been mixed. The company has managed some of the world's biggest infrastructure projects often in forbidding locations, but it has spent heavily on share buybacks and has borrowed heavily to maintain both capital spending and dividend payments. Wall Street analysts say it overpaid for XTO, a domestic shale gas company, and it has failed to meet the production targets Tillerson himself set. In April, Standard & Poor's downgraded the company's gold-plated triple A credit rating to double A plus, the first time Exxon had lost its triple A rating since the advent of color television and the communists took over China. Moreover, Tillerson's career with ExxonMobil isn't seen as an asset by environmentalists. The company has become a target of environmental groups that allege the company's scientists knew about the impact the use of fossil fuels was having on climate change, and that the company suppressed internal research rather than sharing it with investors and the public. The New York and Massachusetts attorneys general have issued broad subpoenas to ascertain whether ExxonMobil's failure to disclose that information violated Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. ExxonMobil has fought back, persuading a Texas federal court to order that ExxonMobil could do discovery, depose the Massachusetts attorney general and search her internal emails and documents for any signs that she acted out of \"bad faith.\" \"Covering up climate science and deceiving investors qualifies you for federal investigation, not federal office,\" May Boeve, executive director of the climate group 350.org said in a statement. \"An oil baron as Secretary of State would do enormous damage.\" When Tillerson took the helm at ExxonMobil a decade ago, he was seen as moderating the company's position on climate change. Whereas his predecessor opposed any action on climate change, Tillerson said in 2009 that he favored a carbon tax and proposed an initial price \"somewhere north of $20\" a ton. And he reduced ExxonMobil's own emissions. Under Tillerson, ExxonMobil also curtailed funding for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose energy and climate expert Myron Ebell played down the extent of climate change and said that no action was needed. Ebell has been the head of the Trump transition team on environmental issues. Yet Tillerson still insisted that oil use was essential. He chaired the American Petroleum Institute, which hammered on the idea that jobs were at stake. \"To say that you're addicted to oil and natural gas seems to me to say you're addicted to economic growth,\" he once told Fortune magazine. Exxon has important relationships with countries other than Russia, most notably the Middle East. It relies on Saudi Arabia for oil supplies and is a partner in refinery projects. It has enormous liquefied natural gas export projects in Qatar. It has also managed to carry out exploration and production ventures in both Kurdistan and southern Iraq, transcending rivalries between Baghdad and the Kurds. But under Tillerson, Exxon has also walked away from some countries. It left Venezuela after contract disputes with the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and it ended its onshore operations in Nigeria, where local insurgents sabotaged infrastructure. Tillerson said later that \"you have to be willing to say 'no, we aren't going to do it that way...if we can't do it this way, we won't be here.'\" Within the oil industry, ExxonMobil has been regarded as the most button-downed company, conservative and sometimes arrogant. \"Rex is a very, very, very honorable man,\" said Gheit, who is also one of his critics. \"He is smart, level headed. He has tremendous resolve and very strong character.\" Tillerson was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, the son of a Boy Scout administrator. He still lists the rank of Eagle Scout on his resume, and he has remained active in the organization throughout his life. In 2012, he was instrumental in pushing the Boy Scouts board to admit openly gay youths. The Exxon chief also chaired the $50 million campaign to restore Washington's Fords Theatre, where President Lincoln was assassinated. ExxonMobil and Qatar were major donors. In confirmation hearings, Tillerson can also expect to face tough questions about his views on international pipelines such as the Keystone XL, which require State Department approval. He'll also be quizzed on climate change. \"I'd expect the State Department's climate change envoy- a key role under [Hillary] Clinton and [John] Kerry-to have a lot of free time on his or her hands, and that State Department permits to build oil pipelines to Canada will be quite a bit easier to get,\" Bordoff said. Tillerson has acknowledged that climate change is caused by humans, but questioned the costs of weaning the world from fossil fuels. \"What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers,\" he said at a 2013 stockholders meeting, citing the outsized impact on poor people if environmental activists succeeded in establishing company goals to reduce emissions.

Ron Wyden Updated at 3:20 p.m. ET with comments from Sen. Angus King The CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election specifically to help Donald Trump win the presidency, a U.S. official has confirmed to NPR. \"Before, there was confidence about the fact that Russia interfered,\" the official says. \"But there was low confidence on what the direction and intentionality of the interference was. Now they [the CIA] have come to the conclusion that Russia was trying to tip the election to Trump.\" The official adds: \"The reason the assessment changed is that new information became available\" since Oct. 7, when the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement accusing Russia of interfering with the American election process. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections The Washington Post first reported the CIA's new assessment on Friday. In addition to hacking into Democratic organizations, Russians hacked the Republican National Committee's computer systems, according to a separate report from The New York Times \u2014 but they did not release any information that might have been retrieved from Republican networks. \"Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials,\" the Post reports. \"Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton's chances.\" Article continues after sponsorship Citing anonymous officials briefed on the issue, the Post says the CIA shared its findings with senators in a closed-door briefing last week, saying it was now \"quite clear\" that Russia's goal was to tip the presidency in Trump's favor: \" 'It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,' said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. 'That's the consensus view.' \" In a previous assessment, CIA officials had thought Russians intervened with the intention of undermining Americans' electoral system, Adam Entous, one of the Post story's reporters, tells NPR's Scott Simon . On Friday evening, the Trump transition team fired back with a statement dismissing the report of the agency's conclusion. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" the statement said. \"The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.' \" In fact, Trump's percentage of the electoral vote in the 2016 election ranks 46th among presidential election winners in U.S. history, according to factcheck.org. Trump's claim is a reference to the CIA's flawed intelligence on Iraq, in the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The CIA and other spy agencies judged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction \u2014 a judgment that proved to be false. While the leadership of the CIA has changed hands several times in the years since then, many intelligence officers and analysts who worked on the Iraq intelligence still serve at CIA and in other parts of the U.S. intelligence community. But whether or not Trump's top officials acknowledge the report as a possible threat, the Post's Adam Entous points out Trump will soon be in command of the intelligence agencies. \"I'm sure they're going to declassify some elements of the report and I'm sure there will be leaks,\" he adds, but the Obama administration can't disclose the full details of the case, because it would be \"compromising what's known as 'sources and methods,' which would then make it harder for the CIA and the NSA and other spy agencies to get more information in the future.\" Earlier Friday, President Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a \"full review\" of \"malicious cyber activity\" timed to U.S. elections, as we previously reported: \"In the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence officials charged that Russia had interfered. In early October, they released a strongly worded statement saying they were 'confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.' The statement went on to say 'these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.' \" The U.S. official says that \"there is a determination to do something\" before the Obama administration leaves power. \"It's still being discussed exactly what to do. And as we've said before, some of it you may see and some of it you will not.\" Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says the response from President-elect Donald Trump is \"very misguided.\" \"When you have strong evidence that a foreign power has interfered with the American election, with American institutions, then what you do is keep digging. You get all the facts out,\" Wyden says. \"You respond to the American people with the kind of information that they have a right to know.\" He also advocates releasing more information on the cyberattacks. \"I do believe there is important information that the American people have a right to know. It ought to be declassified promptly.\" \"It's very important that the American public knows what happened, not necessarily to re-litigate this election, but to look forward,\" says Sen. Angus King, an independent senator from Maine. \"What worries me is the extent to which this is an ongoing pattern \u2014 which, by the way, is the Russians' pattern in other parts of the world. \"And is that going to be the case in our elections? Four years from now, are we going to have the Democrats, the Republicans, the independents and the Russians?\" King asks. \"I mean, this is very serious stuff.\" ",

Democrats call for hearings Gregory Korte , USA TODAY 5:39 p.m. EST December 10, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump speaks in Grand Rapids, Mich. Friday. Trump's presidential transition team challenged the veracity of U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia was trying to tip the November election to the Republican. A top Senate Democrat demanded a full congressional investigation. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Intelligence officials have already made clear they believe the hacking of Democratic emails was directed by Russia in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections. The question now is: Were they actively trying to get Donald Trump elected president? That important distinction \u2014 between causing mayhem in order to sow doubt in the democratic process, versus actually putting a finger on the scale for the Republican candidate \u2014 has reignited the debate over the role foreign powers may have played in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats called for congressional investigations into the hacking on Saturday, the day after\u00a0President Obama ordered intelligence agencies to review the extent to which Russia and other foreign powers may have influenced presidential elections in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., alleged that FBI Director James Comey had secret evidence that Russia was supporting Trump but withheld it for partisan purposes. He offered no evidence. \"This is not fake news, OK?\u00a0Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government. There's no doubt about that,\" he told MSNBC . The man expected to take over for Reid, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called for congressional investigations, promising to \"get to the bottom of this.\" \u201cThat any country could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core,\"\u00a0he said. \"It\u2019s imperative that our intelligence community turns over any relevant information so that Congress can conduct a full investigation.\u201d But President-elect Trump's team continued to downplay claims of foreign interference, even seemingly attacking the intelligence community after the Washington Post reported , based on anonymous sources, that the CIA believed that Russia may have been supporting Trump. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" the Trump transition office said in a statement. \"The election ended a long time ago.\" Trump bashes CIA, dismisses Russian hacking report Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was besieged by a series of embarrassing revelations in the campaign from leaked emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and her campaign chairman, John Podesta. In October, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the leaked emails were \"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,\" and that it was \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions.\" Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer, a member of Trump's transition team, noted Saturday that allegations of Russian support have come from sources unwilling to speak on the record. And he said there's no evidence that Trump benefited from Russian actions. \"What proof does anyone have that they affected the outcome? Because I've heard zero,\" Spicer told CNN . 1723 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 117 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hyzg75 ",

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was part of a group of coal state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of health benefits for coal miners in the stopgap spending bill. Alex Brandon/AP Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short-term-funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline. It's become a familiar year-end act for Congress: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed 63-36, runs out in April. Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners. The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months. Article continues after sponsorship Retired Coal Miners At Risk Of Losing Promised Health Coverage And Pensions \"Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.\" With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday \u2014 and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations \u2014 Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown. The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs. The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year. Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis. For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process. The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew. Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children. Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic. The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010. ",
