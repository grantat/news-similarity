Just two days after Election Day, Trump spent an afternoon on Capitol Hill, meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Ryan. They walked together in front of a throng of press down the historic halls of Congress, praising the progress made in the meetings and signaling unity. But a number of challenges are already on the way, starting with health care. Trump said during the campaign he favors a more interventionist approach by government than do Republican congressional leaders, and Trump has signaled he wants to preserve certain aspects of Obamacare rather than push a wholesale repeal. Trump has also pushed back on cutting entitlement spending, an effort long backed by traditional conservatives. Yet despite Trump\u2019s stated position, Ryan has continued to talk up his longstanding plan to overhaul Medicare. Trump has also advocated a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure, not unlike the stimulus program Obama championed and that Republican lawmakers largely opposed. In foreign policy, Trump splits with his party in some respects, especially in his lack of skepticism of Russia, but Trump\u2019s international positioning has been mostly inconsistent, leaving Republicans uncertain of his next international move. Trump\u2019s victory was so narrow that it\u2019s difficult to attribute any one factor to carrying him across the line. As mentioned in chapter three, tax policy will be a defining debate for the Republican Party. The party consensus since Reagan has emphasized tax cuts for the wealthy as a way to spur economic growth, but some reformers have proposed abandoning this approach in favor of targeted benefits for working families instead. Trump ran on both sides of the issue: He said he supported higher taxes on the rich, but released two multi-trillion-dollar tax plans that overwhelmingly benefitted top earners. The Uncertain Future Trump\u2019s victory was so narrow that it\u2019s difficult to credit any one factor with carrying him across the line. That also makes it hard for both parties to move into the future. If Trump\u2019s win heralds a decisive trend in which white working class voters support Republicans by ever-expanding margins, he could remain a heavy favorite for re-election in 2020 even as the country becomes more racially and economically diverse. Democrats, for their part, could be caught between a Sun Belt moving their way in places like Georgia and Arizona to make up for the Rust Belt\u2019s Republican drift, but not fast enough for a Democratic candidate to win nationally. It\u2019s also possible that Trump\u2019s win is part of a global phenomenon of populist and nationalistic policies and leaders that have caught fire with voters worried about the ongoing threat of international terrorism, increased immigration and economic inequality. Their growth abroad suggests the Trump phenomenon may be durable and go beyond his personal appeal. But it could be Trump\u2019s election was more of a fluke, a razor-thin victory that any of a number of factors could have reversed. Clinton, like Trump, was an unpopular nominee, and depressed Democratic turnout in close races like Michigan and Wisconsin undoubtedly helped Trump win. The biggest unknown factor, though, is simply how Trump performs as president. He starts with a skeptical electorate \u2014 exit polls showed only 33 percent of voters found him honest, and just 35 percent said he had the temperament to be president \u2014 and will have to prove that he can translate his message of radical change into positive results. For an incumbent president seeking re-election, there\u2019s no substitute for success. The biggest unknown factor is simply how Trump performs as president. Share ",

By Jim Tankersley December 14 at 5:21 PM Follow @jimtankersley An interest rate hike will affect anyone with a home mortgage, car loan, savings account or money in the stock market. Here's what it means for your wallet. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in a year and signaled that rates could continue to rise next year more quickly than officials had expected. The increase was unanimous and modest, raising the Fed\u2019s key interest rate by a quarter point, from a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent to a range of 0.5 to 0.75 percent. It reflects Fed officials' confidence in the strengthening of the U.S. economy and what officials see as budding signs of higher inflation. But unlike corporate executives and stock traders, Fed officials do not appear to be anticipating a massive growth boost next year from economic policies implemented by President-elect Donald Trump, but\u00a0they appear set to raise rates faster if those policies were to cause an overheating in the economy. [ How a Fed rate hike could affect your wallet ] Markets were slightly up immediately after the announcement, but they started to dive\u00a0about an hour later, after Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen concluded\u00a0a news conference about the rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.6 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid\u00a00.8 percent, and the Nasdaq tech index was down 0.5 percent. Yellen told reporters that she and the Federal Open Market Committee were \u201crecognizing the considerable progress the economy has made\u201d toward full employment and an inflation target of 2 percent. She indicated that she did not see much need for a large, deficit-financed boost from federal fiscal policy, either tax cuts or spending increases. \u201cI would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment,\u201d Yellen said. She then added that she was not trying to advise Trump and Congress on fiscal issues. [ The eternal mystique of Goldman Sachs ] Economic projections also released by the\u00a0central bank indicate that the Fed now expects the economy to grow 1.9 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017.\u00a0The projections show that the group expects the Fed to increase rates three times in 2017, to a rate of 1.4 percent by year's end. Its September projections signaled only two expected hikes next year. Analysts have warned that if Trump and Congress agree to slash tax rates and increase spending in areas such as infrastructure the Fed could be forced to raise rates faster than expected to counter rising prices. Yellen highlighted uncertainty over those policies at her news conference but said some Fed officials had tried to incorporate expected fiscal changes in their forecasts. Since Trump\u2019s election, markets have jumped \u2014 with the Dow closing in on a record-breaking 20,000\u00a0\u2014 and long-term rates and the dollar have increased. [ Trump Treasury pick vows to curtail Wall Street regulations ] Several analysts said the Fed was right to take that approach to the new administration\u2019s policies. \u201cThe Fed will likely be in wait-and-see mode, given this substantial policy uncertainty,\u201d said Doug Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, \u201cand we view this prudency a virtue.\u201d Much of the Fed statement released Wednesday was unchanged from November, when the Fed declined to raise rates, choosing \u201cto wait for some further evidence of continued progress\u201d toward maximum employment in the economy and a target inflation rate of 2 percent. Officials said Wednesday, as they said a month ago, that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced\u201d \u2014 meaning growth is as likely to speed up as it is to slow down. Fed officials now judge the overall inflation rate to be 1.5 percent, up from 1.3 percent in September, but still well below target. They judge core inflation, which excludes volatile commodities such as gasoline prices, to be 1.7 percent. [ Donald Trump still does not understand the unemployment rate ] In the statement, officials said that \u201cinflation has increased since earlier this year,\u201d a change from November, when the statement said that \u201cinflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year.\u201d Officials also said that measures of inflation compensation \u201chave moved up considerably but remain low.\u201d\u00a0Last month, the word \u201cconsiderably\u201d did not appear in that line. The Fed's decision drew criticism from some liberal economists who want rates to stay as low as possible to further boost employment while inflation remains below target. \u201cThe Fed's action today was unwelcome but not unexpected. Still huge economic risks and little evidence of an inflation problem\u201d economist and former treasury secretary Larry Summers\u00a0wrote in a tweet. Yellen, in her news conference, said she does not favor running a \u201chigh-pressure economy\u201d where inflation might overshoot its target. \u201cI do want to make clear,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I have not recommended running a hot economy as some sort of experiment.\u201d The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point Dec. 14 and signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017 as the Trump administration takes over with promises to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. (Reuters) The central bank last raised rates at its December meeting a year ago, its first step toward moving\u00a0the Fed from what economists call the zero-lower bound \u2014 meaning interest rates hovering around zero percent. Trump has promised to cut taxes for individuals and corporations and to boost infrastructure spending by as much as $1 trillion through tax credits that his team says will pay for themselves. Although\u00a0Trump praised the Fed chair during his campaign, saying he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Yellen, he was mostly critical. Accusing Yellen and the Fed\u00a0of keeping rates low to help President Obama, Trump said in September:\u00a0\u201cI think she is very political, and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself.\u201d Yellen's term ends in early 2018. Asked about whether she would leave her post when the president-elect takes office, the Fed chair said: \u201cI do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven\u2019t made any decision about the future.\u201d Analysts did not expect Fed officials to change their forecasts of future increases this month based on an expectation of what Trump and Congress might do. \u201cWe very much doubt that FOMC members want to be accused of seeking to influence Congress and the new administration,\u201d analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote this week, \u201cgiven how unpopular the Fed is already with Republican politicians.\u201d business ",

    "text": "FILE \u00a0(AP) Don\u2019t call your holiday party a holiday party. That\u2019s the recommendation from Texas Woman\u2019s University \u2013 posting a series of tips on how to make December office parties \u2018all-inclusive\u2019 and \u2018multicultural.\u2019 Click here for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! \u201cNot all faith traditions have holidays in December, and not everyone identifies with a particular faith tradition,\u201d TWU writer Anna Ryan wrote in \u201cA Festivus for the Rest of Us: Tips to plan an all-inclusive multicultural holiday party at the office.\u201d That means dropping the word \u201choliday\u201d for starters, said Dr. Mark Kessler, a professor of multicultural women\u2019s and gender studies \u2013 and the university\u2019s expert on party planning. \u201c\u2019Holiday\u2019 connotes religious tradition and may not apply to all employees,\u201d Kessler told the news service. As an alternative he recommended calling your December gathering an \u201cend of the semester party.\u201d Click here to join America\u2019s favorite Conservative Facebook page! He also recommends not decorating with Santa Claus, a red-nosed reindeer or evergreen trees. And whatever you do, don\u2019t serve red & green sugar cookies shaped like Christmas trees, first reported by the fine folks at Campus Reform . \u201cAvoid religious symbolism, such as Santa Claus, evergreen trees or a red nosed reindeer, which are associated with Christmas traditions,\u201d Kessler recommended. \u201cExcellent alternatives are snowflakes, snow men or winter themes not directly associated with a particular holiday or religion.\u201d Now, that one left me a bit puzzled \u2013 because I can\u2019t seem to find any reference to a red-nosed reindeer in the New Testament. Speaking of snowflakes, he also suggested party planners avoid playing Christmas carols or any music associated with a \u201cfaith tradition.\u201d Instead, he recommended \u201ccelebratory party music.\u201d Instead of chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Texas Woman\u2019s University wants everybody to Wang Chung tonight. As for the Yuletide noshing, Professor Kessler advises a diverse menu with \u201citems that reflect dietary preferences and requirements of non-majority groups in your organization (e.g, halal or kosher).\u201d Just imagine the festive scene at TWU\u2019s all-inclusive winter shindig. Instead of scarfing down Little Smokies and shrimp cocktail, guests would be stuffing their faces with gluten-free hummus and Gefilte fish.\u00a0 So if you are one of the unfortunate souls who received an invitation, you might want to drop by the Chick-fil-A drive-thru before the party. I reached out to the university spokesperson to get the back story or at least some context on their Yuletide suggestions \u2013 but so far no one has returned my telephone call. Because as it now stands, it sure looks like the folks at Texas Woman\u2019s University are a few nuts shy of a fruitcake.

Blue/Bloomberg SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo , already reeling from its September disclosure that 500 million user accounts had been hacked in 2014, disclosed Wednesday that a different attack in 2013 compromised more than 1 billion accounts. The two attacks are the largest known security breaches of one company\u2019s computer network. The newly disclosed 2013 attack involved sensitive user information, including names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and unencrypted security questions that could be used to reset a password. Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions. It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked. Yahoo said it discovered the larger hacking after analyzing data files, provided by law enforcement, that an unnamed third party had claimed contained Yahoo information. Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers. Yahoo has made a steady trickle of disclosures about the 2014 hacking, which it has been investigating with the help of federal authorities. The company said Wednesday that it now believes the attacker in that breach, which it says was sponsored by a government, found a way to forge credentials to log in to some users accounts without a password. Bob Lord, Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, said in a statement that the state-sponsored actor in the 2014 attack had stolen Yahoo\u2019s proprietary source code. Outside forensics experts working with Yahoo believe that the state-sponsored hackers used Yahoo\u2019s code to access Yahoo user accounts without their passwords by creating forged \u201ccookies,\u201d short bits of text that a website can store on a user\u2019s machine. By forging these cookies, attackers were able to impersonate valid users, gaining information and performing actions on behalf of their victims. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Security has taken a back seat at Yahoo in recent years, compared to Silicon Valley competitors like Google and Facebook. Yahoo\u2019s security team clashed with top executives, including the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, over the cost and customer inconvenience of proposed security measures. Security experts also say the time it has taken Yahoo to uncover the breach disclosed on Wednesday is a signal that the company\u2019s security and monitoring technologies are inadequate. \u201cWhat\u2019s most troubling is that this occurred so long ago, in August 2013, and no one saw any indication of a breach occurring until law enforcement came forward,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, the chief executive of Synack, a security company. \u201cYahoo has a long way to go to catch up to these threats.\u201d ",

    "text": "The evacuation buses finally arrived \u2013 but Aleppo has descended back into violence Nabih Bulos The evacuation of Syrian rebels bunkered in their last remaining holdouts in the beleaguered city of Aleppo has been delayed, rebels and activists said Wednesday, as an 11th-hour cease-fire forged by Russia and Turkey broke down after only a few hours of calm. The agreement, which called for a cease-fire to take effect late Tuesday night and have rebels leave their bastion early Wednesday, came as the government took near total control of the rebels\u2019 enclave in eastern Aleppo. It represents the most significant achievement by the government of President Bashar Assad in the almost six-year civil war ravaging the country. The deal would have allowed opposition fighters to exit from Aleppo\u2019s southwestern flank toward\u00a0countryside areas still in rebel hands, taking\u00a0their personal weapons \u2014 a major point of contention that may have\u00a0contributed to the scuttling of the arrangement. On Tuesday, before the cease-fire went into effect, the United Nations said at least 82 civilians had been killed in fighting. Late that day, the green buses used to shuttle opposition fighters out were reported to have arrived in Aleppo, according to pro-government groups. But they had remained empty, and residents from within rebel areas said there had been no evacuations. Caught between rebels and government forces, the Syrian city of Aleppo has largely been cut off from the rest of the world in recent months. But this week, as Syrian forces advanced on rebel-held areas, residents took to social media to send pleas and heartbreaking farewells to a global audience. ... ... (Nina Agrawal) Instead, the sounds of intense artillery and mortar shelling as well as sporadic gunfire could be heard once more after hours of calm overnight. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can hear it, but there are artillery and mortar strikes on the besieged areas,\u201d Mahmoud Raslan, a pro-opposition activist, said via the WhatsApp messaging service on Wednesday. He said he was in Salah Al Din, a neighborhood at the very edge of the Syrian government\u2019s advance. Minutes later, he sent an audio recording of loud explosions in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group with a network of activists in Syria, said at least 10 people had been killed in the barrage hitting eastern Aleppo. \u201cEverything has collapsed,\u201d said Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the Observatory. Late Wednesday, Ahmad Qurah Ali, the spokesman for the hard-line Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham, said in a statement on social media that a cease-fire would start at midnight Damascus time. The first group of the wounded and civilians would leave early Thursday morning, he said. Activists and residents contacted in eastern Aleppo confirmed a significant reduction of hostilities in the wee hours of Thursday morning, but that there were still occasional sounds of gunfire. One resident, Dr. Ghaith Suleiman, said in a Whatsapp message that he received word the evacuation would go through in the morning under supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross . Damascus and Moscow have yet to confirm any arrangement. Meanwhile, the Hezbollah-affiliated Central Combat Media outlet issued a report late Wednesday saying that all rumors regarding a cease-fire and \u201cthe exit of the gunmen\u201d were completely untrue. Syrian government forces conduct a final sweep to take the last rebel holdouts in eastern Aleppo. (Associated Press) It was unclear why Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0deal had broken down. The Russian Reconciliation Center, the Russian army\u2019s monitoring body in Syria, blamed the rebels for the delay and the subsequent breakdown of the fragile truce, saying in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cwhen the [buses] arrived at the agreed boarding site the militants opened fire on the column.\u201d Russia has been Assad\u2019s closest ally, and its air power, deployed on behalf of the Syrian forces, effectively turned the tide of the battle in Aleppo. The Reconciliation Center added that \u201cthe militants had taken advantage of the cease-fire to regroup \u2026 and resume combat operations,\u201d but \u201cthe terrorists were rolled back.\u201d The statement employed the Russian and Syrian governments\u2019 standard description for the rebels arrayed against the rule of Assad. \u201cThe Syrian army went ahead with the operation to retake eastern Aleppo\u2019s quarters from the militants,\u201d the Russian statement continued. Zakaria Malahifji, spokesman for Fastaqim Kama Umert, an opposition faction fighting inside Aleppo, blamed the Syrian government and its Iranian allies for the breakdown, saying they had been displeased that the deal had been imposed on Damascus by Russia without consultation. Islamic State \u2019s self-declared capital of\u00a0Raqqah, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Saturday.\u00a0 Carter told\u00a0a\u00a0security conference in Manama, Bahrain, that\u00a0the new\u00a0troops...

(W.J. Hennigan) The Observatory for Human Rights said the issue was that the rebels had been all but defeated and that \u201cthe regime had gotten nothing in return for this agreement.\u201d Mayadeen, a Lebanese news channel that is close to the Assad government, said government and Iranian officials had insisted on evacuating the wounded in Fuah and Kefraya, two villages in the opposition-controlled province of Idlib that have been besieged for almost two years, and that vital humanitarian aid be allowed in. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest sharply criticized both Russia and Syria, as well as Iran, another Assad ally. He said the United States was \u201cworking diligently through a variety of diplomatic channels\u201d to resolve the situation. \u201cWe continue to be deeply concerned about the situation in Aleppo,\u201d he said at the daily White House press briefing. \u201cWe are seeing the same reports that you are, that innocent people are being slaughtered in the streets at the hands of the Assad regime, aided and abetted by the Russians and the Iranians. And it raises deep concerns. And it's a deeply tragic situation. And these atrocities have to come to an end.\u201d Among those holding out in eastern Aleppo was Monther Etaky, 28, and his family \u2014 his wife, Walaa, 25, and their newborn son, Yazid. \u201cWe will be slaughtered by them,\u201d he said, speaking of the Syrian government forces. \u201cWe prefer to fight them and die like a tree, standing, not be annihilated.\u201d Etaky, speaking via WhatsApp late Tuesday, said he and his family had been forced in recent months to relocate to an abandoned apartment and live without running water and only sporadic electricity. But they had refused to leave, even after he watched his friends die in airstrikes and bombings and\u00a0even when he had to spend his days hunting for food. There was too much history for him to leave, he said, too many ghosts. \u201cThe criminal regime killed my friends,\u201d he said. Then the cease-fire was announced, and Etaky realized he might finally have to depart. \u201cNo way to stay in the city at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to evacuate.\u201d But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rick Perry was picked to run the Department of Energy , cutting down dead trees is the new Gold Rush happening in California , Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade is coming back , and the National Film Registry\u2019s Class of 2016 has arrived .

    "text": "CBS News Dec 14, 2016 7:34 PM EST What would happen if the \u201cbig one\u201d were heading towards Earth, like the life-threatening asteroid in the movie \u201cArmageddon\u201d? Apparently, we are vastly ill-prepared to deal with it, according to Dr. Joseph Nuth, a prominent researcher with NASA\u2019s \u00a0Goddard Space Flight Center.\u00a0 Nuth was speaking at a meeting with nuclear scientists in San Francisco Monday when he made headlines for saying that \u201cthe biggest problem, basically, is there\u2019s not a hell of a lot we can do about it at the moment,\u201d when discussing the possibility of a civilization-ending asteroid or comet smashing into the planet , The Guardian reports.\u00a0 The researcher\u2019s bleak prediction came at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Nuth noted that, while these kinds of cataclysmic collisions are rare in Earth\u2019s history, they aren\u2019t unprecedented.\u00a0 \u201cBut on the other hand, they are the extinction-level events, things like dinosaur killers , they\u2019re 50 to 60 million years apart, essentially,\u201d The Guardian reports him as saying. \u201cYou could say, of course, we\u2019re due, but it\u2019s a random course at that point.\u201d Nuth noted that our planet had a \u201cclose encounter\u201d in 1996 when a comet whirred into Jupiter. Astronomers captured images of another such impact on Jupiter earlier this year. And one of our nearest planetary neighbors experienced a relatively close call in 2014, when a comet came \u201cwithin spitting distance of Mars .\u201d What makes that especially scary is that the comet was only discovered a mere 22 months before it buzzed the Red Planet. If that had been Earth, 22 months would would not be nearly enough time to prepare, Nuth stressed.\u00a0 Nuth said he has suggested that NASA build an \u201cinterceptor rocket\u201d that could be stationed at the agency\u2019s new planetary defense office. A ready-to-launch rocket that could be deployed within a year\u2019s notice \u201ccould mitigate the possibility of a sneaky asteroid coming in from a place that\u2019s hard to observe, like from the sun,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Of course, this kind of mission would require Congressional \u00a0approval, Nuth added; it\u2019s not just something NASA could do on its own. NASA created a Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) earlier this year to coordinate efforts to track so-called near-Earth objects \u2014 asteroids and comets that could cross into our cosmic neighborhood. The space agency estimates that it has spotted about 90 percent or more of the near-Earth objects larger than a kilometer in size. These would be the potentially catastrophic objects that science fiction often warns about. Smaller objects still pose a threat as well, and Nuth said\u00a0 Earthlings \u00a0have to be vigilant about these potential threats. So, how could we defend against these objects? At the talk, The Guardian reports Dr. Cathy Piesko of the Los Alamos National Laboratory said our options could include deploying \u201ca kinetic impactor\u201d \u2014 which she described as \u201cbasically a giant cannonball\u201d \u2014 or perhaps a nuclear warhead.\u00a0 But both would come with serious risks, and it would take years of preparation to figure out how to do it right. \u201cWe are very carefully doing our homework before finals week,\u201d Plesko said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be doing our calculations before something is coming. We need to have this work done.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic \u201cRussia is going to be the central litmus test for United States policy,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cOur allies and our adversaries are watching this very closely, and obviously the names of the cabinet positions are being scrutinized that much more closely.\u201d Senate Republicans \u2014 including Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 who have long been critical of Mr. Putin and of President Obama\u2019s attempt to \u201creset\u201d relations with Moscow, have praised Mr. Tillerson. \u201cMr. Tillerson is a very impressive individual and has an extraordinary working knowledge of the world,\u201d Mr. Corker said. That view was echoed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. The laudatory response from many Republicans over a choice that a year ago, on paper at least, might have appalled them demonstrates a strong desire to begin a new administration aligned with Mr. Trump. It is the same dynamic that has prevented a larger outcry from congressional Republicans over revelations that Russia interfered with the presidential election. They fear they could appear aligned with Democrats in raising questions about the election\u2019s legitimacy. While congressional leaders called for investigations into possible tampering, they stopped short of ordering expansive efforts like a select committee. At the same time, a majority of Republicans are overjoyed with Mr. Trump\u2019s other cabinet picks \u2014 staunch conservatives in the world of education, health care and law enforcement \u2014 and are likely to accede to the president-elect\u2019s choice for the nation\u2019s chief diplomat. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other selections are \u201cdraft picks for conservatives who have been looking to reform those departments for years,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, who was passed over for secretary of state. \u201cThose cabinet picks have certainly helped build up some of that political capital.\u201d Photo President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with Mr. Tillerson, right, in June 2012. At left is Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft. Credit Sputnik/Reuters Still, the contrast from recent years is striking. In 2012, when Mr. Romney was running for president, he called Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe,\u201d a position echoing decades of Republican thinking. He was derided by Mr. Obama, his opponent. Mr. Corker and others have joined the most robust voices on Capitol Hill in calling for sanctions on Russia, a position that would seem to put them at odds with Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson. He and 20 Senate Republicans tried in 2014 to push through severe new sanction triggers against the nation, and he praised Mr. Obama when he imposed them on Russia for destabilizing Ukraine. Both of the last two major defense bills authorized funding for security assistance to Ukraine, including lethal assistance the Obama administration has refused to provide. This year\u2019s bill authorizes $3.4 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative, a fourfold increase from last year, focused on increasing the size, capability and readiness of American forces in Europe against growing threats to their security and territorial integrity. Those bills, while championed by Mr. McCain, are in keeping with a long history of bipartisan agreements over checking Russia, like the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a trade measure that required emigration criteria to get certain trade benefits. In 2012, led by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, Congress overwhelmingly passed more sanctions tied to Russian human rights abuses. Last week, Congress passed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act as part of the broad defense bill, continuing a longstanding bipartisan focus on human rights and anticorruption efforts. \u201cI have found Congress on both sides of the aisle to be entirely robust on the issue of Russia,\u201d said William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital, noting that the Senate passed the 2012 measure 92 to 4.

Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d For the people whose emails were stolen, this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter, recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices, humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts \u201csuboptimal.\u201d \u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201d The United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201d Mr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn.

Democratic House Candidates Were Also Targets of Russian Hacking The fallout for nearly a dozen congressional candidates underscores the effect of the Russian influence operation on the American electoral system. Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed. \u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201d A Target for Break-Ins Sitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture. \u201cGOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair,\u201d reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19, 1972, with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again. There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have. \u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Tamene, who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F.B.I. agent, was not a full-time D.N.C. employee; he works for a Chicago-based contracting firm called The MIS Department . He was left to figure out, largely on his own, how to respond \u2014 and even whether the man who had called in to the D.N.C. switchboard was really an F.B.I. agent. \u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201d Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system. Photo An internal memo by Yared Tamene, a tech-support contractor at the D.N.C., expressed uncertainty about the identity of Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the F.B.I., who called to inform him of the breach. Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo. In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201d Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised. Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d \u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201d The F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201d By March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn. A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google. \u201cSomeone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account,\u201d the March 22 email said , adding that the sign-in attempt had occurred in Ukraine. \u201cGoogle stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.\u201d Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password. Photo A screenshot of the phishing email that Billy Rinehart clicked on, unknowingly giving Russian hackers access to his account. The New York Times has redacted Mr. Rinehart\u2019s email address. What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button. \u201cThis is a legitimate email,\u201d Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta\u2019s aides, who had noticed the alert. \u201cJohn needs to change his password immediately.\u201d With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.

Credit Dave Sanders for The New York Times During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C. The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated. One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.

Credit Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead. Their first major attack was detected on Oct. 7, 1996, when a computer operator at the Colorado School of Mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain. The school had a major contract with the Navy, and the operator warned his contacts there. But as happened two decades later at the D.N.C., at first \u201ceveryone was unable to connect the dots,\u201d said Thomas Rid , a scholar at King\u2019s College in London who has studied the attack. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investigators gave it a name \u2014 Moonlight Maze \u2014 and spent two years, often working day and night, tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end, they concluded that the total number of files stolen, if printed and stacked, would be taller than the Washington Monument. Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world. But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it. The Russians had not gone away, of course. \u201cThey were just a lot more stealthy,\u201d said Kevin Mandia , a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye \u2014 and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems. The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia. But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks. But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cEach time, they eventually met with some form of success,\u201d Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project , wrote recently in a soon-to-be published paper for the Carnegie Endowment. The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them. 2016 Election Hacking Coverage Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d So the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld. It was a brazen change in tactics, moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014, they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a little-known American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine, then in political turmoil. They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the steal-and-leak strategy. The Open Society Foundation, run by George Soros, was a major target, and when its documents were released , some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members. Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot. The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call. Advertisement Continue reading the main story With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers. \u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d No one knew just how bad the breach was \u2014 but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created, including Ms. Dacey, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann , a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie, the Washington law firm that handles D.N.C. political matters. \u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201d Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them. \u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201d Photo Michael Sussmann, a Washington lawyer and former cybercrime prosecutor at the Justice Department, received an email in late April confirming that the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system had been compromised. The D.N.C. immediately hired CrowdStrike , a cybersecurity firm, to scan its computers, identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day, CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia, Mr. Sussmann said. The work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer. It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes. \u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager. Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email. Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations. That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone. To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents. In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak. All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201d The D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage. \u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d The Media\u2019s Role Continue reading the main story Photo Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign protested at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times In mid-June, on Mr. Sussmann\u2019s advice, D.N.C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak, they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way, they figured, they could get ahead of the story, win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign. But the very next day, a new, deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2.0 appeared on the web, claiming to be the D.N.C. hacker \u2014 and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides. \u2014         GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 20, 2016 \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns. Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201d But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter. \u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201d That gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be. Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2.0 had been edited by someone calling himself, in Russian, Felix Edmundovich \u2014 an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky . Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian, generated by what was clearly a Russian-language version of Word. When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201d Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks.com , a site that sprang up in June, claiming to be the work of \u201chacktivists\u201d but posting more stolen documents. It, too, seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably, the website was registered in April, suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to what Guccifer 2.0 published on his site, he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications . The steady flow of Guccifer 2.0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6, 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland, Guccifer released the D.N.C.\u2019s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives, it was insider gold. Then WikiLeaks, a far more established outlet, began to publish the hacked material \u2014 just as Guccifer 2.0 had promised. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped out 44,053 D.N.C. emails with 17,761 attachments . Some of the messages made clear that some D.N.C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger, Mr. Sanders. That was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside. Mr. Trump, by now the Republican nominee, expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent, and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25, he sent out a lighthearted tweet : \u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7, a month before the election, the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta , Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. The same day, the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings, in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date, with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d \u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201d The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming. Wednesday@HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks . \u2014         Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) Oct. 2, 2016 But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming. Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling. In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d \u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201d Photo Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, disputed intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that the email leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d Credit Steffi Loos/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence. Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web. \u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201d Devising a Government Response Photo The D.N.C. headquarters in Washington. Credit Justin T. Gellerson for The New York Times Inside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea. In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim. In that case, embarrassing emails had also been released. But the real damage was done to Sony\u2019s own systems: More than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released. Within weeks, intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the North and its leadership . Mr. Obama called North Korea out in public, and issued some not-very-effective sanctions . The Chinese even cooperated, briefly cutting off the North\u2019s internet connections. As the first Situation Room meetings on the Russian hacking began in July, \u201cit was clear that Russia was going to be a much more complicated case,\u201d said one participant. The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics, and they were masters of \u201c kompromat ,\u201d their term for compromising information. But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president. \u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system. In August a group that called itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d published a set of software tools that looked like what the N.S.A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install \u201cimplants,\u201d malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A., a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar. The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning. The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes. Photo Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, pressed for a more muscular response to the Russians. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options. But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president. In a series of \u201cdeputies meetings\u201d run by Avril Haines , the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C.I.A., several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands. \u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201d Even something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky. \u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201d Instead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy. Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage. Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks \u2014 an offer he declined to take up. \u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201d But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting. Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters. But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony. The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role. But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified. A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201d Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. \u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded. Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201d A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201d The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that. The Next Target Continue reading the main story Photo President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. walked back toward the White House after delivering remarks about the election results last month. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive. Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump? In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals. What seems clear is that Russian hacking, given its success, is not going to stop. Two weeks ago, the German intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, warned that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. \u201cThe perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such,\u201d Mr. Kahl said. Now, he added, \u201cEurope is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance, and Germany to a particularly great extent.\u201d But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target. On the day after the presidential election, the cybersecurity company Volexity reported five new waves of phishing emails, evidently from Cozy Bear, aimed at think tanks and nonprofits in the United States. One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper. Its title: \u201cWhy American Elections Are Flawed.\u201d Correction: December 13, 2016 Editors\u2019 Note: An earlier version of the main photograph with this article, of a filing cabinet and computer at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, should not have been published.

Willie Cochran, 20th, is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud, two counts of extortion and two counts of bribery, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. Jason Meisner , Jeremy Gorner and Hal Dardick Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Willie Cochran was running for 20th Ward alderman as a political unknown a decade ago when he vowed to steer clear of the graft and corruption that had ensnared so many Chicago politicians over the years. \"Most people in the ward are tired of our public officials being embroiled in one controversy after another,\" Cochran, a former Chicago police officer, told the Tribune on the day incumbent Ald. Arenda Troutman was indicted on charges of taking kickbacks from contractors. But instead of cleaning up the sleaze, Cochran was charged by federal authorities with being yet another corrupt Chicago alderman. The 15-count indictment announced Wednesday alleged the South Side alderman stole tens of thousands of dollars in charitable contributions meant for poor children and seniors in the largely impoverished ward, funds he later used to gamble and pay for a portion of his daughter's college tuition. Using the broad powers that aldermen enjoy over business deals in their wards, Cochran also shook down a liquor store manager in exchange for his support on an ordinance change and took a bribe in connection with a federal program to clean up vacant eyesores, the charges alleged. Cochran, 64, was charged with 11 counts of wire fraud, two counts of extortion and two counts of bribery, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. He is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 23 at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. This week's indictment of South Side Ald. Willie Cochran adds a new name to a long list: Chicago politicians charged with crimes. Cochran was charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, federal program bribery and extortion. More here. Chicago aldermen have been frequent law-enforcement targets, with... (Chicago Tribune) In a statement Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon said the investigation arose from information provided by former Chicago Legislative Inspector General Faisal Khan, who 13 months ago turned over his files to the FBI after aldermen eliminated his post, complaining of his judgment and overreach. Khan told the Tribune on Wednesday that Cochran's indictment \"vindicated our work.\" He expressed hope that more federal charges could result from his work, saying, \"We referred a number of investigations to the FBI.\" The charges come two months after the Tribune first revealed that a federal grand jury was investigating Cochran for possible misuse of funds. The Tribune broke the news of the indictment Wednesday morning as Cochran attended the final City Council meeting of the year. Minutes later, Ald. Edward Burke, 14th, walked over to Cochran, showed him his iPad and spoke quietly to him for a couple of minutes while the council was busy honoring the Chicago Cubs with the World Series trophy at the front of chambers. In a text message to a Tribune reporter later Wednesday, Cochran vowed to continue to stay on as alderman while under indictment. He said he and his attorney, Thomas Anthony Durkin, would work with the U.S. attorney's office \"to provide the clarity that is needed to get this matter resolved.\" \"I can say my colleagues and the people of the 20th Ward are strong supporters for my family, and I am confident this will be resolved,\" he wrote. Durkin later said the alderman intends to fight the charges vigorously. The indictment again exposed the risk of aldermen leveraging their extensive powers \u2014 in this case over real estate development and liquor licenses \u2014 for bribery. Cubs as word came down that one of their colleagues who was on hand had been indicted on federal criminal charges. South Side Ald. Willie Cochran already was sitting in... An inimitably Chicago scene played out during Wednesday's City Council meeting as aldermen heaped praise on the world champion Cubs as word came down that one of their colleagues who was on hand had been indicted on federal criminal charges. South Side Ald. Willie Cochran already was sitting in... (John Byrne, Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart) According to the charges, Cochran was the sole signatory on the 20th Ward activities fund, a charity set up to host ward events and parties for constituents such as a summer back-to-school picnic, a Valentine's Day party for senior citizens and events during the holiday season. Cochran was charged with using \"a significant portion\" of the donations made over more than four years for his own personal use, including paying $5,000 toward his daughter's college tuition. He also withdrew about $25,000 from ATMs in or near casinos where he gambled, according to the indictment. In October, a real estate developer told the Tribune that the FBI had questioned him about a donation to Cochran for the ward fund. \"I'll tell you the same thing I told them,\" said the developer, who asked for anonymity. \"I gave him a check, I think it was for a couple hundred dollars. ... What he did with it, I have no clue.\" On Wednesday, another businessman who said he testified before the grand jury investigating Cochran told the Tribune he had written several checks to the alderman over recent years \u2014 some for as much as $300 or $500. \"I wrote a check to him for a fundraiser for kids going back to school,\" said the businessman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because federal authorities had not authorized him to talk. \"I was shocked really,\" he said of the charges against Cochran. \"He's always been a straight-up guy.\" According to the indictment, Cochran also solicited a $1,500 check from an attorney \u2014 identified only as Individual A \u2014 who represented real estate developers with properties in Cochran's ward in connection with a federal program to get boarded-up or foreclosed properties occupied as soon as possible. Prosecutors charged that in 2010 and 2011 Cochran provided letters of support to the attorney about a particular real estate project. The unidentified project was completed in 2014. In 2015, Cochran took a $3,000 cash bribe from a liquor store owner \u2014 identified as Individual B \u2014 in exchange for his support of an ordinance amending the municipal code to allow liquor sales in a two-block stretch of South Cottage Grove Avenue in the 20th Ward, the charges alleged. The owner wanted to sell the business, but the area had since gone \"dry,\" and the amendment was needed for the buyer to continue to sell liquor there. The amendment was passed by the City Council in April 2015. But in a twist earlier this year while Cochran was being investigated, the alderman proposed a new ordinance to again prohibit the sale of packaged liquor on that same stretch of Cottage Grove. The council approved that change in October. Individual B, identified by the Tribune through property records as the seller of the Cottage Grove liquor store in August 2015, declined to comment when a reporter knocked on his west suburban home Wednesday evening. Cochran had taken similar action with his campaign fund. State records show that since January 2015 the alderman has filed an unusually large number of revisions to his campaign finance paperwork \u2014 around 80, including 10 since early last month. Over the previous eight years, Cochran had filed only six amendments to his campaign records. In some of the amended campaign finance reports, Cochran revealed he had paid himself out of his campaign fund. In several instances, Cochran did not report those payments until well after he filed his campaign reports with state elections officials \u2014 in some cases more than a year or two later. But the indictment against Cochran makes no allegations that he misused his campaign fund. The City Council has a long, notorious history of corruption as 29 aldermen have been convicted of crimes related to their official duties since 1972. The most recent, Isaac \"Ike\" Carothers, pleaded guilty in 2010 to bribery and tax charges for accepting $40,000 in home improvements for backing a developer's controversial project in his 29th Ward. His father, William, a former alderman, was convicted 27 years earlier. Cochran was elected in 2007 after Troutman was charged with bribery for soliciting donations from developers seeking to do business in the ward. Cochran was quick to capitalize on the news, publicly calling for Troutman to resign on the day she was arrested by the FBI. Troutman pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to four years in prison. Federal authorities have hinted at other investigations connected to City Hall . In August, Franshuan Myles, the head of a nonprofit group that allegedly made a $5,000 payment to a West Side alderman, pleaded not guilty to charges alleging she used state grant funds to cover personal expenses instead of providing summer jobs for youth. Charges alleged that Myles, president and executive director of Divine Praise Inc., wrote a check for $4,932 to \"Individual A,\" previously identified by the Tribune as 28th Ward Ald. Jason Ervin , after her group received a $60,000 grant for youth employment. Ervin has not been charged with wrongdoing. Cochran, who is considered an ally of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, does not hold any position of power \u2014 such as a committee or caucus chairmanship \u2014 in the council hierarchy. He won a third term in office last year, surviving a tough runoff election. After that victory, Cochran told reporters he and his wife were going to celebrate by flying to Las Vegas and renting a convertible for a West Coast road trip. According to the biography posted on his ward's website, Cochran is the youngest of 10 children. He has a master's degree in public administration from the Illinois Institute of Technology and also has a bachelor's degree in sociology. Cochran retired from the Chicago Police Department with the rank of sergeant in 2003 after 26 years on the force. Court records hint at recent financial troubles for Cochran. He has been the target of three foreclosure lawsuits over his personal home and laundry businesses he held a financial stake in. Cochran, who is paid $116,208 a year as alderman and also collects $60,280 annually from his police pension, suggested in late 2014 that aldermen should be paid more, saying he often works 60 hours a week or more. Days later, he was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court claiming he had defaulted on the $420,000 mortgage on his Woodlawn home, according to court records. He still owed more than $384,000 on the mortgage as of November 2014, records showed. The foreclosure was dismissed in July 2015 \"due to the fact that the loan was reinstated,\" court records state. Records show it was the second time Cochran and his wife had faced foreclosure stemming from the same 2006 loan. A similar lawsuit was filed in 2012 and then dismissed months later after the loan was renegotiated, according to court records. In 2013, Cochran, who for years owned the Rainbow Brite laundromat on East 63rd Street, was named in a foreclosure lawsuit involving a string of laundromats he had a financial stake in, according to court records. That lawsuit alleged that the business owner, Alexander Fletcher, had defaulted on a $1.5 million loan involving several laundromats. It was dismissed in 2014.

Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the family planning group performs abortions at some clinics. J. Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards, addresses the Democratic National Convention in July. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the family planning group performs abortions at some clinics. J. Scott Applewhite/AP The Obama administration is trying to protect Planned Parenthood's federal funding before the president turns over the reins of government to Republicans who have historically been hostile to the family planning group. The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a regulation Wednesday that says states that award federally funded grants for women's health programs can't discriminate against Planned Parenthood . The regulation doesn't name Planned Parenthood, but it was clear the rule was written with the organization in mind. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the family planning group performs abortions at some clinics. \"President Obama has cemented his legacy as a champion for women's health,\" said Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards in a written release . \"This rule protects birth control, cancer screenings, [sexually transmitted infection] testing and treatment and other health care for millions of people.\" Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide family planning services to women get federal funding through the Public Health Service Act . The group says 1.5 million of its patients benefit from the money provided by the federal government. Article continues after sponsorship Planned Parenthood gets more than $500 million a year from the federal government. About 75 percent of that comes from Medicaid, for medical care provided to patients with low incomes. The new HHS rule reinforces federal law that says the agency cannot discriminate against qualified organizations in granting federal funds. Still, the rule could be overturned in 2017 when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Federal lawmakers are allowed to roll back regulations under the Congressional Review Act. Or they could go through a formal rule-making process to reverse Wednesday's action. ",

By David Filipov December 14 at 3:01 PM Follow @davidfilipov MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladi\u00admir Putin is winning.\u00a0For now.\u00a0 The Russian leader\u00a0is winning because the\u00a0post-Cold War order he has railed against has been thrown into chaos, and the Kremlin\u2019s fingerprints are widely seen to be all over it.\u00a0 A year ago, Russia faced a united Europe, an expanded NATO alliance, a paucity of geopolitical allies and the possibility of four more years of poor relations with the United States under a Hillary Clinton presidency. Today,\u00a0Putin\u2019s military contingent in Syria just helped the government essentially retake Aleppo. The CIA has concluded that his hackers worked to help elect Donald Trump, who has dismissed commitments to Europe and touted better ties with Russia. [ CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House ] President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) In Washington, London, Berlin and Paris, Soviet-style propaganda is back. It\u2019s been thoroughly updated, though, and comes packaged as fake news, cyberattacks and WikiLeaks. Whether or not the\u00a0Kremlin\u00a0is guilty of doing all the things Western accusers say it is, Russia is now considered a master purveyor of geopolitical disorder. And that, for Putin, is a win. \u201cOf course the Kremlin likes the fact of such an atmosphere of chaos,\u201d Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Putin adviser, said in a recent interview. \u201cBecause we are traders of chaos. We sell it, and the more chaos there is in the world, the better it is for the Kremlin.\u201d\u00a0 But Putin\u2019s successes, if that is what they are, are\u00a0tactical and temporary, said Fiona Hill, a Brookings Institution scholar and co-author of a biography of the Russian leader. For years, Putin has been the world\u2019s leader in geopolitical disruption, and the United States under President Obama has been a predictable force and therefore an easy target, she said. If Putin really did contribute to Trump\u2019s victory, he may just have handed his crown over to his biggest rival. \u201cThe land of unpredictability and surprise is the land that Putin and the Kremlin have inhabited for the last part of the last 10 years,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re not alone. Trump is going to be the great disrupter.\u201d In the long run, Russia needs the United States to be, if not a friend and a partner, then a neutralized, inward-looking force, she said: \u201cNo one knows if Trump is going to make it that.\u201d Putin has consistently spoken about the need for\u00a0modern Russia to have friends.\u00a0Unlike during the Cold War, Russia is not trying to transform the world order with its own ideology. Russia does not need world revolution. It needs to parlay its status as a master of disruption into a magnet for business partners.\u00a0\u00a0 [ Putin wants revenge and respect, and hacking the U.S. is his way of getting it ] In this sense, Trump\u2019s victory is \u201ca tactical victory for Putin,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center, but also \u201cone that comes with exaggerated expectations\u201d because of the inability to predict what a Trump presidency will bring.\u00a0\u201cIn some sense, it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Kolesnikov said. Case in point: Trump\u2019s choice of ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson, whose ties to Russia include major oil deals and a 2013 Order of Friendship award, as secretary of state. Some Russian officials have had trouble hiding their satisfaction with a choice that appears to showcase Russia\u2019s newfound influence. \u201cOne can assert with more certainty that it is the attitude toward Russia that has become one of decisive factors in the final choice in favor of the businessman from ExxonMobil, who has such obvious ties and interests with respect to our country, [and who is] an opponent of the anti-Russian sanctions,\u201d said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the Committee on International Affairs in the upper house of the Russian parliament. Translation: Winning. The trouble with all this Russian gamesmanship, Pavlovsky said, is that it is making enemies among people with long memories. And that is the paradox at the heart of the Putin worldview. Russia\u2019s leaders may enjoy watching the West chase its tail looking for clues of Kremlin meddling, but Moscow does not want to shoulder the blame.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact that there are people who are convinced that Russia acted on behalf of Donald Trump is frightening,\u201d one senior Russian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, said Tuesday. \u201cIn the long run it could be very dangerous for people to think that Russia may interfere with other people\u2019s elections.\u201d This explains the considerable efforts on the part of Putin and his aides to temper their enthusiasm for the new administration, at least in public. Consider Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s choice of Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely illogical to make any forecasts, not to mention to cherish some dreams, that everything will all of a sudden change instantly and everything that couldn\u2019t gain traction and was barely moving will suddenly follow some amazingly successful scenario,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cWe are sober enough and realize that this won\u2019t happen.\u201d Similarly, Putin and his aides repeatedly and vehemently deny allegations of interference in the Brexit vote, as well as the\u00a0U.S. intelligence accusation\u00a0that\u00a0the Russian government helped provide WikiLeaks with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign staff. They also deny any intention to interfere in upcoming German elections. [ U.S. accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections ] Putin dismissed the U.S. allegations as \u201c hysteria \u201d intended \u201conly to distract the attention of the American people from the substance of what hackers had put out.\u201d On Wednesday, Peskov called the charges \u201cmyths, bedtime stories and boogeymen\u201d and suggested that unsuccessful politicians in the West are trying to blame Moscow for their failures.\u00a0\u00a0 The allegations have not hurt Putin\u2019s approval rating at home, which jumped from 81\u00a0percent in June to 86\u00a0percent in November, according to the Moscow-based\u00a0 Levada Analytical Center . Every time accusations of campaign interference fly, the Kremlin charges hypocrisy (American advisers helped Boris Yeltsin win reelection in 1996). And it has brought up another good old tool, denying it all \u2014 sanctions, hacking suspicions, the international sports doping scandal \u2014 as Russophobia. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou all know that we have encountered attempts to pressure us from abroad over these last years,\u201d Putin said in his annual address to parliament this month. \u201cThey have used every means, from spreading myths about Russian aggression, propaganda and meddling in others\u2019 elections to persecuting our athletes, including our Paralympic athletes.\u201d The approach seems to be working. A poll published in November by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Levada Center found that only 23\u00a0percent of Russians say they have a positive view of the United States.\u00a0 Winning.\u00a0 \u201cThe majority of Russians doesn\u2019t even believe in the doping affair, not to mention this interference in the American elections,\u201d Kolesnikov said. And many who believe it appreciate \u201cthe image of Putin as a strong, cunning man.\u201d \u201cThis is a win-win strategy for the Russian president,\u201d he said. At least for now.\u00a0\u00a0 Natalya Abbakumova contributed to this report. \u00a0Read more ",

One focus is the Russian break-in at the Democratic National Committee . Investigators believe the attack began in July of 2015 -- more than a year before the presidential election. Thousands of emails were sent to hundreds of organizations. New York Times investigation on how Russia tampered with U.S. election Ultimately the hackers -- known as Cozy Bear and tied to Russian intelligence -- burrowed into the computers of the DNC. And for more than a year they stole documents and emails that would later come back to haunt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cThis is unprecedented...\u201d said Adam Hodge, communications director with the DNC. \u201cA foreign government attacked the entire Democratic Party...with one goal, and that was to help Donald Trump.\u201d The U.S. intelligence community is split on whether the hacks were intended to help Mr. Trump,\u00a0 but since at least 2010 U.S. intelligence analysts have been warning of Russian cyber intrusions and information warfare. Intel sources also tell CBS News that the hacks could not have occurred without the blessing of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 \u201cWe were up against two adversaries. It wasn\u2019t just Donald Trump.

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Michigan Republican Party chair, speaks before a Republican presidential primary debate in Detroit in March. Carlos Osorio/AP Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is in line to lead the Republican National Committee. President-elect Donald Trump announced McDaniel's appointment on Wednesday as the RNC deputy chair. That puts her in place to succeed outgoing Chairman Reince Priebus, whom Trump has already tapped as his White House chief of staff. A supporter of Trump's during the primary, McDaniel not only oversaw a critical state that helped Trump pull off his upset win but is also the niece of Mitt Romney. The 2012 GOP presidential nominee was a vocal opponent of Trump's during the primary, but he later walked back his criticism as he made a failed pitch to become secretary of state. \"I'm excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as RNC Deputy Chair and I look forward to her serving as the Party's Chairman in 2017,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan, and I know she will bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee.\" Article continues after sponsorship McDaniel has led the Michigan GOP since February 2015 and helped turn the state red for the first time since 1988. Trump praised her efforts last week at a stop in Michigan on his \"thank you\" tour, telling her and the crowd, \"I was very impressed with you. She didn't sleep for six months.\" The choice of McDaniel is also seen as a victory by Priebus, who reportedly preferred her over Nick Ayers. Some Trump loyalists were pushing for Ayers, an aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to get the job. In the same statement, Priebus called her \"an outstanding fundraiser, and her ability to drive support for our mission of electing Republicans up and down the ballot gives me full confidence that she will be able to continue building on the RNC's success and organizational strength as we head into important elections in 2017 and 2018.\" Trump also appointed his Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik, to be deputy co-chairman. Both are expected to be voted on next month at the RNC's winter meeting, but typically RNC members respect the wishes of an incoming or sitting president. So with Priebus' exit, McDaniel would be the new leader of the RNC with Paduchik as her No. 2. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Twice as many American voters feel hopeful as feel depressed about the outcome of the election. \u00a0More feel relieved than scared. \u00a0Some feel empowered and excited, but plenty feel embarrassed or angry. \u00a0 These are some of the findings of the latest Fox News Poll of registered voters nationwide. More than one-third of voters have a positive outlook for Trump: 25 percent expect him to be an \u201cabove average\u201d president and 11 percent say he\u2019ll be one of the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest.\u201d \u00a0 CLICK TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS Voters are about three times as likely to say he\u2019ll be \u201cone of the worst\u201d presidents (31 percent) as one of the greatest, while 12 percent say \u201cbelow average.\u201d \u00a0Sixteen percent peg Trump for \u201caverage.\u201d The bar is lower for Trump than it was for the man he will replace. \u00a0A month after Barack Obama won the 2008 election, 19 percent said he would be one of the country\u2019s greatest presidents, 43 percent a \u201cgood\u201d president, and just 6 percent expected him to be one of the worst. One-quarter of Republicans expect Trump will be one of the greatest presidents (24 percent). \u00a0More than twice as many Democrats think he\u2019ll be one of the worst (58 percent). \u00a0 By a 10-point margin, more voters view the president-elect as a \u201cdivider\u201d than a \u201cuniter\u201d (52-42 percent). \u00a0In January 2009, 80 percent considered Obama a \u201cuniter\u201d according to a USA Today/Gallup poll. \u00a0 The new poll, released Wednesday, also finds 59 percent of voters feel hopeful about the outcome of the election. \u00a0That\u2019s more than feel relieved (50 percent), embarrassed (45 percent), excited (43 percent), scared (41 percent), or empowered (41 percent). \u00a0About one-third feels angry (37 percent) or depressed (30 percent). \u00a0 \u00a0 Maybe not surprisingly, 96 percent of those who are excited about the election results also feel hopeful, and 76 percent of angry voters are embarrassed. Views are divided on Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks (44 percent approve vs. 46 percent disapprove), and a 52-percent majority is at least somewhat concerned the real estate mogul will put his business interests ahead of the country\u2019s. Among Republicans, 5 percent disapprove of the people Trump has selected for his Cabinet, 10 percent see him as a divider, and one in five is concerned about a conflict of interest (19 percent). A 60-32 percent majority approved of the job Obama was doing picking his Cabinet in February 2009. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract Overall, a record 47 percent of voters have a favorable view of Trump, up from 38 percent before the election. \u00a0For comparison, 68 percent viewed Obama favorably following his first presidential win in December 2008. \u00a0Currently, 57 percent have a positive view of Obama. \u00a0Former President George W. Bush had a 60 percent favorable after his 2000 win, and today 54 percent feel that way. Trump\u2019s also made gains on character: 44 percent say he has the temperament to serve effectively as president. \u00a0That\u2019s up from 36 percent a month ago -- and a new high. \u00a0It would probably go higher if he spent less time tweeting. \u00a0 Related stories... Fox News Poll: Trump and the Carrier deal By a 63-27 percent margin, voters think the way Trump uses Twitter is inappropriate. \u00a0In addition, three times as many view his public comments as \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reactions rather than \u201cwell thought-out\u201d statements (69-19 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,034 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 11-13, 2016. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

    "text": "Dems scramble to prevent their own from defecting to Trump Published               December 14, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Senate Democrats have been scrambling to prevent two of their members from taking a post in the Trump administration, trying to prevent any defection that could bolster Republicans\u2019 control of the chamber.\u00a0 They recently launched a \u201cfull court press\u201d to retain Sens. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota, after each met with Republican President-elect Donald Trump, one senior Senate Democrat told Fox News. Manchin now appears less likely to bolt -- after saying he wants to remain in the Senate and being passed over for Energy secretary -- which puts the focus squarely on Heitkamp.\u00a0 The first-term lawmaker, who faces reelection in 2018 in a conservative state, still appears in the running for the Agriculture secretary post. A Trump transition team source told Fox News the president-elect \u201creally wants her\u201d for the job. Either departure would poses short- and long-term challenges for Senate Democrats.\u00a0 If Heitkamp left, her seat could remain empty for months, meaning Democrats would have one less vote to stop any of Trump\u2019s first-100-day initiatives, which could including getting a Supreme Court nominee confirmed in the Senate or passing a tax overhaul. The North Dakota legislature last year changed its laws so that a Senate seat remains vacant, without a place-holder senator, until it is filled in a special-election vote held within 95 days of a resignation. In the longer-term, Senate Republicans would have a solid chance of winning Heitkamp\u2019s seat in a special election and adding to their 52-48 member majority.\u00a0 In West Virginia, the governor would under the law appoint a temporary replacement and hold a special election within 48 to 120 days to fill the seat for the remainder of the term which ends in 2017. West Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor likely would appoint a Democrat to fill the seat in the interim.\u00a0 As a Democrat in an increasingly conservative state, Manchin initially had appeared at risk of leaving. And his words and actions in recent weeks -- criticizing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and risking a government shutdown over coal miner benefits -- suggested a willingness to depart the Senate, or at least prepare for a tough reelection fight in 2018 in a state that went for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton 68-26 percent.\u00a0 Manchin last month chastised Reid for calling Trump after his White House win a \u201csexual predator,\u201d saying Reid\u2019s remarks were an \u201cabsolute embarrassment\u201d and \u201cneedlessly \u2026 tearing this country apart.\u201d Reid recently told CNN that Manchin\u2019s comments were \u201chis way to get out the door.\u201d Democrats, in an apparent effort to solidify their caucus, recently made Manchin part of their leadership team. And Trump\u2019s official decision Wednesday to pick former Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry for Energy secretary, for which Machin was being considered, settled the speculation for now.\u00a0 \u201cI was humbled to be considered for the Secretary of Energy position,\u201d Manchin said in a statement. \u201cI have dedicated my life in public service to doing what is best for the people of West Virginia. Right now, I believe that I can best serve my state of West Virginia in the United States Senate.\u201d Heitkamp and Manchin are among 10 Democrats in the chamber seeking reelection in 2018. Trump has only three remaining Cabinet posts to fill -- Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs.

    "text": "Yahoo suffers world's biggest hack affecting 1 billion users Yahoo headquarters Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press Yahoo says more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in 2013. Yahoo says more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in 2013. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Yahoo has discovered a 3-year-old security breach that enabled a hacker to compromise more than 1 billion user accounts, breaking the company's own humiliating record for the biggest security breach in history. The digital heist disclosed Wednesday occurred in August 2013, more than a year before a separate hack that Yahoo\u00a0 announced nearly three months ago \u00a0. That breach affected at least 500 million users, which had been the most far-reaching hack until the latest revelation. \"It's shocking,\" security expert Avivah Litan of Gartner Inc. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion \u2014 a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. (Andrea Peterson) But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice \u2014 once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password and questions since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. QUESTIONS FOR VERIZON News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the \"new development before reaching any final conclusions.\" Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses \"definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,\" Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. \"This just adds to fuel to the fire and it won't help Yahoo's cause,\" said Eric Jackson, a longtime critic of the company's management. Although he has in the past, Jackson doesn't currently own Yahoo stock. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. Associated Press ",

More than 1 billion Yahoo accounts may have been exposed after a third-party hacker hit the internet company in a separate attack from the one that was revealed in September . \"Yahoo believes an unauthorized third party, in August 2013, stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts,\" the company said in a statement. \"The company has not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft. Yahoo believes this incident is likely distinct from the incident the company disclosed on September 22, 2016.\" That hack, which affected 500 million accounts, was among the biggest breaches of all time. At 1 billion this time, Yahoo may have earned a dubious new honor. The data stolen from the newly revealed breach includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some instances, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. \"The investigation indicates that the stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected,\" the Yahoo statement said. Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Reuters Authorities handed over data files from a third party that were purported to include Yahoo data, according to the company's chief information security officer, Bob Lord. \"As we previously disclosed in November, law enforcement provided us with data files that a third party claimed was Yahoo user data. We analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data,\" Lord wrote. Through forensic analysis, Yahoo was then able to determine that a breach occurred in August 2013. It's \"very rare\" to learn about two mega-breaches in such a short window of time, Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security at the cybersecurity company SentinelOne and a former Yahoo employee, told NBC News. \"It's really few and far between,\" he said. \"Having multiple distinct breaches doesn't sound good.\" What if you have an account? Yahoo will notify potentially affected users and require them to change their passwords. Because security questions and answers were stolen, Yahoo has nullified any unencrypted questions and answers, Lord wrote. The latest disclosure comes after a tumultuous year for Yahoo. It was announced in July that Verizon had reached an agreement to buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion. The deal is still in process, and it remains unclear how the latest revelation could affect the sale. In a November SEC filing, Yahoo warned Verizon could still pull out of the deal. \"There is no assurance\" the merger will be \"consummated in a timely manner or at all,\" the filing said. It's also possible Verizon could renegotiate, buying Yahoo for a lesser price. \"Breaches or security concerns have never materially impacted an acquisition but this one could be different,\" Grossman said. Related: Yahoo Warns Verizon Could Pull Out of $4.8 Billion Deal In addition to possibly scuppering one of the year's biggest deals, Yahoo's September mega-breach has led to a plethora of federal, legal, state and local investigations, along with dozens of class-action lawsuits from consumers. There's no telling what could come after this latest disclosure. Alyssa Newcomb ",

Yahoo announced a new data breach. It's time to update passwords, but also beware phishing emails. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 12 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Yahoo user? Be ready to refresh your account passwords. But beware: this is prime time for scammers to prey. The Internet company said late Wednesday as many as 1 billion user accounts may have been compromised in a breach that took place in September 2013. That comes on top of a breach involving as many as 500 million Yahoo users that the company reported in September. Yahoo is reaching out to users, advising them to change passwords and upgrade their security. It's also sending possibly affected users email. Look carefully.\u00a0Not all emails that look like they come from Yahoo are legit. Phishing emails from crooks masquerading as Yahoo may asks users to click on links. Yahoo's won't. They also won't contain attachments and never request users'\u00a0personal information, the company says. \"If an email you receive about these issues prompts you to click on a link, download an attachment, or asks you for information, the email was not sent by Yahoo and may be an attempt to steal your personal information. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from such suspicious emails,\" the company said. The company has posted examples of what that email looks like on its site . Change passwords, security questions Yahoo is advising users to change their passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts in which they used the same or similar information as with their\u00a0Yahoo account. Users should also consider enabling two-step authentication on their Yahoo accounts, to provide an extra and very strong level of security. This form of verification sends\u00a0a text message or call\u00a0to the user's\u00a0phone\u00a0with a code as a second verification step. The code which must be typed in\u00a0before the account can be opened. Instructions on how to enable two-step authentication in Yahoo are on its website. Review non-Yahoo accounts In addition, users need to think about passwords and security questions from\u00a0other accounts on which they gave the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account and possibly change them as well. Once hackers have access to ID and password information for one system, they routinely try the same combination against multiple other platforms to see which ones work, an easily automated process. Careful of clicking Users should avoid\u00a0clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails that claim to be updates from Yahoo or others about the breach. Yahoo is not sending such emails, it said. Hackers often use news of big breaches to conduct \"phishing\" campaigns, sending official-looking emails that make it seem as if Yahoo or other legitimate services are asking them to supply information or click through to a link to repair any damage\u00a0\u2014 something legitimate services will not do. How not to get duped by email phishing scams When in doubt, call or email the company that appears to be sending the message separately, don't go through the email you've been sent. Finally, all users should review their online accounts\u00a0for suspicious activity. That includes banks, credit card companies and\u00a0hotel and airline loyalty programs. 12 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hPoAAY ",

Yahoo says more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in 2013. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Tracey Lien Contact Reporter Yahoo said Wednesday that hackers stole data that could be connected to more than 1\u00a0billion accounts \u2014\u00a0believed to be the most users affected in a single breach. The Sunnyvale, Calif., tech firm said the breach probably occurred in August 2013\u00a0and is not linked to a hack disclosed in September that affected some 500 million user accounts.\u00a0 Chief information and security officer Bob Lord wrote on the Yahoo blog that\u00a0the company became aware of the\u00a0breach in November when law enforcement officials provided the company with files that a third-party claimed contained Yahoo user data. \u201cWe analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data,\u201d Lord said. \u201cBased on further analysis of this data \u2026 we believe an unauthorized third party \u2026 stole data associated with more than one billion accounts.\" Lord said the company had not yet identified the party responsible for the theft. User data that may have been stolen includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted and unencrypted security questions and answers, among other details. The investigation so far suggests hackers did not obtain credit card or bank account information. \"We\u2019ve taken steps to secure user accounts, and we are working closely with law enforcement,\u201d Yahoo said in a prepared statement. The company has reached out to users it believes were affected by the breach and is urging them to change their passwords. Given that the breach occurred three years ago, resetting users\u2019 passwords might be too little too late, according to security experts. \u201cThe real issue now is that these passwords\u00a0will be used to breach thousands of other websites unrelated to Yahoo,\u201d\u00a0said Shuman Ghosemajumder, chief technology officer of Shape Security, who used to head Google's trust and safety product teams.\u00a0\"Until users change their passwords [on other sites], those accounts may continue to be accessible to cybercriminals.\u201d The latest breach is yet another setback for the tech firm, whose sale to Verizon was already on shaky ground earlier this year when it disclosed the previous\u00a0breach affecting 500 million user accounts -- itself the largest in the history of data breaches. That breach occurred in 2014 and went undetected by the tech firm for nearly two years. This latest hack, which might affect twice the number of\u00a0accounts, would take the cake, though. \u201cThis is a massive issue,\u201d said Jo Webber, chief executive of security firm Spirion. \u201cMost companies that don\u2019t have the resources of Yahoo will find a breach in less than a year. Why did it take Yahoo three years?\u201d Verizon had agreed to pay $4.83 billion to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business in July, and was made aware of the 2014\u00a0data breach only after the deal had been signed. The company said at the time that it had reason to believe the breach had \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on the deal. On Wednesday, Verizon said it \u201cwill evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation [and]\u00a0we will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.\u201d Security experts said they\u2019d be surprised if the Verizon deal went through unscathed, though, because the scale of the breaches could be an enormous liability to any company that acquires Yahoo. The Internet company is already the subject of class-action lawsuits resulting from the breach it announced in September.\u00a0 If any of the user accounts were in Europe, the company could be subject to tough European penalties, too, Webber said. And while Verizon mulls over how to proceed with its\u00a0Yahoo purchase, security experts such as George Avetisov, CEO of biometrics security firm HYPR, suggest Internet users consider their next steps as well. \u201cThe only solution is to think back: as a Yahoo user, did you ever use your password anywhere else? Avetisov said. \u201cIt would be prudent to change everything. tracey.lien@latimes.com Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rick Perry was picked to run the Department of Energy , cutting down dead trees is the new Gold Rush happening in California , Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade is coming back , and the National Film Registry\u2019s Class of 2016 has arrived .

And if the matter is not resolved through that process, it would be standard for the GSA to bring the case before the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals. The letter also says that the GSA deputy commissioner told them that the GSA has reached out the Trump transition team with the concerns that have been raised about the lease but have not heard back. But the GSA spokesperson said: \"We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,\" the spokesperson continued. \"In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office. GSA is committed to responsibly administering all of the leases to which it is a party,\" the statement adds. If Trump does not divest from the Washington hotel property, which the Trump Organization leases from the federal government, Trump would effectively become both tenant and landlord to the property as president. Asked about the letter on a call with reporters Wednesday, RNC communications director Sean Spicer said that Trump will address the matter at an expected announcement about his business interests in January. Trump previously said he would hold a press conference on Dec. 15th to clarify how he'll separate himself from his businesses, but that press conference has now been moved to January, according to the transition team. Ethics advocates have called for Trump to completely divest from his businesses in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, but Trump has only said that he would turn over control to his two adult sons. Further details about the plan were not released. 0 Shares ",

The FBI and other agencies don't fully endorse that view, but few officials would dispute that the Russian operation was intended to harm Clinton's candidacy by leaking embarrassing emails about Democrats. The latest intelligence said to show Putin's involvement goes much further than the information the U.S. was relying on in October, when all 17 intelligence agencies signed onto a statement attributing the Democratic National Committee hack to Russia. The statement said officials believed that \"only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\" That was an intelligence judgment based on an understanding of the Russian system of government, which Putin controls with absolute authority. Now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation, the intelligence officials say. Their use of the term \"high confidence\" implies that the intelligence is nearly incontrovertible. \"It is most certainly consistent with the Putin that I have watched and used to work with when I was an ambassador and in the government,\" said Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. \"He has had a vendetta against Hillary Clinton, that has been known for a long time because of what she said about his elections back in the parliamentary elections of 2011. He wants to discredit American democracy and make us weaker in terms of leading the liberal democratic order. And most certainly he likes President-elect Trump's views on Russia,\" McFaul added. Clinton cast doubt on the integrity of Russia's elections. As part of contingency planning for potential retaliation against Russia, according to officials, U.S. intelligence agencies have stepped up their probing into his personal financial empire. Play ",

But many ex-inmates have traded incarceration for a cycle of homelessness, drug abuse and petty crime. Jenny Espino , USA TODAY Network-California Published Dec. 14, 2016 Email Comment Ruben Lopez Jr. wakes up on a rundown leather couch inside a dingy auto shop in the Los Angeles suburbs. He feels the familiar temptation of an old enemy. His body aches, his mind buzzes, his nose runs and his stomach twists. He craves meth just to steady himself and knows it is only two blocks away, at a small homeless camp under a bridge. Lopez, 57, a longtime addict, was serving a life sentence in prison for a third-strike methamphetamine conviction until last year, when he was released by Proposition 47, which downgraded drug possession and most small thefts to misdemeanors. Prop 47 felt like emancipation at first, Lopez said, but freedom has not gone as planned. Ruben Lopez Jr., a meth addict who was released under Prop 47 after 20 years in prison, spends his nights in his cousin's auto shop in Downey, Calif. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) After two decades behind bars, his only job prospects are low-paying temp work. He would be homeless if not for the generosity of his cousin, who lets him sleep in the auto shop. He is still smoking meth. He knows that if police were to bust him again, he\u2019d be locked up for hours, not years. So, did Prop 47 help him? \"No,\" Lopez says, with a weary shake of his head. \"It helped me get out of jail. But ultimately it just let me loose to bury myself.\" Two years after it was approved by California voters, Prop 47 has scaled back mass incarceration of drug addicts, but successful reform is woefully incomplete. Proponents celebrate how the law freed at least 13,500 inmates like Lopez from harsh sentences in crowded prisons and jails, but Prop 47 has done little to help these people restart their lives. Instead, the unprecedented release of inmates has exposed the limits of California\u2019s neglected social service programs: Thousands of addicts and mentally ill people have traded a life behind bars for a churning cycle of homelessness, substance abuse and petty crime. Prop 47 earmarked millions saved in prison costs for inmate rehabilitation, but not a penny has been spent. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s shortage of treatment programs is more glaring than ever. Expanding rehab would be expensive, but it is still a cheaper, more effective and more humane strategy for addressing addiction than locking drug abusers in prison. \"The problem is, if you don\u2019t actually do anything to change conditions of their lives, they\u2019re going to be back on the streets anyway,\" said Elliot Currie, a University of California, Irvine criminologist. \"What\u2019s to prevent them from going back to the same old ways when they get out? The answer is nothing.\" x Share Propsition 47 freed roughly 13,500 inmates and erased an estimated 198,000 low-level drug and theft felony convictions. But many released by Prop 47 struggle to find the resources to turn their lives around. Kristen Hwang/The Desert Sun This alarming lack of support services is one key finding in a landmark investigation by USA TODAY Network-California journalists\u00a0who spent seven months analyzing the impacts of Prop 47, a sweeping criminal justice reform law that has been debated and demonized\u00a0but rarely understood. To uncover the ramifications of the law, reporters from four publications \u2013 The Desert Sun, The Ventura County Star, The Record Searchlight and The Salinas Californian \u2013 filed 65 records requests, scrutinized thousands of pages of public documents and performed over 50 interviews with policymakers, academics, police, district attorneys, public defenders, drug addicts and former felons. Among our findings: How we did it: The Prop 47 project California police have dramatically deprioritized drug busts in the wake of Prop 47, arresting and citing about 22,000 fewer people in 2015, a 9.5 percent decrease in the first year since the possession of meth, heroin and cocaine was downgraded to a misdemeanor. Nearly 200,000 felony convictions have been retroactively erased by Prop 47 as of September, according to a first-ever analysis. Government agencies were not required to track how many convictions were reduced, so journalists gathered public records from 21 counties to calculate a statewide estimate. Many former felons will be slow to take advantage of their restored rights because they are unaware their convictions have been downgraded. For those who are aware, however, Prop 47 offers an unparalleled chance for better jobs. Tens of thousands of people\u00a0no longer have to report felony convictions on job applications, making them drastically more employable than they\u2019ve been in years or decades. Michael Romano, a Stanford law expert who helped write Prop 47, stressed in a recent interview the law has been \"amazingly successful\" in its primary goal, which was always to get low-level drug offenders out of California\u2019s crowded, damaging prison system. But tackling drug addiction and mental illness, which plague so many who were released under the law, is a task that will require investing hundreds of millions of dollars in community treatment programs across the state. \"It is incumbent on local governments to engage this problem,\" Romano said. \"Prop 47 was not a cure-all. It\u2019s not a panacea. It is one piece in an extraordinarily complicated puzzle \u2013 perhaps the most complicated puzzle in our communities.\" Many inmates released under Prop 47 have ended up homeless on the streets of Los Angeles' infamous Skid Row, shown here in November. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) A criminal history Wayne Woods, a homeless drug addict who was released by Prop 47, walks through a small park near Union Station in Los Angeles. (Photo: Kristen Hwang/The Desert Sun) For the first time in 20 years, Wayne Woods was a free man. Homeless, but free. Woods, 53, who has been a cocaine and heroin drug addict for most of his life, was released by Prop 47 in March after serving 20 years in prison. With nowhere to go, Woods found his way to Los Angeles\u2019s infamous Skid Row, where tents and cardboard shelters crowd the streets between soup kitchens and free clinics. Needles litter the ground. Drugs are used in plain sight. Woods could not resist for long. He was rearrested in June after a police officer spotted him smoking crack on a street corner. At the police station, Woods realized how much things had changed. The same drugs that had locked him up for years felt like they were barely illegal at all. He was back on the streets in two weeks. \"In my case, it\u2019s worse,\" Woods said, wandering through downtown LA, carrying everything he owns in a backpack. \"In prison, everything was provided. I had a place to stay. I had meals. I had a job, if I wanted to work. And if I wanted to do some drugs, I could have gotten that in there too.\" Like Woods, many of the drug addicts released under Prop 47 found it easy to slip back into their old habits after leaving the system because they didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t access rehab programs. Their plight is the latest chapter in California\u2019s century-long neglect of the addicted and the mentally ill. In the same way addicts have spent generations in the prison system, the U.S. once locked up the mentally ill in asylums. After World War II, Congress promised to replace the shameful asylum system with a network of community mental health centers. The asylums closed, but most of the centers never opened. Patients were freed, but not cured. California made the same mistake. In 1968, the state shifted responsibility for the mentally ill to the counties\u00a0but never followed through with funding. Then-Governor Ronald Reagan closed nine state mental hospitals but twice vetoed the transfer of funds for county treatment programs. In 15 years, the mental hospital population fell 77 percent. A prisoner sleeps during a mid-morning visit to the Monterey County Jail in Salinas. (Photo: Jay Dunn/The Salinas Californian) A lack of treatment options and an era of tough-on-crime policies imprisoned more and more of California\u2019s inseparable mentally ill, addicted and homeless populations. Between 1980 and 2000, California\u2019s prison population quintupled and the proportion of inmates charged\u00a0with drug crimes tripled. The state raced to build 21 new prisons over those years, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep pace: The corrections system reached 175 percent capacity by 2000. \"Jails turned into the mental health system,\" said Currie, the UC Irvine criminologist, \"so in many ways we have to finally grapple with the problem we should\u2019ve fixed in the first place.\" California came to a crossroads in 2011 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state's prison crowding had gotten so bad it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. California responded with AB 109, which moved thousands of non-serious and non-violent offenders into county jails. Three years later, when jails were overcrowded too, Prop 47 released low-level felons, including thousands of mentally ill and drug addicted inmates. But treatment programs with empty beds are still hard to find. \"We talk about the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \u2013 that doesn't really exist. People come out and it's like they time traveled,\" said Eunisses Hernandez, an advocate at the Drug Policy Alliance, a reform group. \"If we want criminal justice reform and social justice reform to work, it's not just about fixing the machine that's incarcerating people, but it's about fixing the system that comes out and supports them when they come out.\" For Lopez, the meth addict in the LA suburbs, that support system felt out of reach. Lopez, who suffers from bi-polar disorder, grew up in Southern California and fell into addiction quickly. He drank beer and smoked pot in high school, but while his friends just dabbled, he used daily. Lopez dropped out of school and joined the Marine Corps, where he started using harder drugs. He was kicked out of the Marines in 1981 after getting arrested in a home invasion robbery case. That case was Lopez\u2019s first strike. California\u2019s once-rigid \"Three Strikes\" sentencing system mandated a life sentence to any defendant with two violent or serious prior convictions \u2013 even if their third crime was just drug possession or shoplifting. The system was responsible for locking up many of the defendants that Prop 47 eventually let out. Ruben Lopez Jr., a meth addict who was released from prison by Prop 47, hugs Blair Stewart, a homeless woman, in Downey, Calif. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) Lopez\u2019 third strike came in 1994, when a Glenn County police officer caught him with 1.8 grams of meth and a sawed-off shotgun during a traffic stop. Lopez got life in prison for felony drug possession and the gun charge was dropped. He was released in April 2015 after Prop 47 reduced his conviction to a misdemeanor. Lopez found himself in an unfamiliar world. Prison had done nothing to cure his addiction. Drugs were a familiar crutch, and they were rampant. \"It was like putting a kid loose in the candy store and telling them there's no consequences,\" Lopez said. \"Eat whatever you want. Party up. That was me.\" Lopez joined and then quit rehab programs twice after his release, saying the strict rules felt too much like prison. With no place left to go, Lopez called his cousin he barely knew who owned an auto shop. The cousin offered him a couch to sleep on, but set one rule \u2013 no drugs in the shop. Lopez broke that rule quickly, so the cousin kicked him out. For the next five weeks, Lopez slept on the streets, hidden away in a burrow dug under a roadside bush, sheltered with cardboard and blankets. In November, Lopez\u2019s cousin let him move back into his shop even though he's still using meth. \"This is where I ended up at,\" Lopez said. \"This is where my decision making got me, where my addiction got me \u2013 to nothing, zero.\" Police patrol near a homeless camp in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey in November. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) The waiting game Rochelle Solombrino had a beer in her hand and two twelve-packs in the car when she saw the flashing lights in her rearview mirror. She knew she was headed to prison, but she was going to finish her beers first. So she fled, chugging Coors Light, as the police cars multiplied behind her and the helicopters swarmed overhead. Ten beers and 25 minutes later, she pulled over. Rochelle Solombrino, 50, who had four felonies reduced under Prop 47, points to her star in Fred Brown Recovery Services that shows the date she stopped using drugs and alcohol. She is now 7 and a half years sober. (Photo: Kristen Hwang/The Desert Sun) The 2007 car chase, for which Solombrino served 18 months in prison, was just the latest on a lengthy rap sheet \u2013 47 misdemeanors over four decades. Every crime had been fueled by drugs or alcohol. Solombrino was in the grasp of her addiction and she thought she could never escape. And yet she did. After her release, Solombrino joined a treatment program and has never used drugs or alcohol since. Now seven years sober, she knows she couldn\u2019t have recovered without a program. She also knows how badly the addicts released by Prop 47 need them too. \"Those were active addicts. They may still be active addicts,\" said Solombrino, 50, who retroactively reduced four felonies under Prop 47. She is now operations coordinator at Fred Brown Recovery Services in San Pedro, where she got clean. \"Those are people that needed help, that need help, and I can reassure you that they didn\u2019t all get help. So, definitely, we need more programs.\" In-patient treatment programs can help even the most serious addicts, according to scientific studies, but hundreds of thousands of California\u2019s addicts have never gone through rehabilitation. Some write off the idea of rehab, too addicted to give their habits up or concerned they\u2019ll never make it through. But those who seek help can be asked to wait weeks or months before beginning treatment, and by then, the urge to recover has vanished into the next pill, drink or syringe. \"If you were to call any treatment facility in Los Angeles County looking for a residential bed, they'll tell you there's a waiting list,\" said David Ramage, an administrator at Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in Pasadena, which has a 90-day wait list. \"People die waiting to get treatment. That is the bottom line.\" California State Prison, Los Angeles County is photographed during a tour in December. (Photo: Anthony Plascencia/The Ventura County Star) The shortage of treatment beds is a result of inadequate funding. California has underinvested in drug rehab for decades, policy experts said, and Prop 47 is the latest example. Prop 47 advocates, who promised voters the law would save hundreds of millions of dollars in prison costs, have accused Gov. Jerry Brown of diverting the money into the state\u2019s general fund. A recent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office report projected $130 million in savings for the past fiscal year, but the state deposited $67.4 million into its Prop 47 fund. Brown\u2019s office directed comment on Prop 47 savings to the state Department of Finance. H.D. Palmer, the department\u2019s deputy director of external affairs, said the state did not \"lowball\" the savings. \"One of the worst things we could do is lead to false expectations,\" he said, \"and therefore (have) people budget on a higher level of savings at the local level that in the end is not achievable.\" Using the Prop 47 fund, the state will put $34 million into mental health treatment, substance abuse and diversion programs this fiscal year, but the process of divvying up that money only began last month. For now, treatment facilities are cash-strapped and scrambling. And even when the money finally arrives, expansion will not be easy. California State Prison, Los Angeles County. Lancaster, Calif. (Photo: Anthony Plascencia/The Ventura County Star) Neighborhoods sometimes push back when treatment centers try to expand, said Doug Burg, an administrator for the Amity Foundation, which runs reentry programs for current and former inmates throughout the western U.S. If that hurdle is cleared, each new facility still needs a county contract and time to train employees. \"For us to really move away from mass incarceration, I think these propositions are absolutely essential,\" Burg said. \"But it\u2019s hard because often we think of these big policy changes and we don\u2019t think of the operational needs for the people, the service providers, that have to run these programs.\" Compared to the criminal justice system, however, treatment is a far more cost-effective strategy for handling California\u2019s 565,000 drug-dependent adults. In-patient treatment programs, which typically last from six months to a year, cost about $20,000 per person \u2013 less than a third of the annual cost to keep an addict in jail or prison. And by treating addiction, the root cause of many drug and property crimes, rehab reduces the chance people commit crimes in the future. \"When you do drug treatment, it is just hands down cheaper and more effective,\" said drug policy expert Dina Perrone, a criminology professor at California State University, Long Beach. While community treatment centers struggle to keep up with demand, drug court programs are emptying. Drug courts traditionally fill their seats through a \"felony hammer\" strategy that uses incarceration to pressure addicts into recovery. When an addict is arrested, a drug court judge gives them a choice: spend years behind bars or join a year-long rehab program. After Prop 47, however, the formula doesn\u2019t work. Incarceration is unlikely, and misdemeanor probation is shorter and less restrictive than drug court, so many offenders choose it instead. The results are clear. At the longest running drug court program in Los Angeles, run out of a narrow building on the edge of Skid Row, enrollment has plummeted from 80 people to only four. Ramage, who leads the drug court program, said Prop 47 \"tore it apart.\" Many inmates released under Prop 47 have ended up homeless on the streets of Los Angeles' infamous Skid Row, shown here in November. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) Policy experts quickly counter that drug court programs still criminalize addiction. Those who can\u2019t complete the programs end up behind bars regardless. \"That's not the way the system should work,\" said Hernandez, from the Drug Policy Alliance. \"That felony hammer has only been good to incarcerate generations of our communities.\" Solombrino, from\u00a0the 2007 car chase,\u00a0was locked up dozens of times, but that never helped her addiction. Treatment was the only effective solution for a life of crime and drug abuse. Solombrino\u2019s parents divorced when she was a toddler. At her private Christian grade school, she struggled to cope with being gay. And at age six, she was molested by her step-father. By the time she was sixteen years old \u2013 when she was regularly using pot, cocaine and PCP \u2013 she couldn\u2019t hide her emotions any longer, so she turned to her dad for help. \"I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t feel good. I don\u2019t feel good inside. I feel a lot of anxiety,\u2019\" she remembers now, 34 years later. \"He said, \u2018Take a drink, you\u2019ll get over it.\u2019 In our culture, you don\u2019t stress on those kinds of things. Take a drink, everything\u2019s going to be fine. So that\u2019s what I did.\" No amount of family conversation, jail time, warnings from judges or interventions from her friends convinced Solombrino to change. But in treatment, she faced her darkest memories head on. She wrote an 18-page autobiography of her life, she attached three emotions to every significant event and she drafted letters to each of the people who appeared in her story. She apologized to the people in her life who she had wronged. She learned from others who were facing addiction and she was congratulated by her new support network each day she stayed clean. \"Every treatment step that we did, this weight just kept being lifted and lifted and lifted and I was free. All of a sudden I was light again,\" Solombrino said. \"I felt like a child, like oh my god I can literally start over again. I don\u2019t have to be defined by my past but what I\u2019m trying to do today to change.\" \"That, for me, was the freedom of purging all my demons and all my secrets and all my life,\" she said.

The company has announced a hacking of user accounts that happened in 2013, but it says payment card information was not accessed. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Updated at 7:00 p.m. ET Yahoo says hackers stole names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers from more than 1 billion accounts. In a statement posted to its website on Wednesday, the company said it had \"taken steps to secure user accounts and is working closely with law enforcement.\" The statement continued: \"As Yahoo previously disclosed in November, law enforcement provided the company with data files that a third party claimed was Yahoo user data. The company analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data. Based on further analysis of this data by the forensic experts, Yahoo believes an unauthorized third party, in August 2013, stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts. ... \"The investigation indicates that the stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected.\" Article continues after sponsorship This is the second major breach of private user information Yahoo has announced in the past three months. In September, the company said information associated with at least 500 million user accounts had been stolen in 2014, as we reported . ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Craig Timberg and Hayley Tsukayama December 14 at 5:48 PM Follow @craigtimberg Follow @htsuka Yahoo said Wednesday that more than 1 billion user accounts \u2014 meaning most of the Internet giant\u2019s customers worldwide \u2014 were hacked in 2013, leading to the release of user names, telephone numbers, dates of birth and other personal information. News of the hack, coming after the announcement in September of a separate hack affecting 500 million accounts, means that Yahoo has been the victim of the two largest data breaches ever reported. Both have been announced since Yahoo agreed to sell its core businesses to telecommunications giant Verizon in July for $4.8 billion. The incident raised new questions among analysts regarding the viability of that deal and whether the valuation will need to be changed, especially if the hacks trigger litigation against the company. \u201cThis is another major blow,\u201d said Jeff Kagan, a Georgia-based telecommunications industry analyst. \u201cIt throws into question what\u2019s really going on at Yahoo. And if you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on at Yahoo, does Verizon have the guts to buy a potential bomb? This company could explode with major problems and major losses.\u201d In the 2013 incident, Yahoo said that credit card and bank account numbers, which are stored separately, were not affected, but the breach did include some unencrypted \u201csecurity questions\u201d that the company uses to authenticate users. The two recent hacks have come after Yahoo agreed to sell its core business, including Yahoo Mail, to Verizon in July. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) [ Have you ever had a Yahoo account? You might want to change some passwords. ] Yahoo also reported a separate incident Wednesday in which hackers used what the company called \u201cforged cookies\u201d to gain access to some accounts, though it did not give the number. That incident, the company said, appeared to have links to the one announced in September involving \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d attackers. Law enforcement officials said that breach, which happened in 2014, was probably the work of Russian hackers , though no final conclusion has been reached. To minimize the damage, Yahoo is alerting affected customers and requiring them to change their passwords. But the scale of the hack and the time that has passed since it happened suggests that few of the company\u2019s customers were unaffected. Given the size of the two hacks, many Yahoo users are likely to have had their information stolen more than once. Yahoo has said it has more than 1 billion users worldwide, though the company\u2019s fortunes have been sagging for years as other tech companies have snatched away pieces of its search, email and other Web-based businesses. \u201cYahoo encourages users to review all of their online accounts for suspicious activity and to change their passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account,\u201d the company said in a statement . \u201cThe company further recommends that users avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails and that they be cautious of unsolicited communications that ask for personal information.\u201d Regarding the deal with Verizon, Yahoo said in a statement, \u201cWe are confident in Yahoo\u2019s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.\u201d Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.\u201d Security experts have long complained that Yahoo lagged the industry in adopting measures to protect its customers. The breach that Yahoo announced Wednesday was discovered after law enforcement officials shared with the company a data set that \u201ca third party\u201d claimed was from Yahoo user accounts. The company, in conjunction with outside experts, verified that it was data stolen in August 2013, the company said in a statement. The news caused a late dip in Yahoo\u2019s stock price, sending it down as much as 2.7 percent in after-hours trading. \u201cThe fact that we now have two breaches implies that Yahoo security measures were inadequate. So it is more likely there will be future breaches uncovered,\u201d said Laura Martin, senior analyst at Needham & Company. \u201cIt sounds to me like they never knew about any of these breaches, which means they never fixed the problem. That implies that the assets are actually less valuable than we thought.\u201d Staff writer Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. business ",

    "text": "CBS News Dec 14, 2016 6:46 PM EST As Donald Trump convened\u00a0 his meeting of tech leaders , there was a conspicuous absence Wednesday at Trump Tower: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the social media platform is renowned -- he has over 17 million followers and tweets news and opinions regularly. Representatives from Twitter were not invited to Wednesday\u2019s meeting with technology executives because the guest list was limited to senior executives from tech behemoths like Apple, Amazon and Google, Trump transition sources said. Trump meeting with tech giants after past criticism In attendance were Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, IBM\u2019s Ginny Rommety, and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, among others. Twitter\u2019s market capitalization is $13.5 billion, compared with $614 billion for Apple on the high end. The company present with the closest market capitalization was Tesla, at $32 billion, still well over twice Twitter\u2019s size.\u00a0 \u201cThey simply were not big enough and do not have the economic viability of these companies,\u201d a senior transition source told CBS News.\u00a0 Sean Spicer, a spokesperson for the transition, told MSNBC, \u201cThe conference table was only so big.\u201d President-elect Trump meets with top tech leaders Politico reported the social media company had been \u201cbounced\u201d from the meeting because of a spat that arose over emojis and advertising dollars during the campaign. Using barnyard language, a Trump spokesman vehemently denied any connection.\u00a0 Twitter was one of dozens of tech companies that did not receive an invitation to the meeting, the spokesman explained. A Twitter spokesman would not comment on Politico\u2019s report or on Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting. In the fall, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC) reached a deal with Twitter to spend $5 million on campaign advertising. As part of the agreement, Twitter promised to provide custom emjois for certain hashtags - icons that appear with a certain phrase. The deal hit a snag before the second presidential debate when Twitter initially approved and then objected to an emoji for the hashtag #crookedhillary that showed a running stick figure holding a moneybag. Moneybag emoji designed by Trump campaign Close screenshot / Gary Coby, Trump campaign, via Medium Twitter offered the Trump campaign and the RNC a discount on the ads and a chance to redesign the emoji. But on October 7th, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called Spicer to voice his objection to the new design (a moneybag with wings) and spike the emoji deal. Moneybag with wings emoji designed by RNC and Twitter Close screen grab / Gary Coby, Trump campaign via Medium \u00a0 Twitter said at the time, \u201cWe believe that political advertising merits a level of disclosure and transparency that branded political emojis do not meet, and we ultimately decided not to permit this particular format for any political advertising.\u201d The social media platform released the same statement again Wednesday after Politico published its report but would not comment further.\u00a0 \u00a0 A person familiar with Twitter\u2019s negotiations with the RNC offered no proof that Wednesday\u2019s snub was retribution for the emoji flap, but said that tensions still remain. Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel arranged the meeting with the president-elect and vice president-elect. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Michigan Ave., some workers called 911 and\u00a0barricaded doors after mistaking an \"active shooter\" drill for a real threat. (CBS Chicago) At the Monroe Building at 104 S. Michigan Ave., some workers called 911 and\u00a0barricaded doors after mistaking an \"active shooter\" drill for a real threat. (CBS Chicago) Rosemary Regina Sobol and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune It was supposed to be just another drill in the Monroe Building in the Loop on Wednesday morning, in this case what to do if a gunman was somewhere inside. The announcement over the PA system said there was an \"active shooter\" in the building at 104 S. Michigan Ave. and people should seek shelter. No one reached by the Tribune remembers hearing the word drill. Some said they recalled earlier warnings about a drill and followed instructions. On the 15th floor, however, workers thought the threat was real: They rushed to a back office that had no windows, scooted desks against the door and called 911.\u00a0 While they waited for help, they left desperate messages for loved ones.\u00a0 \"I got the 'Goodbye, I love you,' all that stuff,\" a husband of one of the workers said.\u00a0 He was among the people who called police, frantic. Officers finally banged on the door about 10 or 15 minutes later -- and told those inside to put their hands up and walk out.\u00a0 They apparently weren't sure if there was a shooter, according to several of the workers in the room. \"We have the dumbest building management in the world,\" one worker said later, now laughing about an episode she described as \"terrifying.\" But building manager Paul Rades put the blame on the workers for not paying better attention. \"We followed the standards and protocol,\" Rades said, wearing a reflective vest as he spoke to reporters outside the building.\u00a0 \"We notified all of our tenants a month ago and also all our tenants' office managers attended an in-person training two weeks ago. ... People need to listen to the drill and listen to their office manager.\" 'Active shooter' drill Rosemary Regina Sobol / Chicago Tribune Workers at 104 S. Michigan Ave., stand in the lobby as they prepare to return to work after evacuation. Workers at 104 S. Michigan Ave., stand in the lobby as they prepare to return to work after evacuation. (Rosemary Regina Sobol / Chicago Tribune) Workers on other floors said they were puzzled by the way the announcement was worded. It's unclear why things unfolded the way they did on the 15th floor. Several workers on the 15th said they heard \"active shooter\" and then \"shelter in place,\" meaning stay where you are.\u00a0 Then someone thought they heard shots on the 14th floor, and workers started filing into the back room for safety, several workers said. \"It made it very real,\u201d one woman said, asking not to be named. \"People were throwing desks up against the door because it didn\u2019t lock.\u00a0 There were no windows, which was good.\u201d Five or 10 minutes later, a woman got on the intercom and said there was now a fire drill and everyone should evacuate.\u00a0 But that made the workers even more nervous.\u00a0 Some were convinced the shooter was holding a gun on the woman making the announcement. \"She said that with, like, escalating tension, quiver, in her voice,\" another worker said. \"Then she just said it over and over and over for what must\u2019ve been 30 seconds or a minute: 'This is a fire drill, everyone proceed quietly down to the lobby.' \"No mention of the disconnect \u2026 with the armed shooter,\" the worker said. \"No mention that the story had changed, just this escalating quiver.\" People in the room decided to wait for police. One woman said she called 911 and said the group wanted \"to be led out by a police officer. Otherwise we\u2019re staying.\" The same woman also began texting her family. \"I was on like a text chain with 25 of my family members, scaring all of them,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s maybe the scaredest I\u2019ve ever been.\" Her friend said she thought about texting her son but \"I hadn\u2019t really worked out what I would say.\u00a0 Goodbye?\u2019\u2019 When officers arrived on the floor, \"they pounded on the door and told us to come out with our arms up,\" another worker in the room said. \"So we were led out of lockdown and they were under the impression that there was a shooter because they were responding to our calls.\" Workers on other floors said they did not hear the word drill either but assumed it was. \"I think that's where the confusion came in,\" said one man who works as a marketer for insurance. \"They said it was an active shooter.\u00a0 Everyone was like, what the hell. I locked my door and stayed in the office.\" None of the workers interviewed wanted their names used, saying they had been told not to talk to reporters. Rades, the building manager, said about 700 people work in the building and there have been no problems with previous drills.\u00a0 What happened Wednesday morning was \"blown out of proportion,\" he said. Rades said he his staff would evaluate the building's drill procedures.\u00a0 \u201cWe always like to see how we can provide our tenants tenant the best safety.\u2019\u2019 ",

    "text": "Fed Hikes Key Interest Rate for 2nd Time in a Decade By Rebecca Jarvis Dec 14, 2016, 2:22 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Fed Rate Hiked for 2nd Time in a Decade 0 Shares Email The Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate by 0.25 percent point today, the first such increase in a year. The target interest rate is now 0.50 to 0.75 percent, increasing from a range of 0.25 to 0.50 percent. The decision was widely expected by investors, who have been speculating for months about when the Fed would increase rates. Before last year\u2019s increase (from a range of 0 to 0.25 percent), the Fed had kept interest rates low in an effort to boost the economy amid the Great Recession and its aftermath. Before December 2015, it last raised the rate in June 2006. In a statement the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the body in charge of adjusting the key borrowing number \u2014 said it \"expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.\" The Fed also indicated that it could hike rates as many as three times next year. \u201cIt is a good sign that the Fed is increasing rates,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told ABC News. \u201cThey are increasing rates because the job market is strong, unemployment [is] low, wage growth is picking up and inflation is getting back to their target.\u201d \u201cIt is an indication of a healthy economy that the Fed feels comfortable increasing rates back to something more typical,\u201d he said. Your Bottom Line Average Americans are likely to be affected most directly by higher loan rates, according to Zandi. \u201cRates will rise on credit cards, home equity loans, auto loans and adjustable rate mortgages ,\u201d he said. While the cumulative effect of several hikes in the future could significantly affect the average consumer, today\u2019s increase is likely to have a minimal effect, according to BankRate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride. \u201cRising rates have a minimal effect on car loan affordability, with a quarter-point move making a difference of $3 per month on a $25,000 car loan,\u201d he said. For those who remain concerned, he advises that they should \u201cshop around for the best financing, negotiate the price of the car, negotiate your trade, but don\u2019t sweat rising interest rates.\u201d On the bright side, higher interest rates in theory provide a boost to savings accounts. But just as the incremental hike is not likely to affect borrowers very much, savers shouldn\u2019t expect a big payday either. \u201cSavers should have low expectations, as many banks will try to hold the line on savings rates,\u201d McBride said. He advised that savers \u201cseek out the top-yielding accounts offered by online banks, community banks and credit unions , as this is where the best returns will be found and a better likelihood of seeing higher rates passed along.\u201d For those with investments or retirement accounts wrapped up in the market, there is, likewise, little to worry about, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. Markets have been rallying since the election, and investors fully expected today\u2019s hike, so the possibility of a jolt in stock prices is minimal. \u201cThe rise in rates was well anticipated by markets, and the key will be future communications from the Fed around next steps,\u201d Haworth said. \u201cMarket watchers in general appear to be expecting a couple more rate hikes in 2017.\u201d He continued, \u201cA more hawkish tone from the Fed could limit further stock price gains, while a more dovish tone would generally be constructive for equities.\u201d 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY (Photo: Yahoo!) 2520 CONNECT TWEET 29 LINKEDIN 38 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo late Wednesday disclosed a breach that took place in August\u00a02013 that may have resulted in the theft of data associated with more than one billion user accounts. The latest\u00a0breach is separate from a 500-million-account breach the company disclosed in September of this year. At the time, the 500-million-account breach, which took place in 2014, was believed to be the largest on record. Yahoo ( YHOO )shares fell 2.5% after hours. The new revelation comes at a time when cybercrime issues loom larger than ever. The CIA has accused Russia of specifically attempting to tamper with the U.S. election via hacked emails, ransomware hit the nation's seventh-largest transit system , in San Francisco\u00a0and a monster botnet of hijacked devices took down much of the East Coast's Internet traffic for a day in October. \u201cWe truly are under major siege and we\u2019re unprepared for it. It really is a national emergency,\u201d said Avivah Litan vice president at Gartner Research. \u201cWe need a national response plan for this.\u201d Whether the attacker in this instance was state-sponsored or merely economically motivated, the danger is very real, said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. \u201cWe're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments,\u201d he said. \u201cAs is the case in any cyber-attack, the incentive is there, the reputation threat is real, and intelligence services have 1 billion reasons to try.\u201d Top hacks and data breaches Yahoo said in September that it had evidence linking the 500-million-account breach to a state-sponsored actor. It does not know who is behind the 1-billion-account breach announced Wednesday and it does not appear the two are linked. In a statement on its website , the company said, \"We believe that the August 2013 incident is likely distinct from the incident we disclosed on September 22, 2016.\" There is some overlap between the affected accounts, but Yahoo is not disclosing how much. Ongoing acquisition Verizon announced a $4.8\u00a0billion deal to acquire Yahoo on July 25 and work on the takeover has been ongoing since then. \"As we\u2019ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions,\u201d it said in a statement to USA TODAY. The revelation could absolutely derail the Verizon acquisition, said Jacob Olcott,\u00a0former legal advisor to the Senate Commerce Committee and now vice president at the security firm BitSight. Verizon was buying Yahoo in part to get customer accounts. \u201cNow Verizon will be trying to figure out what\u00a0the customer loss will be, based on this information that\u2019s being released now and how it affects their valuation,\u201d he said. In addition, Verizon will need to factor in how much it will cost for them to bring Yahoo up to their security standards, he said. Verizon begins Yahoo breach evaluation, earnings hit by Samsung Note 7 recall November disclosure Yahoo disclosed in November that a law enforcement officials had given it data files showing what appeared to be evidence\u00a0that an unknown third party had access to Yahoo user data. Yahoo brought in outside forensic experts and confirmed that the data was in fact from Yahoo users. As part of that analysis, Yahoo now says it believes the attacker \u201cstole data associated with more than one billion user accounts,\u201d the company said in a release . Yahoo does not know who was behind the theft. The company has pinpointed the date when the attackers were able to remove user information from the system as \u00a0August 2013, but it does not know when they gained entry to its network or how long they were there. The fact that the breach went unnoticed for so long isn\u2019t surprising, said Arun Vishwanath,\u00a0a security expert at the University at Buffalo. \u201cThe sobering facts are that almost all such hacks are only accidentally discovered and that hackers usually stay in the system undetected for at least a year if not more,\" he said. \"Yahoo's case is not so unique. Only its scale is troubling.\u201d The stolen account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords\u00a0and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, the company said. The stolen information did not include payment card data, or bank account information, Yahoo said. Yahoo is working to notify affected users, and is working closely\u00a0with law enforcement to investigate the breach. Some in the security community said Yahoo had not been as concerned with security as it might have been. \u201cIn our interactions with Yahoo over the years, there has been a consistent lack of interest in security as well as a palpable arrogance in their ability to manage their security without any help from the outside.\u00a0 As we said in our last interaction, \u2018thank you for the meeting and the best of luck doing everything yourself,\u2019\u201d said Philip Lieberman, president of Los Angeles-based Lieberman Software.

From left are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Trump. President-elect Donald Trump meets with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower in New York on Wednesday. From left are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Trump. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Evan Halper and David Pierson Contact Reporters It wasn\u2019t so much a reckoning as a reboot. The nation\u2019s top tech executives couldn\u2019t know what to expect when they headed to Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday for what President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0transition team had billed as an innovation \u201csummit.\u201d They had reason to fear an ambush. But if Trump holds grudges against Silicon Valley for the way that many of its denizens maligned and ridiculed him at every step of the presidential campaign, he worked hard not to let them show. If Trump\u2019s opening comments were any indication, this was no repeat of that ill-fated meeting he\u00a0called with broadcast and cable TV news executives days after the election, during which he mostly dressed them down. If any grudges were in the air, they were over who was not in the 25th floor meeting room Wednesday. Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News : \u201cOh, I would certainly implement that \u2014 absolutely.\" On Tuesday, hundreds of members of the technology industry... When asked a year ago on the campaign trail whether he thought that the United States should create a database of Muslims in the country, Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News : \u201cOh, I would certainly implement that \u2014 absolutely.\" On Tuesday, hundreds of members of the technology industry... (Tracey Lien and Melissa Etehad) Trump\u2019s favorite social media platform, Twitter, was absent, for example. Politico attributed it to retribution for the company refusing during the campaign to abide Trump\u2019s request to generate a #CrookedHillary emoji. Twitter\u2019s refusal to create a digital running stick figure holding a money bag is a grievance that his director of digital advertising aired on Medium a few weeks ago. Trump representatives denied that was why Twitter was left out of the high-tech confab. They said Twitter didn\u2019t make the cut because it wasn\u2019t a big enough company. It has a market capitalization of about $13.8 billion, less than half that of Tesla , which  was included in the meeting. \u00a0Trump himself boasted at the top of the meeting about the deluge of requests to attend. \u201cI won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had, asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Trump said. He looked to Pay Pal co-founder Peter Thiel , an eccentric billionaire who was among the lone tech giants to back Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 and who now is seen by many tech executives as a potential lifeline in the new administration \u2014 as he sent out invitations. \u201cPeter would sort of say, \u2018You know, that company's too small.\u2019\u201d Those executives that did make the cut, Trump declared, led \u201cmonster companies.\u201d They included\u00a0 Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Elon Musk of Tesla, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. \u201cI'm here to help you folks do well,\u201d Trump said, before taking credit for the bump in the stock market that followed his election. \u201cAnd you're doing well right now and I'm very honored by the bounce. They're all talking about the bounce. So right now everybody in this room has to like me \u2014 at least a little bit.\u201d It was the get-along side of Trump on full display. The meeting was to be a symbol of an administration that would not hew to ideology but the best ideas. Trump\u2019s representatives spent the hours leading up to the meeting talking to the press about how good Trump is at listening,\u00a0even to the people who despise him. Plenty of folks back in Silicon Valley weren\u2019t buying it. The executives who flew to New York found themselves confronted with letters, petitions and public scoldings from colleagues who reminded them that Trump has yet to disavow any parts of his agenda that most appalled Silicon Valley during the election. \u201cNow, more than ever, tech leaders must stand up for human dignity, and examine their role in public discourse,\u201d EBay founder Pierre Omidyar wrote as he retweeted an article that pilloried tech leaders for going to Trump Tower. Nearly two dozen advocacy groups, including Amnesty International USA and Democracy for America, demanded to know why most of the companies at the meeting are refusing to pledge not to help Trump build any type of registry for Muslims, as he suggested during the campaign. More than 640 tech workers, many of them from firms represented at the Trump Tower meeting, vowed to undermine any \u201ccreation of databases of identifying information for the United States government to target individuals based on race, religion, or national origin.\u201d Reports from inside the meeting room suggest that the tech leaders did not heed the call for confrontation. Amazon  Chief Executive Bezos, whose ownership of the Washington Post made him an occasional focus of Trump\u2019s ire during the campaign, declared the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d \u201cI shared my view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country,\u201d Bezos said in a statement. Earlier in the day, Trump added Uber CEO\u00a0Travis Kalanick and Tesla\u2019s Musk to his business advisory council, which previously had only one representative from the tech industry:\u00a0Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM. Both Kalanick and Musk were bitter critics of Trump during the race. Kalanick said last year that he\u2019d move to China if Trump won the election. Musk had called Trump \u201cnot the right guy\u201d for the presidency in a November interview with CNBC. The Tesla leader\u2019s companies are heavily invested in green energy, setting him up for a possible clash with Trump over climate change policy and subsidies for renewables. But Musk can be a nimble political player, building strategic relationships with others who share many of Trump\u2019s views, such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). Trump showered the group with praise. And before reporters were ushered out of the room, he made a point of assuaging the tech leaders\u2019 concerns about his threats to slap tariffs on companies that manufacture their products abroad, as most big Silicon Valley firms do. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders,\u201d Trump told them. \u201cThere's nobody like you in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cThere's nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along \u2026 we're going to be there for you. And you'll call my people, you'll call me. It doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here.\u201d Halper reported from Washington and Pierson from Los Angeles.\u00a0 Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

    "text": "5 Tech Issues Donald Trump Will Face as President By Meghan Keneally Dec 14, 2016, 4:21 PM ET 0 Shares Star Drew Angerer/Getty Images Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, Larry Page, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google), Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, Vice President-elect Mike Pence listen as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting of technology executives at Trump Tower, Dec. 14, 2016, in New York City. 0 Shares Email Donald Trump has been meeting with his political rivals for weeks as he fills up his Cabinet, and now he's meeting with another group of former would-be foes: tech titans. The president-elect, who is known for his prolific use of Twitter to disseminate his message, has been at odds with Silicon Valley at various points during the campaign, and there are a number of tech-related issues that he will have to face during his administration. Here is a rundown of some of the biggest issues on which Trump and his team will likely have to work with the tech giants, some of whom he has insulted. 1. Immigration Though not solely a tech issue, Trump's plans relating to immigration could have a direct impact on the tech world. The ability to hire tech-savvy workers and to make contracts with foreign companies with access to cheaper labor costs have become important building blocks in the tech world, and the prospect of changing those policies could significantly affect the industry's practices. An open letter addressed to Trump and signed by more than 140 tech leaders read, \"We believe that America's diversity is our strength. Great ideas come from all parts of society, and we should champion that broad-based creative potential. We also believe that progressive immigration policies help us attract and retain some of the brightest minds on earth \u2014 scientists, entrepreneurs and creators.\" 2. Net Neutrality Net neutrality \u2014 the principle that internet service providers should not reduce the speed of service for certain content or charge more for access to certain websites \u2014 is an issue that Barack Obama's administration has championed. In 2014, Obama and his team pushed to have the Federal Communications Commission include broadband internet service in its classification of a public utility. Trump spoke out against the move, calling it an \"attack on the internet\" in a tweet. He appeared to imply that conservative media sites could be unfairly targeted, even though that is the opposite intention of net neutrality. Obama's attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014 The open letter also addressed tech leaders' concerns about his understanding of how the internet works. \"We also believe in the free and open exchange of ideas, including over the internet, as a seed from which innovation springs. Donald Trump proposes 'shutting down' parts of the Internet as a security strategy \u2014 demonstrating both poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works,\" the letter stated. 3. Encryption The topic of technology encryption came up in the wake of the shooting in San Bernardino , California, when Apple refused government calls to unlock the iPhone of one of the shooters. Trump told his Twitter followers at the time that he would be using only his Samsung phone rather than his iPhone until Apple turned over information about the shooter to authorities and later called for a boycott of all Apple products. Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 \"The phone's not even owned by this young thug that killed all these people. The phone's owned by the government, OK. It's not even his phone,\" he said at an event in South Carolina in February, referring to the fact that the iPhone was issued by his employer. \"But [Apple CEO] Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up. They should get the security or find other people.\" 4. Cybersecurity With the new reports about the role that Russian hacking could have played in the election, the question of cybersecurity is emerging as a hot topic in the transition to the new administration. Trump called for an increase in cybersecurity throughout the federal government but did not specify how that would be tackled. During the campaign, he said there was a need to \"conduct a thorough review of United States cyberdefenses and identify all vulnerabilities. And we have to do that immediately.\" \"We will improve the Department of Defense's cybercapabilities \u2014 a new threat, a new problem, very expensive, and we're not doing very well with cyber,\" he said. 5. Tech Manufacturing Relocation Trump took Apple to task during the campaign for having many of its products made outside the U.S., and considering his push to bring jobs back stateside, this could be an issue for him to bring to the forefront. \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" he said at a rally in January. Apple does much of its manufacturing in China. Bonus: Direct Attacks on Tech CEOs Trump has not shied from criticizing private companies (like Boeing) or individuals (such as a local union president in Indiana after a deal with Carrier not to move jobs to Mexico), and the same holds true when the two are combined. During the campaign, Trump connected his unfavorable view of Amazon and The Washington Post \u2014 he repeatedly called it unfair and at one point suspended its reporters' credentials to cover his campaign events \u2014 to the two companies' owner, Jeff Bezos. The @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon . \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 Trump took his criticism onto the campaign trail as well. \"I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he bought The Washington Post to have political influence, and, I've gotta tell you, we've got a different country than we used to have ... He owns Amazon. He wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems,\" Trump said at an event in Texas on Feb. 26. For his part, Bezos responded by posting a video on Twitter saying that he would save him a space on a rocket. Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump . Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3 \u2014 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015 Bezos is one of the tech entrepreneurs meeting Trump's team at Trump Tower today in New York. Another attendee who has come under fire from Trump is Apple's Cook. Trump repeatedly complained over the years that the iPhone should have a bigger screen. Steve Jobs is spinning in his grave - Apple has lost both vision and momentum - must move fast to get magic back! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2014 In July 2013, in another tweet about how iPhones should have a larger screen, Trump wrote, \"Bring back Steve Jobs!\" Jobs died in October 2011. When there was speculation that the company would introduce larger screens, Trump appeared to suggest he should get credit for the move. I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soon\u2014long overdue. \u2014 Donald J.
