One-third says the economy is in excellent (3 percent) or good shape (30 percent). \u00a0That\u2019s up 10 percentage points from 23 percent in January 2016 (2 percent excellent and 21 percent good). Before Obama took office in 2009, just five percent of voters rated economic conditions positively (1 percent excellent and 4 percent good). \u00a0Some 23 percent say it\u2019s in poor condition today, down drastically from 74 percent (January 13-14, 2009). Related Image Expand / Contract Despite that improvement, only 30 percent feel they are better off financially now than before Obama became president. \u00a0One-in-five says they\u2019re worse off (22 percent), and nearly half feel their family\u2019s financial situation is about the same (47 percent).\u00a0 A 56-percent majority thinks the economy will be in better shape a year from now. \u00a0One-third expects things to get worse (34 percent). \u00a0 There\u2019s a significant partisan gap in views on the economy\u2019s future. \u00a0Republicans (89 percent) are three times more likely than Democrats (28 percent) to say the economy will be better next year. \u00a0Fifty-eight percent of independents see sunnier times ahead.\u00a0 Obama leaves office with a thumbs-up from 53 percent of voters for his overall job performance, while 41 percent disapprove. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract For his handling of the economy, 52 percent of voters approve and 44 percent disapprove. \u00a0That\u2019s notable since Obama\u2019s ratings on the economy were in negative territory for most of his presidency. \u00a0 He received his record high of 55 percent approval in September 2009 -- the most recent time more voters than not rated him positively on the economy. \u00a0His record low was in August 2011 when 34 percent of voters approved. \u00a0 Obama ends his second term with less than half of voters approving of the job he\u2019s doing on foreign policy (47-46 percent), health care (47-51 percent), immigration (47-49 percent), and ISIS (41-51 percent). \u00a0In each of these areas, his ratings are at or near the high point of his second term. \u00a0 Meanwhile, 43 percent feel the country is less safe than when Obama became president. \u00a0That\u2019s more than twice as many as say it\u2019s safer (20 percent). \u00a0One-third feels it hasn\u2019t changed under Obama (35 percent). \u00a0 Views of Obama as a person have been more positive than negative for much of his presidency. \u00a0 The new poll finds 57 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of him, including 40 percent who have a \u201cstrongly\u201d favorable view. \u00a0Forty-two percent have an unfavorable opinion (30 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d unfavorable). Michelle Obama is more beloved: \u00a067 percent favorable vs. 28 percent unfavorable. \u00a0Nearly half of voters, 48 percent, have a \u201cstrongly\u201d positive opinion of the first lady. Pollpourri By a nearly three-to-one margin, voters say Obama should not pardon Hillary Clinton for crimes she might have committed in connection with the Clinton Foundation or her time as secretary of state. \u00a0When Donald Trump mentioned Clinton\u2019s email troubles at rallies, his supporters regularly chanted the phrase, \u201cLock her up!\u201d \u00a0The poll shows 23 percent of voters think Obama should pre-empt any attempt to prosecute Clinton with a pardon. \u00a0Sixty-eight percent disagree.\u00a0 Even voters who backed Clinton in the presidential election are more likely to oppose a pardon: \u00a040 percent say Obama should vs. 48 percent shouldn\u2019t. \u00a0 Among those voting for Trump, it\u2019s 8 vs. 87 percent. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,034 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 11-13, 2016. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

    "text": "Obama administration on defense over fall of Aleppo Published               December 15, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Obama administration is finding itself back on the defensive over its Syria policy as Aleppo falls to Bashar Assad\u2019s government and civilians are evacuated, an operation preceded by desperate pleas from the city\u2019s battered residents and reports of atrocities against them. Ambulances reportedly were carrying out the first groups of wounded and other residents on Thursday, under a cease-fire deal that would seal a rebel pullout from what had been their stronghold in the eastern part of the city. Outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters Thursday he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the cease-fire arrangements as well as the start of convoys moving out of the city. But he also cited a report that a convoy of injured people were fired upon, and reports that Syrian men are being detained or conscripted at checkpoints. He condemned \u201cinexcusable attacks\u201d on civilians and humanitarian personnel, calling for an \u201cimmediate and verifiable, durable cessation of hostilities.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to do our part\u201d to push all parties toward \u201cresolution,\u201d Kerry said. At the same time, Kerry noted that if Aleppo falls completely, it will be harder to bring the parties around and will not end the war. He put the onus on Damascus and its allies in Moscow to pursue peace. Within minutes, State Department spokesman John Kirby took the podium and was peppered with tough questions about how the administration sees any political transition or deal playing out at this stage.\u00a0 Asked whether the U.S. is prepared to take action beyond talks, Kirby said it was determined that military options will not \u201cget us to the end we seek,\u201d while insisting the U.S. is \u201cleading\u201d and acting on behalf of the Syrian people. He conceded diplomacy has fallen short so far.\u00a0 In a feisty exchange at the White House press briefing a day earlier, Press Secretary Josh Earnest also was pressed repeatedly by reporters on the U.S. government\u2019s policy. President Obama famously drew a \u201cred line\u201d with Syria in 2012 over the use of chemical weapons and then opted not to enforce it after evidence surfaced the line was crossed. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to somehow suggest that the United States government and the world is not doing anything,\u201d Earnest said Wednesday. He defended using diplomatic efforts rather than military force to seek an end to the fighting. \u00a0 \u201cI think the Assad regime has demonstrated that they\u2019ve crossed all the lines in pursuit of their goals,\u201d Earnest said, adding he didn\u2019t know what kind of \u201csick mind\u201d comes up with the strategy Russia and Assad are pursing. \u201cThose goals apparently include depraved tactics like trying to starve innocent civilians into submission, bombing hospitals and playgrounds, targeting them,\u201d he said. Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, blasted Earnest\u2019s comments. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he can stand here and make a statement like that,\u201d Keane said Thursday on Fox News. Keane said Obama had the right to respond militarily after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people but \u201cwas paralyzed by the fear of adverse consequence [that] could happen from that.\u201d But, Keane added, \u201cThere\u2019s consequences from doing nothing.\u201d Kirby also faced tough questions earlier this week from a reporter who pressed him on why the U.S. did not go beyond diplomatic calls to help civilians stranded in the Syrian city. \u201cYou\u2019ve failed repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again, which is a combination of trying to bring together people in some sort of talks with, sort of, imperfect cease-fire and then when things go badly you get really angry \u2026 and then nothing ever changes,\u201d the reporter charged. Kirby said Kerry stressed the need for an immediate end to civilian deaths in Aleppo. He also blamed Shia fighters for violating a truce secured Tuesday but broken hours later. At the annual Saban Forum on Sunday, Kerry admitted the administration\u2019s failure to enforce the red line threat had \u201ccost\u201d the U.S. \u201csignificantly\u201d in the Middle East in terms of a damaged reputation. But Kerry insisted it was Congress that dropped the ball and not Obama, by not formally authorizing military force. \"People have interpreted it as his decision not to when, in fact, he never made a decision not to bomb,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cHe made the decision to bomb. He simply decided he had to go to Congress because David Cameron lost the vote in the parliament on a Thursday, and on Friday, President Obama felt \u2026 he would go [to Congress] and get the decision. Well, the decision wasn\u2019t forthcoming, and in the meantime, I got a deal with Lavrov to get all of the chemical weapons out of the country.\" The deal with Lavrov was cast as reducing the pressure on the West to intervene in Syria. But as Russia subsequently increased its involvement in the war, Assad\u2019s hold on power strengthened. The war became increasingly complicated as the United States turned its attention toward targeting Islamic State forces, following a largely ineffective effort to arm moderate rebels. In some circles, any large-scale intervention in Syria was seen as a losing campaign. By punting to Congress, Obama simply avoided the entanglement. But some lawmakers insisted all along there were middle-ground options that could have reduced the bloodshed in Syria. \u201cIt did not have to be this way,\u201d Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. \u201cBut this is the inevitable result of hollow words and inaction, red lines crossed without consequences, tarnished moral influence, \u2018leading from behind,\u2019 and a total lack of American leadership.\u201d They said \u201cthe name Aleppo will echo through history, like Srebrenica and Rwanda, as a testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame,\u201d while predicting the Assad regime will use the cease-fire to \u201creset its war machine and prepare to slaughter its way to victory across the rest of the country.\u201d Despite the criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s lack of action, it\u2019s unclear what President-elect Trump plans to do. Aleppo\u2019s fall to Syrian government forces could be his first major test of how he plans to approach Russia, with which he has sought friendlier ties. Trump\u2019s pick of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has extensive businesses dealings with Russia and ties to President Vladimir Putin, has fueled speculation. Currently, the situation in Aleppo is fluid. According to Reuters, the International Committee of the Red Cross said the evacuation of 200 wounded people had begun. Russia, an ally of Assad, claimed 5,000 Syrian rebels and family members had been brought out of eastern Aleppo, though those claims could not be confirmed. The evacuations come after two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian army, aided by Russian air power and Shi\u2019ite militias, in a part of the city held by rebels for four years.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Advanced Black Lung Cases Surge In Appalachia Advanced Black Lung Cases Surge In Appalachia Embed Embed Radiologist Brandon Crum and former coal miner Mackie Branham, 39, view an X-ray of Branham's diseased lung at Crum's black lung clinic in Coal Run Village, Ky. Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Radiologist Brandon Crum and former coal miner Mackie Branham, 39, view an X-ray of Branham's diseased lung at Crum's black lung clinic in Coal Run Village, Ky. Howard Berkes/NPR Across Appalachia, coal miners are suffering from the most serious form of the deadly mining disease black lung in numbers more than 10 times what federal regulators report, an NPR investigation has found. The government, through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, reported 99 cases of \"complicated\" black lung, or progressive massive fibrosis, throughout the country the last five years. But NPR obtained data from 11 black lung clinics in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which reported a total of 962 cases so far this decade. The true number is probably even higher, because some clinics had incomplete records and others declined to provide data. \"The actual extent of PMF in U.S. coal miners remains unclear,\" says the report, which appears in this week's issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"I can't say that I've heard really anything worse than this in my career,\" says Robert Cohen, a pulmonologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago who studies and tracks black lung. Article continues after sponsorship \"I can't think of anything in this particular field ... that's more frightening than this,\" Cohen adds. Edward \"Lee\" Petsonk of West Virginia University has spent three decades addressing the disease and finds NPR's numbers \"very disheartening, very disappointing.\" \"I've spent much of my career trying to find ways to better protect miners' respiratory health,\" Petsonk says. \"It's almost like I've failed.\" NIOSH released a report Thursday , published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which focuses on a small health clinic in Kentucky with 60 cases alone of PMF in 20 months. The report acknowledges cases are being missed by the government's count; it concludes: \"The actual extent of PMF in U.S. coal miners remains unclear.\" \"The more I talk, the more I get out of breath\" Mackie Branham, 39, of Elkhorn Creek, Ky., spent 19 years mining coal until he was diagnosed with complicated black lung. He ran monstrous mining machines and drilled bolts into mine roofs \u2014 occupations NIOSH says can involve excessive mine dust exposure. He worked double shifts and seven-day weeks every chance he had. His gallbladder was removed one day and he says he was back at work the next. He took two days, he says, after knee surgery, before working a 12-hour shift drilling bolts. But severe breathing problems forced him to leave work in March. And he struggles for every breath now. \"My dad has got it. Everybody that has got it, got it when they had like first stage or so. I'll probably be the first born to be this bad in the family,\" Branham says, describing a family legacy of black lung. \"They can't breathe but they can still get up and walk around and do stuff. The more I talk, the more I get out of breath. It's like I ain't got no capacity.\" The Sidney Coal Co.'s Coal Preparation Plant in Sidney, Ky., in 2006. Brian Tietz/AP hide caption toggle caption The Sidney Coal Co.'s Coal Preparation Plant in Sidney, Ky., in 2006. Brian Tietz/AP Branham was diagnosed with PMF at United Medical Group, a clinic in Coal Run Village, Ky., that was the subject of the NIOSH study. Radiologist Brandon Crum was alarmed by the numbers of miners coming in with such severe disease, including some like Branham, who were in their 30s and 40s and worked less than 20 years underground. So he contacted NIOSH researchers. \"I think the percentage of black lung that we're seeing now here in central Appalachia is unprecedented in any recorded data that I can find anywhere,\" Crum says. \"In this clinic we're roughly around 9 to 10 percent complicated rate, which is around three times higher than even the highest reported numbers.\" NIOSH researchers gathered at the clinic and verified the diagnoses. They, too, were alarmed. \"The current numbers are unprecedented by any historical standard,\" says NIOSH epidemiologist Scott Laney, who has focused on black lung as well as the recent Ebola outbreak in Africa. \"We had not seen cases of this magnitude ever before in history in central Appalachia.\" Crum tells NPR he diagnosed 10 more cases of PMF since Laney and his colleagues left the clinic. In three years, 644 cases Life with PMF is bleak. It's incurable and fatal. Fifty-three-year-old Charles Wayne Stanley of Pound, Va., is matter-of-fact about his future. \"Staying on oxygen 24/7, dying of suffocation, that's what I've got to look forward to,\" Stanley says, as he sits in a clinic in St. Charles, Va. \"I've seen it too many times. My wife's grandpa ... [I] watched him take his last breath. I watched my uncle die with black lung. You literally suffocate because you can't get enough air. That's my prospects.\" Stanley says his diagnosis includes black lung and silicosis. In just the last three years, 644 cases of complicated black lung were diagnosed at Stone Mountain Health Services, which operates black lung clinics in St. Charles and two other Virginia communities. That's six times the NIOSH national count in nearly half the time. Ron Carson is the director of the Black Lung Program at Stone Mountain Health Services in St. Charles, Va. \"Something major is going on,\" he says. Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Ron Carson is the director of the Black Lung Program at Stone Mountain Health Services in St. Charles, Va. \"Something major is going on,\" he says. Howard Berkes/NPR \"I'm not an epidemiologist or a scientist or a doctor,\" says Ron Carson, who manages the clinics. \"I just see the results that come through the doors, and something is going on. Something major is going on.\" Laney and his colleagues acknowledge in their paper that they have missed hundreds of cases with their national surveillance program. By law, they can X-ray only working miners and the testing is voluntary. NIOSH data show most miners avoid that testing. Only 17 percent of all working Kentucky miners were tested in the NIOSH program since 2011. Stanley waited until he was out of work, after 30 years mining coal, before he got his first chest X-ray. Miners avoid the NIOSH testing, he says, because they worry it could cost them their jobs. \"If you're working and you go and have that stuff done and the company finds out about it, they'll find a way to get rid of you,\" Stanley says. \"As long as you're working and producing you're an asset. But now when you get something wrong with you, you become a liability. And they'll find a way to get rid of you.\" The last company a miner worked for (for at least a year) is saddled with black lung benefits payments and medical care \u2014 even if the miner spent 20 years working somewhere else in excessive dust. It's the last employer who pays. But it's against the law to punish or fire miners for getting X-rays or being diagnosed with disease. Bruce Watzman of the National Mining Association also says mining companies are not supposed to see the X-rays. \"Those results are not shared with any employer. It's at the miner's discretion the way the program operates today when and if to divulge that information,\" Watzman says. Still, the fear is widespread. So missing from the official NIOSH counts in the last 40 years are the working miners avoiding X-rays, and miners who are retired or laid off. More than 40,000 miners lost their jobs since 2010. Six hundred mines have closed. And those out of work are now flocking to clinics to get screened for the disease and apply for black lung benefits. Last year alone, 3,000 miners showed up at the Stone Mountain clinics. \"I'm seeing miners now feeling that there's no hope. I think that they have really come to the realization that there's other energy out there now that is going to override any coal,\" Carson says. With the increased testing, more cases of complicated black lung are being diagnosed. \"Pure rock dust\" Cohen, Laney and other black lung experts believe thinner coal seams in central Appalachia are likely to blame for spikes in complicated black lung. The thickest seams are mostly gone. The thin seams that remain have coal embedded in rock, and that rock contains quartz. Cutting quartz and coal together results in mine dust that includes silica, which is especially toxic in lung tissue. Stanley worked in so much dust he labeled his mining machine the dust dragon. \"They kept getting less coal and more rock. So you're cutting 19 inches of coal, you're cutting 50-60 inches of rock,\" Stanley recalls. \"And the more rock you cut the more dust you're going to eat.\" A display case at NIOSH shows a normal lung and a diseased black lung from inhaling coal dust and other harmful particles while coal mining. Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR A display case at NIOSH shows a normal lung and a diseased black lung from inhaling coal dust and other harmful particles while coal mining. Howard Berkes/NPR There's also the practice of slope mining, where crews cut solid rock to reach coal seams. Burnham did that in Kentucky for six straight months, working 14 16-hour shifts at one point. It was \"pure rock dust,\" he says. \"I had my respirators on and you'd actually have to remove it to help take a breath every once in a while because the dust packed so much around your filters you couldn't get no air in.\" Protective masks are among the controls that are supposed to prevent inhalation of coal and silica dust. Robust ventilation in mines is supposed to sweep dust away. Water sprays are used to tamp down dust. Kentucky miner Barney Stanton says those things didn't always work, even when most of the companies he worked for provided proper safety gear. \"It's hard to wear a mask and do a physical job,\" he says. \"Just trying to do your job, you breathe so hard the dust will come in around the mask.\" Stanton has been diagnosed with the most serious stage of PMF and is awaiting a lung transplant. \"The mining game is a numbers game,\" Branham says. \"If you don't produce coal, they'll put somebody else in your spot that can. If I've got another man on the other side of the mines, he's cutting more coal than me, it's not going to look good on me. I just thought about my family to be honest with you.\" Mining jobs are often the best-paying jobs in central Appalachia, where there generally are few other options for work. New rules in place, but a decade to see results New and tougher federal limits on mine dust exposure fully took effect in August, and they get even tougher when there's excessive silica. Simple black lung and PMF can take a decade or longer to develop, so the spike in disease is not an indication that new limits are failing, says Watzman of the National Mining Association. \"So I think we're talking about historic exposures and not the exposures we're seeing today.\" Watzman's group sued to keep the new dust rules from taking effect, but he acknowledges positive impact. \"I think that miners that are working today are better protected because the silica levels have come down,\" he says. Silica dust is down, on average, 50 percent since 2009, according to the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, whose director is Joe Main. \"I think if the rules are followed as they are prescribed we would not have these diseases,\" Main says, while also posing this question: \"Is the strength of the rules that are in place adequate enough to protect miners? I think that's the question of the day.\" There are some holes in the new rules when it comes to silica. For example, it can take a week or more to detect silica in dust samples, so excessive exposure isn't quickly addressed. Also, the U.S. Department of Labor has failed to take action on proposed dust rules specifically targeting silica. Every other industry cutting rock has strict limits on silica exposure, except mining. Main, whose tenure will end with the change in administrations, wouldn't commit to a silica limit. \"I think if the evidence points in that direction then that needs to be done,\" he says.

Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption A NIOSH black lung surveillance van at the fire station in Wharton, W.Va., in 2012. Howard Berkes/NPR It'll be a decade or more before the effectiveness of the new rules is known, because it takes that long to detect the disease in lungs. In the meantime, there are the cases NPR has identified. According to year-by-year data reported by NIOSH, our count this decade (962 cases) is more than double the cases NIOSH counted in the last 40 years (441). NPR also did not receive complete numbers from some clinics and did not get data from eight others in the heart of the region experiencing the spike. So there are very likely many more cases that are uncounted. That suggests more and more severely diseased miners will be seeking state or federal black lung benefits, which concerns Evan Smith, an attorney at the Appalachian Citizens Law Center in Whitesburg, Ky., which helps miners file for benefits. \"You're just putting more people into the system that need compensation, so the more people we have moving into the system, the more potential burden it places on the taxpayers,\" Smith says. There are also younger miners now being diagnosed, so benefits payments and health care may be required longer. There may be more demand for expensive lung transplants. \"The treatments run from a half-million to a million dollars,\" notes Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., the ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \"So, if there are cases out there that have not been counted then we have a lot of expenses [coming] that we don't expect.\" That increased demand comes as the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is stressed. The fund is nearly $6 billion in debt. It has taken on 1,000 claims that were covered by self-insured mining companies until they went bankrupt. And the coal excise tax that supports the fund is set for a 50 percent cut in two years. \"I think there are real reasons to be concerned about the viability of the trust fund,\" says Smith. There is also concern involving possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which contains a provision that makes it easier for miners to get black lung benefits. Scott has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the trust fund's ability to continue to pay claims. He also wants more accurate numbers of miners afflicted with progressive massive fibrosis. \"We have to get the numbers straight to make sure they're being properly reported,\" he says.

He is also left gasping for air and grasping for words. He worked hard to feed his family and now, as his life leaves him one breath at a time, he wonders about the cost. Branham has \"never been scared of death,\" he says, as he chokes back tears. \"It don't bother me a bit. It's just not seeing my kids grow up. But if I had it to do over I would do it again, if that's what it took to provide for my family as long as I have.\" Branham hopes for a lung transplant, which may give him five to 10 more years of life.

The administration did take action in response to the hack prior to the election. In September, President Obama privately confronted Vladimir Putin about the hacks at the G-20 summit in China. He warned the Russian President of unspecified consequences if the hacks continued. Watch Cynthia McFadden on Nightly News with Lester Holt for More On October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued an unprecedented joint statement pointing the finger at Russia, saying hacks of U.S. political groups and individual politicians could only have been done with the authorization of \"Russia's senior most\" Russian officials and that its intent was to undermine the integrity of the election.

James Stavridis when asked by NBC News about the level of the administration's response. \"In retrospect it certainly seems as though it was a mistake not to call the Russians sooner and respond to them in a very forceful way.\" Click Here to Read the Exclusive NBC News Report on Putin's Involvement in the Hack An administration official, in turn, criticized the news media for focusing more on the leaked documents than on the Russian covert operation that hacked into political entities to steal the documents. Administration officials pointed out that the day the intelligence assessment was made public was the same day a tape was leaked revealing Trump's lewd conversation with Billy Bush. Eleven days later, at an October press conference, Obama was not asked a single question about the Russian hacks. \"We used the same playbook we did with Sony,\" an administration official said, referring to the North Korean cyber attack on the Hollywood studio. The difference, he said, was that the media and the public was focused elsewhere. A Shift in Position? On Thursday morning, President-elect Trump joined in the criticism of the Obama administration, writing, \"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking , why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\" Trump was no longer disputing, as he has for months, that Russia was involved. And his top transition aide, Anthony Scaramucci, went even further Wednesday night in an interview with MSNBC's Brian Williams. \"I don\u00b9t think anybody thinks that you\u00b9re wrong,\" he said of the NBC News report. \"Our position right now is that we\u00b9re waiting for more information. We reject the notion that people would cyber attack our institutions. We are very upset about it.\" Play ",

Tony Rackauckas speaks at a news conference in Santa Ana in February. Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas speaks at a news conference in Santa Ana in February. (Nick Ut / Associated Press) Joel Rubin, Adam Elmahrek U.S. Justice Department officials have launched an investigation into whether the\u00a0Orange County district attorney\u2019s office has routinely denied accused criminals fair trials\u00a0by using jailhouse informants to secretly gather\u00a0evidence. The undisclosed role of informants in several high-profile\u00a0cases has\u00a0roiled the county\u2019s criminal justice system and raised questions about the conduct of prosecutors and sheriff\u2019s jailers. Earlier this year, a panel established by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas released a highly critical report saying a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d in his office\u00a0led to the scandal. Justice officials announced the investigation Thursday, saying the\u00a0inquiry would scrutinize\u00a0whether changes are needed to\u00a0the\u00a0long-running practice of\u00a0deploying\u00a0informants\u00a0to surreptitiously extract information from defendants. (Richard Winton, Christine Mai-Duc and Shelby Grad) Investigators will search for patterns of\u00a0widespread violations of the Constitution\u2019s 6th\u00a0Amendment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0namely whether defendants were denied their right to have their attorney present during any questioning.  They will look as well at whether prosecutors have adhered to strict\u00a0rules that require them to disclose evidence that is favorable to defendants.\u00a0 \u201cA systematic failure to protect the right to counsel and to a fair trial makes criminal proceedings fundamentally unfair and diminishes the public\u2019s faith in the integrity of the justice system,\u201d Vanita Gupta, head of the\u00a0Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, said\u00a0in a statement.\u00a0 If problems are found, federal authorities could present Rackauckas with a set of\u00a0reforms\u00a0and offer him\u00a0a stark choice: Make the changes or face a federal lawsuit. In announcing the investigation, Gupta and U.S. Atty. Eileen Decker\u00a0made clear they expected Rackauckas to cooperate, highlighting an offer he made this year for federal officials to look into his office\u2019s\u00a0use of informants. \u201cWe appreciate the district attorney\u2019s invitation to review his office\u2019s policies and practices, along with his assurance of unfettered access to documents and personnel in his office,\u201d Decker said. Rackauckas and Sheriff Sandra Hutchens, whose jailers run the informant program, said they would cooperate with the probe. Rackauckas said he would\u00a0\u201cprovide all needed documents and information.\u201d He added that\u00a0he expects Justice officials will find that his department\u00a0\u201cdid not engage in systematic or intentional violation of civil rights of any inmate and no innocent person was wrongfully convicted.\u201d Some reliance on informants is legal as long as they are not part of an orchestrated plan\u00a0to elicit information from a suspect. When informants are actively drafted by police and prosecutors, they effectively become an arm of law enforcement. In such instances, their involvement can violate a defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the U.S. Constitution. However, police and prosecutors often deny overstepping legal bounds. Daniel Medwed, a professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University and an expert on wrongful convictions,\u00a0said there is a belief among defense attorneys that the use of informants is often based on a \u201cwink and a nod\u201d instead of an explicit arrangement. The other problem prosecutors face when relying on jailhouse informants is disclosure. If the informant is offered a benefit in exchange for information \u2014 such as a shorter jail sentence \u2014 the defense must be informed. Failure to do so could violate a defendant\u2019s\u00a0right to a fair trial. In the past, both\u00a0Rackauckas and Hutchens have rejected claims that the\u00a0use of informants  has led to anything other than isolated problems.\u00a0 The decision by federal officials to delve into the inner workings of the county\u2019s\u00a0top law\u00a0enforcement agency raises\u00a0the stakes dramatically in what has been a rancorous\u00a0battle over the use of jailhouse informants. Last year, a judge kicked Rackauckas\u2019 office off the case of Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2011. The district attorney\u2019s office was pursuing the death penalty, but Superior Court\u00a0Judge Thomas Goethals handed the case over to the state\u2019s attorney general. Goethals made the dramatic move\u00a0after growing increasingly impatient with  sheriff\u2019s jailers and prosecutors, who resisted repeated orders to fully disclose the role of an informant in the case and to hand over records about the informant program. An appeals court recently upheld the decision, saying there was ample evidence of wrongdoing. The discoveries in the Dekraai case have upended several other murder cases. In February, a Superior Court judge ordered a new trial for a convicted killer on the grounds that authorities failed to reveal that a key witness was an informant. In another case, prosecutors neglected to tell defense\u00a0lawyers they had used a paid\u00a0jailhouse informant to help convict a\u00a0man of a 2004 gang\u00a0slaying in Santa Ana. In light of that\u00a0information, the murder conviction was scuttled\u00a0and the man was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter. He could be out of prison in four years. And a defendant\u00a0who faced the possibility of life in prison if convicted of murder in two gang\u00a0killings went free on\u00a0probation after being allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder.\u00a0Prosecutors lost faith in the case after hearings in the Dekraai case revealed that an informant gathered information on the defendant. Medwed\u00a0said the federal investigation into Orange County informants\u00a0\u201chas been a long time coming.\u201d While first\u00a0used to infiltrate complex organizations such as corrupt governments and the mafia, the use of informants has expanded\u00a0over time to include murder and other crimes, Medwed said. Prosecutors, he said,\u00a0have come to over-rely on informants, especially in weaker cases. Informants factor into a high percentage of cases in which defendants are later found to have been wrongfully convicted, he said. \u201cThe problem with informants is they\u2019re so attractive. If it\u2019s a weak case, maybe bringing in an informant is a way to solidify it,\u201d Medwed said. The government\u2019s move Thursday was foreshadowed by the committee Rackauckas appointed as he tried to address the blossoming crisis. The panel,\u00a0which included legal experts, concluded that\u00a0the district attorney\u2019s office was functioning \u201cas a ship without a rudder\u201d\u00a0and faulted some of its prosecutors for adopting a \u201cwin-at-all-costs mentality.\u201d Specifically, it suggested a series of reforms, including the need to create \u201ca clear and consistent policy regarding its use of jailhouse informants\u201d that would establish strict limits on when and how they are used. After the panel presented its findings to\u00a0Rackauckas, the district attorney wrote to U.S. Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch in January to request the federal inquiry. If federal officials find that jailers and prosecutors routinely violated defendants\u2019 rights with the\u00a0use of jailhouse informants, they are likely to impose\u00a0a consent decree on the county\u00a0that would\u00a0require\u00a0changes and appoint a monitor to track progress.

Fifty-two percent of the tested pharmacies sold the medications without mentioning the potential interaction. (Chicago Tribune) The Chicago Tribune tested 255 pharmacies to see how often stores would dispense risky drug pairs without warning patients. Fifty-two percent of the tested pharmacies sold the medications without mentioning the potential interaction. (Chicago Tribune) Sam Roe , Ray Long and Karisa King Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune The Tribune reporter walked into an Evanston CVS pharmacy carrying two prescriptions: one for a common antibiotic, the other for a popular anti-cholesterol drug. Taken alone, these two drugs, clarithromycin and simvastatin, are relatively safe. But taken together they can cause a severe breakdown in muscle tissue and lead to kidney failure and death. When the reporter tried to fill the prescriptions, the pharmacist should have warned him of the dangers. But that's not what happened. The two medications were packaged, labeled and sold within minutes, without a word of caution. The same thing happened when a reporter presented prescriptions for a different potentially deadly drug pair at a Walgreens on the Magnificent Mile. And at a Wal-Mart in Evergreen Park, a Jewel-Osco in River Forest and a Kmart in Springfield. In the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind, the Tribune tested 255 pharmacies to see how often stores would dispense dangerous drug pairs without warning patients. Fifty-two percent of the pharmacies sold the medications without mentioning the potential interaction, striking evidence of an industrywide failure that places millions of consumers at risk. CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy retailer by store count, had the highest failure rate of any chain in the Tribune tests, dispensing the medications with no warning 63 percent of the time. Walgreens, one of CVS' main competitors, had the lowest failure rate at 30 percent \u2014 but that's still missing nearly 1 in 3 interactions. In response to the Tribune tests, CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart each vowed to take significant steps to improve patient safety at its stores nationwide. Combined, the actions affect 22,000 drugstores and involve additional training for 123,000 pharmacists and technicians. \"There is a very high sense of urgency to pursue this issue and get to the root cause,\" said Tom Davis, CVS' vice president of pharmacy professional services. CVS, which filled about 1 billion prescriptions last year, said the company would improve policies and its computer system to \"dramatically\" increase warnings to patients. Walgreens said it would, among other changes, increase training for pharmacists. \"We take this very seriously,\" said Rex Swords, Walgreens' vice president of pharmacy and retail operations and planning. Dangerous drug combinations are a major public health problem, hospitalizing tens of thousands of people each year. Pharmacists are the last line of defense, and their role is growing as Americans use more prescription drugs than ever. One in 10 people take five or more drugs \u2014 twice the percentage seen in 1994. Some pharmacists who were tested got it right, coming to the counter to issue stern warnings. \"You'll be on the floor. You can't have the two together,\" said one pharmacist at a Walgreens on Chicago's Northwest Side. Said a Kmart pharmacist in Rockford: \"I've seen people go to the hospital on this combination.\" But in test after test, other pharmacists dispensed dangerous drug pairs at a fast-food pace, with little attention paid to customers. They failed to catch combinations that could trigger a stroke, result in kidney failure, deprive the body of oxygen or lead to unexpected pregnancy with a risk of birth defects. Location didn't matter: Failures occurred in poor neighborhoods on the South Side as well as in affluent suburbs and the Gold Coast. Even the Walgreens at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago failed its test. The newspaper also tested independent pharmacies, many of which take pride in providing personalized care. As a group, they had a higher failure rate than any retail chain, missing risky drug interactions 72 percent of the time. Chains overall failed 49 percent of their tests. The Tribune study, two years in the making, exposes fundamental flaws in the pharmacy industry. Safety laws are not being followed, computer alert systems designed to flag drug interactions either don't work or are ignored, and some pharmacies emphasize fast service over patient safety. Several chain pharmacists, in interviews, described assembly-line conditions in which staff hurried to fill hundreds of prescriptions a day. Wal-Mart, operator of 4,500 U.S. pharmacies, failed 43 percent of its tests. The company said it would update and improve its pharmacy alert system and train pharmacists on the changes. Kmart failed 60 percent of the tests. Phil Keough, pharmacy president for Sears Holdings, which owns Kmart, said he was disappointed with the results. \"While not happy, we also take this as an opportunity to look in the mirror and see where we can get better,\" he said. Costco, a membership warehouse club whose pharmacies are open to the general public, failed 60 percent of the tests; the company declined to comment. The Tribune also tested two Chicago-area chains: Jewel-Osco, which failed 43 percent of the time, and Mariano's, 37 percent. Jewel-Osco declined an interview request and instead emailed the Tribune a one-sentence written statement: \"Osco pharmacists have a history of providing knowledgeable, exemplary care to our customers and their health, well-being and safety is our primary concern.\" Mariano's also declined to answer questions. The chain said in a written statement: \"None of our pharmacists are intentionally disregarding drug interactions or patient safety.\" The chain wrote, \"Our pharmacists look at each patient profile which includes patient history, allergy profile, pre-existing conditions and other factors such as age, all of which must be considered when assessing the potential for a drug interaction.\" But in the Tribune tests, pharmacists at Mariano's stores rarely asked for all of that information. Last line of defense In the fight to protect patients from dangerous drug interactions, doctors shoulder significant responsibility. They are the ones who write the prescriptions. But one physician may not know what another has prescribed, and research has found that doctors' knowledge about specific interactions is often poor. In filling prescriptions, pharmacists are uniquely positioned to detect potential drug interactions, warn patients and prevent harm. Pharmacists themselves say that is one of their primary duties. Yet little data exists about how well they perform in real-world situations. The Tribune set out to find the answer. To select drug pairs to be used in the tests, the newspaper enlisted the help of two leading experts on drug interactions: pharmacy professors Daniel Malone of the University of Arizona and John Horn of the University of Washington. Five pairs were chosen, three of which posed life-threatening risks. Another could cause patients to pass out. A fifth included an oral contraceptive and could lead to unplanned pregnancies. According to the two experts, all of the drugs had been on the market for years, and the pairs presented well-established interactions that pharmacists should easily catch. \"No-brainers,\" Horn called them. Writing the prescriptions was Dr. Steven C. Fox, a Chicago physician who treats many elderly patients on multiple medications. He knew the risks of interactions firsthand. Fox wrote the prescriptions in the names of 18 Tribune journalists, 15 of whom conducted tests in the field. They presented the prescriptions written in their names or, in some instances, their colleagues' names. The reporters tested 30 stores at each of seven leading chains as well as numerous independent pharmacies. Most stores were in the Chicago area; some were in Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. Reporters presented the prescriptions together or a couple of days apart, then waited to see if the orders would be filled. Read the story In Illinois, pharmacists who detect a serious interaction must contact the prescribing doctor to see if the order is correct or if an alternative therapy is available, according to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. Pharmacists are then supposed to alert the patient. Carmen Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, said the professional standard is clear. \"Anytime there's a serious interaction, there's no excuse for the pharmacist not warning the patient about that interaction,\" he said. In the Tribune study, a test was considered a pass if the pharmacist attempted to contact Fox about the interaction or warned the reporter. Drug information leaflets placed inside the bag or stapled to the outside were not considered sufficient to warrant a pass. Illinois regulators said these materials typically are not adequate replacements for verbal warnings; some of the materials don't warn about specific interactions, and experts say patients frequently throw out the leaflets without reading them. After the tests, reporters called many of the pharmacists to inform them of the results and to discuss the findings. Why were so many pharmacies missing dangerous drug combinations? Speed vs. safety Mayuri Patel, a pharmacist at a Wal-Mart in west suburban Northlake, said she typically fills 200 prescriptions in a nine-hour shift, or one every 2.7 minutes. At another Wal-Mart where she was trained, it was even busier, she said: \"We were doing 600 a day with two pharmacists with 10-hour shifts.\" That works out to one prescription every two minutes. In the Tribune tests, she caught a potentially deadly drug pair, warning the reporter at the counter: \"This is a common interaction.\" It is difficult to say why so many pharmacists failed the same test, but interviews and studies point to a possible explanation: the emphasis on speed. Several stores dispensed risky drug pairs with no warning in less than 15 minutes. At a Kmart in Valparaiso, Ind., it was 12 minutes. At an independent pharmacy on the North Side, it was five. The Tribune found that pharmacists frequently race through legally required drug safety reviews \u2014 or skip them altogether. According to Illinois law, pharmacies are required to conduct several safety checks, including whether the dose is reasonable and whether the medication might interact with other drugs the patient is taking. But in the Tribune tests, pharmacies rarely asked what other medications testers were using. \"They're cutting corners where they think they can cut,\" said Bob Stout, president of the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy, which sampled data from two retail chains in the state and found that pharmacists spent an average of 80 seconds on safety checks for each prescription filled. \"What happens, I found on the board, is people stop doing (safety) reviews,\" Stout said. \"They're not going in looking at patient records.\" Drug combinations E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Tribune reporters presented pharmacies with prescriptions for drugs that are known to be harmful or even fatal if taken together, but 52 percent of the time the prescriptions were filled without warning. Tribune reporters presented pharmacies with prescriptions for drugs that are known to be harmful or even fatal if taken together, but 52 percent of the time the prescriptions were filled without warning. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Most pharmacies use computer software designed to flag drug interactions. But experts say computer alerts are so common that pharmacists can get \"alert fatigue\" and ignore many of the warnings. At the same time, chain pharmacies are increasingly promoting quick service. Drive-through windows are now common, and services like CVS' walk-in MinuteClinics appeal to consumers' preference for speed. These efforts may send a message to patients that speed is more important than quality health care. Patients have internalized that message and feel entitled to short wait times, pharmacists said. \"The patient will get mad if you call the doctor and take time,\" said Sadia Shuja, a pharmacist at Skypoint Pharmacy in Schaumburg who caught a dangerous drug pair in the Tribune tests. \"Sometimes they think it is fast food.\" To ease workload, most pharmacies employ technicians to manage tasks that require less medical expertise. Arsen Mysllinj, a Kmart pharmacist in Rockford who passed the Tribune test, said technicians at his store and others often screen for drug interactions after entering patients' drug orders into a computer. If interactions appear, he said, the technicians are trained to print out the warning on the screen and hand it to a pharmacist. It would be better, he said, for pharmacists to do the screening. Kmart said that in light of the test results, it would review its relevant policies, computer systems and training programs. Unionized pharmacists, including those in Illinois, have periodically pushed for minimum staffing rules, but those efforts have not gone far. Some pharmacists say time spent pitching company promotions could be better spent on patient safety. In the Tribune tests, the majority of Kmart pharmacists dispensed risky drug combinations without warning testers. But several did take time to try to enroll the reporters in the company's savings program. 'Scorecard' pressures At CVS, prompt service isn't just a vague goal. It is a carefully measured metric that the chain uses, along with other assessments, to grade its pharmacies and rank them against one another, records and interviews show. Several current or former CVS pharmacists criticized the practice, saying it pressures them to focus more on corporate criteria than on drug interactions and other safety checks. \"You get stressed, and it takes your mind away from the actual prescriptions,\" said Chuck Zuraitis, head pharmacist at a CVS in south suburban Park Forest and a union steward for Teamsters Local 727, which represents 130 CVS pharmacists in the Chicago area. His pharmacy was not among those tested. Performance and business metrics are common at big chain pharmacies and in other industries. Supporters say they make companies more efficient and responsive to customers. In 2012, the nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication Practices conducted a national survey of 673 pharmacists and found that nearly two-thirds worked at stores that track the time it takes to fill prescriptions. About 25 percent worked at companies that guaranteed short wait times. Of the pharmacists at stores that advertised quick service, 4 in 10 said they had made a medication error as a result of hurrying to fill a prescription within a set time. In 2013, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy called on states to prohibit, restrict or regulate company policies that measure the speed of pharmacists' work. But, the association says, little has changed in state law. Internal CVS records obtained by the Tribune show that the company tracks numerous pharmacist tasks, including whether prescriptions are filled in the time promised to customers and whether voicemails are retrieved in a timely fashion. \"Every prescription is timed,\" said Deepak Chande, a former head pharmacist at a CVS in southwest suburban Worth, \"and this is the worst of the pharmacist's nightmares.\" Deepak Chande E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Deepak Chande, a former head CVS pharmacist in southwest suburban Worth, says pressure is intense to fill prescriptions quickly. Deepak Chande, a former head CVS pharmacist in southwest suburban Worth, says pressure is intense to fill prescriptions quickly. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) If pharmacists fall behind, the backlog pops up in color on their computer screens, said Chande, also a former union steward. \"It's an unreal pressure,\" he said. \"Your mind is kind of frantically trying to obey it.\" CVS officials declined to be interviewed about metrics but issued a statement and answered questions in writing. The company said prescriptions do not have to be filled quickly, but it expects pharmacists to have medications ready by the time promised to the customer. Records show that head pharmacists receive a monthly \"WeCARE Scorecard\" that tracks the percentage of prescriptions filled by the times promised. The pharmacies are ranked by district, by region and nationwide. CVS' computer system prioritizes prescriptions based on patients' requested pickup times, with preference given to customers with urgent needs \u2014 for instance, someone on his way home from the hospital after surgery. Pharmacists can reset a promised pickup time if they think it cannot be met, the company wrote. The color indicators on computer screens are meant to help pharmacists with prioritizing their work, CVS said. The company also wrote that several years ago it removed a red indicator for prescriptions that had gone beyond the promised pickup time because pharmacists \"felt the color red denoted something negative or alarming.\" \"We switched to an 'orange' indicator to inform a pharmacy team which prescriptions may not be ready before a customer's expected arrival time,\" CVS wrote. Another CVS metric, documents show, tracks how many patients sign up for automatic refills. Zuraitis said posters on pharmacy walls record how many flu shots have been administered. \"You feel like you're trying to sell people something,\" he said. CVS said automatic refills help patients stay on schedule with the drugs they need to treat chronic conditions. The company said it measures the number of flu vaccinations offered to customers to help support the recommendation by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that people receive a flu shot annually. At Walgreens, officials said the company collects business metrics as a way to monitor staffing levels and service. The firm said it does not use them in a manner that emphasizes productivity over patient safety. Alethea Little, a Walgreens pharmacist in west suburban Forest Park who properly warned a tester, said metrics are no excuse for missing drug interactions. \"Our flu shot goal is 10 a day, 12 a day, 50 a day,\" she said. \"And the phone rings off the hook. You just got to do what you got to do, essentially.\" Squeezed by chains Independent pharmacies face a different kind of pressure: intense competition from the big chains. B.M. Patel, a pharmacist for 40 years who owns Riteway Pharmacy on Chicago's Northwest Side, missed the test interaction but didn't make excuses. \"It was a mistake,\" he said. \"Maybe I should be paying more attention.\" But he also said small pharmacies know that if they don't fill a prescription, the customer might simply go to a nearby chain store. Business at his store, he said, \"is not good. I can still survive, but not too long. We don't really know how long it's going to last.\" The number of independent stores has been shrinking nationwide. In Illinois, the number dropped about 9 percent from 689 in 2013 to 624 last year, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association. Several independents tested by the Tribune looked like classic drugstores, offering medications alongside greeting cards, stuffed animals and candy bars. Others were less inviting. One dispensed drugs behind a thick window; at another, a reporter had to knock several times to gain entry. In Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood, independent pharmacist Audrey Galal passed her test while working at a Mexicare Pharmacy, a small storefront on a block of brick buildings. The store is in the process of closing, she said, in part because of competition from chains. Galal said she did not think small drugstores would knowingly sell harmful medications, but they might be reluctant to turn away business. \"These pharmacists are acting like businesspeople, just trying to keep their pharmacies afloat instead of being clinicians,\" said Galal, who now works at a Mexicare in Little Village. Audrey Galal E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Pharmacist Audrey Galal recognized the danger when presented with a pair of prescriptions at the independent Mexicare Pharmacy in Chicago\u2019s Pilsen neighborhood and did not dispense the drugs. She doubts small drugstores knowingly sell harmful combinations but says they might be reluctant to turn away business.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Andy Politis, a pharmacist and part owner of Oakmill Pharmacy in north suburban Niles who passed the test, said he was surprised how many independents failed. \"The independent guys should be better because they don't have the same pressure as the big stores with so many prescriptions,\" he said. B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive of the national community pharmacists group, said the results were alarming. \"It's something that shouldn't happen \u2014 both for chains and independents,\" he said. \"Even one is too many.\" Several independents said the findings prompted them to make changes. After failing its test, Summit Medical Pharmacy in the southwest suburbs beefed up internal checks and worked with a software company to ensure that even minor drug interactions are detected. Since then, the new system has flagged several interactions that led to consultations with doctors and patients, head pharmacist Pankaj Bhalakia said. \"We changed the whole system,\" he said. \"I don't think there could be a problem in the future.\" sroe@chicagotribune.com ",

The president-elect speaks during a meeting Wednesday in New York with technology executives. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Dawn had barely broken Thursday when Donald Trump once\u00a0again broadcast\u00a0via Twitter a provably false claim: that the Obama administration had not raised an alarm about Russian interference in the presidential election until after Hillary Clinton \u2019s defeat. In fact, on Oct. 7, the administration issued an official statement accusing the Russians of being behind the cyberattacks that appear to have harmed Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cOnly Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the administration statement said at the time.\u00a0 Nor was the issue a surprise to Trump.\u00a0He had\u00a0publicly called on\u00a0the Russians in July to find and release Clinton\u2019s emails. He\u00a0talked in September about accusations of Russian hacking and commented on them during the fall\u00a0presidential debates. Still\u00a0he added some equivocation\u00a0to his false tweet\u00a0Thursday: \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u201d In another message Thursday, Trump accused the media of working \u201cso hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex, when actually it isn\u2019t!\u201d Except it was Trump and his team who specifically had cited the complexity of his business operations when they canceled a long-planned Thursday news conference that was supposed\u00a0to explain how he\u2019d separate his government duties from his business affairs\u00a0while in office . Those two tweets \u2014 along with one criticizing Vanity Fair magazine, which appeared to be\u00a0 retribution for a negative review of a\u00a0Trump Tower\u00a0restaurant \u2014 were the latest in a pattern for Trump. His\u00a0communications seem aimed at keeping his supporters on the team, his opponents under fire and the rest of America distracted from larger unanswered questions about the president-elect\u2019s plans . It is a strategy that has helped Trump gather a band of enthusiastic supporters large enough to win the presidency \u2014 but poses the threat of further alienating those who did not side with him and with whom a more conventional president-elect\u00a0might want to ingratiate himself during his preinaugural period. A McClatchy-Marist poll released Thursday demonstrated both the rationale for and the risks of Trump\u2019s tactics.\u00a0Asked about Trump\u2019s tweets, two-thirds\u00a0of American voters cast them as \u201creckless and distracting\u201d compared with 1\u00a0in 5 who found them \u201ceffective and informative.\u201d There was a sharply partisan cast to the findings, but even among Republicans,\u00a0nearly 2 in 5 disapproved of his communications. More than half of those who called themselves \u201cstrong Republicans,\u201d however,\u00a0had a favorable view of Trump\u2019s\u00a0tweets. \u201cHe has been talking mostly to his base and has not been reaching out,\u201d said poll director Lee Miringoff. \u201cAt some point that could become a problem, though we are not at that point yet.\u201d One of the challenges for Trump will be making sure that his regular entreaties on social media don\u2019t work against him as he seeks to build support for his goals. In the case of the Russian hacks, for example,\u00a0his repeated disavowal of the\u00a0unified judgment of U.S. intelligence that Moscow was behind the hacking \u2014 as well as insults leveled at the CIA and his own sympathetic views toward the foreign power \u2014 could complicate his desire to win support for his secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson . The Exxon Mobil chief executive has close ties to President Vladimir Putin from many years of doing business in Russia. More broadly, any president needs to have a trust-based relationship with the country he leads, particularly in times of crisis. \u201cThat only works if the president has credibility,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff , a Democrat from Burbank and member of the House Intelligence Committee, noted at a recent breakfast with reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cSo when you have a president-elect that sends out patently false information \u2026 that impugns the credibility of the [presidency], and at some point the president is going to need to be believed by the country,\u201d Schiff\u00a0said. Trump\u2019s Russia tweet marked the second time in four days that he has falsely asserted that the Obama administration did not say anything in public about the Russian hacking until after the election. He seemed to be trying to frame\u00a0concerns about Russian intervention in the election as an effort to delegitimize his victory. In fact, many of those alarmed about the matter\u00a0\u2014 a group that includes Republicans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have said that there\u2019s no indication the intervention cost Clinton the White House, and that their concern rests with the larger issue of Russian duplicity. Trump spokesman Jason Miller hit the legitimacy\u00a0theme Thursday when asked about Trump\u2019s tweets earlier in the day. ",

Trump at a \u201cthank you\u201d rally in West Allis, Wis., on Tuesday. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump on Thursday falsely stated that the United States government had waited until after the election \u201cto complain\u201d that Russia had hacked into American political organizations to interfere in the presidential race. But in doing so, he raised substantive questions about the Obama administration\u2019s slow response to a cyberattack that proved successful. In another of his provocative, early-morning posts on Twitter, Mr. Trump cast doubt on the government\u2019s conclusion that Russia had carried out the hacking with the approval of the highest levels of the Kremlin, suggesting instead that the finding was a case of postelection sour grapes by President Obama. \u201cWhy did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, ignoring the fact that the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., formally blamed Russia on Oct. 7 \u2014 a full month before Election Day \u2014 for the cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee and other organizations. In September, meeting privately in China with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Obama not only complained, the White House says, but warned him of consequences if the Russian activity did not halt. \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. The Twitter post was the latest move by the president-elect to accuse the intelligence agencies he will soon control of acting with a political agenda, and to dispute a well-documented conclusion that Moscow carried out a meticulously planned series of attacks and information releases devised to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. In the message, Mr. Trump again sought to dismiss the evidence of Russia\u2019s misdeeds as the unfounded complaints of sore losers casting about for reasons to reject the results of the election. But Mr. Trump also seized upon questions that have roiled the White House and the highest echelons of the Obama administration: Why did it take months after Russia\u2019s breaches had been discovered for Mr. Obama to publicly name Moscow as the culprit? And why did Mr. Obama opt not to openly retaliate, through sanctions or other measures? Advertisement Continue reading the main story White House officials say the warning to Mr. Putin at a September summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, constituted the primary American response. But when the administration decided to go public a month later with its conclusion that Russia was responsible, it did so in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security, not in a prominent presidential appearance. And there was no promise of economic sanctions against the individuals or organizations responsible. Officials said they worried that any more public response to the hacking would raise doubts about the integrity of the election, something that Mr. Trump was already seeking to do in campaign appearances in which he insisted that the election was \u201crigged.\u201d ",

    "text": "Supreme Court Strikes Down Abortion Restrictions In Texas Abortion-rights groups filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming the regulation unfairly \"burdens women seeking pregnancy-related medical care\" by imposing \"a funeral ritual on women who have a miscarriage management procedure, ectopic pregnancy surgery, or an abortion.\" In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that required clinics that provide abortions to have surgical facilities and their doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Supreme Court ruled both provisions were an undue burden and therefore unconstitutional. The regulations on fetal remains were issued by the state's Health and Human Services Department and were strongly endorsed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, NPR's Wade Goodwyn reported. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reported : \"Supporters ... say its purpose is to provide dignity for 'unborn infants.' \" 'What we're saying is, it needs to be humane, and the mother needs to be given the opportunity to have a say and be informed with what's happening,' says Kristi Hamrick of Americans United for Life. The group has created model legislation intended for other states, similar to the Texas regulation. ... \"The Texas regulation is part of a wave of such laws that followed last year's undercover videos targeting Planned Parenthood . The maker of the videos, an anti-abortion activist, accused the women's health organization of unlawfully selling fetal tissue. The deceptively edited videos sparked congressional hearings and a dozen state investigations. None found any evidence of wrongdoing.\" As Wade has reported , funeral directors in Texas also raised concerns about the new rules: \" 'If the regulations do go into effect, we as an industry, we're real uncertain and real uncomfortable at this point cause we really don't know what to expect,' said Michael Land, a past president of and current spokesman for the 4,000 members of the Texas State Funeral Directors Association. \"Currently funeral homes in Texas are required to cremate the remains from miscarriages after the fifth month of pregnancy. That doesn't happen very often, though, and Land says frequently funeral homes do it pro bono.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

(Photo: FEMA) 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Because of yet another mix-up with bioterror pathogens, a federal terrorism response training center in Alabama says it mistakenly exposed more than 9,600 firefighters, paramedics and other students to a deadly toxin over the past five years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Center for Domestic Preparedness blames an outside laboratory for a series of shipping errors since 2011 that resulted in the first-responder training center using in its classes a potentially lethal form of ricin powder. The a poison, made from castor beans, is capable of killing at small doses. The training center says it submitted order forms asking for a type of ricin extract that is unlikely to cause serious harm. But officials from Toxin Technology, the Florida company that sent nine shipments to the center since 2011, told USA TODAY that its ricin products were all accurately labeled as \u201cRCA60\u201d \u2013 a scientific name for the whole ricin toxin, which can be deadly. It\u2019s unclear why training center staff didn\u2019t recognize for years that they were working with a far more dangerous substance. There is no antidote to treat ricin poisoning. After issuing repeated statements to USA TODAY since Monday solely blaming the vendor, on Thursday FEMA administrator W. Craig Fugate called for the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General to investigate. The training center had already suspended all training with biological agents, which include training with a less-dangerous strain of anthrax. Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said he\u2019s stunned that over the past five years the training center never verified that that it was receiving the less-toxic ricin product it thought it was ordering. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond careless and outrageous. It's almost malfeasance,\u201d Ridge said. Nobody was sickened by the exposures, FEMA spokeswoman Alexa Lopez said. Students, who were being trained to detect the presence of biological agents, were wearing protective gear during the exercises. Workers at the Anniston, Ala., training center prepared ricin training materials in special biosafety cabinets designed to protect against exposures. Still Ridge and other national security experts say the ricin mix-up is just the latest high-profile incident showing lax safety practices at U.S. biodefense facilities. Hundreds of government, military, private and university laboratories nationwide possess potential bioterror pathogens, which the government calls \u201cselect agents,\u201d such as those that cause anthrax, botulism and plague. They\u2019re used in scientific research and the development of vaccines, medical treatments and for creating and testing detection and personal protection equipment. In 2014, CDC mistakes with anthrax specimens that were believed to be killed resulted in dozens of the agency\u2019s lab workers being potentially exposed to the deadly bacteria. In 2015, the Pentagon discovered that an Army lab in Utah had been mistakenly shipping live anthrax \u2013 labeled as killed \u2013 to dozens of labs in the U.S. and abroad for more than a decade. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert at Rutgers University, said what happened at the FEMA training facility with ricin is the latest incident in which \u201cincompetence by a federal agency\u201d has resulted in a mix-up between biological specimens that were thought to be killed or inactivated \u2013 yet weren\u2019t. \u201cThe only way those running security agencies will get this message in their heads, is if violators are held accountable,\u201d Ebright said. But that hasn\u2019t happened, he said. A USA TODAY investigation in 2015 found hundreds of safety incidents at labs nationwide and a lax and secretive system of oversight of potential bioterror pathogens that hides serious incidents from the public. Inside America's secretive biolabs \u201cThese kinds of things are continually going to happen until biosafety gets elevated to a major level,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security. While the research done into bioterror pathogens is important, the public\u2019s trust and support for it will be eroded if safety isn\u2019t improved, he said. Investigators from the Federal Select Agent Program, which regulates labs and other facilities that work with potential bioterror pathogens, traveled this week to the company that supplied the ricin to the FEMA training center. The program is jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Neither the CDC nor FEMA would name the vendor that supplied the ricin to the training facility when asked by The Anniston Star, which first revealed the incident, nor to USA TODAY. USA TODAY determined through its reporting the vendor was Toxin Technology in Sarasota, Fla. Information provided to USA TODAY by officials at Toxin Technology and the FEMA training center conflict in several ways and raise significant questions about how ricin materials were ordered and shipped over the years. FEMA in its statements has repeatedly said the material mix-up was \u201cdue to an error by the supplier\u201d and that the \u201cintended use declaration\u201d forms the training center submitted to the vendor specified the center was seeking \u201cRicin Chain A.\u201d The ricin toxin has two components, referred to as A and B chains. The B-chain needs to be present, experts said, to allow the A-chain to enter and damage cells. FEMA officials say their intent was to use the A-chain ricin in its programs because it was safer and would still react with detection equipment during training classes as if it were the more dangerous whole ricin toxin. \u201cIn November 2016, while making a purchase of ricin A-chain for training, staff at FEMA\u2019s Center for Domestic Preparedness recognized an ongoing discrepancy in the documentation related to the type of ricin being provided,\u201d FEMA said in a statement. But the agency wouldn\u2019t provide any details about what kind of documentation and discrepancy was involved. However the ordering catalog for Toxin Technology does not list any A-chain ricin products \u2013 only a whole ricin product. FEMA told USA TODAY the product it ordered wasn\u2019t in the company\u2019s catalog. \u201cIt was a specialty product rather than a standard catalog item,\u201d the agency said. Raoul Reiser, who founded Toxin Technology in 1984 and sold it to a partner about three years ago, told USA TODAY that he remembers supplying A-chain ricin products to the FEMA training facility while he was there. Reiser said that while the A-chain ricin product wasn\u2019t in Toxin Technology\u2019s catalog, it was purchased by many customers as far away as Singapore who learned about it through word of mouth. \u201cWe never made the ricin at Tox Tech, we were just repackaging and reselling what Vector Labs was selling,\u201d Reiser said. He said Toxin Technology would buy the A-chain ricin in liquid form from the international biological supply company, then turn it into a powdered form for resale. Yet officials at Vector Laboratories told USA TODAY their records show they never sold A-chain ricin to Toxin Technology \u2013 only a product that contained the whole ricin toxin. David Weber, Vector Labs chief commercial officer, said the company checked its records going back to early 2005 and found the only product it shipped to Toxin Technology on numerous occasions through August was a whole ricin product. Reiser said he was surprised to hear this. \u201cI was under the impression we were buying the A-chain toxin, not the holotoxin,\u201d he said Wednesday night. He said all of the purchasing was handled at Toxin Technology by Paul Bina. Bina, who is currently listed on Toxin Technology\u2019s website as vice president and lab manager, said he doesn\u2019t know why Reiser would have been under the impression the product sold by the company was A-chain ricin. Bina told USA TODAY that he was at the company when it first started selling ricin products and it sold only two and both were whole toxin products. They were labeled as RCA60 in the company\u2019s catalog, website and \u201con all shipping and manufacturing records,\u201d he said. Bina said: \u201cI instructed to purchase the RCA60 from Vector Labs for this purpose. At no time did we ever have Ricin A Chain and at no time did we ever repackage RCA60 and sell it as Ricin A Chain.\u201d Bina said that when he left the company in 2010 for a few years, the ricin products were still being correctly identified as \u201cRCA60.\u201d When he returned, Bina said the multiple lots of ricin produced while he was away \u201cwere still all correctly identified as \u2018RCA60\u2019 on all shipping and manufacturing documents.\u201d After USA TODAY asked FEMA to produce documents showing how the ricin products it received were labeled, the agency called for the inspector general investigation. Bill Rose, manager of Toxin Technology, said it is company policy not to discuss its clients. But he told USA TODAY on Thursday that the company is in the process of contacting all recipients of its ricin products to ensure they are aware they received the whole toxin products. But he said that a review of the company\u2019s available sales and shipping records show the information sent with the products correctly showed they were \u201cRicin RCA60.\u201d GAO finds more gaps in oversight of bioterror germs studied in U.S. labs Although ricin is a select agent, under federal regulations, it\u2019s exempt from regulation if it is held in amounts less than 100 mg. So while Toxin Technology is regulated by the select agent program, the FEMA training center \u2013 which\u00a0never possessed more than 70 mg of ricin \u2013 is not. \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d said Ridge, who has been co-chairing a Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense that issued a report calling for strengthening U.S. readiness for bioterrorism and response to emerging disease. The panel, co-chaired by former Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman and sponsored by the Hudson Institute think tank, issued a follow-up report this week noting that Congress still hasn\u2019t done a comprehensive reassessment of the Federal Select Agent Program. 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hT6qOC ",

Colchicine, foreground, and verapamil are potentially fatal when taken together. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) To determine how often area pharmacies would dispense potentially dangerous drug pairs without warning customers, the Tribune launched what would become the most extensive testing project of its kind. In all, 255 tests were conducted, most of them in Chicago or its suburbs. Five national chain pharmacies with a large presence in the Chicago area were tested \u2014 CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Costco \u2014 as well as local chains Jewel-Osco and Mariano's. Reporters also tested a randomly selected group of independent pharmacies. The five drug pairs used in the tests were chosen in consultation with national experts on drug interactions. The drug combinations In choosing the test pairs, the goal was to find combinations in which each drug had been on the market for many years, the drugs could cause serious harm when taken together, and the interactions should have been well-known to pharmacists. The Tribune selected five pairs with the help of two pharmacy professors who are leading experts in drug interactions: Daniel Malone of the University of Arizona and John Horn of the University of Washington. Three of the combinations were potentially fatal: the antibiotic clarithromycin and the cholesterol drug simvastatin; clarithromycin and ergotamine, a migraine medication; and the blood pressure drug verapamil and colchicine, used to treat gout. Another pair \u2014 the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the muscle relaxant tizanidine \u2014 could cause patients to pass out. The fifth pair was griseofulvin, an anti-fungal medication, and a hormone-based oral contraceptive sold under various brand and generic names. Taking griseofulvin can render the birth control pills ineffective and lead to unexpected pregnancy with a risk of birth defects. According to Malone and Horn, drug safety databases used by pharmacies rate each of the pairs chosen as a major, severe or contraindicated interaction, with the exception of the pair that includes the oral contraceptive. That interaction is classified as moderate by Micromedex but major by Medi-Span and severe by First Databank. The prescriptions Writing the prescriptions was Dr. Steven C. Fox, a Chicago physician licensed by the state of Illinois. He wrote the orders in the names of 18 Tribune journalists, 15 of whom conducted tests in the field. Those reporters presented the prescriptions written in their names or, in some instances, their colleagues' names. All prescriptions were for first-time medications as opposed to refills. The test locations The 255 tests were conducted from October 2015 to June 2016. Seven chains were tested 30 times each to limit chance results. No single location was tested more than once. Because fewer than 30 Kmart and Costco stores are in the Chicago area, reporters tested some of these stores in downstate Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. The newspaper also sought to test 30 Target stores but stopped after CVS acquired Target pharmacies during the study. Thirteen tests at Target were completed, and the results are included in the study's statistics. The Tribune chose 32 independent pharmacies for testing at random from a list of locations obtained from the state. All were in Chicago or suburban Cook County. Individual chain stores were not picked randomly, as stores within a large chain generally share the same computer systems and policies. Still, reporters attempted to select chain stores that represented a diverse cross-section of the area. Doing the tests The reporters presented each pharmacy with prescriptions for one of the five drug pairs. Each pair was tested the same number of times at each chain. Most prescriptions were dropped off at the same time; some were presented a couple of days apart. In some cases, the prescribing physician called in an order. Drug orders were not run through insurance. Reporters did not identify themselves as Tribune staffers but used their own names and answered all questions truthfully. The reporters typically waited at the pharmacy for the orders to be filled, taking notes about what transpired from the time they dropped off the prescriptions to when they picked up the medications. In many tests, conversation was extremely limited. Reporters' notes were then entered into standardized data collection forms. All purchased medications were cataloged and stored in a secure location. Reporting the results A pharmacy was considered to have failed the test if its staff did not either attempt to contact the doctor about a drug interaction or orally warn the tester. Information leaflets placed inside the bag or attached to the outside were not considered sufficient to warrant a pass. After the tests, the Tribune called many of the pharmacists to inform them of the results and discuss the findings. Some of their comments are included in the story. The Tribune is not identifying all of the individual stores in its article because each location was tested only once, a sample size too small to draw conclusions about a particular store.\u00a0 ",

Got it By Dustin Waters and Kevin Sullivan December 15 at 6:57 PM Follow @sullivank A jury finds Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof guilty of federal hate crimes resulting in the death of nine black parishioners at a historic church in South Carolina last year. (Reuters) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Dylann Storm Roof, a ninth-grade dropout who learned to hate black people on the Internet, was convicted Thursday of 33 counts of federal hate crimes for slaughtering nine black parishioners at a church Bible study meeting here last year. A federal jury took less than two hours to reach its decision, following a seven-day trial in which Roof, 22, a self-described white supremacist, chose to remain silent and motionless amid a barrage of testimony and evidence so thorough and devastating that his mother, watching from the third row, suffered a heart attack on the first day. \u201cHe executed them because he believes they are nothing but animals,\u201d prosecutor Nathan Williams said in his closing argument, addressing a somber jury that had seen crime-scene photos of all the dead, including Susie Jackson, 87, the oldest victim, into whom Roof had emptied an entire 11-round magazine from his Glock .45-caliber pistol. [ \u2018Evil, evil, evil as can be\u2019: Emotional testimony as Dylann Roof trial begins ] As Williams spoke, a photograph of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney was shown on the screen. The pastor, who had offered Roof a seat next to him at Bible study, was wearing a crisp white shirt and new suit now stained by blood from the five bullet wounds in his neck, back and arm. Roof\u2019s grandmother, sitting in the courtroom while the image was displayed, wiped a tear from her eye. Read the victims\u2019 stories View Graphic Read the victims\u2019 stories Judge Richard M. Gergel dismissed the jury for the holidays and told them to return on Jan. 3, when they will hear prosecution and defense arguments about whether Roof should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without parole. Roof also faces a separate state murder trial in January, which also carries a potential death penalty. Many friends and relatives of the dead attended the trial, in the historic heart of the city where the Civil War began, and many sat with their eyes closed tight as they listened to the verdict. \u201cThere\u2019s no win in this. We still have grieving families, a grieving community. There\u2019s some closure, but there\u2019s no win in this thing,\u201d said Kevin Singleton, 43, whose mother, Myra Thompson, was killed. \u201cWe just want to move forward and put this behind us and try to get on with our lives. Nothing good came out of any of this.\u201d [ Scene in Charleston: \u2018At the end of the day, we are just looking for justice.\u2019 ] But some allowed themselves a moment of gratitude. The Rev. Sharon Risher, whose mother, Ethel Lance, was among the dead, said she was \u201coverjoyed that this part is done.\u201d At the moment the verdict was read, she said, the family members \u201clooked at each other with smiles, like, \u2018Hallelujah, God is still in the miracle-working business.\u2019 \u201d Roof\u2019s guilt in the killings was essentially uncontested; prosecutors showed the jury Roof\u2019s interview with FBI agents in which he calmly confessed to the killings and complained that he was \u201cworn out\u201d after pumping more than 60 bullets into his victims. Prosectors introduced and played Dylann Roof\u2019s two-hour video confession during the third day of Roof\u2019s federal death penalty trial. (U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina) Under federal law, he was charged with hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms violations. He was also charged with attempting to commit those same offenses against two adults and a child who survived. [ The white flight of Derek Black ] His attorney, David Bruck, a death penalty specialist, told the jury he expected them to find Roof guilty, but he repeatedly tried to inject the notion that Roof was mentally or emotionally unstable. He was consistently cut off by Gergel, who said that was relevant only in the penalty phase of the trial. Roof has said he will represent himself during that phase, and Bruck was apparently trying to help his client in advance of that by giving the jury some justification to spare his life. \u201cConsider the mad energy, the rationale, the senselessness,\u201d Bruck said as the prosecution mounted objection after objection. \u201cThe fact that one is a racist does not tell you what else is going on. And what else is going on is what you should be thinking about.\u201d The federal death penalty is rarely imposed; the last time was more than a decade ago. Roof had offered to plead guilty and accept life in prison, but the U.S. Justice Department determined that the circumstances were so egregious that they warranted seeking Roof\u2019s execution. The crime stood as a new and hideous chapter in the long history of racial killings in America. Prosecutors read lines from a journal found in Roof\u2019s car and the manifesto he posted online, and they told jurors that Roof wanted to incite a race war. Prosecutors presented evidence that Roof chose the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic monument known as Mother Emanuel, because of its spiritual and symbolic importance to the black community. [ What happens next if Dylann Roof is sentenced to death ] Roof told FBI interrogators that he \u201chad to\u201d kill blacks because they rape white women; computer records showed that he had researched \u201cblack on white\u201d crime and spent time on white supremacist sites. He said he chose Mother Emanuel because it was the South\u2019s oldest black church and he \u201cknew that would be a place to get a small amount of black people in one area.\u201d During the trial, prosecutors documented Roof\u2019s meticulous planning in the seven months leading up to the killings. Data collected from his GPS showed that he had made at least six trips to Charleston, visiting historic plantations and studying the church. He videotaped himself on several occasions taking target practice with his Glock in the back yard of his home. Photos showing Roof posing with the Confederate battle flag prompted South Carolina officials to remove the flag from the state capitol in Columbia. 1 of 10 ",

    "text": "VA Secretary 'Most Difficult' Position to Fill in Trump Cabinet, Transition Team Official Says By Shushannah Walshe Dec 15, 2016, 6:55 PM ET 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump made veterans\u2019 issues a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. But selecting a leader for the Department of Veterans Affairs will be one of the final decisions to round out his cabinet. Transition sources say Trump is still considering a number of different candidates, from Trump loyalists to retired military officials, ahead of a self-imposed goal of the end of the week to finalize his cabinet. Contenders for the VA job include former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown; Pete Hegseth, the former chief executive of the conservative Concerned Veterans for America; and Adm. Michelle Howard, the first African-American woman to command a U.S. Navy ship. A senior Trump transition official says the president-elect has also interviewed retired Gen. Ann Dunwoody, who served as the Army\u2019s first female four-star general. Hegseth, who is an Army veteran and Fox News contributor, has met with Trump twice, most recently on Thursday at Trump Tower. One senior transition official told ABC News the position of VA secretary is proving to be the \"most difficult\" cabinet position to fill. Trump's pick will be responsible for managing the government\u2019s second-largest department and a national health care system that serves more than 6.6 million veterans and beneficiaries each year. Some veterans\u2019 advocacy groups have expressed frustration that Trump has not met personally with them to discuss the selection, instead meeting with a mix of celebrities and CEOs. \"He's met with Kanye West and Leonardo DiCaprio, but hasn't met with the American Legion or IAVA [Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America],\" said Paul Rieckhoff, CEO and founder of IAVA. Asked about Trump's focus on selecting a VA secretary, transition officials say the president-elect is taking the issue seriously. \"This is an area he cares deeply about, reforming the VA,\" spokesman Sean Spicer said on a call with reporters Thursday. He said that this is \"an area that's near and dear to his heart and one that he really wants to make sure is addressed appropriately, quickly and successfully.\" Some veterans organizations have urged Trump to keep current VA Secretary Bob McDonald in his administration. But a senior transition official says that idea has not been embraced in Trump Tower. \"Transforming an agency as large and diverse as VA will take a continuous commitment from leadership over the course of many years,\" a coalition of 20 veterans groups wrote in a letter to Trump and the transition team. \"As you make your selection for VA Secretary, then, we advocate for an approach that recognizes and builds upon current progress. Given the challenges we face, we cannot afford to start over.\" Trump has proposed making it easier for secretaries to fire VA employees, creating a commission to investigate fraud in the agency and creating a 24/7 White House hotline for veterans' complaints. In interviews, top veterans' advocates say Trump has much in common with McDonald, a registered Republican and former CEO of Proctor & Gamble. \"They\u2019re both businessmen from outside the government that have a different perspective,\" said Garry Augustine, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. \"If he wasn\u2019t already secretary, president-elect Trump would probably be looking at him.\" Bill Rausch, the executive director of Got Your 6, said keeping McDonald would allow the Trump administration to hit the ground running in January to pass reforms with a GOP-led Congress. \"If we bring in a new VA leader who is going to take a year, two years to get up to speed,\" he said. \"We could miss that window of opportunity.\" It\u2019s not clear if McDonald and Trump have been in contact with each other, but those who have spoken to the current secretary said he would consider serving in a Trump administration. McDonald told the Military Times in a recent interview that he has not been approached about serving in the Trump administration. \u201cI have not been approached, and I\u2019m making plans according to that. But service is important,\" he said. ABC News' request for comment from McDonald\u2019s office was not immediately returned. \"I think he would say yes,\" Rausch said. \"His answer has been that he\u2019s a member of the Veterans Party and he\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for veterans.\" 0 Shares ",

By Steven Mufson and Max Ehrenfreund December 15 at 7:08 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @MaxEhrenfreund Conservative television commentator Larry Kudlow is a leading candidate to become chair President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, which is usually run by one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious economists. Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and an adviser to Trump, told a Lansing, Mich. business group Thursday that Kudlow would be named to the post, though Moore later added the nomination \u201cisn\u2019t a done deal,\u201d according to the Detroit News . A person close to the transition told The Post that Trump is trying to find a space for Kudlow, a Trump friend and loyal adviser during the campaign, in an economic advisory role. If selected, Kudlow would mark another un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox pick for Trump. Under both Republican and Democratic presidents, the council has provided expert economic advice to the president and attracts a staff of top-flight young economists. But Kudlow lacks a graduate or undergraduate degree in economics and has not written scholarly papers on the subject. A fervent supporter of deep tax cuts, Kudlow is a senior contributor at CNBC and former host of the cable channel\u2019s primetime \u201cThe Kudlow Report.\u201d While continuing with his broadcasts, he informally advised Trump during the campaign. Like Moore, Kudlow disagrees with Trump about trade and opposes protectionism, but shares the president-elect\u2019s desire to slash tax rates for businesses. \u201cHe should have hammered much harder on his tax cuts,\u201d Kudlow said of Trump\u2019s performance in one of the debates with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s been the Kudlow theory of debates for a long time that no matter what you are asked you give the answer you want to give on the subject you want. Trump needs to learn more about that.\u201d Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far A graduate of the University of Rochester, where he joined the left wing Students for a Democratic Society and majored in history, Kudlow worked as a junior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, then as chief economist first at Paine Webber and later at Bear Stearns. He became associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan. A star in the conservative fermament, Kudlow later advised Jack Kemp and toyed with the idea of running for the Senate. But his career was derailed two decades ago by alcohol and drug addiction, and he took a long leave of absence starting in late 1992 to attend a twice-daily program to help addicts. In recent years, he has become a popular figure on television, but his record as an economic forecaster is full of potholes. Less than nine months before the economic crisis hit in 2008, Kudlow wrote in the National Review that \u201cThere\u2019s no recession coming. The pessimistas were wrong. It\u2019s not going to happen. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that\u2019s a minimum). Goldilocks is alive and well. The Bush boom is alive and well... Yes, it\u2019s still the greatest story never told.\u201d Earlier, in 2005, he made fun of people worried about inflated housing prices, calling them \u201cbubbleheads.\u201d Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet John Glidden Jr., a friend of Kudlow\u2019s since middle school, said that \u201cLarry, most of his life, was a very high-strung individual, very bright.\u201d He added that Kudlow \u201calways wanted to be involved, always wanted to be in the right circles.\u201d In high school at the Englewood School for Boys in New Jersey, Glidden and Kudlow were friends and rivals. Glidden described Kudlow as a civil but \u201cdogged\u201d partner in speech and debate, who could argue liberal and conservative cases with equal cogency. In their senior year, the two played a match for the top slot on the school\u2019s tennis team. Kudlow won. Both boys\u2019 fathers were prominent Republicans in Englewood, successful men who expected success from their sons as well. \u201cI\u2019m the same way,\u201d said Glidden, now a senior vice president at Gates Capital and the mayor of the borough of Closter, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s something we had in common. I think it\u2019s something that was instilled in us, the way we were both brought up.\u201d In the high-rolling and hard-partying atmosphere of Wall Street, Glidden suggested, Kudlow\u2019s desire to be in the middle of action might have led him into addiction. Yet Glidden said his friend has been sober for about two decades and that his experience in finance would make up for his lack of economic training. \u201cHe licked it. I\u2019m proud of him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do a good job. He\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\u201d Kudlow has linked the economy\u2019s performance to moral values, and he has blamed inequality on poor broken families. \u201cIf we stick with what I call first principles, which is morality and ethics, some spiritual guideline which was present at the creation with the founders . . . then this country is unstoppable,\u201d Kudlow wrote in a 1998 book title \u201cAmerican Abundance: The New Economic and Moral Prosperity. \u201cWe are the city on the hill.\u201d Some economists were shocked by the possibility of Kudlow\u2019s appointment, news of which came the same day Obama\u2019s Council of Economic advisers issued its annual report. Created by the Employment Act of 1946, the council last year marked its 70th anniversary, noting its \u201cdistinctive role\u201d in \u201capplying economic theory and empirical research to the often-novel situations in which policymakers find themselves.\u201d The past chairs have included Harvard professor Martin Feldstein, who served under Reagan; Columbia business school dean Glenn Hubbard, who served under President George W. Bush; University of California, Berkeley professor Christina D. Romer, and later Federal Reserve chiefs Benjamin S. Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan. Kudlow, by comparison, has not done any comparable research, though he is much more famous by dint of his television career. William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economic professor and a member of President Carter\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said \u201csince President-elect Trump apparently doesn\u2019t listen to the professionals at intelligence agencies, why should he listen to professional economists?\u201d business ",

    "text": "Florida Seeking Full Recount? Here's the Real Story By ALANA ABRAMSON Dec 15, 2016, 6:25 PM ET 0 Shares Star Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images Florida voters mark their ballots at the Leon County Courthouse on Nov. 8, 2016 in Tallahassee, Florida. 0 Shares You may have seen the headline that Florida is looking to have a full recount after the presidential election . The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially false. Here's what we have found. The story was originally posted December 6 on bipartisanreport.com with the headline 'Breaking: Florida Moves for Full Recount of State Over Massive Voter Fraud (Details)' The headline is false. The story has some questionable reporting. The state has not asked -- and does not plan to ask -- for a full recount The Florida secretary of state has not asked for any sort of recount. Under Florida law, a recount is automatically triggered if the differential is 0.5 percentage points or less of the total votes cast. Trump received 4,617,886 votes in Florida, and Clinton received 4,504,975, a difference of 112,911 votes and nearly 2 percentage points, according to the Florida secretary of state. Otherwise, a court or the Florida secretary of state could order a recount if there\u2019s enough proof of fraud or misconduct to have changed the election results. The secretary of state has not mandated a recount. Three people are asking for a recount Three people are calling for a recount, saying the \"totals in the certification are wrong because of several factors,\" including unaccounted votes, illegal votes and lack of integrity of the voting machines, according to a complaint filed December 2. The suit claims Hillary Clinton would have won Florida if the votes were counted properly. There have been no reported election issues in Florida, officials say The original article didn\u2019t go beyond the lawsuit, but there have been no reported election issues in Florida, according to the Florida Department of State spokeswoman. \u201cWe have no indication of an issue,\u201d spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice wrote in an email to ABC News today. On election night, Secretary of State Ken Detzner wrote in a release, \u201cOverall, we\u2019ve had a very smooth and successful General Election Day here in Florida. We only received a few reports of minor issues from the counties. All the Supervisors of Elections were proactive in addressing any concerns and ensuring all voters were able to vote.\u201d The release from Detzner did cite problems, including the evacuation of a polling location and disciplinary action against two poll workers, but they did not include any of the ones mentioned in the complaint. But since he filed the court complaint, attorney Clint Curtis said he has received over 500 complaints about voting issues on Election Day. Before he filed, Curtis said, a couple dozen had come forward. The website bipartisanreport.com did not respond to multiple requests from ABC News for comment.

    "text": "Lawyer claims link between ex-NY police chief and unsolved Long Island murders By Cristina Corbin Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Dec. 15: A woman, identified only as \"Leanne,\" 30, told reporters during a press conference that former Suffolk County Police Chief, James Burke, paid her for sex. \u00a0(FoxNews.com) The lawyer for the family of a prostitute whose body was found near a suspected serial killer's dumping ground claimed Thursday that a disgraced former New York police chief regularly hired women for rough sex in a home near the scene. Attorney John Ray held a press conference Thursday with a prostitute, identified only as \"Leanne,\" who claims she was paid to have sex with former Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke in 2011. The remains of four prostitutes, each covered in burlap and dumped in thick bramble on the south shore of Long Island, N.Y., along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, were discovered five years ago in a case that remains unsolved. Ray represents the family of Shannan Gilbert, a New Jersey escort whose body was found near the other women and whose death may also have been a homicide. Burke, who reportedly blocked the FBI from investigating key evidence in the murders, is currently serving time in federal prison in a separate case. Burke was sentenced to 46 months for beating up a man who stole sex toys and other items from his car and then later orchestrating a cover-up. Burke has not been named a suspect or person of interest in the Long Island serial murders. \"The allegations against my client don\u2019t warrant a comment,\" Burke's attorney, John Meringolo, told FoxNews.com Thursday.\u00a0 On Thursday, \"Leanne,\" told reporters she met Burke at a party in Oak Beach in June 2011. According to the woman, Burke paid her $400 for \"rough sex\" at the home, a few miles from where the murdered prostitutes were found. The woman claims Burke hired her again for sex two months later. According to an affidavit, the woman claims she observed Burke \"roughly pull a young woman by her hair to the ground\" at the party, which included cocaine. She said in sworn testimony that Burke was introduced to her as a \"a high police official.\" In August 2011, the woman said she met Burke for sex a second time in a bathroom at an undisclosed location. \"He insisted upon oral sex, which was given,\" the affidavit states. She described Burke as \"aggressive\" to reporters and said he called her a \"whore\" before throwing $300 or $400 in cash at her. \"I was a little dehumanized,\" she said. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the Long Island serial killer investigation told FoxNews.com last month that Burke was being eyed as a person of interest in the murders, though the FBI declined to comment on the case. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said federal investigators were questioning Burke's former girlfriends after learning he had a \"violent past.\" This is not the first time Burke -- once Suffolk County's top cop -- has been linked to prostitution. A 1995 internal affairs report by the Suffolk County Police Department shows Burke -- then a sergeant -- had a months-long relationship with a convicted prostitute and drug dealer named Lowrita Rickenbacker, according to Newsday,\u00a0 which obtained a copy of the report . The report claimed Burke once left Rickenbacker alone in his car with his gun belt and service weapon resting on the backseat. The report also said Burke engaged in a sexual act with Rickenbacker at least once inside his patrol car. Despite the report, Burke continued to rise through the ranks of the Suffolk County Police Department -- one of the highest paid police departments in the country. In 2000, Burke was promoted to lieutenant. In 2002, he was named chief of detectives by Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota and, in 2012, he became the Suffolk County police chief. It was the search for Shannan Gilbert that led to the discovery of four other women's remains -- the work of a suspected serial killer. Gilbert, 23, of Jersey City, N.J., disappeared May 1, 2010, after visiting a client in the gated community of Oak Beach on a barrier island off Long Island's south shore. On December 10, 2010, a police dog and his officer stumbled across the first set of remains. In the following days, police found three more women in varying states of decomposition. The women were identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes,\u00a0Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello. They were all sex workers in their 20s found stuffed inside burlap bags along Ocean Parkway, a 15-mile road that spans Jones Beach, roughly a mile from where they would later find Gilbert's body, in December 2011. After the discovery of Gilbert's remains, the medical examiner ruled her cause of death \"undetermined,\" and police theorized she drowned while running through a marsh in a drug-induced state -- calling her death unrelated to the four other victims. But that finding was called into question in March 2015, when Dr. Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, and a Fox News contributor, examined Gilbert's skeletal remains inside a Nassau County funeral home at the request of her family.\u00a0 Baden observed the hyoid bone -- a small horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck -- had a \"rough edge\" on one side, suggesting a fracture. A fracture to the hyoid bone is a hallmark sign of a strangulation. \"The hyoid shows some breakage,\" Baden said at the time. \"If it is a fracture, that would be strong evidence Ms. Gilbert was strangled to death by neck compression.\" FoxNews.com's\u00a0Robert Gearty contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "WATCH Legendary Sideline Reporter Craig Sager Remembered 0 Shares Email Craig Sager never once thought about giving up as he battled cancer for more than two years. \"Man, life is too beautiful, too wonderful, there's just too many things,\" he said in late August. \"It's not just you. It's your family and kids and all. Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can.\" The end for the beloved TNT broadcaster came Thursday when the man known as much for his outrageous wardrobe as his relationships with the NBA's elite succumbed to the disease he fought so hard to overcome. Turner Sports announced his death without disclosing details. He was 65 and had worked basketball games for TNT for nearly a quarter-century. \"There will never be another Craig Sager,\" Turner President David Levy said. \"His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports.\" His son, Craig Jr., posted a loving video tribute to his father, tweeting: \"We packed a lifetime and then some into these 28 years together.\" Sager's passing brought out condolences from every corner of the NBA and Hall of Famer Larry Bird expressed what many were feeling. \"He was as identifiable with the NBA as any player or coach,\" Bird said. \"The league will not be the same without him.\" Magic Johnson echoed those sentiments on Twitter. \"The NBA family lost a legend who changed the way sideline reporters did their job. RIP Craig Sager,\" Johnson said. It wasn't just the NBA community that mourned his passing , with Vice President Joe Biden and Drake expressing sadness at the loss. Sager had two bone marrow transplants with his son as the donor before undergoing a third one from an anonymous donor at the end of August in Houston to fight an aggressive form of leukemia. To no one's surprise, he was characteristically cheerful . \"It really isn't all that painful, not physically,\" he said then. \"I think the hardest toll is mentally and emotionally. I have this thing of positive thinking. I think if you think something is going to be right and you think positive then you feel that way and if you feel that way you'll act that way. I try not to get down.\" Sager announced in April 2014 that he had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, and he missed the playoffs and much of the following season as he underwent the first two transplants. Sager revealed in March 2016 that his leukemia was no longer in remission. He said doctors told him the typical prognosis was three to six months to live. He was overwhelmed by how news of his fight spread and people across the world started talking about the Sager Strong campaign. \"At first was our family's fight,\" Sager said. \"Then because of TV and TNT and people seeing me in the stands and I talk to people and then it got bigger and then that inner circle became an endless world to tell you the truth.\" Sager then started gaining inspiration from everyone who shared their story or reached out to show support. \"They saw that I refused to give up and I refused to give in and that I'm still fighting it and they saw a lot of inspiration in what I was doing,\" he said. \"Now I feel I'm not only fighting for what I want and what my family wants, but for everybody out there who has cancer or will.\" His battle brought out the soft side of Gregg Popovich, the prickly San Antonio Spurs coach with whom he had many memorable exchanges during in-game interviews. Sager never faulted Popovich for his gruff attitude during those interviews, saying \"he's trying to win a game. He doesn't want to talk to some reporter.\" \"Later, he said, 'You're still going to be media on the court, but off the court can I call you and see how you're doing?' I said: 'Heck yes,'\" Sager recalled in August. \"Just keep treating me the way on the court you always do. He said: 'I wouldn't want it any other way.'\" After learning Sager had died, Popovich spoke somberly for close to two minutes before a game in Phoenix. \"A day like this, basketball has to take a back seat, as we all think about somebody who was very unique, very special,\" Popovich said. \"Whether you really knew Craig or not, you got the feeling that he was a very special person in a lot of different ways, and right now I just feel for his family.\" \"He was a way better person than he was a worker, even though he was amazing in that regard. He loved all the people around him and everybody felt that,\" he said. \"The most amazing part of him is his courage ... if any of us can display half the courage he has to stay on this planet, to live every life as if it's his last, we'd be well off.\" Sager sported suits in every color of the rainbow and plenty of shades not found in nature, from teal to fuchsia to magenta. He would match plaid blazers with paisley ties or striped shirts \u2014 all in bold hues. Kevin Garnett once told him to burn an entire outfit. In a 2016 interview with HBO's \"Real Sports,\" Sager recalled how Popovich reproached him for trying to stand out. Sager explained to him: \"Coach, you don't understand. If I'm not wearing bright colors and if I don't feel lively, it's not me.\" Sometimes lost in the glare of his wardrobe was Sager's relentless nature as a reporter. Every time Popovich would give a terse non-answer, an unfazed Sager would pepper him with another question. Sager's persistence was on display at the start of his career, when the 22-year-old found himself in the middle of one of the most famous moments in sports history. Making $95 a week in 1974 as the news director at WSPB \u2014 a Braves-affiliated AM radio station in Sarasota, Florida \u2014 Sager risked getting fired by deciding to hop a flight to Atlanta for a game with Hank Aaron a home run away from breaking Babe Ruth's career record. With a last-minute credential, Sager was stuck in the third-base photographers' well. As the historic homer sailed out of the park, Sager, without thinking, sprinted onto the field and wound up chasing Aaron down the third-base line. When Aaron's teammates mobbed him at home plate, Sager can be seen in his trench coat in the middle of the scrum. The next day, Sager caught a 5 a.m. flight to Sarasota to be back for his morning drive responsibilities, and his tapes from the game wound up in Cooperstown. Sager worked as a reporter on the Olympics, Major League Baseball playoffs, the NFL and the NCAA Tournament, among other sports. But he was indelibly connected to the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver said the \"true original\" was respected for his reporting \u2014 and his inspiring fight. Bulls star Dwyane Wade sold paisley ties during the 2016 playoffs to raise money to combat blood cancers. \"Craig was as vital to the NBA as the players and coaches,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \"Craig earned widespread respect for his insightful reporting and inspired so many most recently with his courage.\" Sager got to cover his first NBA Finals in 2016 through an unusual arrangement between TNT and ESPN, which invited him to join its coverage. He marked the occasion by wearing a blazer with a royal blue floral print. In an interview with LeBron James after Game 6, the Cavaliers star turned the tables to giddily ask Sager a question: \"How in the hell do you go 30-plus years without getting a Finals game?\" He was self-deprecating when asked what the outpouring of support from across the NBA meant to him. \"It means that I'm not just the nuisance that they see on the court when I'm trying to talk to them when they want to be somewhere else,\" he said in August. And Sager loved everything about his job. \"I try to get there three hours before the game, talk with the ushers and the security guards, the coaches and the fans,\" Sager said in 2015. A native of Batavia, Illinois, Sager attended Northwestern, where he walked onto the football and basketball teams, and served as the school's \"Willie the Wildcat\" mascot for three years. He worked at several TV and radio stations in Florida after college before spending two years in Kansas City. Sager joined CNN in 1981 after handling the network's first live remote report during the 1980 baseball playoffs. Sager was in Dallas for a game in April 2014 when he felt ill and sought treatment from Mavericks team physician Dr. Tarek Souryal, who had previously performed Sager's knee surgery. With a dangerously low hemoglobin count, Sager had six blood transfusions over a 24-hour period before returning to Atlanta. After that came the treatments and his public battle with leukemia. Earlier this year, Sager was involved in the television coverage of the NCAA Final Four and had a memorable postgame interview with Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. \"I'm proud of you,\" Boeheim told Sager on air after the Orange lost in the national semifinals. \"I'm really proud of you and what you're doing. You're a fighter and that's something we all should really aspire to be. You're setting an example that we all should be really happy to try to follow.\" Sager replied, \"Well, thank you very much.\" And then the professional broadcaster did what professional broadcasters do - he went to his next question, one about Syracuse's famed 2-3 zone, without missing a beat. \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP freelance writer Jose M.

By Renae Merle December 15 at 1:51 PM Follow @renaemerle NEW YORK \u2014 In what some are calling the \u201cTrump rally,\u201d investors are pushing U.S. stock markets to new heights in anticipation that the president-elect will work with the Republican-led Congress to lower taxes and pass more business-friendly policies. In the five weeks since Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win, traders have rushed into the market, accelerating gains that had been building all year. Their enthusiasm had the Dow Jones industrial average flirting with a record-high 20,000 mark that once would have seemed unattainable in 2016. For now, many are willing to look past potential stumbling blocks that lie ahead for the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve , for instance, is beginning to raise interest rates\u2014it bumped up a key lending rate Wednesday, a move that traditionally has added costs for businesses\u2014and the global economy is bracing for Britain's pending departure from the European Union. There\u2019s also the risk that Trump himself could disrupt global trade with protectionist policies, perhaps stirring a backlash from China. Investors have already learned to beware of Trump\u2019s Twitter account: The president-elect sent shares in Lockheed Martin, and the rest of the defense industry, tumbling after lashing out at the cost of the company\u2019s F-35 fighter jet earlier this week. Boeing, too, has felt his wrath and a pharmaceutical industry that once looked forward to less red tape reeled when the president-elected vowed to bring down drug prices. Even before Trump\u2019s election, some market analysts were warning that stock prices were too high given recent corporate financial results. Specialist trader Mario Picone wears a \"DOW Almost 20,000\" cap as he works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters) \u201cA pullback in this market would certainly be healthy. Trees don\u2019t grow to the sky,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Trump, too, spent much of his presidential campaign raising caution about the rising U.S. stock market, calling it a \u201cbig, fat, ugly bubble\u201d and warning that investors would soon be \u201cwiped out.\u201d (His spokesman said he sold his entire portfolio in June). And yet, as shares have pushed even higher, Trump\u2018s supporters have embraced the rally as a referendum on his pro-business policies, creating ever higher expectations for quick results once he assumes office. Just Thursday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that U.S. builders\u2019 confidence jumped to the highest level in more than a decade. \u201cThis notable rise in builder sentiment is largely attributable to a post-election bounce, as builders are hopeful that President-elect Trump will follow through on his pledge to cut burdensome regulations that are harming small businesses and housing affordability,\u201d Ed Brady, chairman of the trade group, said in a statement. The Dow, an index of 30 large publicly owned companies, has long been viewed as a proxy for the broader market, but its movements can be affected by big swings in individual stocks. About 20 percent of the Dow\u2019s rise over the last month is due to one company that market analysts say could benefit greatly from Trump\u2019s policies: Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street giant\u2019s stock has soared amid expectations that his administration will roll back regulations put in place to rein in the banking sector after the 2008 financial crisis. It hasn\u2019t hurt that Trump picked Goldman veterans to lead the Treasury Department and chair his team of economic advisors. Goldman Sachs has not been the only beneficiary. Virtually every other sector of the market has also felt a lift in recent weeks. Investors are enjoying the ride. Many traders have talked openly about holding onto their shares this year in hopes the taxes they pay on gains could be lower next year. Institutional investors and other big traders, meanwhile, have shifted money out of bonds, a traditional safehaven during economic turbulence, to snap up more stock and ride the momentum. The combined market value of the 500 companies tracked by the Standard & Poors 500 has climbed nearly $1 trillion since Trump was elected. \u201cIt is the difference between investing for a slow-growing economy and investing for strong growth,\u201d said Jeff Carbone, a managing partner for Cornerstone Financial Partners. In nearing the 20,000 threshold, the Dow has staged an improbable recovery in a year that started with massive selloffs as economists worried about China\u2019s rocky economy and falling oil prices, and then panicked when Britain voted to leave the European Union. Now, investors who began the year hoping to just break even are experiencing one of their most profitable periods in years. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t change when the Dow hits 20,000. That is simply a psychological barrier,\u201d said David Schiegoliet, a managing director at U.S. Bank. But \u201cit can\u2019t be ignored because market psychology can be self fulfilling. It could generate enthusiasm that will turn markets even higher.\u201d Much of that enthusiasm appears tied to expectations that Trump will usher in a period of deregulation and lower taxes. Trump has also, for example, that said he would lower the corporate tax rate and encourage companies that currently hold more than $2 trillion in profits overseas, where it can\u2019t be taxed by the Internal Revenue Service, to bring that money back to the United States. Those companies may try to use some of the cash they bring back to pay dividends for shareholders or to buy back their stock, reducing the supply and pushing up the prices for the shares that remain, market analysts said. Lower corporate taxes could also help revive the market for companies wishing to go public, which has languished in recent years, market analysts say. Only about 105 companies are expected to go public by the end of the year, half as many as would occur during a typical year, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of funds focused on initial public offerings. \u201cEverything we see now says that 2017 should be a very strong year for IPOs,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. But there are also warning signs. Twenty years ago, Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller developed a system for determining whether stocks may be overvalued by comparing the stock price of companies listed on the S&P with corporate profits over a 10-year period. A high ratio indicates that stocks may be too expensive, the theory goes. That ratio climbed to 27.9 last week , a relatively high level. But even for Shiller, Trump complicates the picture. When the ratio is \u201chigh like it is now, it suggests that returns will be weak,\u201d he said. But Trump \u201cis a unique political figure and it is difficult to measure his affect on the market.\u201d \u201cTrump seems to have some powers of persuasion, inspiration that have propelled the economy since he was elected,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cIn the long term it might not work out as well, but at least in the short run\u201d it is propelling stocks forward. Even some Trump enthusiasts are beginning to worry the recent market exuberance may be overblown. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn was one of Trump\u2019s earliest and most vocal Wall Street supporters and when stocks initially tumbled upon his election, Icahn left the Republicans\u2019 victory party to snap up about $1 billion in stock, later lamenting that he hadn\u2019t bought more. But now, Icahn told CNN , \u201cit\u2019s gone too far.\u201d \u201cI personally think it\u2019s a little overdone,\u201d Icahn said of the stock market\u2019s rise. business ",

Credit Eric Hammarberg, an engineer at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, for ensuring all that delicate, ornamental plaster on the decorated ceiling of the Rose Reading Room atop the 42nd Street library , which had begun collapsing, won\u2019t fall down. And the former Whitney Museum of American Art on Madison Avenue, rechristened Met Breuer , was also restored. Beyer Blinder Belle, the New York architecture firm, performed an act of thoughtful and immaculate preservation. This once-reviled 1960s building, now with its patina of age, is finally coming to be recognized for what it is: a practical Modernist landmark of exceptional finesse and a surprisingly good neighbor. Photo The Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center at Columbia University\u2019s medical campus near the George Washington Bridge. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times \u2018STUDY CASCADE\u2019 Vagelos Center The Roy and Diana Va gelos Education Center , devised by Diller Scofidio & Renfro (in collaboration with Gensler), is a whimsical 110,000-square-foot exclamation mark on Columbia University\u2019s Upper Manhattan medical campus near the George Washington Bridge. The 14-story tower\u2019s camera-ready face looks south. It presents a cheerfully teetering stack of cantilevered terraces, indoor bleacher seats, lounges and stairs. They spill toward a handsome wood-lined amphitheater linked by steps to the sloping sidewalk. One can picture a giant pinball bouncing from the top of Vagelos and rolling down Haven Avenue. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The architects call this sunny, wide-open south side the \u201cstudy cascade.\u201d Offices and classrooms fill the more conventional north half of the tower, which is clad in a fritted milky curtain wall that\u2019s less striking outside but mitigates solar heat gain. State-of-the-art anatomy classrooms tucked behind the cascade are part of a deceptively pragmatic layout. A restrained palette \u2014 of white, orange and Douglas fir panels stained a burnt sienna \u2014 balances the sculptural gymnastics. The other day I found students poring over their laptops in the ground-floor lounge. Some grumbled a little about minor early-days stuff like not enough electrical outlets, but they all said they loved the architecture. I do, too. It\u2019s what medical schools generally aren\u2019t: playful, welcoming, warm. And when the sun sets, the center becomes a beacon in the neighborhood. Photo The Jerome L. Greene Science Center by Renzo Piano is a nine-story, 450,000-square-foot glass-and-steel hub for neuroscience at Columbia. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times \u2018FACTORY FOR IDEAS\u2019 Greene Center Farther south, Columbia\u2019s 17-acre Manhattanville campus began to take shape this fall with the construction of an arts hub and completion of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center , an urbane glass-and-steel behemoth by Renzo Piano rising beside the aged No. 1 subway viaduct, near the intersection of Broadway and 125th Street. The building is a nine-story, 450,000-square-foot nexus for neuroscience. Four steel-frame glass blocks surround a glassy core with meeting rooms. The basic shape is nothing pyrotechnic, but, as usual with Mr. Piano, the nub is in the details and in the light. A double-skin curtain wall, the two layers separated by a muffling pillow of air, lets light flood in while reducing the rumble of the elevated subway. I write these words inside another of Mr. Piano\u2019s buildings, staring from a glass cubicle through several more layers of glass across a birch-filled courtyard. My colleagues across the court look almost immaterial. The Greene Center engineers even greater illusions of ethereal weightlessness, the layered glass membranes held in equilibrium by a clockwork of steel beams and cables, tinted powder blue. Like church spires, tall twin smokestacks announce the campus from afar, declaring the center a factory for ideas. The industrial nostalgia recalls Mr. Piano\u2019s ship-shaped new Whitney Museum and is clearly meant to substitute midcentury symbols of modern commerce for the usual classic emblems of institutional authority. A plaza stands in for the ancient agora. The center will anchor one side of the evolving Manhattanville project, with its multidisciplinary aspirations, underground passageways for Columbia people and variety of street-level public spaces. These are intended partly to appease angry former residents of the neighborhood troubled by Columbia\u2019s gentrifying expansion, and also to signal that the university is opening itself up. Mr. Piano envisions a kind of Italian piazza, democratic and energized. We\u2019ll see how further development follows through on that promise.

Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times HIGH-WATER MARK Governors Island Several weekends this summer, I hopped the ferry with the family for Governors Island. Back in 2003, the federal government sold the island to the city, which got a derelict former military base that included some lovely historic officers\u2019 homes. Leslie Koch was hired in 2006 as president of the Trust for Governors Island . She enlisted Adriaan Geuze of West 8 , the landscape architecture firm. Ms. Koch and her team spent years just watching how people used the island, seeing what was wanted. They responded with food carts, mini-golf, Adirondack chairs, bike shares, children\u2019s programs and art projects. The last, most ambitious phase of redevelopment was completed this summer: man-made hills (cost: $71 million, half public, half private money). A hill with twisty slides for kids became an instant sensation; another features a sculpture by Rachel Whiteread. The tallest has a killer view of the Statue of Liberty and much of the skyline. Mr. Geuze\u2019s design for the island established a high-water mark for resilient planning, taking into account not just sea rise and storm surges but also social cohesion. Watch the mix of parents and children around the slides, sprinklers and food carts on a warm summer Saturday afternoon. Governors Island is New York as a diverse and joyful city. Mr. Geuze and Ms. Koch, who stepped down this year, deserve medals. Now City Hall has to find tenants to help pay for the island\u2019s upkeep. Big office or apartment towers would undo much of what has been accomplished. Here\u2019s hoping that some venturesome, well-endowed university or cultural institution is seeking a beautiful home. Photo Via 57 West, apartments soaring 467 feet, redrew Manhattan\u2019s western skyline. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times PYRAMID ON THE HUDSON Via 57 West Most rental apartment towers end up vanilla-brick or glass nonentities, invisible at best. Not Via 57 West. No building redrew the city\u2019s western skyline more ingeniously than Bjarke Ingels\u2019s first completed project in New York: a warped, mountainous pyramid hugging the Hudson River at 57th Street. Already filmmakers have exploited it in \u201c Doctor Strange .\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The shape is not a pyramid, actually, but a hyperbolic paraboloid, rectangular on the ground, with a swooping roof-facade, a bit like the billowed sail of a ship, sweeping upward from 12th Avenue to the mast\u2019s peak at the northeast corner of the site, 467 feet high. Looking from 11th Avenue and 58th Street, the 32-story building resembles a spire. From elsewhere, it unfurls, its saw-toothed balconies, angled toward the Hudson, making hundreds of facets in the stainless-steel skin, which shimmer with the changing light. This is a building very much designed outside in, notwithstanding that the Danish Mr. Ingels has trumpeted the nice \u201cScandimerican\u201d stylings of the lounges and handsome oak-and-brick lobby and the community-enhancing function of the landscaped private courtyard at Via 57, which recalls his design for the 8 House in Copenhagen. Sliced from the center of the building, the courtyard leads to riverfront terraces with outdoor grills and a host of indoor amenities. I\u2019ll be curious to know how much this fosters community. The amenities require a fee. Twenty percent of the 709 apartments are set aside for subsidized tenants, in return for which the developer enjoyed the usual tax breaks. Otherwise, Via 57 seems to market itself toward brokers and Westchester doctors who can pay top dollar for the light but sometimes cramped apartments off double-loaded corridors, a hike from the nearest subway. Of course, tenants are also paying for the pleasure and cachet of living in a striking work of architecture. New York\u2019s former planning commissioner Amanda Burden deserves a shout-out here for pushing Douglas Durst, the developer, and Mr. Ingels to cook up something bold at such a conspicuous site. The three of them have given the city a new spectacle. Photo A sour design note in Greenwich Village, where the Metropolitan Transportation Authority built a $180 million emergency ventilation plant in Mulry Square. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times VENTING Mulry Square Fan Plant O.K., I get one Grinch moment, not about the $4 billion shopping mall attached to a PATH station at ground zero or the election of a president who, among other things, believes privatization is the answer to what ails the nation\u2019s infrastructure. No, I want to grouse about one of the sadder excuses for architecture completed this year. You can nominate your own candidate. This one is a kind of sleeper, at Mulry Square, at the intersection of Greenwich and Seventh Avenues, in Greenwich Village. There the Metropolitan Transportation Authority finished building a $180 million emergency ventilation plant. The site is opposite the new St. Vincent\u2019s Triangle Park and AIDS Memorial. Once upon a time, this is where I stood guard as a fourth-grade street-crossing monitor from P.S. 41, the school up the block, until my boss and classmate Trippy West suspended me for reporting late at the end of a lunch period. But I digress. Neighborhood groups, along with the city\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission, acknowledging the necessity for a \u201cfan plant,\u201d pleaded for years with the authority for a design less hideous than a windowless concrete bunker and a few forlorn benches. Transit officials paid no attention. With a chain-link fence around the base and part of a fake-brick townhouse facade, topped by a curtain-rod cornice, the facility seems an intentional slap in the face of every New Yorker who hoped for a structure that, if not actually good, might at least be innocuous. Photo The Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at Greenwich Avenue and 13th Street, from the early 1930s, is an Art Deco gem and a neighborhood landmark. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times It\u2019s also a reminder that infrastructure projects like this were once occasions for civic-minded expressions of architectural ambition. Walk just a few blocks from Mulry Square to the three-story Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at Greenwich Avenue and 13th Street, built during the early 1930s. Its geometric decorations, embossed aluminum doors, limestone frieze, Flemish brick coursing and square turrets make it one of New York\u2019s Art Deco gems and a neighborhood landmark. The contrast between the bunker and the substation can make you weep. But it also proves what a difference good architecture makes, to New Yorkers\u2019 daily lives and to the long-term welfare of the city.

(Photo: Zach Gibson, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama allowed an Iran sanctions bill to become law without his signature Thursday, using a rare constitutional maneuver that hasn't been used in 21 years. Obama's decision to allow the Iran Sanctions Extension Act to become law ends the latest chapter of the debate over his pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, in which world powers agreed to relax sanctions on the Iranian regime in exchange for specific commitments to curtail its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Congress passed the bill to give a future president the authority to \"snap-back\" those sanctions if Iran violates the deal. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said it would give President-elect Donald Trump \"the opportunity to evaluate our policy towards Iran independent of additional interference from the outgoing administration.\u201d But the White House has said the president already has that authority under a separate law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and that the new law was unnecessary but ultimately harmless. \"This is part of a message we\u2019re sending to Congress, and it\u2019s simply this: If Congress does blow up the deal that prevents Iran form obtaining a nuclear weapon, they\u2019re going to have to deal with the consequences, and the consequences are grave,\"\u00a0White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. The White House conceded that it was rare for a president to neither sign nor veto a law.\u00a0\"We find ourselves\u00a0in a situation that I'm not sure we\u2019ve encountered in eight years. The bill didn\u2019t meet the standard of something that the president\u00a0would veto, but it's also not something that the administration\u00a0feels is\u00a0necessary,\" Earnest said. The maneuver is made possible by a quirk in what's called the presentment clause of the Constitution. In a way, it's the flip side of a pocket veto: If the president doesn't sign a bill while Congress has adjourned, it's a veto. If he signs it while Congress is in session, it becomes law \"in like manner as if he had signed it.\" Obama's pocket veto on shaky legal ground, experts say Congress recessed for the year last Friday, but remains in \"pro forma\" session\u00a0\u2014 a kind of skeleton session in which Congress remains open for business, usually to block pocket vetoes and recess appointments. The Iran Sanctions Extension Act had just one provision, extending life of The Iran\u00a0Sanctions\u00a0Act\u00a0of 1996 for 10 more years, until Dec. 31, 2026. It passed Congress nearly unanimously. The vote was 419-1 in the House and 99-0 in the Senate. For Obama, fewer bill-signing ceremonies reflect years of gridlock The last time a president allowed a bill to become law without his signature was 1995, when President Bill Clinton did not sign an annual defense spending bill. Clinton expressed a number of policy and constitutional concerns with the law, but concluded that \"the pressing demands of peace and of our military service men and women compel my approval of this measure.\" According to the National Archives, 28 bills have become law without the president's signature since 1951. During the same time, there have been more than 200 pocket vetoes. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The United States has few options for responding to such hacks. Russia does not extradite its citizens and has shown that it will not easily be deterred through public shaming. At times, the American authorities have enlisted local police officials to arrest suspects when they leave Russia \u2014 for vacation in the Maldives, for example. But more often than not, the F.B.I. and Justice Department investigate and compile accusations and evidence against people who will almost certainly never stand trial. The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. \u201cYou can indict 400 people. They don\u2019t care,\u201d said Robert E. Anderson Jr., who until last year served as the F.B.I.\u2019s most senior executive overseeing computer investigations. The American government divides the cybersecurity world into two categories: attacks directed or sponsored by governments, and those conducted by criminals. But Russian hacking defies easy categorization, American officials say, because the Russian government tacitly supports many private hackers and occasionally taps them for freelance government work. That has complicated investigations and upended the normal diplomatic order. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In May 2009, for instance, Secret Service agents met in Moscow with their counterparts in the Russian Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B. The Americans said they were investigating a hacker who had installed malicious code in the software that some American businesses used to process credit card transactions. The hacker was stealing millions of credit card numbers and selling them in an underground digital marketplace. The agents provided a name \u2014 Roman Seleznev \u2014 and the aliases he used online. His father was a member of the Russian Parliament. The Secret Service had followed his digital trail to Vladivostok, Russia, and they asked for help catching him. Within weeks, all evidence of Mr. Seleznev\u2019s online identity vanished from the internet. Rather than advancing the case, the Russian government had set it back, the American authorities believed. Prosecutors described their blunt conclusion in court documents: \u201cFurther coordination with the Russian government would jeopardize efforts to prosecute this case.\u201d The American authorities were left to pursue Mr. Seleznev by themselves. In another computer crime case, in 2014, the Justice Department shut down two worldwide computer networks that had been used to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting victims. Called Operation Tovar, it was among the department\u2019s most complicated computer investigations and involved intelligence agencies around the world. The target was a 30-year-old Russian named Evgeniy M. Bogachev. Safely in Russia, he watched as the F.B.I. made him a most-wanted fugitive and offered a $3 million reward for his capture. Photo Evgeniy M. Bogachev is wanted by the F.B.I. for his involvement in a cybercrime case in which millions of dollars were stolen from unsuspecting victims. Credit via F.B.I. In that case the F.B.I. was actually able to identify the person sitting at the keyboard. More often, the authorities identify aliases or internet addresses but cannot prove who is behind them unless the hackers get sloppy. In the Seleznev case, for example, the authorities searched a Yahoo email account that was used to register some of the servers in the credit-card scam. Agents found, among other things, receipts for flowers that Mr. Seleznev had sent to his wife. In the D.N.C. case and other election-year hacks, the authorities have concluded that people affiliated with the Russian government are to blame. But even if intelligence officials can identify who is behind those attacks, naming the actual perpetrators is even harder. One senior federal law enforcement official said this week that investigators still had many unanswered questions. If it can be done, naming and prosecuting the hackers would follow a path set in 2014, when the Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army on charges of hacking into American networks. The indictment links the men to specific email addresses and aliases, but does not reveal how the authorities made those connections. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe chance of us ever getting those Chinese guys is about zero,\u201d said Mr. Anderson. \u201cBut it does show them that there\u2019s a change afoot. At least the way we\u2019re looking at it policy-wise.\u201d Criminal charges have more practical implications, too. \u201cIt\u2019s about denying them the ability to travel freely and preventing them from spending their ill-gotten gains anywhere but Russia,\u201d said Leo Taddeo, the chief security officer at Cryptzone and the former top agent in the F.B.I.\u2019s New York computer operations division. \u201cYou\u2019re confining them to a prison that spans 11 time zones that can be a pretty unpleasant place.\u201d ",

Now, they anxiously await his next move Gaby Pacheco, left, and other immigration advocates meet with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2013. Diego Sanchez A group of \"Dreamers\" including Diego Sanchez, second from left, Gaby Pacheco, center left, and Jose Machado, second from right, met with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2013. A group of \"Dreamers\" including Diego Sanchez, second from left, Gaby Pacheco, center left, and Jose Machado, second from right, met with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2013. (Diego Sanchez) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter Gaby Pacheco\u00a0strode into Trump Tower\u2019s\u00a0gilded\u00a0lobby on a mission to\u00a0convince the businessman to back immigration reform\u00a0and\u00a0help young people like her who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Back in that summer of 2013, Donald Trump was just beginning to flirt with a presidential run, and others warned her that he might be using the visit\u00a0for publicity. But she and other Dreamers,\u00a0as the young immigrants are called,\u00a0coveted the star power\u00a0he might bring to the cause. Almost an hour later,\u00a0she and a few colleagues departed\u00a0the surreal encounter with doubts about Trump\u2019s understanding of the issue, an inkling\u00a0of his future political ambitions, and, most oddly, parting\u00a0gifts of chocolates, jewelry and neckties from his famous brands. But they also left with\u00a0a reason for optimism.\u00a0When Trump walked\u00a0his\u00a0young\u00a0visitors to the elevator, he turned and nodded:\u00a0\u201cYou convinced me,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Soon they will know whether they did. Of all of Trump\u2019s\u00a0campaign promises, one of the\u00a0thorniest to navigate\u00a0will be deciding\u00a0what to do with the approximately 700,000 young immigrants who are here illegally, but have been temporarily allowed to work and avoid deportation\u00a0under an executive action by President Obama. Trump made promises to blue-collar voters. Democrats plan to make sure he follows through \u00bb Among the first big tests of his administration will be whether to immediately cancel Obama\u2019s program, allow it to\u00a0gradually expire or\u00a0expend\u00a0some of his political capital to help the\u00a0Dreamers, who have lived in the U.S. most of their lives and\u00a0whom Obama has said are essentially \u201cAmerican kids.\u201d What Trump\u00a0decides may provide one of the clearest signals yet of his commitment to the hard-line\u00a0immigration policy he advocated during the campaign.\u00a0 As a candidate,\u00a0Trump repeatedly vowed to end Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,\u00a0threatening to deport the young immigrants along with the 11 million others\u00a0who are living in the U.S. illegally. As\u00a0president-elect, Trump\u00a0has\u00a0softened\u00a0his tone, saying he wants to \u201cwork something out\u201d for the Dreamers, whose inspiring stories have captured public attention, including his own. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in never-never land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump told Time magazine this month. \"We\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud.\u201d But any leniency by Trump risks blowback from those who\u00a0embraced his tough stance\u00a0against illegal immigration and might view such an accommodation as \u201camnesty.\u201d That includes top advisors and Cabinet picks, not to mention the crowds who still chant \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d at Trump rallies, echoing his repeated campaign promise to erect a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. In Congress, a growing bipartisan group of senators is offering Trump a way out. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) have introduced legislation that would allow Trump to essentially keep his promise to end Obama\u2019s executive action while also creating a new, similar\u00a0program that would allow young immigrants to remain temporarily in the U.S. The so-called Bridge Act\u00a0would give DACA-eligible young people \u201cprovisional protected presence\" for three years, providing work permits and deferring deportations if they continue to be law abiding. \u201cWhat would make America great would be to deal with these kids humanely,\u201d Graham said. Trump and the GOP are charging forward with Obamacare repeal, but few are eager to follow \u00bb Theirs is a carrot-and-stick approach \u2014 nudging Trump toward a compromise while also warning him that\u00a0mass deportations\u00a0of Dreamers would probably be unpopular with lawmakers and most Americans. Obama, too, counseled Trump during their first meeting at the White House not\u00a0to deport Dreamers. For the young people who have gained DACA status \u2014 becoming \u201cDaca-mented,\u201d as they call it \u2014 any disruption in the program would be devastating. DACA provides young immigrants with temporary legal status, which allows them to work, apply for driver\u2019s licenses and travel. Many now have healthcare through their employers.\u00a0All of that would be gone if DACA is terminated. \u201cEverything we worked so hard for,\u201d said Diego Sanchez, 26,\u00a0an immigrant who\u00a0was at the 2013 Trump\u00a0meeting and is now in law school in Miami. DACA permits are currently\u00a0valid for two years, so\u00a0every day some are at risk\u00a0to expire. Many young people are rushing to get them renewed before Trump takes office, but the soonest they can apply is 150 days before their expiration date.\u00a0A backlog has developed, officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of waiting,\u201d said Cesar Vargas, 33, an attorney in New York, who is hoping his own permit, scheduled to expire Feb. 17, is renewed before Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20. \u201cHopefully, it comes before.\u201d For Maria Isabel Vazquez, it\u2019s the ordinary things, like being able to drive, that has made life so much easier since she qualified for DACA four years ago. Most weekdays, after computer science classes at community college in New York, the 20-year-old meets her sister at a bus stop and climbs behind the wheel of the family\u2019s minivan.\u00a0First she picks up their younger sister from school and then she collects her mom from her work cleaning houses. Their dad comes home later from his job as a restaurant cook. On the days she doesn\u2019t have school \u2014 Friday, Saturday and Sunday \u2014 she works 12-hour shifts\u00a0earning $12 an hour as a home health aide, bathing and cooking for an elderly widow she has cared for since 2015. She earned a certificate for the job, and pays taxes.\u00a0 Maria Isabel Vazquez's family depends on the driver's license that DACA allowed her to obtain. Maria Isabel Vazquez Maria Isabel Vazquez's family depends on the driver's license that DACA allowed her to obtain. Maria Isabel Vazquez's family depends on the driver's license that DACA allowed her to obtain. (Maria Isabel Vazquez) But without DACA, all of that could be at risk, costing her the job and the driver\u2019s license that\u00a0much of her  family relies on to work and study. Her DACA permit\u00a0will expire in April, and she is already preparing the renewal \u2014 saving up the $465 application fee. Some immigrants have been afraid to apply for DACA protection, worried about submitting their name, address and biometric fingerprint data as required for the federal government background check. They\u2019re afraid\u00a0the Trump administration could use that information\u00a0to more easily find and deport them. But Pacheco, the Miami Dreamer\u00a0whose 2013 meeting was\u00a0arranged by an advocacy\u00a0organization, hopes the impression the young immigrants made during that visit to his skyscraper will\u00a0convince him to help. She recalled being whisked into his office, where Trump showed\u00a0off his impressive view of the Manhattan skyline. To their surprise, even as they lobbied him, Trump also seemed to be pumping them for information. He peppered them with questions about the upcoming presidential campaigns \u2014 whether Latinos would support Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio for a run. He did not mention his own plans. But as the young people steered the conversation back to\u00a0immigration reform, they noticed many of his questions resembled those they\u2019d heard from ordinary Americans at town hall meetings that summer. Why can\u2019t they just get legal, he asked? If you have enough money, can\u2019t you just hire an attorney and file the paperwork?\u00a0 They emphasized that the U.S. was the only home most of them had ever known. And due to immigration policies\u00a0that give priority to those with family members legally in the U.S. or with special skills, there was virtually no way for Dreamers\u00a0to go back and wait in line because they would never meet the criteria for legal immigration, or could spend many years waiting.\u00a0 Jose Machado, 21, another immigrant who was part of the group and is now a property manager in Miami studying to become a lawyer, said it was like \u201cteaching an Immigration 101 course.\u201d When the meeting ended, Trump rode in the elevator with them to the lobby gift shop. He told them to take what they wanted, helping pick out jewelry, ties and signed copies of his book. Initially they were optimistic that they had won him over. But last summer when Trump announced his candidacy for president, Pacheco watched as he called many Mexican immigrants\u00a0criminals\u00a0and rapists. She felt fooled. \u201cHe\u2019s a salesman,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that then, but now I see it clearly. We went in there and he sold us what we wanted to hear.\u201d Still,\u00a0she and the others remain\u00a0hopeful they made a lasting impression. \u201cTo this day, I continue to hope the conversation we had, the sharing of our stories, it penetrated, it stuck with him,\u201d Machado said. \u201cI still continue to hope that.\u201d Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014 In 2009, a life-threatening rash attacked Becki Conway after she took two drugs a doctor prescribed to her. She came down with a potentially deadly condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the eyes and skin. In 2009, a life-threatening rash attacked Becki Conway after she took two drugs a doctor prescribed to her. She came down with a potentially deadly condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the eyes and skin. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014) Karisa King and Sam Roe Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Dangerous doses: First Becki had a sore throat and cough. Then a rash. Soon, her skin peeled off in sheets. The first symptoms mimicked the flu. Becki Conway had a sore throat, a dry cough and irritated sinuses. But the next signs were more puzzling. A sharp pain radiated through her chest. Her eyes turned red and itchy. It seemed like she was fighting off some strange bug, or maybe it was just the normal exhaustion of keeping up with twin toddlers. Then the scalding rash began. Red spots popped up on Conway's face and neck. The next day, painful sores appeared in her mouth and then her throat. Within hours Conway was in a hospital bed, watching with alarm as the rash spread across her torso, arms and face. The red dots turned into blisters that welted so quickly it looked like her skin was burning from the inside out. No treatment could stop it. Within a day or two she wasn't recognizable. Eventually, the rash covered her eyelids with blisters and attacked the lining of her lungs. Her skin peeled off in sheets. Drug interaction Provided by Becki Conway After Becki Conway took\u00a0a risky pairing of prescription medications, her\u00a0skin erupted in blisters. Less than three days after the potentially lethal rash began, the Michigan woman's face was covered in sores and her skin began to peel. After Becki Conway took\u00a0a risky pairing of prescription medications, her\u00a0skin erupted in blisters. Less than three days after the potentially lethal rash began, the Michigan woman's face was covered in sores and her skin began to peel. (Provided by Becki Conway) Only after it was too late to stop the rash did anyone figure out that Conway had taken a potentially dangerous mix of medications that can trigger the immune system to attack the body's own cells. Drug interactions in which one drug alters the effect of another are a hidden epidemic in America, a decadeslong threat to public health that has been barely acknowledged, let alone addressed. Many interactions involve relatively safe drugs that become dangerous only when taken at the same time. Hundreds of risky combinations involve common antibiotics, blood thinners, antidepressants, cholesterol drugs and medicine to treat migraines, heart problems and high blood pressure. The tragedy is that much of the harm is preventable. The particular drug interaction that hospitalized Conway was identified years ago. But experts estimate that thousands of patients still become sick every year from drug interactions because of errors and neglect by front-line providers of medical care. The result in such cases: Victims and their families are left with few answers, and the underlying safety failures go uncorrected. The doctor who prescribed Conway's medications did not heed a black box warning about a fatal rash that could result from the drug pairing, according to medical and legal records and interviews. The pharmacy that dispensed the medicine did not call her attention to the danger. And as her symptoms rapidly worsened, a string of doctors and nurses missed the connection to the drug combination. Most patients rely on their doctors to protect them, but studies show that prescribers often are unaware of harmful drug combinations or trust that pharmacists have more expertise. Pharmacists, in turn, tend to respect the discretion of doctors. For pharmacists, warning patients about the risky mixing of drugs is one of the major responsibilities of the profession, according to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. Yet when injured patients sue, pharmacies often take the legal position that they have no duty to do so. Pharmacies and hospitals use computer programs to screen for unsafe drug pairs. But those systems trigger so many alerts about potential drug interactions \u2014 including many that pose little risk to patients \u2014 that doctors and pharmacists frequently ignore them. Research has found that some pharmacists are more likely to approve dangerous mixes of prescriptions while working busy shifts. When drug interactions hurt patients, the Food and Drug Administration along with most state medical and pharmacy boards do not require doctors and pharmacists to report cases. Pharmacists and doctors rarely face sanctions unless patients take the initiative to complain, according to the national pharmacy group. \"When you look at it from every conceivable aspect, the system is badly broken,\" said Philip Hansten, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Washington who has studied drug interactions for nearly 50 years. \"It's really disheartening to see people are still dying from interactions we've known about for decades.\" Victim of dangerous drug mix tells her story Becki Conway developed a potentially lethal skin rash known as\u00a0Stevens-Johnson syndrome\u00a0while taking two medications, Lamictal and Depakote, that a doctor prescribed to her. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Becki Conway developed a potentially lethal skin rash known as\u00a0Stevens-Johnson syndrome\u00a0while taking two medications, Lamictal and Depakote, that a doctor prescribed to her. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) See more videos Dozens of legal complaints reviewed by the Tribune described how patients became sick or died from a toxic mix of drugs that was mishandled in nearly every health care setting, from family practice offices and corner pharmacies to specialty clinics, hospitals, emergency rooms and nursing homes. One physician prescribed the cholesterol drug simvastatin to a patient in north suburban Niles who was already taking ketoconazole and cyclosporine because of a kidney transplant years earlier. The potentially lethal mix led to a toxic buildup of the heart medication and left the man\u00a0too sick to walk and requiring hospital care, according to a lawsuit that was later settled. In North Carolina, the state pharmacy board found that a CVS pharmacist had ignored computer safety warnings about combining allopurinol for gout and the kidney transplant drug azathioprine. The 49-year-old woman who took the medications together for weeks grew increasingly ill as her bone marrow failed to produce enough blood cells, leaving her hospitalized, according to pharmacy board and medical records. The interactions don't always set off a toxic reaction. In many cases, one drug makes the other drug ineffective, leaving patients vulnerable to the effects of HIV, cancer and other serious ailments. When Becki Conway sought help, trusted health care providers failed her at nearly every turn, leaving her in a fight for her life. A case of anxiety At 37, Conway was a high-energy mother of five children ranging in age from 2-year-old twin boys to a 17-year-old son. The summer of 2009 was one of the most hectic periods in her life. She and her husband were working full time, installing a new roof on their two-story brick home in central Michigan and preparing to open a pizzeria in a month. Their twins were not yet potty-trained. Making matters worse, Conway was battling an ex-boyfriend in a child custody dispute and had been feeling extremely anxious. She found herself lashing out at her husband and shouting at the kids. Conway worked at Sparrow Urgent Care in the town of Mason, registering patients as they arrived at the clinic. She decided to seek help from a doctor she was friendly with, Thomas Bellinger. The two met for 15 minutes in a break room where employees often chatted, drank coffee and ate lunch, according to interviews and documents in a later court case. Conway mostly talked about her family history, childhood abuse and previous medications. She told Bellinger she had taken medicine for depression years earlier but hadn't taken anything since. He told her he empathized with her and promised to bring her a book on bipolar disorder. Bellinger had practiced family and emergency medicine since receiving his medical degree in 1985 from Michigan State University. He worked at several hospitals and urgent care clinics in Michigan before taking a job at the Sparrow clinic. Minutes after their consultation, Bellinger approached Conway at her desk and handed her two prescriptions: one for Lamictal, the other for Depakote, according to medical records and her legal deposition. Both drugs are used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Lamictal carries the FDA's strongest label, a \"black box\" warning, which highlights the potential danger of combining Lamictal and Depakote. (Chicago Tribune staff) Research on the ability of doctors to identify harmful drug pairs shows that although many physicians consider the issue when they write prescriptions, their specific knowledge about drug interactions is generally poor. In one 2008 study, researchers asked 950 prescribers to classify various drug combinations by severity of risk.\u00a0More than a third of the prescribers answered \u201cnot sure\u201d for half of those pairs.\u00a0For three of the four highest-risk combinations, less than 25 percent of the prescribers correctly recognized that the drugs should not be taken together. Training on specific drug interactions in medical schools is lacking because of time constraints and the vast number of hazardous combinations, said Dr. Alfred George, chair of the pharmacology department at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. Doctors also are not required to demonstrate knowledge of drug interactions to state licensing boards or when seeking hospital credentials, he said. \"New drugs are hitting the market every day, and clinicians rarely have time to read all the literature on the drugs they prescribe,\" George said. Adding to the problem, no list of medications automatically follows patients from one medical provider to another. One physician may not know what another doctor has prescribed. The label for Lamictal warns that the drug's concentration level in the body more than doubles when taken with Depakote. To lower the risk of a deadly reaction, the label advises doctors to decrease the normal starting dose of Lamictal by half when it is combined with Depakote. Physicians may read such warnings but make prescribing decisions at their own discretion. Bellinger gave Conway a prescription for the full initial dose of Lamictal.

This is a story about prescription drugs, the beating of our hearts, cells from hamsters and the promise of big data. How the Chicago Tribune and a team of scientists tackled a serious problem in public health. See more videos In depositions, Bellinger said his diagnosis of bipolar disorder was based on multiple conversations with Conway over a period of months and that his prescriptions were in line with successful treatment plans for other patients. He said he was familiar with the black box warning but assessing the combined risk of the two drugs was difficult because Lamictal also can cause a dangerous skin rash when taken alone. Citing language on the drug label, Bellinger said the extent to which Depakote potentially increases the risk is unclear. He believed the possible risk posed by giving Conway the full dose of Lamictal was outweighed by the danger of giving her a dose that was too low to relieve her symptoms. In her deposition, Conway said Bellinger made a prediction as he handed over the prescriptions: She would feel better by the next day. No warnings Conway faxed the prescriptions to her usual pharmacy at Sparrow Hospital in nearby Lansing, part of the same health system as the urgent care clinic. Her husband, Tim Conway, worked there transporting patients and picked up her prescriptions the next day. No one at the pharmacy called his attention to the potentially lethal drug pair, he said in an interview. No one mentioned that the dose of Lamictal exceeded the guidelines for taking it with Depakote. And no one talked to him about a rash. \"There were no special warnings \u2014 nothing,\" he said. Pharmacists serve as the last line of defense against bad drug combinations. Those who see a potentially unsafe pairing can ask questions of the patient, consult with the physician and ultimately withhold the medications. \"If a patient has a significant drug interaction that the pharmacist should've been aware of and didn't catch, then their license could be affected,\" said Carmen Catizone, executive director of the pharmacy group. Yet pharmacists who are busy, distracted or inundated with alerts may fail to intercept potential drug interactions. Sophisticated software systems automatically screen prescriptions for risky drug combinations and alert pharmacists about the danger. But more than a decade of research shows those systems fail to fully protect patients. The safety checks produce a flood of alerts about a range of potential dangers, including drug interactions that cause only minor side effects. Pharmacists must contend with so many alerts that they can become desensitized to even the most serious warnings and dismiss them. One study found that pharmacists overrode more than 90 percent of alerts, including warnings about some risky drug interactions. Heavy workloads for pharmacists also pose a threat. A 2007 study by University of Arizona researchers found that the risk of dispensing two drugs that could interact rose about 3 percent for each additional prescription filled by a pharmacist in an average hour. The pharmacist who filled Conway's prescriptions, Ryan Hamelin, later testified in a deposition that he handled as many as 80 orders on a busy shift. He signed off on her medications at 6:51 a.m., nine minutes before his overnight shift ended. When a technician entered the two prescriptions into a pharmacy computer, a red screen appeared with a warning that required a pharmacist's review, Hamelin said. The alert noted a potential overlap between the medications, which are both used to treat the same illnesses, but it did not call attention to the drug interaction, he said. Hamelin, who had received his doctor of pharmacy degree a year earlier, said he had seen such drugs paired together previously. He also said he was aware of the drug interaction and the black box warning on Lamictal. But it seemed to him that the doctor had used some discretion when writing the prescriptions, as Bellinger had prescribed initial doses that increased over time. Hamelin trusted the prescriber's judgment, he said. Hamelin said he did not see a need to warn Conway personally about the drug pair. Package inserts that advise patients about drug risks typically satisfy a pharmacist's obligation to warn about such dangers, he said. Hamelin approved the scripts and left work. 'This is not right' That day, Conway began taking the two drugs. She felt better almost immediately. But two weeks later, she felt a tickle in her throat and pain inside her ears. She had a cough and bloodshot eyes. Then she woke up with her eyes matted shut with thick gunk. Conway went to work early to get medication for what she assumed was pinkeye. At the urgent care clinic, Conway told the medical staff about taking Lamictal and Depakote, according to her deposition. She described her symptoms, including chest pains she suffered for a day or so before the episodes stopped. No one realized that the seemingly unconnected symptoms foretold an agonizing condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome in which the immune system attacks the patient's skin and mucous membranes. The cells in the lining of Conway's eyes, mouth and lungs were self-destructing. It was as if some switch in her body had been flipped and nothing could shut it off. An anxious mom sought help from a doctor. He prescribed two drugs that may increase\u00a0the risk of a deadly rash when combined. Soon she was fighting for her life. Exactly how the disease develops is not fully understood, but it is most often triggered by medications. Numerous drugs including Lamictal have been linked to the condition when taken on their own. There is no cure; the best treatment is to stop taking the drugs that caused it. Had Conway's condition been diagnosed, she would ideally have been sent to a hospital burn unit, which is best suited to treat the massive loss of skin as the disease progresses, said Jean McCawley, director of the Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation, a patient advocacy group. Instead, Conway's chest pains became the main concern. A doctor at the clinic ordered X-rays and an electrocardiogram to test for possible heart problems. Both showed normal results. To be cautious, Conway was sent by ambulance to nearby Sparrow Hospital for more comprehensive heart tests, medical records show. Legally blind E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014 Becki Conway can use a tablet if she magnifies the text and holds it close to her face.

She often chats online with a network of other survivors of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014) Conway told the hospital intake nurse that she was taking Lamictal and Depakote. Because Conway's eyes were too inflamed for her to see, the nurse pulled the pill bottles from Conway's purse and noted the medications in a hospital record. The second round of heart tests showed no abnormalities, and Conway was released from the hospital with a suspected strained chest muscle, records show. Her husband came to the emergency room to take her home. After receiving her discharge papers, Conway went to a bathroom to change out of her hospital gown. She glanced at herself in the mirror before getting dressed. On her way out, she caught another glimpse and stopped to stare. Bright red spots had popped up on her face and neck. It looked like someone had thrown red pepper on her. Conway flagged down a nurse and pointed to her face. \"This is not right,\" Conway said, according to her deposition. \"Wow,\" the nurse said. The nurse retrieved a doctor, who examined Conway. But no one connected the outbreak to the two new medications she had reported to nurses and doctors twice that day. The nurse gave Conway a shot of Benadryl and sent her home. Deadly diagnosis Spotting the signs of a dangerous mix of medications can be critical to saving a patient's life. But because the interactions often cause common symptoms, such as low blood pressure or confusion, health care providers can easily miss the clues. \"Drug interactions hurt and kill like nobody has any idea,\" said David Juurlink, head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. Juurlink has treated patients who arrived at the emergency room after taking an antibiotic with certain types of blood pressure medication, which can cause a deadly spike in the level of potassium in the blood. Such a death likely would be attributed to heart disease and old age instead of a drug interaction, he said. After Conway got the Benadryl shot she went home and went to sleep. She woke up at 4 a.m. with painful blisters in her mouth. Her skin rash was turning into red welts. Conway drove herself to the clinic where she worked and was examined by Dr. Kellie Donahue. The doctor asked Conway about her symptoms and any medication she had been taking. When Conway told her about the Lamictal and Depakote, Donahue stopped taking notes and looked up at her. \"I think you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome,\" she said, according to Conway's deposition. Donahue, the first medical professional to notice the dangerous drug mix, explained to Conway that she was suffering from a serious skin rash caused by medications. But even Donahue didn't realize how severe the rash would become. After telling Conway to stop taking the drugs, which Conway had done when the chest pains began, Donahue gave her a steroid shot and sent her home. Conway took a short nap and woke up with blisters spreading into her throat. She called Donahue, who instructed her to go to the hospital immediately. Her first night in the hospital, Conway sat up in bed until dawn researching Stevens-Johnson syndrome on her laptop computer. She'd never heard of the disease. The more she learned, the more alarmed she became. She discovered that, in its most extreme form, many victims die. The biggest risks stem from infections. Drug interactions hurt and kill like nobody has any idea. \u2014 David Juurlink, head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto In the next days, Conway's blisters spread and erupted. Swallowing food was too painful. She couldn't stop coughing and complained that she was struggling to breathe. Her skin began to peel off in sheets, leaving angry patches of exposed flesh that turned black and bloody. Worried about infection, her husband laid down a trail of towels so she didn't have to walk to the bathroom on the hospital floor. He spent the nights at her bedside in a chair. He didn't know what to tell the kids, especially the three youngest. He didn't want them to visit their mother \u2014 her wounds looked too gruesome. He did not disclose his biggest fear, that she might not come home. Conway sporadically roused herself from a stupor of morphine, but mostly she was in too much pain to speak or open her eyes. On Conway's 10th day at the hospital, nurse Kathy Sandoval was assigned to treat her. The nurse had treated one other Stevens-Johnson victim years earlier, but when she walked into the room, she had never seen anything that compared to how Conway looked that day, Sandoval recalled in an interview. From head to toe, only patches of skin could be seen. \"It was red, open, exposed,\" Sandoval said. \"She wasn't gushing blood, but there was blood everywhere.\" Sandoval was afraid to touch Conway. \"She looked like she'd been in a fire,\" Sandoval said. Intensive care Tim Conway Becki Conway was transferred to an intensive care unit for burn victims at the University of Michigan Medical Center after several days of fighting Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Her husband, Tim, took photos to share with family members, who were not allowed to visit her because of the high risk of infection she faced.

Her husband, Tim, took photos to share with family members, who were not allowed to visit her because of the high risk of infection she faced. (Tim Conway) She knew how lethal the condition could be and worried that the sloughing tissue in Conway's lungs and throat might block her airway. Sandoval hovered over Conway's bed watching for signs of distress. That night, at Sandoval's insistence, Conway was transferred in unstable condition from Sparrow to an intensive care burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center, records show. At that point, about 70 percent of Conway's skin had blistered or\u00a0peeled off. She could barely communicate. The next day, an ophthalmologist tried to examine the damage in her eyes, but Conway was in too much pain to cooperate. In the doctor's notes from that day, he wrote that Conway told him she didn't expect to survive. Fighting to live Medical records document the flurry of activity that surrounded Conway at the Ann Arbor hospital. Nurses checked her vital signs at regular intervals. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. The wound care was constant. Every hour, nurses pried open her eyelids to apply drops of medicine. \"They're just trying to keep the patient alive at that point,\" said McCawley of the Stevens-Johnson advocacy group. \"Patients are usually monitored 24/7 with the most intensive care they can give them. ... The reaction has to run its course.\" On Conway's third day at the hospital, her condition improved slightly. She was able to sit up on her own and was taken off contact isolation, which meant that staff no longer had to wear gowns and gloves to enter her room. Over the next few days, the rash stopped spreading and parts of her skin began to grow back. In an attempt to save her eyesight, doctors grafted amniotic membrane onto her eyes to help them heal. She continued to gain strength and looked better. Medication was more effective in easing her extreme pain. The lesions on her face were clearing. Doctors removed her feeding tube and she was able to swallow soft food. Kathy Sandoval Carolyn Van Houten / Chicago Tribune 2015 Nurse Kathy Sandoval, who was assigned to treat Becki Conway at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., said she had never seen anything that compared to the severe skin trauma that Conway suffered. Sandoval insisted that Conway be transferred to an intensive care burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center.

Sandoval insisted that Conway be transferred to an intensive care burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center. (Carolyn Van Houten / Chicago Tribune 2015) After nearly three weeks, Conway returned home with her eyes stitched shut so they could heal from surgery. Wounds were still red and visible on her face and neck. Her twins were too scared of her appearance to sit on her lap, so her husband turned off the lights in the living room and they sat with her on the couch. She held their hands in the dark, tracing the outlines of their small fingers. Unable to see, she learned to distinguish the boys by the shape of their fingernails. Conway spent the next two months unable to open her eyes and later received training on how to walk with the help of a long white cane. In the years since, she has slowly regained her strength, taking long walks and working on home repair projects with her husband. But the trauma left Conway legally blind. In her left eye she can see only shadows and light. By holding a computer tablet close to her right eye and magnifying the text, she can read in limited amounts. She can't drive a car or watch the kids at sports events or read a paperback book. She also suffers stabbing pains in her eyes from nerve damage, leaving her unable to get out of bed on her worst days. She must frequently apply medicated eyedrops because her tear ducts were destroyed. She fights a constant cough caused by her lung injuries. The family now lives in Florida where the high humidity provides some relief for her eyes. Living with the effects E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Because of the eye trauma she suffered, Becki Conway can\u2019t drive a car or watch her children at sports events or read a paperback book.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Conway said her approach to taking medication has changed. \"The general public trusts that what their doctors give them is OK,\" she said. \"They don't question it, but they should question it \u2014 every time.\" In 2012, Conway filed a lawsuit against Bellinger and Sparrow Health System that was settled in 2014 under confidential terms. She and her husband talked about her ordeal in several interviews but declined to disclose the names of the defendants, whom the Tribune identified through court records. Her attorney, Andrea Dalton, said she has handled more than a dozen lawsuits for other patients, many of them children, who suffered from Stevens-Johnson syndrome after taking the same drug combination as Conway. The cases fit a pattern of errors, Dalton said. \"It starts with a hospital or physician error, then there's a pharmacy error and diagnostic errors, and that becomes the perfect storm,\" she said. \"At the end of this is someone who has to live with it for the rest of their life.\" Surviving E.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014) Citing a confidentiality agreement, Bellinger's attorney declined to comment on the case. An attorney for Sparrow Health System said Hamelin, the pharmacist, turned down requests for interviews. The health system released a brief statement saying: \"Sparrow cannot discuss specifics of this case due to the nature of the settlement agreement. But the safety and security of patients is always our top priority.\" Bellinger stopped prescribing the two drugs together after Conway became ill, he said in a deposition. It wasn't worth the risk, he decided. The case did not appear to change anything for Hamelin, the pharmacist who handled the prescriptions. He testified he would not have a problem filling the same order again. ",

    "text": "Craig Sager, on the sidelines of the 2016 NBA Finals. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Craig Sager, on the sidelines of the 2016 NBA Finals. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images NBA sideline reporter Craig Sager, a broadcaster nearly as famous for his wardrobe as for his basketball knowledge, has died at the age of 65. Sager had been very public about his diagnosis of leukemia. \"There will never be another Craig Sager,\" David Levy, president of Turner Broadcasting, said in a tweeted statement . \"His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports.\" \u2014 TurnerSportsPR (@TurnerSportsPR) December 15, 2016 The network also posted a video on Facebook commemorating Sager's career. Sager spent two decades covering pro basketball on TNT, work that earned him an induction into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. And during his time on the sidelines, Sager had no problem standing out. Argyle, paisley, floral, seersucker \u2014 name any pattern of fabric, and Sager wore a suit made from it. \"That's always been a badge of honor for Craig,\" says his TNT colleague Ernie Johnson. \"You say, 'You can't possibly wear that.' It's like, 'Hey thanks, you couldn't have said anything nicer to me.' \" Article continues after sponsorship Sager had charisma and unmatched rapport with players. Even when players like future Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett stopped live interviews to insult his brightly colored suits \u2014 \"take this outfit home and burn it,\" Garnett once told him \u2014 Sager was capable of turning those moments into compelling television. In the world of basketball, Sager's name towers nearly as high as LeBron James'. He was among the first to interview Kobe Bryant at the NBA draft in 1996. He joked with Shaquille O'Neal on the sidelines at All-Star games. And LA Clippers point guard Chris Paul always made time for Sager \u2014 even after tough losses. \"When you see Craig, you pep up,\" Paul said once. \"Because you know that he has the same respect for you that you have for him.\" Doris Burke, a sideline reporter with ESPN, shares that admiration. \"There's a saying in basketball: Game recognize game. There's a reason Craig Sager is beloved, and it's the beauty and the magic of what Craig Sager does,\" Burke says. Sager's career started in April 1974, when he was a 22-year-old from Batavia, Ill., who rushed to an Atlanta Braves baseball game. Hall of Famer Hank Aaron was one hit away from breaking Babe Ruth's untouchable home run record, and Sager wanted to cover it for his AM radio station. Sports Reporter Stands Out From The Sidelines He didn't have press credentials, and his boss had threatened to fire him if he showed up late the next day. But Sager went anyway. Somehow, he wound up in the third base photographer's pit on that historic night \u2014 just as Aaron went to bat in front of a roaring crowd. It was one of the biggest moments in baseball history, and Sager did the unthinkable: He got his tape recorder, jumped onto the field and chased after Aaron. It's a dogged determination that never left Sager, even after he switched to basketball and spent decades on NBA sidelines. And those outlandish suits? Well, as Sager told Weekend Edition Sunday host Rachel Martin in 2012, he never minded the ribbing he would get from Garnett and others. He had another audience in mind. \"Some people maybe think it's too outlandish, but I have fun,\" he said. \"I buy it all myself. I pick it all out myself. I once in a while get some help from my 7-year-old daughter. Some people might not like it; my 7-year-old, she likes it.\" ",

Then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey was alerted to the attack by an early-morning phone call from the Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Mike Rogers.\u00a0 Now retired, Dempsey told CBS News in an exclusive interview that the attack was proceeding at an alarming speed. Within an hour, hackers had seized control of the unclassified e-mail system used by the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff, the organization of some 3,500 military officers and civilians who work for the Chairman. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey tells CBS News the Pentagon was the target of a 2015 cyber attack by Russian hackers.\u00a0 CBS News In that time, the hackers seized the computer credentials of Dempsey and hundreds of other senior officers  -- the passwords and electronic signatures they used to sign on to the network. The only way to stop the attack was to take the network down.\u00a0 The attack, which officials now blame on Russia, began with 30,000 e-mails sent to a West Coast university. Of those 30,000, four were forwarded to members of the Joint Staff and one was opened -- allowing the hackers in.  Since it was an unclassified network, the attack had no real intelligence value. It was not spying, but a full-on assault whose only apparent purpose was to cause damage and force the Pentagon to replace both hardware and software, which took about two weeks to accomplish.

REUTERS The motive for the attack was believed to be Russian anger at economic sanctions orchestrated by the Obama administration in response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine. Cyber attacks have come to be known as weapons of mass disruption, and it is now clear that Russia has used them not just to meddle in U.S. elections -- but to do harm to the American military.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
