Norman Green, a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a temporary staffing agency, is photographed Dec. 6, 2016, at his Chicago home. The suit against Personnel Staffing Group, known as MVP Staffing, accuses the agency and several clients of discrimination and seeks class-action status. (Kristen Norman / Chicago Tribune) Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A group of African-American men filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Chicago federal court alleging systematic discrimination by a temporary staffing agency and several of its clients they say passed over black applicants in favor of Hispanic workers. The lawsuit against Personnel Staffing Group, which does business as MVP Staffing, is seeking class-action status. The clients named as defendants are Blommer Chocolate Co., Segerdahl Graphics, Mercury Plastics, MPS Chicago (which does business as Jet Lithocolor), The Penray Cos., ARI Packaging and Lawrence Foods. The alleged discrimination took place at MVP Staffing's Cicero branch office, which the lawsuit claims was directed by clients not to send African-American workers to their companies for assignments. Those wishes allegedly were communicated using code words, according to testimony from former dispatchers and on-site representatives given in prior cases and attached to the filing as evidence. For example, according to the lawsuit, \"guapos,\" which translates to pretty boys, would be used to refer to African-Americans to suggest they don't want to do dirty work. The terms \"feos\" (translated to mean \"dirty ones\"),\" \"bilingues\" (bilinguals) and \"los que escuchan La Ley\" (referring to people who listen to Spanish-language radio station La Ley) were used to refer to Hispanic laborers, the lawsuit alleges. Christopher Williams of Workers' Law Office, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, said such a model is prevalent in the fast-growing temporary staffing industry, where competition between agencies puts pressure to keep wages low. An immigrant-dominated workforce, with language barriers and legal status concerns, is less likely to complain about failure to pay overtime, workplace injuries, wage theft or overwork, according to Williams. He described dozens of white vans that pick people up in the Little Village neighborhood, populated mostly by Mexican immigrants, and drive them to the suburbs for jobs, while black applicants will show up early at the agency office and wait all day before being told there's no work. \"They get up early, they make their way there, they get there on the promise that there might be work for them,\" Williams said. \"And they watch as it changes from a very mixed room in the morning to mostly African-Americans left in the afternoon.\" Williams, who has filed several federal discrimination lawsuits against individual companies before Tuesday's class action, said the complaints have spurred some staffing agencies to hire more African-Americans, but cultural issues inside the companies create a revolving door. Because of the emphasis on Hispanic recruiting, often the company plant managers and assembly line leaders are Hispanic as well, and \"they didn't want them there,\" Williams said. A person who answered the phone at MVP Staffing said no one was available to comment. None of the other companies named as defendants in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment. In Illinois, the unemployment rate among blacks, at about 14 percent, is nearly three times that of whites (5 percent) and nearly twice that of Hispanics (7.8 percent), according to a May report from the Economic Policy Institute, which at the time said Illinois had the highest black unemployment rate in the country. Williams, who has spent most of his career focused on immigrant workers' rights, said he sees the devastation of joblessness in black communities where there are already barriers to employment, such as criminal records, that leads to \"a level of desperation.\" \"These (temp) jobs are the entry level to the entry-level jobs,\" Williams said. \"They would be perfect for this class of people who make up the extremely large population (of people with criminal records) and they end up being denied these jobs.\" Norman Green, one of the five plaintiffs, said he has felt the discrimination at MVP and other staffing agencies in Chicago. He described arriving at the agency early, around 4 or 5 a.m., with his steel-toe boots on and ready to work, signing his name at the top of a check-in paper. He said he would sit for hours and wait while Hispanics would arrive and be sent out to work sites right away. But the agencies would tell him to come back, he said, so he would borrow from money from friends and family to make the trip and get there early only to sit and wait again. \"A lot of black people just sitting there mad that they can't work,\" said Green, 33, who lives in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. When he has gotten jobs he feels everyone is talking about him in Spanish, and \"it's just uncomfortable.\" Green said the pattern, based on the perception that blacks don't want to work, is \"clear-as-day racist\" and unfairly applied to him even though \"every time I walk into a temp agency I work my butt off.\" Green, who has eight kids, seven of whom live with him, said he lost faith in the temp industry and instead supports his family doing construction and other manual work for family members. In an exhibit attached to the lawsuit, former MVP dispatcher Rosa Ceja testified that she had been yelled at by representatives of client companies when she assigned African-American workers to jobs and was warned by MVP managers and owners not to send blacks because MVP could lose the account if they did. Another MVP employee, Pamela Sanchez, who worked as an on-site manager at a bakery named in a prior lawsuit, said in an exhibit that she was instructed directly by bakery employees not to send black workers and to \"DNR\" (Do Not Return) them on the rare occasions she did. She said she would review lists of laborers to be sent to a shift and if a name didn't sound Hispanic, she would cancel them, even once they had already been assigned, because she knew they would be rejected. She added that she was told to have black applicants complete criminal backgrounds disclosures but not Hispanics. Williams estimated there could be 8,000 to 10,000 potential class members for Tuesday's lawsuit. Andrew Wells, director of workforce development at the Chicago Urban League, said he believes hiring discrimination plays \"a fairly big role\" in persistently high black unemployment, which he links to high crime rates. \"You see so much chaos and violence in the community, that's because you're seeing so many people not working,\" said Wells, who is not connected to the complaint. Wells said spotlighting discriminatory patterns is one step toward starting conversations across sectors \u2014 government, nonprofit and private \u2014 about how to address the problem. His organization also helps people build workplace skills, buy homes, rebuild credit and start their own businesses that employ people from the community. \"People should be employed based on their ability to do the job, their talent,\" Wells said. The lawsuit comes during a heightened debate over immigrant labor as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office with promises of restoring American jobs. Williams said there are plenty of jobs for everyone as the temp industry continues to expand, but hiring needs to be fair and better reflect the population that is applying. Currently about 70 percent of the population around the Cicero office is Hispanic and 30 percent is African-American, but 98 percent of job placements go to Hispanics, he said. \"If we can shift the balance, our hope is that the jobs continue to be available to anyone in the community who wants to work,\" he said.

(Photo: Adam Nadel, Associated Press) Rashaan Salaam, winner of the 1994 Heisman Trophy and a first-round NFL draft pick in 1995, was found dead shortly before 9 p.m. Monday night at a park in Boulder, Colo., a Boulder police spokeswoman said. His mother, Khalada, told USA TODAY Sports Tuesday that police said they suspect it\u2019s a suicide after finding a note. \u201cThey said they found a note and would share that with us when we get there,\u201d Salaam\u2019s mother said. The police spokeswoman said the cause of death is still under investigation. She said there is no indication of foul play and no threat to the community. A 911 call Monday night reported a body found in Eben G. Fine Park in Boulder, later identified as Salaam, 42, who starred at running back for the University of Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big trip. That\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Salaam\u2019s mother said. \u201cWe just found out this morning, and we\u2019re going to Colorado to take care of him.\u201d She said the family hopes to bury him in Boulder because \u201che liked it there and was successful there, and he liked the people there.\u201d Salaam, who is from San Diego, led Colorado to one of the most charmed football seasons in its history in 1994, when he rushed for 2,055\u00a0yards and helped the team finish No. 3 nationally with an 11-1 record. He was beloved by the CU community and was among many CU alumni who took special pride this year in the football program\u2019s revival as winners of the Pac-12 Conference South Division. \u201cCU starting winning this year, too,\u201d Salaam\u2019s mother said. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d The Chicago Bears selected Salaam in the first round of the NFL draft in 1995. \u00a0He rushed for 1,074\u00a0yards and 10 touchdowns during his rookie season, but he soon was slowed by injuries and his\u00a0production fell off after that. He\u00a0was out of the league a few years later. The last post on his Facebook page dated Nov. 27 includes a video of Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston and Dionne Warwick singing the song \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d In the post, Salaam noted he was \u201cfeeling joyful\u201d and told people to \u201ckeep smiling.\u201d Followers since have posted condolences underneath it. News of his death shook the CU community Tuesday as many remembered Salaam's slicing runs in 1994 on a team that might be one of the greatest not to win a national championship. It included standout quarterback Kordell Stewart and star receiver Michael Westbrook, who combined for a legendary Hail Mary pass that season to beat Michigan as time expired. It also featured a\u00a0stellar offensive line that Salaam often credited for his success. Salaam scored a school-record 24 touchdowns that season and rumbled off a string of nine straight 100-yard games. He rushed for 317 yards in a 34-31 win at Texas a week after the miracle win in Michigan. \"He had a happy heart,\" former Colorado coach Bill McCartney said in a statement on the CU athletics website. \"I loved being around him. He didn't take himself too seriously, and he always credited those around him, especially his offensive line. What I liked about him is that he had a sparkle in his eye. He was upbeat and positive.\" Salaam turned pro after that magic\u00a0'94 season, his junior year. He spent three seasons in Chicago, going a long way in a short time after leaving La Jolla Country Day School in San Diego, where he played eight-man football. After football, he eventually returned to Colorado, where he will always be revered as the great No. 19. \"This is a sad day for the entire university community as we mourn Rashaan's death,\" CU Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano said in a statement on the CU website. \"Rashaan will be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever wear a Buffs uniform, and his 1994 Heisman Trophy brought great prestige and honor to the university. We send our deepest condolences to his family and friends.\" Follow reporter Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer .

Flynn, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be national security adviser , Michael G. Flynn, resigned from the Trump transition team Tuesday, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported. He offered his resignation when it became clear that he was becoming a significant distraction and his position helping his father was no longer tenable. Flynn the younger was given the distinct impression that his tweets on fake news had become problematic and the transition did not intend to expend the energy or political capital necessary to defend him. He did scheduling things for his father and other tasks, but senior transition \u200eofficials don\u2019t know the extent of his work for his father. But he had quickly become a problem that was going to be solved immediately: he resigned before he was fired. Possibly seconds before, Garrett reported.\u00a0 The Trump transition team told reporters Tuesday only that Michael G. Flynn is not working with the transition. Michael G. Flynn could be seen attending at least a couple of meetings at Trump Tower with his father -- he\u2019s shown standing behind his father in photos like this one: Retired Lt.

His tweet came after a a man named\u00a0 Edgar Welch showed up over the weekend at the pizzeria armed with an assault-style rifle so that he could investigate the story for himself.\u00a0 Michael G.

    "text": "OPEN Interactive Graphic While insurers say they do not plan to fight the Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal the law, they are in no hurry to see it unwound. And Ms. Tavenner said the industry would support a delay so it could prepare for the changes. \u201cWe would love to see a three-year time frame, as long as possible,\u201d she said. The marketplaces, now three years old, have not become as robust as expected by many of the people behind the Affordable Care Act. Even President Obama, who pushed the law and the marketplaces through Congress, has suggested some improvements. Some of the largest insurers, like UnitedHealth and Aetna, have stopped selling policies on some of the state marketplaces after losing hundreds of millions of dollars, and other insurers say they are still debating whether to stay in the market. Many have raised their premiums sharply. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tavenner acknowledged that the current law \u201cneeded to be improved.\u201d But she emphasized that there was widespread agreement among Republicans about the need for some the law\u2019s provisions, including covering people with expensive medical conditions. President-elect Donald J. Trump has also signaled his support of this popular provision. \u201cThere are common starting platforms,\u201d she said. Ms. Tavenner did not give many details about her group\u2019s positions, but she said its top priority was to stop the immediate threat of eliminating the subsidies for plans sold to low-income people. House Republicans have already sued to block these payments, and the lawsuit is now delayed. If the new administration chose not to defend the lawsuit, the money would disappear, and insurers would probably rush to the exits because fewer potential customers would be available. Another of the industry\u2019s concerns is ensuring that enough young and healthy people sign up to stabilize the market. Republicans have discussed eliminating one of the law\u2019s main tools, the so-called individual mandate, a tax levied on those who do not enroll. In talking with Congress, Ms. Tavenner said, her members are emphasizing the need for some alternative, especially after criticism by insurers that the penalty is not large enough to persuade enough people to enroll. \u201cThere\u2019s not one magic solution,\u201d she said. She pointed to some of the provisions in Medicare that encourage people to sign up before they become sick. And she discussed some options to ease how insurers price their policies to be able to offer plans that are less expensive to younger people. She also argued that the insurers had no desire to return to the time before the law was passed, when people with pre-existing conditions were routinely denied coverage in the individual market. Still, the industry seems willing to embrace some of the ideas being discussed by Republicans, including giving individuals more choices of plans and more accountability for the cost of their health care. Republicans also seem eager to put the states in charge of some of the details of how coverage in both the individual market and Medicaid will look. Ms. Tavenner said the industry had a long history of working with state insurance regulators. Republicans are discussing other ways to stabilize the market, including the creation of high-risk pools, where people with expensive medical conditions might be covered, bringing down the coverage costs for everyone else. \u201cWe would hesitate to rush back to that,\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. In the past, those programs, typically run by the states, have not been adequately funded, she noted. The insurers are also beginning to discuss a potential overhaul of Medicare, pushed by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who favors so-called premium support, or vouchers, as a way for people to find coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re not big fans of that approach,\u201d said Ms. Tavenner, although she said the industry would be open to discussing it. Ms. Tavenner said the industry wanted to know more about what the Republicans were planning, including information on the fate of the Medicaid expansion under the law. \u201cWe still have more questions than answers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disrupt individuals who are relying on our coverage,\u201d she said.

Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi leaves a  Catholic hospice in Cesano Boscone on May 9, 2014, after serving his first day of community service for tax fraud. Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images He was a flamboyant, alpha-male billionaire who said things no career politician ever would \u2014 someone who promised to use his business savvy to reform the system and bring back jobs. Voters believed that his great wealth insulated him from corruption, because he couldn't be bought. But his administration was marked by criminal investigations and crony capitalism. Italian Prime Minister Silivo Berlusconi was \u2014 until Donald Trump came along \u2014 the best known example of a certain type of wealthy businessman who decides to go into politics, promising that, as an outsider, he is uniquely qualified to shake up the system, says Darrell West , vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Trump's Loans From Troubled German Bank Pose Conflict Of Interest \"Most of the time, they win, and for exactly the same reason that Trump did, which is [that] people like business people. They think they know how to create jobs and run the economy. It's a kind of white-knight phenomenon,\" West says. In the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Bidzina \"Boris\" Ivanishvili formed his own political party and was elected prime minister in 2012 after the sitting leader threatened to join NATO, West notes. At the time, Ivanishvili was worth more than $5 billion, about a third of his country's annual economic output. Other immensely wealthy people who have been elected to office include Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , as well as regional and local politicians in Austria, France, Australia and the Philippines. Many of these politicians succeed by assembling unconventional coalitions and displaying a willingness to think outside the box, West says. But in some cases, their immense wealth can become a problem. \"Over time, people notice that they're not separating their personal businesses from the government,\" West says. \"There is corruption. Their friends are getting rich. And by the end, they almost always suffer a big fall in popularity.\" Enlarge this image Thailand's deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra (left) and his wife Pojaman greeted supporters on arrival at a court in Bangkok in July 2008.

He was convicted on conflict of interest charges and lives in self-imposed exile. Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty Images Berlusconi came to office bragging that his wealth made him incorruptible, says Alexander Stille , author of The Sack of Rome: How a Beautiful European Country with a Fabled History and a Storied Culture Was Taken Over by a Man Named Silvio Berlusconi. But the Italian leader had a history of bribery and corruption, and his business interests were a lot more tenuous than anyone knew, Stille says. Article continues after sponsorship Once elected, Berlusconi set about trying to derail investigations into his conduct by rewriting Italy's penal code and giving immunity to business associates. He even made sure members of his defense team were elected to parliament, Stille says. \"It was a situation where the conflict of interest was massive and entered into some of the most important business of the Italian state,\" Stille says. Despite numerous corruption investigations and trials, Berlusconi clung to power for nine years total, resigning in 2011 after his party lost a parliamentary majority. He has since been convicted of tax fraud and abuse of power, though the latter conviction was subsequently overturned. The Berlusconi case illustrates what happens when politicians can pursue policies that benefit them financially, and underscores the need to set up strong firewalls between elected leaders and their business interests, says Meredith McGehee of Issue One , a group that works to get money out of politics. \"Those places where you've had these kinds of businessmen as leaders and they have not taken steps to take care of these conflicts \u2014 their administrations have become bogged down in scandal,\" McGehee says. Trump Sold Stocks In June, Lifting Some But Not All Conflicts Of Interest It also highlights some of the problems that could face President-elect Trump, who has said he will \"separate\" from his business operations, but so far provided no details. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said Tuesday that the president-elect sold all his stock holdings back in June. A federal disclosure form Trump filed in May suggests his shares were worth in the tens of millions of dollars, a fraction of his multi-billion-dollar fortune, which is largely made up of commercial real estate and golf courses. Trump's business holdings are widely expected to become an ethics minefield, presenting the new chief executive with numerous conflicts of interest . McGehee notes that the United States has often held itself up as a paradigm of clean government, lecturing other countries about the need for strong bribery laws and an independent legal system. Even the appearance of conflict of interest by the Trump administration threatens to undermine that, she says. \"The United States has been the shining light on these issues and has been respected around the world for how you deal with these conflicts,\" she says. \"And I would hate to see us lose that leadership.\" ",

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama speaks on counterterrorism at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa on Tuesday. (Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama gave an optimistic assessment of the campaign against terror across North Africa and the Middle East on Tuesday, thanking U.S. troops for their help in \"breaking the back\" of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In his last major foreign policy address of his presidency, Obama urged Americans to \"put the terrorist threat in perspective,\" and reject torture, unlimited detention and heightened scrutiny against Muslim Americans\u00a0\u2014 all hallmarks of President-elect Donald Trump's counter-terrorism policies. \"The terrorist threat is real and it is dangerous,\" Obama told a crowd that included special operations troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. But unlike fascism and communism, today's extremists are do not threaten the world order.\u00a0\"They are thugs and they are murderers and they should be treated that way.\" While noting that he will be the first president to serve two full terms in a state of war,\u00a0Obama\u00a0laid out a detailed defense of a his military strategy. It was a doctrine doctrine that avoided large-scale military deployments in favor of more targeted actions to support foreign troops fighting terrorists.\u00a0\"It demonstrates a shift in how we have taken the fight against terrorists everywhere,\" Obama said.\u00a0\"Instead of trying to mount invasions wherever terrorists appear, we've built a network of partners.\" But while Obama touted the withdrawal of 180,000 troops from Iraq and Afghanistan since taking office, a report Obama sent to Congress Monday shows that he has been unable to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Africa and the Middle East. The unclassified version of his semiannual war powers letter outlined\u00a019,996 combat troops he's authorized in hot spots from Afghanistan to Cameroon to Kosovo \u2014 1,579 more than just six months ago. There are 1,352 troops scheduled to depart Afghanistan by Jan. 1, however. White House aides said the speech had been planned since before the election, and Obama did not mention his successor by name. But Obama's\u00a0final foreign policy speech provided a clear contrast with President-elect Donald Trump's more bellicose approach to fighting terrorism. \"Staying true to our traditions as a nation of laws advances our security as well as our values,\" he said. He argued that the United States should continue to ban the use of torture, close the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, and \"deal with suspected terrorists through our justice system.\" Obama has been unable to make good on his eight-year promise to close Guantanamo Bay because of Congressional restrictions on transferring prisoners to U.S. soil. After transferring scores of detainees to third countries \u2014 including one to Cape Verde on Sunday \u2014 the prison now holds 59 suspected terrorists captured during the early days of the war on terror. \"Until Congress changes course, it will continue to be judged harshly by history,\" he said, calling the prison \"a\u00a0blot on our\u00a0national honor.\" Obama also urged a more democratic and transparent use of presidential war powers, calling\u00a0on Congress to update its 2001 authorization to use military force to adapt it to today's threat. \"Democracies should not operate in a state of permanently authorized war,\" he said. The speech comes the day after Obama laid out the legal justifications for how he's prosecuted the war on terror in a 66-page report that revealed how his administration has claimed broad powers to fight the war on terrorism. In a presidential memorandum to national security agencies, he encouraged them to report annually on the legal justifications on their actions into the next administration. 89 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 53 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hb3KLV ",

Alison Yin/Invision for Nintendo/Facebook hide caption toggle caption Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., as seen in 2015. Alison Yin/Invision for Nintendo/Facebook Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube say they are creating a database to keep track of terrorist recruitment videos and other terror-related images that have been removed from their services. In a joint statement posted by Facebook on Monday, the company said: \"Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of 'hashes' \u2014 unique digital 'fingerprints' \u2014 for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. \"By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\" The collaboration will allow companies to cross reference videos and pictures that show up on their services with a database of those that have already been removed from other services. For example, if a video glorifying violence in the name of the Islamic State has been removed from Twitter, it will be assigned a unique \"fingerprint\" which will be stored in the database. If the same video shows up on Facebook, Facebook will be able to match the video and, if it chooses, to remove it. Article continues after sponsorship The choice about whether to remove such content falls to the companies, although videos and images related to terrorist or extremist organizations can also be pertinent to law enforcement. As we have reported , identifying what is, or is not, terrorist imagery can be challenging for tech companies. For example, last year Facebook removed (at least temporarily) a parody photo posted by journalist Sultan Al-Qassemi depicting a rainbow pride filter over a picture of the leader of ISIS. Another Facebook user had taken it literally, and flagged it for containing \"graphic violence.\" It was unclear whether the photo was permanently removed by the company. Twitter said earlier this year that it had \"increased the size of the teams that review reports,\" and suspended more than 125,000 accounts since mid-2015 \u2014 that number has since grown to about 360,000 \u2014 for what it called connections to terrorist or extremist groups. But NPR's Aarti Shahani reported that Twitter noted there's no \"magic algorithm\" to identify terrorist content on the Internet, and that it was forced to decide who to ban based on \"very limited information and guidance.\" ",

The car was driving fast, but not so fast as to draw attention. That was essential. The lives of the two men in the front seat depended on their ability to keep a low profile and pass through undetected. In the passenger seat, Khaleel Al-Dhaki was focused on the secret mission he was leading to rescue a Yazidi woman and her child, both of whom were taken by ISIS and dragged into Mosul. \"This kind of operation can't be done during daytime,\" he later told NBC News. \"We are basically going in there to kidnap them back from ISIS.\" Khaleel AlDhaki filmed as he coordinated the secret rescue mission of Leila and her three-year-old son. Marc Smith / NBC News Al-Dhaki, a lawyer by training, runs a small team of activists who regularly make dangerous trips into ISIS territory to rescue Yazidi women, members of a non-Muslim minority that live mostly in northern Iraq. \"Saving a soul is the best thing a man can do,\" Al-Dhaki said. \"You get more motivated when you watch them meeting their families. I can't describe the moment of the reunion. We devote our whole lives to rescuing these women.\" Related: Yazidi Women Tell of Rape and Enslavement at Hands of ISIS Al-Dhaki estimates ISIS kidnapped around 7,000 Yazidis and that roughly 3,000 of them managed to escape on their own or were ransomed out of bondage. The fate of 1,000 Yazidi men remains unknown, he adds. That leaves, by his calculation, some 3,000 Yazidi women and children like Leila and Ahmed in ISIS' hands.

Yazidi women, sometimes with their children, were taken as sex slaves. In 2015, ISIS' propaganda magazine, Dabiq, boasted about reviving the ancient practice of slavery. But ISIS is now under intense pressure. Its last stronghold in Iraq, the city of Mosul, is surrounded by Iraqi and Kurdish forces who are elbowing their way in with close support and guidance from U.S. troops. Amid the offensive, Al-Dhaki was sneaking into Mosul to steal the hostages from ISIS. Related: ISIS Mines Pose 'Unprecedented' Threat to Families in Mosul He had arranged to pick up a 23-year-old woman and her 3-year-old son. Although he shared her real name with NBC News, al-Dhaki asked that she be called \"Leila\" \u2014 for her safety and the safety of other Yazidis held by ISIS. Leila had managed to leave her captor's home and go with her son to a safe house that al-Dhaki's team had secured for them. Leila spoke to NBC News of her \"marriage\" to an ISIS fighter, the rape and the abuse she went through while in ISIS captivity. Marc Smith / NBC News Now, outside that safe house, Leila and her son were climbing into the car. She was wearing a headscarf that left her face uncovered. She appeared terrified and sat silently as the car passed other vehicles along the road, each one potentially driven by an ISIS fighter. The boy, whom NBC News is calling \"Ahmed,\" slept in his mother's arms in the backseat. The extraction was a success. Relatives were waiting to receive Leila and Ahmed once they were safely out of ISIS territory. They cried, hugged and kissed one another before driving into Kurdish-held territory near the Turkish border, far away from ISIS. Leila and her son had been gone for two-and-a-half years. Silent and still terrorized by the horrors of ISIS, Leila is now back with her family in northern Iraq. Marc Smith / NBC News \"They took my husband away from me and gave me to an ISIS fighter. They married me to him,\" she told NBC News. Leila is now a refugee living with relatives in a tented camp. Her own village is still occupied by ISIS. Related: Amal Clooney Takes on ISIS for Persecuted Yazidis Leila spoke hesitantly, struggling to finish her sentences. She described how, after the trauma of being separated from her husband and being forced to marry another man, she was \"resold\" twice again to other ISIS radicals. ISIS fighters seemed to trade Yazidi women like baseball cards. Leila's last rapist was a squat, thickly-built Iraqi fighter with an unkempt beard that fell to his chest. His wife was also an ISIS fanatic. \"I hated her even more than him,\" Leila said. \"She would beat my son.\" Children 'Not the Same' As Leila spoke, Ahmed was crying and throwing whatever he picked up from the carpet covering the tent's floor. For most of his life, Ahmed had been surrounded by violent armed men. To prevent Leila from escaping, her ISIS captor would take Ahmed with him when he went to ISIS headquarters, where acts of savage brutality were carried out. Once the the Mosul offensive began, Leila said her captor and his wife wore explosive suicide vests in their home, ready to kill and die if U.S.-backed Iraqi troops came knocking. How had all of this shaped Ahmed during his formative years? Al-Dhaki said many of the Yazidi children he has rescued remain troubled. \"They need help. They are showing signs of violence. They are not the same as before,\" he said. Leila said that Ahmed had seen beheading videos and passed by the body of a crucified man on the street. She doesn't know what he saw during those long hours at ISIS headquarters. The night of her rescue from ISIS Leila reunited with some of her and her husband's relatives who had also been previously rescued from ISIS captivity. Marc Smith / NBC News As Leila spoke about the past from her new home, Ahmed walked back inside the tent after briefly going outside to play with other children. He came back carrying a pair of scissors. Leila went over and tried to pry the scissors from his hands. Ahmed screamed and cried. \"I'll slaughter you,\" he told his mother. Al-Dhaki said another Yadizi boy he'd rescued had tried to slit his sister's throat, apparently mimicking something he had seen ISIS fighters do. Richard Engel ",

Now State of emergency declared in Oakland after deadly warehouse fire At least 36 people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Veronica Rocha , Soumya Karlamangla , Javier Panzar and Matt Hamilton Contact Reporters Officials in Oakland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, clearing the way for the city to receive federal and local funding to cover the massive response to a warehouse fire that left 36 people dead. Oakland Fire Department Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said the local state of emergency declaration, which will be taken up for ratification Thursday by the city council, will also allow businesses affected by fire to obtain reimbursement for lost revenue.\u00a0 Addressing reporters on Tuesday evening, Deloach Reed praised fire crews and law enforcement who have worked around the clock since Friday night\u2019s fire was first reported. \u201cThis has been a heavy labor operation as well as a heavy mental operation,\u201d said Deloach\u00a0Reed, as Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf nodded in the background. Of the 36 people whose bodies have been recovered so far from the warehouse,\u00a0all but one person has been identified, according to Alameda County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. J.D. Nelson. The families of 30 victims have been notified. Meanwhile, the cause of the fire remains under investigation. Alexandria Corneiro, a\u00a0spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told The Times that a refrigerator and other electrical items inside the so-called Ghost Ship warehouse were being examined as potential ignition sources. ATF engineers were still inspecting the wreckage from the blaze and trying to determine the source of the flames, Corneiro said. \u201cThere is no determination of origin or cause of this fire,\" Deloach Reed said. Meanwhile, the building manager offered an apology for the blaze but said he could not say whether he should be held accountable. \u201cCan I just say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d a distraught Derick Almena told the \u201cToday\u201d show in front of the fire-gutted building early Tuesday. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here is to put my face and body in front.\u201d\u00a0 Asked if he should be held accountable for the fire that erupted at an electronic music event late Friday night, Almena responded, \u201cWhat am I gonna say to that? Am I gonna be held accountable? I can barely stand here right now.\u201d Did you know one... A fire ripped through a warehouse in Oakland on Friday night, killing more than 30 people who were there for an electronic music concert.

Ray Kelly told KTVU-TV that some victims, realizing that they were facing\u00a0death,\u00a0had texted family members to tell them they loved them and to say goodbye. Kelly said rescue crews found some of the victims \u201cprotecting each other, holding each other,\u201d the Associated Press reported. Authorities have promised a thorough search. \u201cWe are going to continue\u00a0the investigation,\u201d Oakland police Officer Johnna Watson said.\u00a0\u201cWe are going to continue the process until absolutely every piece of debris is removed from this building, every area has been searched, so families and our community know there is nothing left at this location.\u201d The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was still examining an area within the building, officials said.\u00a0 \u201cThey definitely focused in on a section that\u2019s of interest, but it will remain under investigation for a while until they can be certain,\u201d Call said. Who could be held responsible for the Oakland fire If the fire is\u00a0determined to be an arson, prosecutors could bring murder or aggravated arson charges \u2014\u00a0with one count for each person killed. \u00a0 If the fire is\u00a0determined to be an arson, prosecutors could bring murder or aggravated arson charges \u2014\u00a0with one count for each person killed. \u00a0 See more videos A second\u00a0area in the warehouse had to be stabilized before firefighters could dig through the debris.\u00a0 As the search for bodies progressed, pressure was mounting on city officials to explain how they dealt with numerous complaints concerning conditions in the warehouse. Schaaf, the city\u2019s mayor, release more details on Tuesday about complaints the city had received over the years about the warehouse. She said three complaints had been filed about safety conditions in warehouse itself, two in 2014 and one in 2015. Additionally the city received 18 complaints about a vacant lot adjoining the warehouse between 2008 and 2016. Officials have previously said they had an open safety investigation in process at the time of the fire. Neighbors said they had complained about piles of trash and illegal construction at the warehouse. They said a steady stream of young artists came and went, giving every indication that the building was their home, yet the property\u2019s owner had only a permit for a warehouse, not a residence. Officials had opened an investigation into possible code violations, and an inspector had visited the warehouse but never went inside.\u00a0 \u201cThe administration has to tell us, well, what happened to the code inspector. Why did he just knock on the door and not pursue?\u201d said City Councilman Noel Gallo, whose district includes the Fruitvale neighborhood where the warehouse was located. \u201cThis thing has been going on for 2 1/2 years.\u201d The city of Oakland has yet to release a full accounting of all city building or fire code inspections and investigations of the warehouse, but city records available online show at least five complaints had been investigated since June 2014. The warehouse was a\u00a0 10,000-square-foot\u00a0tinderbox \u00a0with stacks of\u00a0discarded furniture piled high, a rickety staircase made partly of wooden pallets, and a half-dozen RVs. Officials said they have found no evidence of sprinklers or fire alarms inside the structure, known as the Ghost Ship.\u00a0And, according to the man who oversaw the building, it was also outfitted with his homemade electrical repairs, for which he did not obtain permits. Almena\u00a0told NBC News on Monday that he made those\u00a0repairs because the landlord refused.\u00a0 Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories Chor N. Ng, the warehouse owner, could not be reached for comment. Her daughter, Eva Ng, has previously said the family was unaware people were living there.\u00a0 Zac Unger, vice president of the local firefighters union, said\u00a0 the fire marshal\u2019s inspection unit has been understaffed for years.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re way short, especially in an aging city with a huge amount of building going on,\u201d he said. Unger said a more aggressive fire marshal\u2019s office would scour the city looking for buildings that had avoided scrutiny in the past, or had other city code violations and might be hazardous. Such tactics could have possibly prevented the tragedy at the warehouse, he said. \u201cHad a fire inspector walked into that building and seen the conditions in there, they would have shut the place down,\u201d he said. Alameda County Dist. Atty. Nancy O\u2019Malley said her office is investigating the fire, which torched the building during an unpermitted concert. The\u00a0probe could result in criminal charges, including murder or manslaughter, she said. \u201cWe owe it to the community and those who perished to be methodical, to be thorough and take the time to look at every potential piece of evidence,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave no stone unturned. Already people from the community have been reaching out to us about the individuals involved and the scene itself.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , California\u2019s new legislative session began in dramatic fashion , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , and former L.A.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President Obama boards Air Force One during a refueling stop Nov. 18 in the Portuguese islands of Azores. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump wants to clip the wings of a new Air Force One, saying the customized 747 is too expensive. Trump's Businesses And Potential Conflicts: Sorting It Out \"The plane is totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday morning. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that the new aircraft would cost more than $4 billion and urged the government to cancel the contract. Neither Trump nor his spokespeople said where that cost estimate came from. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Last year the Air Force struck an agreement with Boeing to deliver two new 747s around 2024, by which time the two planes now in service for presidential travel will be more than 30 years old. The new models will be able to fly about 1,000 miles farther than the current planes. They'll also be slightly larger and faster, but will have a smaller carbon footprint. Article continues after sponsorship Fake Or Real? How To Self-Check The News And Get The Facts \"The presidential aircraft is one of the most visible symbols of the United States of America and the office of the president of the United States,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said at the time. While affordability was listed as a top concern for the Air Force, the presidential planes include special features that drive up the cost, including secure communications equipment, counterterrorism features and capability for in-flight refueling. The Air Force did not respond right away to Trump's complaint about the planes' cost. But Boeing put out the following statement: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" Similar concerns were raised in the early weeks of the Obama administration over costs for a new fleet of presidential helicopters. That $13 billion project was eventually canceled, but not before Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., needled the new president over the high price tag. Biden Hints He's Leaving The Door Open To A 2020 Run Obama agreed the effort to upgrade Marine One was too extravagant. \"The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me,\" Obama said at the time. \"Of course, I've never had a helicopter before, you know? Maybe I've been deprived and didn't know it.\" ",

The figure covers the cost of extra officers assigned to cover Trump Tower, along with the overtime they accrue. \"New York taxpayers must not pick up the tab,\" said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Should Trump's family remain in New York City, Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., and other New York Democrats want Washington to cover the additional costs of securing Trump Tower. The Trump family has said Melania Trump and Barron Trump will remain in New York through the spring, so Barron can finish school in the city. Miller said the security plan \u2014 devised with the Secret Service \u2014 and its costs take into account the difficulties of securing a skyscraper on one of the busiest streets in the city. Asked about those difficulties, Miller said, \"If I could have picked a place to secure, it would have been among the very last.\" Lowey and other New York Democrats want the funding included in a year-end spending bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. Money for the city is \"in the mix\" for the spending bill, according to a representative for House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky. As of Tuesday afternoon, House Republicans floated a counteroffer that included less federal compensation than the New York Democrats requested. \"No decisions have been made,\" the representative said in an email. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio asked Congress to approve the $35 million in a letter sent on Monday, and the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a formal request for the funds to Capitol Hill two weeks ago. 0 Shares ",

Osorio / Chicago Tribune \u00a0Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio\u00a0could be on his way out at Halas Hall.\u00a0 \u00a0Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio\u00a0could be on his way out at Halas Hall.\u00a0 (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Mike Mulligan There is nothing like losing to stir gossip in NFL circles. It's not unusual to hear one whopper after another. And when dubious stories are repeated often enough, they can be mistaken as truth. With that warning comes a surprisingly widespread belief in NFL circles that Bears coach John Fox will be parting ways with one of his coordinators in the offseason. And it is not the guy you think it is. Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is rumored to be winding down his time with the team as part of a massive overhaul anticipated at the end of the season. It sounds like a tall tale when you consider the Bears' problem has been a lack of continuity because of injury and suspension, along with a number of less-than-stellar game plans on offense. Most observers expect changes at quarterback, and Dowell Loggains has appeared on shaky ground virtually since the day he was promoted to offensive coordinator. The idea that Fox is displeased with Fangio or the coordinator is unhappy in his job sounds absurd but has been the subject of speculation for over a month. \"It has to be some kind of philosophical thing like you saw in Minnesota,'' one league source said. \"It's so out of left field, it might be absolutely correct.'' The Minnesota reference is to the resignation earlier this season of offensive coordinator Norv Turner , who left the team just as the Vikings started to fall apart after a hot start. Turner's decision was a response to philosophical differences with coach Mike Zimmer. Turner is an offensive guy who likes to attack with long passes off play action and was a student of the Don Coryell school of football. Zimmer is a defensive-minded head coach who prefers running the ball and using a short passing game. It's unlikely the Bears would substantiate any conflicts within the coaching staff, so there will be no telling the veracity of the rumors until after the season. Fox and Fangio both come from a defensive background with the Bears running a 3-4 front in large part because it is Fangio's specialty. Fox had always run a 4-3 scheme as a coordinator and head coach although he used a flexible front more often in Denver than in previous stops. The Bears have been building their team and drafting players to fit a 3-4 system, so it is unlikely they would change scheme. The Bears' strength lies in its defensive front seven, where guys like Akiem Hicks , Eddie Goldman, Pernell McPhee and Leonard Floyd are best suited to a 3-4. Philosophical differences may refer to how often they use pressure packages or disagreement on coverage schemes. Fox, insiders say, will return for a third season despite the team's failures this year. He will be reworking his offensive staff and now may also be looking at changes in his defensive staff. It's unknown if respected defensive assistants like Ed Donatell, who came with Fangio from San Francisco or Clint Hurtt, a carryover from the last administration, would want to stay without Fangio. Fox came to the Bears with a reputation as the mayor of NFL coaches with endless lists of guys who wanted to work with him. Jobs in Chicago won't be as attractive if he enters a third year with a losing record and expectations waning. With Fangio, the defensive players have remained believers despite all the losing. Without him, might they become agnostic? There are always two enemies in the NFL \u2014 the one within as seen with doubt and a loss of confidence. And an equally dangerous opponent outside spreading rumors and disharmony to break a team apart. The truth will unfold one way or the other. Chicago Tribune special contributor Mike Mulligan co-hosts \"The Mully and Hanley Show\" weekdays from 5-9 a.m. on WSCR-AM 670. ",

Hagen is a high-ranking Klansman based in California. William Hagen, right, shown at a Ku Klux Klan rally in Anaheim, was arrested and charged with assault with intent to kill in North Carolina. Hagen is a high-ranking Klansman based in California. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) James Queally Contact Reporter The California Ku Klux Klan leader who led a \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d rally\u00a0that erupted in violence in Anaheim\u00a0this year\u00a0was arrested last week\u00a0in connection with a North Carolina stabbing hours before a\u00a0Klan\u00a0parade celebrating\u00a0 Donald Trump \u2019s election, authorities said Tuesday. William Hagen and a\u00a0second person were charged with assault after they stabbed another Klan member\u00a0shortly before the victory\u00a0parade about 20 miles away in Roxboro, N.C., according to Capt. Frank Rose, who oversees criminal investigations for the Caswell County Sheriff\u2019s Office in North Carolina. Hagen and Chris Barker, whom experts described as a national Klan leader, were involved in an argument with Richard Dillon at Barker\u2019s Yanceyville, N.C., home, Rose said. The clash turned violent, and Hagen and Barker are accused of stabbing Dillon several times, the captain\u00a0said.\u00a0Dillon was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and released from a local hospital a short time later, Rose said. Dillon reported the stabbing to sheriff\u2019s deputies about 3 a.m.\u00a0Saturday, Rose said. Barker was arrested at his home a short time later, and Hagen was arrested later the same day during a motor-vehicle stop, he said.\u00a0 William Hagen William Hagen William Hagen (Caswell County Sheriff's Office) Both men are charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflict serious injury, Rose said. They are both being held in the Caswell County detention center in lieu of bail.\u00a0 Attempts to contact attorneys for Hagen and Barker were unsuccessful. A spokeswoman for the Caswell County district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment, and calls to the county clerk\u2019s office attempting to obtain documents related to the charges\u00a0were not returned. Hagen is the \u201cGrand Dragon,\u201d or state leader, of the Loyal White Knights faction of the Klan in California, according to Carla Hill, an investigative researcher with the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, which tracks members of hate groups.\u00a0Barker is the \u201cImperial Wizard,\u201d or national leader, of the Loyal White Knights, a group\u00a0of between 150 and 200 white supremacists across the country, Hill said. Dillon, the person who was stabbed, is also a known Klan member from Indiana, she said. Hill said many Klan members had traveled to North Carolina to participate in the pro-Trump rally. Hagen, who also goes by the name William Quigg, often travels to attend Loyal White Knights rallies\u00a0and was spotted at a white supremacist gathering in Georgia this year, she said.\u00a0 Last weekend\u2019s parade in North Carolina, which gained widespread attention after a reported surge in hate crimes after Trump\u2019s victory, involved about 20 or 30 vehicles driving through Roxboro with people waving flags and praising the president-elect, Hill said. Brian Levin,\u00a0director of Cal State San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism,\u00a0said Hagen also traveled to South Carolina to join protests against\u00a0the removal of the Confederate flag from the statehouse in Columbia, after nine people were shot to death inside a Charleston church in 2015, allegedly by a white supremacist.\u00a0 Hagen, he said, has claimed in the past to have supported Hillary Clinton rather than Trump. But Levin\u00a0said Hagen has openly praised Trump on social media. Trump has received support from a number of white supremacists and ethno-nationalists over the course of his candidacy.\u00a0This year, a white nationalist from Los Angeles was mistakenly listed among Trump\u2019s California delegates. The president-elect has repeatedly denounced the adulation of such fringe groups, but critics contend he has not been forceful enough in distancing himself from their support. ",

    "text": "Anti-Trumpers trying to sow chaos in Electoral College Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Amid a rowdy recount push in battleground states, anti-Donald Trump forces are escalating efforts to invalidate his election on another front: the Electoral College. The people who technically choose the next president will gather on Dec. 19 to, presumably, make the results of the Nov. 8 presidential election official. Trump won 306 electoral votes in the election, well above the 270 needed to defeat Hillary Clinton and claim the White House. But even as Clinton herself has conceded and joined President Obama in urging a smooth transition of power, a group of electors from Colorado and Washington known as the \u201cHamilton Electors\u201d is trying to persuade other electors to unite behind a Republican alternative to Trump. On Monday, they peeled off one Republican. Chris Suprun, from Texas, said he won't cast one of his state's 38 electoral votes for Trump because \"I am here to elect a president, not a king.\" Suprun previously indicated he would support Trump. But he now says the president-elect's postelection attacks on the First Amendment, as well as the billionaire businessman's continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas, changed his mind. The anti-Trump electors, however, face a very steep climb. In total, they would need to persuade 37 electors to either abstain from voting or switch their vote from Trump to someone else. This would throw the vote for president to the House of Representatives. Texas law doesn't mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state's presidential election, which Trump won by nine percentage points over Clinton. But a majority of states bind their electors to the state\u2019s popular-vote winner, complicating efforts to switch those votes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a binding position,\u201d Cherilyn Eagar, a Utah elector, told The Salt Lake Tribune of the law in her state, dismissing efforts to get fellow electors to defect from Trump. The same newspaper notes that some attorney groups have offered to defend electors who try to defy the will of their states. Politico reported Monday that advocates of the latest stop-Trump plan have been in touch with Clinton allies, though Clinton and her campaign have not commented on the plan. Clinton likewise has not gotten behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s efforts to pursue a recount in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The plan for Electoral College chaos doesn\u2019t necessarily hold promise for Clinton anyway. Anti-Trump electors are pushing for members of the Electoral College to support a Republican alternative in order to bring Trump\u2019s number down \u2013 not elevate Clinton\u2019s. According to Politico , Democratic electors backing the push are leaning toward Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for president, as the likely alternative. Suprun said he \u201cwould have to strongly consider someone like Kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together.\u201d Suprun said he was waiting to see if other electors revolt and rally behind a Trump alternative like Kasich. \"I'm looking for someone we can all unify behind,\" he said. The Kasich camp is pushing back on efforts to put forward his name on Dec. 19. Adviser John Weaver told Politico: \u201cThere\u2019s no question Trump won enough votes in the states to receive over 270 votes when the members of the Electoral College meet.\u201d He voiced confidence the Electoral College \u201cwill affirm this when it gathers later this month.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The 5.8 magnitude quake hit late Tuesday afternoon and was felt widely in this twin-island republic off the coast of Venezuela . It was also felt on the neighboring islands of Grenada and St. Vincent. The shaking was strong enough in Trinidad's capital, Port-of-Spain, that some workers streamed out of office towers and into the streets. The temblor was centered about 15 miles (25 kilometers) southwest off the city of Scarborough on the island of Tobago, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

(Dec. 5) AP It's not exactly a war of words, but China and Donald Trump are going after each other in public media. Chinese state media denounced the U.S. president-elect as a \"diplomatic rookie\" on Tuesday, hitting him for his phone call with the leader of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, and his subsequent comments about China's government. \"Provoking friction and messing up China-US relations won't help 'make America great again,'\" said a front-page opinion piece in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, reports the AFP wire service . The Global Times'\u00a0Chinese edition hit Trump\u00a0for his \"inability to keep his mouth shut,\" and his \"provocation and falsehoods,\" according to AFP. Trump said Tsai called him to congratulate him on his election; others in the president-elect's orbit described the call as part of an effort to re-calibrate the relationship with China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province. After China protested the Taiwan call, Trump hit back Sunday night in a pair of tweets. \"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!\" Trump said. ",

Protesters wait Friday outside Chicago Public Schools headquarters, where Black Lives Matter Youth met with city officials and Marist's principal. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The fathers of two girls expelled from Marist High School after being accused of sending racist text messages have filed a lawsuit against the private Southwest Side school that claims another teenager altered the texts. The lawsuit was filed in Cook County on Monday, one month after Indianapolis resident Joshua Beal, 25, was allegedly shot to death by a Chicago police officer in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood, where Marist is located. The shooting led to protests by both Black Lives Matter and pro-police demonstrators. Days later, in a group text message exchange between more than 30 students, a discussion began about the impact of the police shooting and the resulting Black Lives Matter protests would have on classes at Marist. During the exchange, someone allegedly wrote \"I f------ hate n------.\" Screenshots of the exchange were later posted to Twitter. The lawyer handling the lawsuit, which was filed anonymously under the names John Roe and John Doe, claims the images were doctored. \"According to my clients, another student, who particularly doesn't like one of my clients, somehow edited some of these chats to make it look more incriminating than it was. It appeared to be more of an outwardly racially hate-filled statement when the context was removed,\" attorney Steven Glink said in an interview Tuesday. \"It's a personal vendetta.\" Marist expelled the two girls, whose names have not been released. Three other students were also either suspended or expelled, according to the lawsuit. School representatives said they could not comment because of the pending litigation. ",

    "text": "Refrigerator may have sparked deadly Oakland warehouse fire, official says Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A refrigerator may have been the cause of the Oakland warehouse inferno that killed at least 36 people, an official said Tuesday. Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern said a person who escaped the deadly blaze told authorities there were flames coming from the refrigerator, and evidence found at the scene so far supports the claim. \"On that back wall, there's a significant 45 degree angle burn,\" Ahern told KTVU-TV , which he said could indicate it was the source of the fire. Additional details on a possible cause of the blaze have not yet been released by officials. More on this... Charges possible over deadly Oakland warehouse fire, DA says Ahern also released heartbreaking details of what rescuers found when they searched the warehouse. Two of the victims appeared to be hugging when they died, according to Ahern. The male and female were found on top of one of the seven RVs in the center of the building. It is believed the floor collapsed and the male and female, along with another person, landed on top of the vehicle, he said. \"For our people to see that, it was very emotional for them,\" Ahern said. Work inside the building resumed after it was stopped for several hours Monday.\u00a0 Oakland Fire Deputy Chief Darin White said officials have finished searching 90 percent of the warehouse, and that crews should complete their search of the remaining 10 percent of the building by midnight. Fire officials started knocking down parts of the building that they said were structurally unsound. Officials said the debris will fall on areas that have already been searched for bodies. The death toll remained at 36 on Tuesday with no changes overnight in the number of bodies recovered from the remains. Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy Tya Modeste said 36 bodies have been recovered and 26 of their families have been notified, while another nine bodies have been \"tentatively identified.\" Officials are still lacking any type of identity for one individual. \u201cOur hope is not to find any more (victims),\u201d Lipp said during a press conference. \u201cWe want to completely clear the building.\u201d The building\u2019s structure and safety have reportedly been on city officials\u2019 radar for some time and questions have emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the fire. Oakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints about the warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn't get inside, said Darin Ranelletti of the Oakland Planning Department. Once the building is cleared, the investigation will turn to the cause of the fire. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze. \"We owe it to the community and those who perished in this fire, and those who survived the fire to be methodical, to be thorough, and to take the amount of time it takes to be able to look at every piece of potential evidence,\" Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said. Shelley Mack, who lived at the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d for several months about two years ago, said the building was a \u201cdeath trap.\u201d The building was crammed with rugs, old sofas and a garage-sale-like collection of pianos, paintings, turntables, statues and other items that quickly fed the flames. \"I didn't think it was going to last this long before it went up or somebody shut it down,\u201d she said.

    "text": "Authorities have begun identifying the victims of a deadly warehouse fire that claimed the lives of 36 people Mayor Libby Schaaf deflected questions about whether more aggressive action by authorities could have prevented the tragedy at the building known as the Ghost Ship. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and prosecutors said they are looking into the possibility of criminal charges.\u00a0 The Alameda County Coroner\u2019s Bureau released the names late Tuesday of 9 more victims who have been positively identified.\u00a0 The news release issued by the city of Oakland says the nine were men and women in their 20s and 30s, and most came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Authorities say all but one of the 36 people who died have been identified. Most, but not all of those who have been identified, have been publicly named. The local sheriff, who is also the coroner, told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud he doesn\u2019t believe there are more bodies inside.\u00a0 The building itself is so compromised that work here is dangerous and they\u2019re getting much-needed help from some heavy machinery. Crews brought in a large crane to help comb through the charred rubble where the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d once stood as a criminal investigation begins. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at two things: one is whether or not there is any criminal liability attached to this fire and secondly, if there is criminal liability, against whom,\u201d said Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley. \u00a0 O\u2019Malley said potential charges could range from involuntary manslaughter to murder.\u00a0 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says it is looking at the possibility that a refrigerator or other appliance was the source of the fire.\u00a0 Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge of the ATF\u2019s San Francisco office, said it\u2019s too early to say for sure a refrigerator caused the blaze, but she said it was a potential source of ignition. Snyder said investigators are looking at anything electrical on the first floor of the warehouse near where the fire started. Record searches and interviews by The Associated Press indicate that the couple who leased the warehouse and turned it into living spaces and artists\u2019 studios, Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison, were already under scrutiny by several agencies. Some of those agencies had been told or could have seen for themselves that the family of five and their dozens of artist tenants were living in a warehouse that had no permit to operate as a living space and allegedly had no proper kitchen, electricity, adequate fire exits or solid stairs.\u00a0 Almena, 46, is on probation for receiving stolen property, an Airstream trailer he was accused of stealing and stashing at the warehouse. The terms of his probation allowed authorities to enter his home to search without a warrant, records show. Child welfare workers had taken away the couple\u2019s three children in mid-2015 but returned them by this past summer, despite the illegal conditions at the warehouse and the children being hungry, infested with lice and frequently truant, Micah Allison\u2019s father and other acquaintances said. Almena confirmed in a 2015 document that child welfare workers visited the warehouse at least twice. Child welfare authorities refused to comment on the family, citing privacy laws. In returning the children, the authorities set certain conditions, including that the youngsters be out of the warehouse during the many parties held there, according to those who knew the couple. On the night of the fire, Allison and the three children had checked into an Oakland hotel, according to Almena. All of them survived. Almena said in a TV interview that he had little involvement in the party and had gone to the hotel as well.\u00a0 Almena told the \u201cToday Show\u201d on Tuesday that he was \u201cincredibly sorry.\u201d \u00a0 Almena said he started the community in the warehouse as a dream for the arts and performing arts, but, he said, sometimes \u201cyour dream is bigger than your pocketbook.\u201d He said he signed a lease for the building that \u201cwas to city standards supposedly.\u201d Almena said he lived in the warehouse with his family and other residents, but said he didn\u2019t make a profit. He said, \u201cThis is not profit; this is loss. This is a mass grave.\u201d ",

By Drew Harwell and Rosalind S. Helderman December 6 at 12:36 PM Follow @drewharwell Follow @PostRoz President-elect Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June, his spokesman said Tuesday, a move that could have created a cash windfall as he ramped up to begin a costly general election presidential campaign that at the time he claimed he would personally support with \u201cmajor contributions.\u201d The sell-off could help address conflict-of-interest worries about his stock portfolio, a sizable part of Trump\u2019s financial life that was worth roughly as much as $40 million as of December 2015, a May disclosure filing shows. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio, the May filing shows, included shares in a number of banks, oil giants and other companies with business pending before the U.S. government and whose value could rise due to Trump\u2019s decisions in office. Those stock holdings, ethics advisers said, offered a potentially troublesome facet of Trump\u2019s private finances that could entangle his public decision-making. Beyond comments to The Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since the May filing. Trump spokesman Jason Miller, who told The Post about Trump\u2019s stock sale Tuesday morning, did not immediately answer why Trump had sold the shares, how much he sold them for, or whether he has bought anything since. Trump will not be required by law to file another personal financial disclosure until May 2018. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) [ Trump\u2019s stock holdings may give him a personal stake in rules on banks and oil firms ] Trump\u2019s campaign had given no indication of the sale in the five months since it apparently took place in June. As president, Trump will be subject to the STOCK Act, a law passed in 2012 that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1,000 within 45 days. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio, which is separate from his broader real estate and branding businesses, included stocks and bonds invested in companies such as Apple, AT&T, ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs. The June stock sale would have coincided with a point when Trump was pouring money into his presidential campaign. During the Republican primary, Trump loaned his campaign $47 million of his own money. In June, as the general election began, he formally forgave the loan and began making cash infusions to his campaign, first donating $2 million on June 22. Trump then gave $2 million a month between July and August before donating $10 million in October. Much of Trump\u2019s campaign was ultimately funded by other donors. In all, Trump gave his campaign $66 million, federal filings show \u2013 short of the $100 million that he repeatedly claimed he was spending on his race. Miller, the Trump spokesman, told The Post about Trump\u2019s stock sale Tuesday morning, following Trump\u2019s criticism of aviation giant Boeing. Trump tweeted that Boeing\u2019s federal contract to build new Air Force One jets should be cancelled because costs had gone \u201cout of control.\u201d Trump was once a company shareholder, tweeting in January 2013 that \u201c@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!\u201d Trump reported owning between $50,000 and $100,000 of Boeing stock in the May filing. In the three years between Trump\u2019s original tweet about buying Boeing stock and June 2016, Boeing\u2019s share price climbed about 70 percent. Trump has tweeted that he will separate from his own business, the Trump Organization, but has provided no additional details other than promising to hold a press event on Dec. 15 to outline his plans. [ Citing high cost, Trump says Boeing\u2019s contract to build Air Force One should be canceled ] Trump told Fox Business News in August that he was dumping stocks because he predicted the market was crashing, saying, \u201cI did invest, and I got out, and it was actually very good timing.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s August comments, stock prices have generally been on the rise since June. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post last month that Trump had in June also sold his shares in Energy Transfer Partners, the majority stakeholder in the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline project that has drawn protests from environmentalists and Native Americans. The Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday it would not allow the oil pipeline to be drilled further near a Standing Rock Sioux reservation, but Trump has said he supported completing the pipeline. The company\u2019s chief executive was a major campaign donor to Trump, but its stock had declined in value in the face of protests. Trump said in a financial filing released in May 2015 that he owned between $500,000 and $1 million worth of stock in Energy Transfer Partners. By May 2016, when Trump updated his annual filing, the value of the holding had fallen to less than $50,000. Norm Eisen, who served as ethics counselor to President Obama and has criticized Trump over his conflicts, said it would be \u201cabsolutely a step in the right direction\u201d if Trump had sold his stock holdings in June, divesting himself of ownership in companies whose fates could be tied to his policies. But he added that it is now important to know how Trump spent the money he earned from the sale. \u201cWe need to know, has he put them in conflict free assets ... or has he bought other stocks or assets that would create new conflicts?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more reason that we need a prompt and full financial disclosure. If he did liquidate all his stocks, what did he do with the money? What bank is the money in? What did he buy? It\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d He called this the latest example of the tension between Trump\u2019s promise to drain the swamp and how he has managed his own business conflicts. \u201cThe swamp draining should begin with Trump\u2019s own wetlands,\u201d Eisen said.

Trump, asked about a tweet he sent on canceling a Boeing contract to build a new Air Force One, said the costs were \"ridiculous\" and that \"Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.\" By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump , who has for years flown in a jet bearing his name, criticized a pending order for a new Air Force One , saying Tuesday morning on Twitter that the upgrade would cost too much. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 6, 2016 The post appeared to come out of the blue: Mr. Trump had not focused during the campaign on the cost of Boeing\u2019s plans for a next-generation plane for the president. And his criticism of the contract to build on a newer Boeing 747-8 airframe raised the possibility that he might prefer to keep flying his own, well-appointed 757. The Secret Service and the Defense Department might object to Mr. Trump keeping his own airplane. Beyond convenience, Air Force One carries an array of top-secret communications gear for conducting everyday business \u2014 and for managing a global crisis, if required, while aloft. It is also equipped with a number of never discussed security features. The current Air Force One, with its white and blue design recognizable around the globe, is aging. There are actually two of the Boeing 747-200B planes, each bearing the famous call sign only when the president is aboard. The Air Force designates them VC-25A . Advertisement Continue reading the main story They were commissioned by President Ronald Reagan and delivered during the term of his successor, President George Bush. The new plane, which the Defense Department had hoped to deliver to the White House by 2023, would have been more powerful, able to travel farther and more technologically advanced. But given Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post, it is unclear when \u2014 or whether \u2014 Air Force One will get an upgrade. In remarks to reporters at Trump Tower shortly after his message, Mr. Trump made clear that he was serious about the issue. He accused Boeing of escalating the costs of building a new plane. \u201cThe plane is totally out of control,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d In a statement just before noon on Tuesday, Boeing made no mention of Mr. Trump or his post on Twitter, but it said it remained committed to proceeding with the upgrade to Air Force One.

    "text": "Obama defends counterterror record in parting security speech, amid new warnings Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Obama, in what was billed as his last major national security speech in office, defended his counterterrorism record and strategy Tuesday while warning \u201cthe threat will endure\u201d well into the future \u2013 and taking a glancing shot at his successor\u2019s approach. \u00a0 Even as a new congressional report declared the U.S. is facing its highest threat from Islamist terrorists since 9/11, Obama claimed progress in the fight against terror in his address at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, home to U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. While calling Al Qaeda a shadow of its former self, the outgoing president said the U.S. and its allies also are \u201cbreaking the back of ISIL.\u201d \u201cThe results are clear. ISIL has lost more than half its territory, ISIL has lost control of major population centers, its morale is plummeting, its recruitment is drying up,\u201d Obama said. He also declared that during his two terms, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned or executed an attack on the homeland. At the same time, Obama acknowledged America has faced numerous attacks from \u201chomegrown and largely isolated individuals who were radicalized online.\u201d \u201cTo say that we\u2019ve made progress is not to say that the job is done,\u201d Obama said, adding \u201cviolent extremism will be with us for years to come.\u201d He also seemed to critique President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric on the subject, without mentioning him by name: \u201cRather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs, or deploying more\u2026 troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world, we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat.\u201d Despite Obama\u2019s claims of progress, a new report published earlier Tuesday afternoon by the House Homeland Security Committee showed a growing threat to the United States and Europe. \u201cMake no mistake: we face a deadlier threat than ever before not only because our enemies have gotten savvier, but because we took the pressure off them,\u201d House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement on the report. \u201cFor eight years, the Obama Administration reluctantly played global whack-a-mole with terrorists rather than leaning into the fight with decisive leadership.\u201d The report said that throughout 2016, ISIS conducted 62 attacks worldwide, injuring 732 people and killing 215 in several countries, including the United States, France, and Belgium. According to the report, ISIS\u2019 shift in messaging from joining the jihad in Syria and Iraq to carrying out attacks in fighters\u2019 home countries is likely to accelerate the trend of at-home radicalization.\u00a0 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also slammed Obama's speech Tuesday as a \"feeble attempt to evade the harsh judgment of history.\" He said in a statement that \"his legacy on counterterrorism is unmistakably clear: a disastrous withdrawal from Iraq, the terrorist rampage of ISIL, an indecisive approach to the war in Afghanistan that has empowered the Taliban, and an indifferent approach to the carnage in Syria on which our terrorist enemies have thrived.\" Before taking the stage Tuesday, Obama met with top military leaders at the base, including Gen. Raymond Thomas, who heads U.S. Special Operations Command. He also told about 250 U.S. service members gathered in a gym that it had been the privilege of his lifetime to serve as their commander in chief. For Obama, who came into office telling a war-weary nation he would wind down two wars and prevent new ones, the inclination toward smaller-scale, limited military involvement was a natural extension of his foreign policy philosophy. But his approach has most notably come up short in Syria, where Obama long ago predicted that U.S.-backed forces would eventually prevail over Syrian President Bashar Assad. Assad's grip on power appears stronger than it has in years while the brutal civil war continues to rage. Trump has said little about how he intends to shift course in Syria and whether he would continue Obama's strategy in other regions destabilized by extremist group. He's argued that ambiguity and unpredictability are assets that deny the enemy a chance to plan ahead. Still, all signs suggest he'll pursue a more muscular, military-driven approach to extremist groups like the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Trump has argued that Obama's decision to withdraw the bulk of troops from Iraq, rather than negotiating harder with Baghdad to leave some there, created a power vacuum that allowed ISIS to form and seize territory. During the presidential campaign, he said he would listen to top military officers about the need for ground troops to fight ISIS, at one point floating a figure of 20,000 to 30,000. Meanwhile, he's suggested that ousting Assad isn't a top priority and that closer alignment between the U.S. and Russia, which backs Assad, would be positive. Obama was promoting Tuesday the benefits of his more limited approach. Under Obama, the number of U.S. troops Iraq and Afghanistan has dropped from roughly 180,000 to 15,000 today, according to deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. Meanwhile, the U.S. has been able to take out key Al Qaeda leaders, most notably Usama bin Laden, and has started edging the Islamic State group out of strongholds like Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. Yet while U.S. troop casualties declined significantly under Obama's approach, as he finishes his term the U.S. is fighting in far more corners of the globe \u2013 as ISIS has nearly tripled the number of countries where it operates. Military action under former President George W. Bush was mostly limited to Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Under Obama, the U.S. is also launching strikes in Syria, Somalia, Libya and Yemen, according to a report to Congress the White House released this week. Additional U.S. troops and assets are also in Jordan, Djibouti, Turkey, Egypt and Cameroon to support counterterrorism missions, while other overseas operations remain classified.

By Philip Bump December 6 at 4:30 PM Follow @pbump This post has been updated. Shares of stock in aircraft manufacturer Boeing fell nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday. The reason? A tweet from the president-elect. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Were Boeing to lose a $4 billion contract, that would certainly cause people to be skeptical of future earnings. But this, as seems always to be the case with Donald Trump tweets, is not the full story. As our Christian Davenport reports , the contract with Boeing is currently $170 million. The government's plan to replace Air Force One actually involves two different planes which would serve future presidents for years to come. Boeing won the contract in 2015; the new planes are expected to be operational in about a decade. The $170 million isn't for manufacturing, after all. It's for Boeing's work \"determin[ing] the capabilities\" of the planes they will eventually produce. It was natural to wonder, given the apparently unprompted nature of Trump's tweet, if part of his comment was meant to suggest he would prefer to use his existing aircraft for the job of the presidency. His campaign spent $6.7 million on his personal aircraft after he announced his candidacy, and he has called Air Force One \"a step down\" from his personal aircraft \"in every way.\" (Not size , mind you.) Once Trump received a Secret Service detail, the agency paid $1.6 million for its agents to travel with him -- money that went to TAG Air, a company owned by Trump. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump documented the changes he made to his 757 jet in a 2011 video on his YouTube channel. (Donald Trump/YouTube) Trump's current plane is also a Boeing. The Air Force wouldn't let Trump keep using his plane as president, though, unless it were significantly upgraded. As CNN reported earlier this month, Trump's personal plane would need to be upgraded with critical functionality to serve as his official aircraft. That includes missile detection and avoidance systems, electromagnetic shielding, mid-air refueling mechanisms and confidential communications systems. The cost of those upgrades would be up to Trump. As it turns out, though, the Trump tweet may not have been unprompted. CNN's Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that shortly before the tweet (which was posted at 8:52 a.m. Eastern) the Chicago Tribune posted an article quoting the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenberg.\u00a0(The comments were made at a speech on Friday, not in an interview with the Tribune, as this article originally indicated.) \"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" Muilenberg said at the Illinois Manufacturing Association last week, as noted by Tribune columnist Robert Reed. Fair trade has helped Boeing, which prides itself on being America's largest manufacturing exporter . \"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world,\" Muilenberg continued, noting that a third of the planes were sent to China. \"This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985.\" Those are pointed comments. It was Trump, of course, who robustly criticized free trade during the general election. And it is Trump who, this week, seemed to threaten a trade war with China. Shortly after tweeting that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled, Dec. 6, President-elect Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower he wants the company \"to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" (The Washington Post) That story has a dateline of 7:30 Central time -- 8:30 Eastern. Trump's tweet came out a few minutes later. We don't know that Trump was responding to the Tribune story. We do know that the last time he tweeted an out-of-the-blue opinion, about flag-burning, it was immediately after a Fox News segment showing students burning flags. We also know that Trump's tweet tanked Boeing's stock price, albeit only briefly. In 2013, Trump tweeted about having just bought stock in Boeing (\"great company!\"), but his spokesman said on Tuesday that the president-elect no longer holds stock in Boeing, or anything else, having sold it all in June. The fluctuations in Boeing's stock price that may have stemmed from Trump's annoyance at a news article criticizing his policies in the lightest of terms, then, only affected other people. Update: Some good news for shareholders: Boeing's stock ended the day up slightly. politics ",

But because of the pipeline's size \u2014 30 inches in diameter \u2014 its approval went to Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy, an official said. \"Ms. Darcy had the authority to make the decision on behalf of the Department of the Army, and she did so,\" Darcy spokesperson Moira Kelley told NBC News Tuesday evening. Sunday's decision was hailed as a victory by protesters who oppose the pipeline, saying its construction threatens land believed to be sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and could threaten its drinking water. The activists call themselves \"water protectors.\" Related: Cruel Winter Could Be Another Blow to Pipeline Protesters' Hopes Darcy said in the memo that more work needs to be done in looking for an alternate route, with greater participation from the tribe. The memo from Darcy makes clear that her decision \"does not alter the Army's position that the Corps' prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.\" When asked why Assistant Secretary Darcy decided to go against the Corps of Engineers recommendation, Kelley her spokesperson said, \"the Army decided that the totality of circumstances call for additional analysis, a more robust consideration of alternatives, and additional public information.\" Army Secretary Eric Fanning was \"supportive\" of Darcy's decision but ultimately the decision was hers, the spokesperson said.

The footage from October raises new questions about whether authorities in Oakland, California, were aware of possible safety issues at the warehouse or knew that people were living there, even though it was not zoned for residential use. Derick Almena, the embattled manager of the warehouse , said police came to the building while responding to a neighbor's party because they needed access to the roof.

The city of Oakland requires yearly fire inspections for residential and commercial properties, but the head of the firefighters' union said scarce resources may have meant the warehouse didn't get one. \"There are many unsafe buildings in the city,\" union chief Zach Unger told NBC News. The two-story, 10,000-square-foot structure was a maze of makeshift studios and apartments, much of it crammed with wood furniture, and there appeared to be no sprinklers. Residents said the heating and electrical systems were improvised. The warehouse owner, Chor Ng, rented it to Alemena, who lived there with his wife and three children and also rented space to other people.

It's not clear if the agency noted any issues during its site visit, but the children were returned to the couple. The family was staying in a hotel the night of the fire because, Almena said, of a dance music party being thrown on the site. This 2014 photo provided by Ajesh Shah shows the interior of a portion of the 'Ghost Ship' warehouse, taken while he was on a tour as a potential tenant of the Oakland, Calif., building. Ajesh Shah / AP In an interview Tuesday morning , Almena defended his management of the building and said when he signed the lease, he \"got a building that was to city standards supposedly.\" City records show at least 10 complaints had been lodged against the property since Ng bought it in 1997, ranging from trash and debris piling up to an allegation of an illegal structure. In some cases, the city corrected problems and then took out liens against Ng for the money spent on the work. Housing officials say there was an open investigation into the building, but residents say they were never contacted. The Oakland Mayor's Office had no comment. In a statement, the Ng family said: \"We are also trying to figure out what's going on like everybody else. We're sorry to hear about the tragedy. Our condolences go out to family and friends.\" Stephanie Gosk ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Christian Davenport December 6 at 10:22 AM Follow @wapodavenport Shortly after tweeting that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled, Dec. 6, President-elect Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower he wants the company \"to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing\u2019s contract\u00a0to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Boeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn\u2019t much of a competition.\u00a0Boeing\u2019s 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \u201cconsistent with the national public interest,\u201d Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. She insisted that the Pentagon \u201cwill insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\u201d [ Boeing chosen to build the next Air Force One ] Talking to reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: \u201cThe plane is totally out of control. It\u2019s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d And in a call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said that Trump plans to closely examine the Pentagon\u2019s budget and look for areas where he can find savings. \u201cI think this really speaks to the president-elect\u2019s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we\u2019re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.\u201d The entire cost of the program, including development costs, is expected to reach $4 billion, according an analysis by\u00a0Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In a statement, Boeing said that so far it is only under contract for $170 million. And that\u2019s not yet for manufacturing,\u00a0but rather \u201cto help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\u201d An Air Force official, not authorized to speak publicly about the program, said that the current plane will be 30 years old next year, and the new ones aren\u2019t slated to come online until the mid-2020s. By then the technology aboard the current plane will be dated and it will become increasingly hard to maintain it. Any delays to replace it could cause significant problems, the official said. Air Force One. (Carsten Koall/Getty Images) Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump\u2019s tweet was \u201ccompletely nonsensical\u00a0and based on exactly nothing. But it\u2019s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.\u201d Loren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that \u201cAir Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances \u2014 like nuclear war.\u201d The price tag, he said, \u201cis driven by the demands of the mission.\u201d Boeing is under contract\u00a0to build two planes to serve as Air Force One. \u201cI think once [Trump]\u00a0sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,\u201d Harrison said. Air Force One is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad, servicing under the call sign \u201cAir Force One\u201d when the president is on board. But it is also a \u201cflying command post,\u201d as Harrison said. \u201cIn the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.\u201d [ Why we can\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 ignore Donald Trump\u2019s tweets ] President Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was \u201can example of the procurement process gone amok \u201d leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process.\u00a0By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems. But Air Force One is different, Harrison said, because \u201cit\u2019s still very, very early. It hasn\u2019t had a chance to have any cost overruns yet.\u201d\u00a0He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule. But this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events: \u201cTaxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cA total disgrace!\u201d He\u00a0brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. \u201cNow Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d Trump reported owning between $50,001 and $100,000 in Boeing stock in his most recent financial disclosure, which was filed in May 2016 and disclosed his 2015 holdings. He sold the shares in June, according to his spokesman. Boeing\u2019s stock was down\u00a00.64 percent in morning trading. Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. Read more: ",

    "text": "Battered San Bernardino is one step closer to exiting years-long bankruptcy San Bernardino City Hall Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times A federal judge said Tuesday that she would approve San Bernardino's bankruptcy plan, meaning that the city can begin the process of emerging from four years of bankruptcy. A federal judge said Tuesday that she would approve San Bernardino's bankruptcy plan, meaning that the city can begin the process of emerging from four years of bankruptcy. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Paloma Esquivel Contact Reporter After four long, painful years, San Bernardino will soon emerge from bankruptcy. A federal judge on Tuesday said she\u00a0 would approve the city\u2019s plan to exit bankruptcy, marking a major step toward the end of the process for San Bernardino. \u201cThis is a very important day for the city,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Jury said. \u201cThe city came in in financial chaos and it\u2019s leaving in a much better place.\u201d Approval of the city\u2019s plan to pay its creditors and restructure its finances was touted by officials as the start of a new era for the battered Inland Empire city, even as it faces a daunting list of challenges to truly right itself. \u201cWe want our residents to know, and we want people who would invest in the city ... to know we\u2019ve cleared this burden and we\u2019re ready to do business,\u201d City Manager Mark Scott said. The plan includes a list of agreements with employees, retirees, municipal bondholders and many others. The confirmation order is tentative until being made official, which Jury said would be done within 30 days. \u201cNobody is walking away from this proceeding without having taken some kind of hit,\u201d Jury said. The plan, the broad outlines of which have been known for some time, preserves pension benefits for employees and retirees, though employees will have to contribute more to their pension plans and benefits were modified for new employees. Retirees will lose some health benefits they were promised. Meanwhile, some bondholders and unsecured creditors will be paid only 1% of what they were owed. The vast majority of the city\u2019s creditors have agreed to the plan. But during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, a number of lawyers for clients with federal civil rights lawsuits against the city that allege police abuse argued forcefully against it. Those clients stand to get 1 cent on the dollar for the first $1 million in judgments if the city is found liable. Insurance would cover the remaining amount. City representatives have argued that any savings from their compromises with creditors would go to rebuilding the city\u2019s depleted infrastructure and improving municipal services. In issuing her ruling, Jury noted that the city must be able to offer adequate services \u2014 particularly those for public safety \u2014 if it is to improve. \u201cAnybody who lives in this area knows that the crime problem in San Bernardino is significant,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to be able to get safe in order for people to want to live there.\u201d City Atty. Gary Saenz said the city\u2019s creditors, employees and others made significant compromises for the plan to move forward. They \u201crealized that the city is in bankruptcy, has no money, and is in an extremely difficult situation,\u201d he said. And they \u201cgave up much to help the city get to a place where we could have a plan that would help the city survive.\u201d San Bernardino has been in bankruptcy since summer 2012. Over the last four years, other municipalities have entered and emerged. Stockton filed bankruptcy in 2012 and exited last year. Detroit filed in 2013 and exited the following year. Years of cuts to public services and struggles to raise revenue in the impoverished city have battered its infrastructure and taken a heavy toll on its ability to meet basic public needs and attract new economic opportunities. The bankruptcy process and cost-cutting efforts in years prior mean the city is now a very different place than it was just a few years ago. Its storied Fire Department has been outsourced to the county and trash collection, recycling and street sweeping services have been contracted out. City staff has been cut by hundreds, while street repair, libraries, parks, community centers and other services have been severely neglected. The Police Department\u2019s staffing has been cut 30%, hampering its ability to deal with a recent surge in homicides. \u201cThe public has had to put up with a lot,\u201d Scott said. \u201cNothing would make us happier than to get back to where we\u2019re serving them at a higher level.\u201d But in a city that is among the poorest in the nation, officials say raising revenue will continue to be a major challenge. The city declared bankruptcy having been devastated by the effects of the Great Recession and housing crisis, which left it grappling with huge unemployment rates, one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation and plummeting property and sales tax revenues. Those tax revenues have improved moderately in recent years but are unlikely to do so significantly in the near future, officials have said. Although city officials have explored raising various sales and other taxes to increase revenue, they concluded that the city\u2019s poor residents could be overly burdened by such increases and voters may not approve them. The city has taken steps to raise fees, which do not require voter approval. To boost the city\u2019s economic foundation, officials hope to attract new development. But challenges including the city\u2019s high violent crime rate, difficulty in providing needed services and the well-publicized bankruptcy itself have made that difficult. On Tuesday, officials expressed hope that the impending exit from bankruptcy would help it begin to address some of those issues. Voters also recently approved a new charter that restructured the city\u2019s complex governmental structure. In issuing her ruling, Jury sounded an optimistic note and congratulated the city\u2019s leadership. The city\u2019s top positions are now filled by different people from when the bankruptcy process started. Four years ago, she said, city officials appeared to be working at odds with each other. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this community for 40 years,\u201d Jury told the packed room of attorneys and city officials who gathered for the momentous hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018that city needs help.\u2019 And it got it.\u201d ",

Gen. Michael Flynn -- was forced out of the transition efforts amid controversy over a fake news story that he pushed on Twitter. \"The younger Michael Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early on in the transition process,\" Trump team spokesman Jason Miller said, adding that he is \"no longer involved with the transition efforts.\" The decision came from President-elect Donald Trump himself, two Trump transition officials said. Flynn Jr. is accused of pushing the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory in a flood of tweets Sunday and Monday, prompted by gunplay at Ping Pong Comet Pizza in Washington, D.C. The suspect in that case allegedly went to the eatery to investigate what turned out to be a fake news story involving Hillary Clinton and campaign manager John Podesta . ",
