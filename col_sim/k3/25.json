USA TODAY Sports Dez Bryant of the Dallas Cowboys argues with Josh Norman #24 of the Washington Redskins after catching a pass in their game at AT&T; Stadium on November 24, 2016 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo: Ronald Martinez, Getty Images) ARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant and Washington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman had to be warned by officials during the game because their words and actions were getting a little too heated in the second half. The end of the game didn\u2019t calm anything down. Norman and Bryant went mask-to-mask and had a heated exchange on the field after the Cowboys' 31-26 win and had to be separated by teammates. Once both players retreated to their respective locker rooms, the fireworks continued. \u201cFirst off,\u201d Bryant told reporters, \u201cWashington needs to get their money back from Josh Norman.\u201d Dez Bryant and Josh Norman pic.twitter.com/imieKlig4d \u2014 Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) November 25, 2016 That was, frankly, the kindest thing said. (And a reference to the shot Norman took last season when he said the Cowboys needed \u201cto get their $70 mil back from Dez.\u201d) \u201cI didn\u2019t make it personal,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI was just going to come out and do my job and that\u2019s exactly what I did. He wanted to bump and me and him got to bumping a little bit and it just made me attack him even more. I honestly feel like the guy is extremely soft. He\u2019s a bunch of talk. If he was out and about, I wouldn\u2019t dare on my life let him talk to me like that. \u201cThose words would never come out of his mouth. I promise. I promise it wouldn\u2019t. We got after that ass and it was a hell of a win. It feels good.\u201d Bryant and Norman battled all game, at times needing to be separated. \u00a0After a 13-yard completion on a skinny post in fourth quarter, Norman tackled Bryant by the legs, and held on after the whistle. Bryant got up and got in Norman\u2019s face, and the two continued to jaw back and forth. After that series, a member of the officiating staff directly addressed both players. \"I think he's extremely soft. All talk,\" Bryant said. Norman told reporters\u00a0that Bryant \u201cbumped into me\u201d after the game and \u201cwas\u00a0like, 'what\u2019s up.' \u201d Norman then said: \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we unload the clip,\u201d but it was unclear if he was attributing that saying to Bryant or himself. \"Don't step to someone when the game is over like that when they're not even looking for you, or even having a conversation with you,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThey won the game, so you have to tip your hats off to them. But I don't do trash, and that was trashy on his behalf.\u201d All through the week I will post film how Norman got exposed... https://t.co/WKWE9IdQYr \u2014 Dez Bryant (@DezBryant) November 25, 2016 Boy stop... go watch the film.... the man can't cover one on one... I broke him down on so many routes tonight https://t.co/EoOtHWHoid \u2014 Dez Bryant (@DezBryant) November 25, 2016 @J_No24 don't lie on me..  but I will whoop yo ass boy straight up \u2014 Dez Bryant (@DezBryant) November 25, 2016 Bryant finished the game with five catches for 72 yards on seven targets. He appeared to have Norman beaten deep for what would have been a sure touchdown, but Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott did not see Bryant streaking down the field wide open. \"You supposed to be a lockdown corner, and you can't even play man-to-man,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing bail technique. That\u2019s not man-to-man. He was scared. He was scared, man.\" Norman signed a five-year, $75 million contract this offseason after his former team, the Carolina Panthers, rescinded the franchise tag the offered him in March. \"He was holding the whole night, man,\" Bryant said. \u201cHow much he got paid? Seventy-something? Damn.\u201d Norman has also sparred with Odell Beckham Jr. of the New York Giants, a highly-publicized matchup from Week 15 last season in which both players were penalized for five personal foul penalties. Now, it appears Norman may have another bitter rival inside the NFC East. \"If that boosts his ego, or if he needs it to fuel whatever kind of things he got in his head, then so be it,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI played him three or four times now,\u201d Norman said. \u201cAnd those times, I don\u2019t think he broke 30 yards, or had any significance of any kind in the game. Definitely didn\u2019t have a touchdown. So, out of those three games, you would think that a guy of that magnitude, of that kind of big standards, would do more than that. But at the end of the day, I will let him speak for himself. If he feels like he wants to have that, then go play with the kids on the playground.\u201d Follow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes . PHOTOS: Best of NFL Thanksgiving games Posted!

    "text": "CBS/AP November 24, 2016, 3:16 PM Trump's team to raise millions for inauguration events President-elect Donald Trump arrives at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Nov. 19, 2016. Reuters/Mike Segar Email Last Updated Nov 24, 2016 1:43 PM EST PALM BEACH, Fla.\u00a0-- The scramble to shape his administration underway , President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s team has simultaneously begun turning its attention to raising tens of millions of dollars for festivities related to his Washington inauguration. Mr. Trump, who vowed during the campaign to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests corrupting Washington, has set $1 million donation limits for corporations and no limits for individual donors, according to an official on the Presidential Inaugural Committee with direct knowledge of tentative fundraising plans. At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee will not accept money from registered lobbyists, in line with his ban on hiring lobbyists for his nascent administration. Barack Obama set stricter limits on donations for his first inauguration, in 2009, holding individual donors to $50,000 each and taking no money from corporations or labor unions, as well as none from lobbyists and some other groups. Plenty of corporate executives, though, gave individually and often at the maximum amount. And he opened the spigots for his 2013 inauguration, setting no limits on corporate or individual donations. President-elect Donald Trump is spending Thanksgiving with family at his Palm Beach, Florida resort. He announced Wednesday that charter school a... The new details, confirmed Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to disclose private deliberations, came as Mr. Trump gathered with family at his Palm Beach estate on Thanksgiving. It was a working holiday of sorts for Mr. Trump, who suggested on Twitter that he was engaged in trying to prevent an Indiana air conditioning company from moving jobs to Mexico. \u201cI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cMAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\u201d The company, which has announced plans to move 1,400 jobs to Mexico from Indiana in the coming years, said  Thursday it \u201chas had discussions with the incoming administration\u201d but that there was \u201cnothing to announce at this time.\u201d Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time. \u2014 Carrier (@Carrier) November 24, 2016 On the eve of the national holiday, the president-elect offered a prayer for unity after \u201ca long and bruising\u201d campaign season. \u201cEmotions are raw and tensions just don\u2019t heal overnight,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a video message on social media. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country strengthened by shared purpose and very, very common resolve.\u201d Unity has emerged as a common theme during Mr. Trump\u2019s limited public appearances in the days since his stunning general election victory, which followed a campaign season in which he rained extraordinary personal attacks on his opponents in both parties, the media and his many Republican critics. Mr. Obama also emphasized this in his own Thanksgiving message .\u00a0 Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we are still one people, part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d the president said in a video published Thursday. \u201cWe are communities that move forward together. We are neighbors who look out for one another, especially those among us with the least. We are always, simply, Americans.\u201d Unity would also be a theme for the incoming president\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration, the official said. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the U.N. ambassador for his administration. Who else will be part of T... While Mr. Trump\u2019s fundraising plans have not been completed, he is expected to raise significantly more than the $43 million Obama raised for his 2013 inauguration. Taxpayers cover the cost of official activities such as the swearing-in, but outside donations pay for the many related balls and parties. Mr. Trump has focused most of his attention in the two weeks since his victory on building a White House team from scratch. He injected the first signs of diversity into his Cabinet-to-be on Wednesday, tapping South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. They are the first women selected for top-level administration posts. And Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, would be his first minority selection after a string of announcements of white men. The South Carolina governor has little foreign policy experience, yet Trump praised her as \u201ca proven dealmaker.\u201d DeVos, like Mr. Trump, is new to government but has spent decades working to change America\u2019s system of public education. The president-elect called DeVos a \u201cbrilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d saying in a statement that \u201cunder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families.\u201d Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on Wednesday said \u201can announcement is forthcoming\u201d on his position, which would make him the first black choice - possibly as secretary of housing and urban development. But he also suggested he\u2019d be thinking about it over the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cI feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\u201d Carson wrote on his Facebook page. Mr. Trump praised his former primary opponent as a \u201cgreatly talented person,\u201d after months of launching vitriolic campaigns against the neurosurgeon. \u00a0 I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 Mr. Trump is also expected to select billionaire investor Wilbur Ross Jr. to lead the Commerce Department, a senior Trump adviser said on condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorized to disclose internal deliberations. The 78-year-old Ross, who is white, is chairman and chief strategy officer of private-equity firm W.L. Ross & Co., which has specialized in buying failing companies. The picks come as Mr. Trump works to dissociate himself from the alt-right, a movement of white supremacists who continue to cheer his election. His first appointments included chief counselor Steve Bannon , who previously led Breitbart News, a website popular among the alt-right. Mr. Trump on Thursday was with his family behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. He\u2019s spending the Thanksgiving holiday there after a week of interviewing potential appointees in New York, punctuated by announcements of members of his national security team. The president-elect is not expected to meet with anyone over the Thanksgiving holiday, but according to pool reports, Mr. Trump is still making phone calls throughout the day.\u00a0 He will be sworn into office in fewer than 60 days. Beyond his Cabinet, he must fill hundreds of high-level administration posts. Mr. Trump is expected to stay in Florida through the weekend. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

But in at least one critical sense, the result couldn\u2019t have been more European: Across the continent, parties of the center-left that have dominated politics for decades \u2014 and that have given Europe its reputation for generous social welfare systems \u2014 now find themselves beaten, divided and directionless. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are just the latest members of a beleaguered club. In Germany and Britain, once-mighty center-left parties have been badly diminished, locked out of their nations\u2019 top jobs for the foreseeable future. In Spain and Greece, they have been usurped by newer, more radical alternatives. And in France and Italy, they\u2019re still governing \u2014 but their days in power may be numbered. The rout of the center-left has even extended deep into Scandinavia, perhaps the world\u2019s premier bastion of social democracy. Overall, the total vote share for the continent\u2019s traditional center-left parties is now at its lowest level since at least World War II. Like the Democrats, these parties have been marginalized, with little influence over policy as the right prepares to place its stamp on the Western world in a way that could endure for decades. \u201cIf the left and the center-left don\u2019t get their act together, then we\u2019re looking at a period of very unstable right-wing hegemony,\u201d said Alex Callinicos, a European studies professor at King\u2019s College London.

(Markus Schreiber/AP) [ Trump\u2019s win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave ] The decline of the European center-left is part of a broader unraveling of the continent\u2019s mainstream consensus as electorates fracture and a political kaleidoscope of alternatives emerges. But unlike the center-left, traditional parties of the center-right have managed to hold their own amid the populist fury, clinging to power in London, Berlin and Madrid \u2014 with a strong chance next year to take Paris, as well. As recently as a decade ago, the picture was very different. Britain\u2019s Tony Blair was at the vanguard of a generation of European center-left leaders who had emulated Bill Clinton\u2019s pragmatic Third Way politics and seemed poised to ride their marriage of social democracy with market liberalization to an unlimited future of electoral success. But the Great Recession \u2014 and the bumpy, deeply unequal recovery that followed \u2014 fundamentally changed that. \u201cWith the economic crisis, and the negative effects of globalization, the socialists couldn\u2019t convince the populations in their respective countries that the future lies in a liberal Europe,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a historian of socialism at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cThis is the end of the European utopia.\u201d That \u201cutopia\u201d emerged in the aftermath of 1945, when politicians across war-torn Europe banded together to build a new continent that would never repeat the grave mistakes of the recent past. This was the genesis of the European Union: an economic union that was meant to become, at least in theory,committed to the common cause of social justice, largely a leftist ideal. Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers a speech at a Center for Labour and Social Studies event in London on Nov. 5. (Neil Hall/Reuters) If the three decades that followed World War II coincided with the longest period of growth in Europe\u2019s history, voters today see neither leftist economic policies nor the E.U. itself as necessarily worth preserving. Britain voted to leave the bloc in June, and separatist movements have spread across the continent to France, the Netherlands and elsewhere. [ Europe\u2019s traditional left is in a death spiral. Even if you don\u2019t like the left, this is a problem. ] To historians, the unlikely abandonment of this former European bedrock is partly a function of its own achievements. \u201cIt was a failure by success,\u201d said Timothy Snyder, a historian of 20th-century Europe at Yale University. \u201cOnce the left becomes not revolutionary but transformative, and once that transformation succeeds, people start taking it for granted. \u201cEuropeans take for granted that they will have public education, free health care and social services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the left doesn\u2019t get votes on this anymore.\u201d The marginalization of Europe\u2019s center-left parties has been consistent across the continent, although their paths to the political wilderness have varied. In France, prospects for a leftist victory in presidential elections in 2017 remain bleak. The perceived failure of the Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to respond adequately to a recent string of terrorist attacks has brought him the lowest approval ratings in modern French history and ignited a rebellion in his own party. In particular, Hollande\u2019s proposal to strip French citizenship from convicted terrorists who hold dual nationality outraged fellow leftists, distracting the party from presenting a united front against its opponents. [ Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, France\u2019s conservative front-runner, promises the return of the traditional right ] Hollande will face a conservative party whose candidates have promised to bolster national security and bring the country out of economic stagnation. For nearly the duration of the current Socialist government\u2019s tenure, the unemployment rate has hovered at or above 10 percent. In prosperous Germany, the Social Democratic Party\u2019s years of playing second-fiddle to the center-right-led government of Chancellor Angela Merkel have diluted its voice. Analysts give it little prospect for victory in next year\u2019s national elections. In Italy, the center-left Democratic Party occupies a precarious position. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has proposed a host of constitutional revisions, which have been put to a referendum slated for early December. Renzi has reiterated his promise to resign from office if he loses the vote, which the latest polls suggest he will. In economically devastated Greece, the traditional center-left party, Pasok, finished no better than fourth in a pair of votes last year that saw its support drop to the mid-single digits. In both elections, it embarrassingly placed behind the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. But rather than swinging to the right, Greek voters went far left, electing and then reelecting a government led by the Syriza party, a coalition of Trotskyites, Maoists and other figures once limited to the revolutionary fringe who were thrust into power on a pledge to fight austerity and the unforgiving terms of the country\u2019s international bailout. In Spain, voters have divided almost evenly between the long-standing center-left party, the Socialists, and an upstart far-left alternative that didn\u2019t exist three years ago, Podemos. As a result of the split, the center-right People\u2019s Party was able to squeak back into power after elections in June. Britain\u2019s Labour Party \u2014 which built the country\u2019s vaunted National Health Service and was riding a streak of 13 years in power as recently as 2010 \u2014 has faced no similar challenge by an upstart party to its left. Instead, the far left has taken over Labour from within, through the bomb-throwing backbencher Jeremy Corbyn and his astonishing victory in leadership elections last year. Corbyn\u2019s win came after two straight national election defeats for Labour and a bout of soul-searching that mirrors the sort of anxious introspection now sweeping the Democratic Party in the United States. Faced with the choice of three center-left contenders or the long-shot bid of Corbyn, Labour members went with a man who had made a career of bucking the Labour hierarchy and who starkly repudiated the centrism embodied by Tony Blair. [ After Trump win, Obama warns against taking democracy \ufffd?for granted\u2019 ] But there\u2019s little sign that Labour\u2019s lurch to the left has put it any closer to power. With a possible early election coming next year, polls indicate the party would lose decisively to the ruling Conservative Party. Corbyn, meanwhile, has struggled to hold his party together as Labour members of Parliament have overwhelmingly said they have no confidence in his leadership. Blair and his allies have argued that Corbyn will simply guide the party to continued irrelevance. \u201cYou win from the center; you win when you appeal to a broad cross section of the public; you win when you support business as well as unions,\u201d Blair, who guided the party to three straight national election victories, said in a speech last year. \u201cYou don\u2019t win from a traditional leftist position.\u201d But center-left parties have an obligation to try something more radical, said Callinicos, the European political analyst, because the moderate approach they\u2019ve been offering hasn\u2019t worked. \u201cThe merger of traditional social democracy with neoliberalism and globalized free-market policies has fallen apart in fairly disastrous fashion,\u201d he said, suggesting that the turning point was the global financial crash of 2008, when working-class voters saw their jobs disappear or their wages stagnate even as the net worth of the wealthy continued to race ahead. Across Europe, the center-left has had little to offer those voters, who have looked elsewhere \u2014 including the far right. In Britain\u2019s June referendum on the European Union, for instance, working-class voters in traditional Labour strongholds ignored their party\u2019s advice to opt to stay in, and instead heeded the call of the anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party to vote out. Trump\u2019s victory in the United States rested at least in part on a similar phenomenon \u2014 a billionaire tycoon using appeals to xenophobia and racism to scoop up support from voters who no longer believe the party of the working man has their interests at heart. As in the Brexit vote, Trump won certain key states with the help of working-class voters who had supported Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012. One implication of the growing void on Europe\u2019s left could be profound political instability, both within specific countries and geopolitically. Another could be the emergence of a right-wing stranglehold, based on widespread nostalgia for a world that, in Snyder\u2019s view, never actually existed. \u201cAll these continental parties are nostalgic for the interwar nation-state, which was a total disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never any moment when they were happy, independent nation-states. There was never such a time, and their nostalgia is a kind of disguise. \u201cIf you plunge into that abyss,\u201d he added, \u201cvery bad things lie ahead.\u201d Witte reported from London. ",

The Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s office said Sherri Papini, 34, was located Thursday, 22 days after she was reported missing in the town of Mountain Gate, California when she went for a run in the afternoon and never came home.\u00a0 \"We are very ecstatic to report that Sherri Papini has been located and has been reunited with husband and family on this day of Thanksgiving,\" Sheriff Tom Bosenko said at a news conference.

He did not specify the nature of her injuries, but said\u00a0she was treated at a hospital in Sacramento and reunited with her family.\u00a0 The mother of two is being interviewed by detectives from the Major Crimes Unit of the sheriff's office. \u201cDetectives will not rest until her captor or captors are identified and brought to justice,\u201d the sheriff said. Papini was last seen going for a jog on Nov. 2. Her husband reported her missing when he came home from work and discovered that she hadn\u2019t picked up their two children, ages 2 and 4, from daycare. Keith Papini told officers that she had found her phone\u00a0while investigators said they spotted her earbuds along with strands of her hair . However, other clues were scarce.

(The Washington Post) Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor considered the \u201cking of bankruptcy\u201d for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliver profits, is expected to be President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, two officials with knowledge of the decision said. Ross helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s economic agenda, particularly its hard-line stance on the need to renegotiate \u2014 or even withdraw from \u2014 free trade agreements. That position resonated with the working class voters who were instrumental in delivering Trump\u2019s upset victory. Elevating Ross to a position in his Cabinet could suggest that Trump intends to nurture the nationalist streak that was one of the hallmarks of his campaign. In a video released this week, Trump said he is focused on\u00a0creating jobs and reiterated his pledge to withdraw from the sprawling Asian trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership that became a flash point during the election. 1 of 7 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

Chief of Staff\u00a0Reince Priebus President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump\u2019s campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party.

In Ross, Trump has tapped a like-minded businessman who understands the prospects for both profit and peril in restoring American manufacturing. Ross built his fortune buying the distressed companies that were once at the heart of American industry \u2014 steel mills, coal mines and textile factories, to name a few \u2014 and then selling them in short order, making billions of dollars along the way. [ Ross: How Trump would stimulate the U.S. economy ] Perhaps his signature investment was the purchase of some of the nation\u2019s largest steel mills in the early 2000s, including Cleveland-based LTV Corp. and Pennsylvania\u2019s Bethlehem Steel. The move was credited with saving manufacturing jobs, with the United Steelworkers calling Ross \u201ca new ally\u201d in news reports at the time. Since then, however, many steel mills have shut down amid a glut of foreign production, much of it in China. Ross sold his steel conglomerate to what is now ArcelorMittal in 2004 for about $4.5 billion. 1 of 47 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

His metallurgical coal company was headquartered in West Virginia, cobbled together from the remnants of bankrupt mining company Horizon Natural Resources and smaller coal companies. Shortly after the company went public in 2005, an explosion at its Sago Mine in West Virginia killed a dozen people. Ross sold the business to Arch Coal in 2011 for $3.4 billion. [ 2006: Sago mine explosion: After 44 Hours, Hope Showed Its Cruel Side ] And in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Ross purchased several failed banks, including BankUnited in Florida, as well as some European banks. More recently, Ross has invested in troubled oil and gas companies, taking advantage of the oversupply and weak demand that have tanked big-name businesses. He remains chairman and chief strategy officer of WL Ross & Co., which is now part of investment firm Invesco. Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on trade includes a promise to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, as well as threatening to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In addition, Trump has called for double-digit tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. Many economists have warned that adopting those policies could spark a trade war that could undermine the U.S. recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that we could engage in some interventionist trade policy through tariffs and other measures that might help some Americans, somewhere, for some period of time,\u201d said Michael Strain, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut certainly the country as a whole would suffer. \u2026 As your time horizon extends beyond a few years, it\u2019s just going to be harder and harder to find anyone better off by those kinds of policies.\u201d As head of Commerce, Ross would oversee many of the government\u2019s disputes with its trading partners, though it remains unclear how much authority over trade policy Trump might provide him. Ross could ramp up the number of cases brought against China, for example, or increase the penalties for dumping, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI think they are in broad alignment,\u201d Hufbauer said of Ross and Trump\u2019s views. But, he added, \u201cRoss is probably more single-mindedly protectionist than Trump.\u201d In an interview with Yahoo Finance just days after the election, Ross appeared to walk back at least some of Trump\u2019s remarks. He stressed that withdrawing from trade deals would only occur if other countries refused to negotiate. He also described some more mundane changes, such as relaxation of Chinese quotas on some American imports. \u201cEverybody says, oh he\u2019s going to slap 45 percent tariff on everything out of China,\u201d Ross told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat\u2019s not what he said, and it\u2019s not what he intends.\u201d Previously, Ross warned that the economy could enter another recession within the next 18 months, especially if Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were elected. He told Bloomberg TV last month that stock markets appeared near a top. \u201cWhat we\u2019re noticing is there is relatively little demand for any kind of physical product and almost nobody has any kind of pricing power,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you just can\u2019t cut costs anymore and therefore you ultimately need pricing power and physical volume growth, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really lacking in today\u2019s world.\u201d Ross is a trustee of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think bank, and a noted art enthusiast with a taste for Chinese and Vietnamese works who boasts a $100 million collection of works by surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. The Commerce Department is also responsible for compiling crucial data about the health of the economy, including the quarterly estimate of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, or GDP. It also houses\u00a0the U.S. patent office and the Minority Business Development Agency, among others, and the department\u00a0has often been led by corporate executives. Current Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker was a wealthy real estate investor whose family helped found the Hyatt hotel chain. Carlos Gutierrez, who served under President George W. Bush, was chairman and chief executive of Kellogg. No formal announcement about Ross\u2019s position has been made, and the team was still discussing how to make one Thursday morning. Trump met with Ross on Sunday at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J. Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Trump said he was considering Ross to lead the Commerce Department. Ross demurred when asked if he wanted the job. \u201cWell, time will tell,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, internal divisions within Trump\u2019s inner circle over whether he should tap Mitt Romney to be secretary of State are becoming more pronounced due to tensions over whether Romney\u2019s sharp critique of Trump\u2019s career and temperament during the GOP primary ought to disqualify the former Massachusetts governor from a cabinet position. Conservative Romney supporters Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich this week spoke out against the possibility of choosing Romney. \u201cI\u2019m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump,\u201d Huckabee said on Fox News Wednesday morning. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just go after him from the standpoint of \u2018I disagree with his policy on immigration, I disagree with his policy on taxes.\u2019 He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor.\u201d Gingrich said Romney didn\u2019t represent \u201cthe kind of tough-minded America-first policies that Trump has campaigned on\u201d later Wednesday on Fox. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, advanced those critiques Thanksgiving morning on Twitter, saying she had received a \u201cdeluge\u201d of social media and private communications from Trump loyalists warning against the Romney choice, possibly opening the door for former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani or another candidate to be named. She added that former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George P. Shultz \u201cflew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist.\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell contributed to this report. powerpost ",

    "text": "First US Service Member Killed in Syria in IED Blast By Paul Blake Nov 24, 2016, 5:19 PM ET 0 Shares Email A member of the U.S. military died on Thursday near the city of Ayn Issa in Norther Syria, marking the first time a U.S. soldier has been killed in Syria during the current conflict, a senior defense official confirmed to ABC News. U.S. Central Command announced the death in a communiqu\u00e9, but did not identify the service member, who succumbed to wounds sustained from an improvised explosive device blast. \"The entire counter-ISIL Coalition sends our condolences to this hero's family, friends and teammates,\" Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, commander of Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve, said in an emailed statement, referring to ISIS by another common acronym. \"On this Thanksgiving, please be thankful that there are service members willing to take up the fight to protect our homeland from ISIL's hateful and brutal ideology.\" It is unclear what the service member's activities were in Syria. The service member's death follows the death of another U.S. service member in Iraq last month . The naval officer was killed by a roadside bomb north of the Iraqi city of Mosul, where he was serving as an adviser to Iraqi troops. The U.S. is part of a multi-nation coalition that is battling ISIS in Iraq and Syria. This is a breaking news story. Please check back for updates.

    "text": "Your Black Friday cheat sheet: how to find the deals and duds Courtney Jespersen You\u2019ve made your list, you\u2019ve got your comfiest shoes on and you\u2019ve honed your bargain-hunting skills. You\u2019re readier than ever to conquer the stores on\u00a0 Black Friday . But not everything will be business as usual the day after Thanksgiving, as retailer policies will greet consumers with a mixture of shiny gifts and lumps of coal. Here\u2019s what you should know about the shopping rules that have changed ahead of Nov. 25. Coal: Restricted price matching Price matching is a valuable money-saving technique for shoppers. In price matching, store customers can show proof of a lower price from a competitor and ask the store to meet or beat that deal. But price matching probably won\u2019t be there to bail you out of bad deals this Black Friday. Many major retailers make their policies exempt during the annual shopping extravaganza. Toys R Us says it doesn\u2019t match \u201cany competitor\u2019s advertised store or online pricing for Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday .\u201d Target strikes out price matches and adjustments for prices from Thanksgiving Day through the end of the following week. You\u2019ll find similar blackout dates at Best Buy and Staples. That\u2019s because price matches can be time consuming for retailers, said Sucharita Mulpuru, chief retail strategist for annual commerce industry convention Shoptalk. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to be discounting products even further than they already are, especially if you only have limited units of the product,\u201d Mulpuru added. So if you won\u2019t be able to price match while you\u2019re standing in the store, compare prices before you shop and head straight to the retailer with the best offer. Apps such as BuyVia and ShopSavvy can make comparing a breeze. Gift: More free shipping Here\u2019s a present for you: Free shipping won\u2019t just exist on Black Friday; there will be more of it than usual. That\u2019s welcome news, since 93% of online shoppers surveyed in the\u00a0 National Retail Federation\u2019s annual holiday consumer spending survey \u00a0said they\u2019ll take advantage of free shipping this holiday season. A handful of big-box retailers have eliminated their free shipping minimums for Black Friday and throughout the holidays, granting their Internet customers free shipping on everything, regardless of price. At Best Buy, items ship free through Christmas Eve, and at Target, free standard shipping extends through Jan. 1, 2017. Use free shipping for even your smallest orders, but remember that some exclusions may apply to these promotions; read the fine print. Coal: Limited coupons If coupons are your go-to discount method, think again on Black Friday. With deals and discounts so prevalent in the days after Thanksgiving, it\u2019ll be more difficult to stack coupons on top of what you\u2019re already saving. Last Black Friday, for instance, Macy\u2019s stuffed savings passes within its Black Friday ad with coupons for $10 off purchases of $25 or more or $20 off $50 or more, but the discounts were only good for a limited period and couldn\u2019t be used on door busters or deals of the day. In 2015, Kohl\u2019s shoppers earned $15 Kohl\u2019s Cash for every $50 spent, but the coupons could be redeemed only during the first week of December. Keep a close eye on coupon restrictions and limitations again this year. Gift: Longer return periods Some retailers will have one more treat to offer \u2014 extended return policy windows. In case you\u2019re filled with regret after your Black Friday shopping splurge, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to return or exchange your not-so-hot purchases. Items shipped by Amazon.com from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 may be returned until Jan. 31 for a full refund, subject to return guidelines. This is much more generous than Amazon\u2019s typical 30-day return period. At Newegg, almost every product bought Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 can be returned for a refund or replacement until Jan. 31. Sears, too, has made returns easier. Select items purchased Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 \u2014 which typically have 30-day return periods \u2014 can be returned through the end of January. Check your favorite store\u2019s return policy for similar extended holiday offerings. These can be found on a retailer\u2019s website.

Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press By Jonathan O'Connell November 24 at 12:52 PM Follow @OConnellPostBiz President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Thanksgiving morning that he was trying to make good on a campaign promise that a Carrier air-conditioning factory in Indiana, and its 1,400 jobs, would not move to Mexico in 2019 as planned. \u201cI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS \u2014 Will know soon!\u201d Trump tweeted . Carrier, a division of United Technologies of Farmington, Conn., responded with a tweet about an hour later: \u201cCarrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time.\u201d During the campaign, Trump called the planned closure of the Indianapolis plant \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d and made it a campaign rallying cry . At an Indianapolis event in April, he went further, offering the crowd a \u201c100 percent\u201d guarantee the plant would not leave if he were elected. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump said, according to Bloomberg News . \u201cThey\u2019re going to call me, and they are going to say, \u2018Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 1 of 7 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

Chief of Staff\u00a0Reince Priebus President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump\u2019s campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cOne hundred percent \u2014 that\u2019s what is going to happen,\u201d Trump added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have an 80\u00a0percent chance of keeping them or a 95\u00a0percent. One hundred\u00a0percent.\u201d The Carrier back-and-forth was reminiscent of a similar exchange over manufacturing facilities that Trump began a week earlier, when he said on Twitter that he had received a call from Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Co., saying that \u201che will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky \u2014 no Mexico.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim was exaggerated , as Ford\u2019s union contract prevented it from shutting down its Louisville assembly plant. Ford clarified that it had merely decided not to relocate production of a single vehicle model, the Lincoln MKC, from Kentucky. Carrier announced its plans to shut down the Indiana plant in February, with the closure slated for 2019. Chris Nelson, a Carrier president overseeing the unit, issued a statement at the time saying the move to Mexico would allow the company \u201cto operate more cost effectively\u201d because of the industry\u2019s ongoing migration to that area as well as \u201ccost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements.\u201d The closure could lead to the loss of more than $100\u00a0million to the Indiana economy and more than 1,000 other jobs that indirectly relied on the plant, according to some estimates . Trump\u2019s promise to save the plant was met with skepticism in some corners of Indiana, the home state of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, but Trump carried the state easily over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. business ",

And when Donald Trump gets sworn in as president on Jan. 20, that contingent will balloon to more than 920 Secret Service agents and support personnel in Washington and his hometown, New York. The price tag for all that security is already very big, or as the Manhattan mogul might put it, \"Yuge,\" internal Homeland Security and Secret Service documents reviewed by NBC News show. \"Secret Service protection is the most intrusive thing that anyone could ever experience\" Right now, the cost to taxpayers is more than $2 million a day, the documents show, a number that is sure to increase whenever the president or the first lady travels \u2014 or when the threat level rises. Meanwhile, the New York Police Department is already handling external security at Trump Tower, the president-elect's Manhattan home base, at an estimated cost of $1 million per day. \"You put a price tag on anything around the president, then you're putting a price tag on his life, and that is priceless,\" Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent who has protected every living president, including Barack Obama, told NBC News in an exclusive interview. Protecting Trump's family presents unprecedented challenges. First off, it's a big family \u2014 18 members in all, including Melania Trump and her 10-year-old son, Barron, as well as four adult children, three of them married, with a combined eight grandchildren. The Secret Service has not had to protect the adult children of a president-elect in a long time, Wackrow said. Play ",

The price of a basic Thanksgiving meal in 2016 fell to $49.87 as food prices mark the first annual drop in nearly 50 years. (Los Angeles Times) Geoffrey Mohan and Daniel Wheaton Contact Reporter The cost of a basic Thanksgiving meal for 10 people dropped 24 cents, to $49.87,\u00a0thanks to the first annual deflation in food prices in nearly half a century, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture . The consumer price index for supermarket food was down by 1.1% from last year\u2019s annual rate, with little more than a month left to the year. The annual decline is likely to be between 0.25%\u00a0and\u00a01.25%, marking the first time U.S. retail food prices posted an annual deflation since 1967, the agency\u2019s Economic Research Service\u00a0 said. A strong U.S. dollar made U.S. goods less competitive abroad, leaving more in the domestic market, while low oil prices kept the cost of transportation and other factors lower, according to USDA. Turkey prices dropped substantially from last year \u2014\u00a030 cents less for a 16-pound turkey \u2014\u00a0as the industry fully recovered from last year\u2019s avian flu outbreak, according to the Farm Bureau.\u00a0 U.S. dairies\u00a0over-produced so much, the federal government spent $20 million to buy 11 million pounds of cheese, according to USDA. A Wall Street Journal analysis of USDA data suggests the dairy industry dumped as much as 43 million gallons of milk in the first eight months of this year. The price slide is not expected to last through next year. USDA predicts retail food prices will rise by 0.5% to 1.5% in 2017. The Farm Bureau survey, now in its 31st year, includes turkey, bread stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk, all in quantities sufficient to serve a family of 10 with plenty for leftovers.\u00a0 In current dollars, the meal cost a high of $63.16\u00a0in 1986, and was below $50 from 1991 to 2010.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a look at some of what may be on your plate this year: A beginner's guide to cooking a Thanksgiving turkey \u00bb Turkeys There are nearly enough turkeys raised in the U.S. for each person to have his or her\u00a0own bird for Thanksgiving.\u00a0 The latest turkey census showed more than 286 million\u00a0birds in the country, according to the U.S.\u00a0Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service. North Carolina has the most turkeys, with more than 54 million birds.\u00a0California ranks seventh, with a little more than 15 million birds.\u00a0 According to the National Turkey Foundation \u00a0industry group, Americans eat about 16 pounds of turkey a year, a number that has been flat since the 2000s. The consumption has doubled from the 1970s, when the average was 8.1 pounds per year.\u00a0 It is the fourth-most consumed protein in the nation. Cranberries First mass sold in 1914, cranberry sauce is now a mainstay.\u00a0 Wisconsin leads the nation in the number of acres used to produce cranberries, according to the USDA. The state was followed by Massachusetts and New Jersey.\u00a0 Cranberries are one of the few fruits native to the Americas. They grow in shrubs that can reach up to 7 feet tall. Although\u00a0the berries are not grown in bogs, the fields are often flooded at\u00a0harvest time because the berries float in water.\u00a0 The methods for commercial production of cranberries were developed by a group of farmers who later formed the brand Ocean Spray.\u00a0 Green beans The production of green beans, or snap beans as called by the USDA,\u00a0is spread nationwide. All but Connecticut, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts and Mississippi have some amount of acreage devoted to the production of these beans.\u00a0 Wisconsin is the bean king, with more than 70,000 acres of beans, followed by Florida and New York. The origins of the ubiquitous green been casserole comes from 1955, when recipe pamphlets were the \u201ctasty\u201d videos of that era.\u00a0 Dorcas Reilly created the recipe that was inspired by\u00a0various Minnesotan hot dish recipes. Mashed potatoes In nearly every Thanksgiving meal, the starch is the spiritual center to the dish.\u00a0 Idaho makes the most potatoes, with 30%\u00a0of all potatoes grown in that state. Other northern states follow Idaho\u2019s lead. Only three states in the nation do not produce any potatoes: Connecticut, Louisiana and New Mexico. Mashed potatoes have been a part of the western diet since Spanish conquistadors brought the spud back to Europe from South America. One of the earlier mentions of \u201cmashed\u201d potatoes was in the 1747 English cookbook \u201cThe Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy,\u201d by Hannah Glasse.

Fernando Vergara/AP hide caption toggle caption Fernando Vergara/AP Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos (left) shakes hands with with FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, after signing a revised peace pact in Bogota, Colombia, on Thursday. Fernando Vergara/AP Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Rodrigo Londono, the leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC, signed a new peace agreement Thursday, despite lingering opposition to the deal. The accord, which was struck earlier this month , follows an October referendum in which the country narrowly voted to reject a peace agreement reached in September. Voters opposed the September peace deal for its \"perceived leniency toward FARC fighters,\" as my colleague Colin Dwyer wrote, but Santos was still awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. This time, the peace deal will not be put to a country-wide vote. Instead it will go to Colombia's Congress for ratification, the Associated Press reports : The new accord introduces some 50 changes intended to assuage critics led by still-powerful former President Alvaro Uribe. They range from a prohibition on foreign magistrates judging crimes by the FARC or government to a commitment from the insurgents to forfeit assets, some of them amassed through drug trafficking, to help compensate their victims. The AP said the deal could be ratified \"as early as next week.\" Members of Uribe's party, however, who wanted harsher punishment for FARC rebels, are calling for \"protests to denounce what they say is a 'blow against democracy,' \" the AP said. Article continues after sponsorship The BBC reported the Thursday signing ceremony was \"deliberately\" smaller than the ceremony held for to sign the previous deal on Sept. 26. Today, about 800 people were in attendance, about a third as many as who attended the September ceremony. Though the peace accord aims to end more than 50 years of conflict between the government and FARC rebels, the lack of unified support could complicate the already difficult task of disarming fighters and implementing the terms of the peace. The AP says Colombia's government will have to \"[ensure] that the 8,000-plus fighters don't wind up joining criminal gangs rampant throughout the country, or the much-smaller National Liberation Army.\" ",

Revelers cheered and yelled, \"Thank you!\" as police walked the parade route, and the crowd gave special attention to the New York Police Department marching band. Spectators \u2014 sometimes standing 10 deep \u2014 held signs and balloons as they watched Santa Claus and his reindeer, Ronald McDonald and SpongeBob SquarePants pass by. Charlie Brown led the signature balloons as the parade kicked off with a ceremonial ribbon-cutting before the parade made its way to Macy's flagship store on 34th Street. Photos: 90th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Floats Through NYC Clowns carrying bundles of balloons rode down the parade route as marching bands from across the country entertained revelers. Costumed characters and dozens of celebrities, including singers Tony Bennett and Sarah McLachlan and Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez, were among the attendees. Annie Quinn traveled more than three hours from Albany to attend the parade with her cousin and two sisters \u2014 all three dressed in turkey costumes \u2014 scoring prime front-row seats along the route. \"We sat here for hours, but it was worth it,\" she said. \"This was the best parade I've seen in a while.\" But amid the fun, high-fives and cheers, there was an air of uncertainty about the possibility of an extremist attack after a recent posting in an English-language Islamic State group magazine that called the parade \"an excellent target.\" Nevertheless, the parade went off without a hitch Thursday. More than 80 sanitation trucks filled with sand were parked at intersections and other places, acting as barriers against any kind of attack. The NYPD said the sanitation trucks, which they have used before, would play a bigger role at this year's parade in the wake of the cargo truck attack in Nice, France, that killed more than 80 people. In addition to more than 3,000 uniformed and plainclothes officers, bomb-sniffing dogs and officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors walked among the crowds. At least one spectator said the intensive security made her feel secure. \"There are so many police officers out here you can't help but feel safe,\" said Sarah Bender, who brought her two young sons to watch the parade. \"It's a day to have fun, watch the balloons and celebrate with your family. You can't spend your life worrying about what could happen.\" Close ",

Louisville Metro Police Department spokesman Dwight Mitchell said officers responded to a call of multiple shootings about 1:30 p.m. at Shawnee Park. The injuries among those taken to University Hospital were not considered life-threatening, he said. \"Most people were here having a good time,\" Mitchell said. \"But unfortunately this tragic situation has happened.\" Mitchell had no information about any suspects or motives. The shootings occurred near the site of the annual Juice Bowl series of football games, which was attended by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. \"To have people with guns so disrespect life, Shawnee Park, and neighborhood tradition is sad and has no place in our city,\" Fischer said in a Twitter post. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those impacted by today's violence,\" he said. Youth games had just ended and two women's teams were in the middle of a flag football game when the shots were fired. Men's games scheduled to take place afterward were canceled. Charlotte Waddell, a cousin of the late Muhammad Ali who has attended the football event for decades, told The Courier-Journal that she had just finished talking to the mayor when she heard several gunshots. \"This is the worst Thanksgiving ever; I'll never be back,\" she said. \"I'm pretty shaken up.\" Associated Press ",

Only, instead of dining on turkey, the hundreds who gathered in this Maryland town actually dined with a turkey. His name is Perry. The strutting turkey, who's something of a star at Poplar Animal Sanctuary, stared down the hungry crowd with nothing to worry about \u2014 because the big dinner in Poolesville was no ordinary Thanksgiving feast: The diners there were only interested in vegan fare. Every year, they gather to forego the traditional dinner of turkey or pork roast, and instead eat vegan or vegetarian dishes right alongside the chickens, pigs and sheep. Terry Cummings and her husband, Dave, came up with the idea of this Thanksgiving shindig some 18 years ago with one goal in mind: to save farm animals from slaughter. And that idea, she says, has really caught on. Terry Cummings accepts tickets and welcomes guests to the Thanksgiving feast.

And she's got her favorites. \"Evie, the three-legged goat \u2014 she lost her leg because her owners did not take her to the vet when an emu stepped on her and she got a broken leg,\" Cummings says. \"They were going to shoot her, and the veterinarians called us and asked us to take her \u2014 and we've had her ever since.\" Now, here's your moment of Zen: Evie, the three-legged goat, dines politely with her turkey compatriot.

We've put together a list for you. USA TODAY NETWORK JC Penny's Mechella Wheeler hands out gift cards to shoppers a  sChristmas shopping began with a flurry of activity on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24, 2016, in Grand Chute, Wis. Thousands of shoppers put down their forks after Thanksgiving dinner and headed out to take advantage of doorbusters and in-store deals. Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) NEW YORK \u2014 Thanksgiving has traditionally boiled down to three \u201cFs\u201d: food, football and family. Many Americans can now add a fourth F to the mix, the \u201cfrenzy\u201d that comes with holiday shopping. We\u2019re not just talking Black Friday. More and more folks are shopping in person on Thanksgiving Day, with major retailers such as Best Buy, Macy\u2019s, Sears, Target and Toys R\u00a0Us, all opening their doors even before the last of the turkey has gotten cold. And online shopping is off to a brisk start. Shoppers spent $1.15 billion online between midnight and\u00a05 p.m. ET, a 13.6% increase over last year, reported Adobe Digital Insights. Adobe is forecasting Thanksgiving Day online sales to hit $2 billion for the first time, a 15.6% year-over-year growth increase. A record $820 million is expected to come from mobile devices, with $449 million spent by 5 p.m. ET. Adobe added that half the people it surveyed expect to shop after 5 p.m.\u00a0on Thanksgiving, after families pushed back from the dinner table. Black Friday tech deals: Making sense of it all \"Thanksgiving Day is still on track to either hit or come close to $2 billion, although heavy discounting seen in the early hours of the day has slowed revenue growth,\" Adobe reported. In all, an estimated 137.4 million consumers plan to or are considering shopping during the holiday weekend, according to the annual survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. Twenty-one percent of the weekend shoppers plan to shop on Thanksgiving Day itself, nearly the same as the 22% who did so last year. Still, not every retailer is comfortable with the idea. There\u2019s been a recent tug of war over whether retailers should be open on Thanksgiving Day,\u00a0with some deciding to close their doors this year to boost employee morale, score points with consumers who dislike the practice, and preserve the dwindling sales power of Black Friday. Tennessean Tom Alberty told The (Clarksville, Tenn.) Leaf-Chronicle last week, that he doesn't like shopping on the holiday because it takes away from family time. \"You have 300 days to shop throughout the year. Why do you pick Thanksgiving?\" Holiday Spending Headquarters The Mall of America stayed shuttered this holiday. CBL & Associates Properties Inc. planned to close 72 of its 89 malls this Thanksgiving after keeping them open the last three years, and electronics chain hhgregg\u00a0closed all of its 220 stores. But most major retailers decided to continue this newest tradition of kicking off the holiday shopping marathon right after \u2014\u00a0or even before \u2014\u00a0the Thanksgiving feast. Toys R Us, for instance, opened its doors at 5 p.m. on the holiday and will keep its stores open for 30 hours straight. \u201cOne of the reasons we opened our stores on Thanksgiving ...\u00a0is there\u2019s just a lot of people that enjoy that as part of their Thanksgiving tradition,\u2019\u2019 says Toys R Us\u2019 CEO Dave Brandon. \u201cAnd if they want to shop ... we want to be open and available to them.\u2019\u2019 In Wisconsin, Mike Franke knows something about tradition. He likes being first in line for Black Friday deals, so he planted himself in\u00a0the small slice of real estate right outside the Best Buy store in Delafield. Mike Franke holds a pair of commemorative chips he got from Best Buy after arriving at the Delafield store a week in advance to be first in line on Thursday. \u00a0(Photo: Mark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) Franke didn't arrive a few hours before Best Buy opened at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving.\u00a0Or even a few\u00a0days\u00a0before. No, Franke is a hearty shopper with time to burn, or at least vacation to use from his job at the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles. So he\u00a0took roost at Best Buy a full week\u00a0before the big sale. Arriving at 3 p.m. on Nov. 17, Franke set up two tents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one for sleeping, one for a living room outfitted with a heater and television hooked into Direct TV powered by his own portable generator. He's done this at the same Best Buy for the last 10 years. And\u00a0the object of his desire? A TV. \"It's tradition, believe it or not. Everyone thinks it's the deals, but it's the tradition. I actually met the other people in line 10 years ago, and we see them every year and we've become friends,\" Franke said Thursday afternoon, about two hours before he was the first person\u00a0through the sliding glass doors to snap up a Toshiba 50-inch 4K TV for $199 for his man cave. A line forms outside of JC Penny as Christmas shopping began with a flurry of activity on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24, 2016, in Grand Chute, Wis.

Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin \u00a0(Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) Charlie Nardi, a longtime manager for JCPenney, said there was a line of customers when he arrived at the Vero Beach, Fla., store at 1:15 p.m. Thursday, almost two hours before the 3 p.m. opening. \u201cCustomers who came so early are going to be happy to shop,\u201d said Nardi during an employee pep talk before the opening. \u201cAll of our hard work for the last couple weeks will come to fruition today. It\u2019s going to be crazy all day.\u201d At a nearby Best Buy, Vero Beach resident Bobby Lusquinos said he lined up at 2 a.m., 15 hours before the 5 p.m. opening. He came for the 50-inch Toshiba 4K television for $199 and a $349 Dell laptop. \u201cI rather have it in my hand than order online,\u201d Lusquinos said, adding that he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about order cancellation this way. Like Lusquinos in Florida, Jess Coulson of Milwaukee had a plan. Coulson visited in advance every store where she planned to shop on Thanksgiving, noting where in-store exclusive items were located. Some retailers handed out store maps to people in line, which Coulson said was a help. ",

Trump at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., this week. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump is expected to select as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross , a billionaire investor who became known as the \u201cking of bankruptcy\u201d for buying, restructuring and selling off steel makers and other fading industrial companies, officials on the transition team said on Thursday. After choosing national security hard-liners for some of his earliest appointments, Mr. Trump is now turning to a group of ultrawealthy conservatives to help steer administration policy. In addition to Mr. Ross, a generous contributor to his campaign, Mr. Trump is likely to choose Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor who is an owner of the Chicago Cubs and whose father founded TD Ameritrade, to be the deputy commerce secretary, the officials said. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would name Betsy DeVos , a school choice activist and Republican fund-raiser, as his education secretary. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest Shortlist. Mr. Ross, 78, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be $2.9 billion, is aligned with Mr. Trump on trade. He says the United States must free itself from the \u201cbondage\u201d of \u201cbad trade agreements,\u201d and he has advocated threats of steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Mr. Ross, the chairman of the private equity firm WL Ross & Company, has also pressed for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and reducing taxes and regulations on energy companies. During the general election, he hosted at least one fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his home in the Hamptons. There, Mr. Trump, who at the time was pondering his choice for a running mate, turned his deliberations into a party game, soliciting opinions from the donors in attendance. ",

    "text": "This year's Thanksgiving dinner is a time when we all need a little more comfort than usual Thanksgiving turkey Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times A hickory-smoked bird. A hickory-smoked bird. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) Jonathan GoldRestaurant Critic If\u00a0you\u2019ve been following the media recently, you may have noticed a certain lack of consensus on many things, including what an ideal Thanksgiving dinner might be. There have been instructions on how to spatchcock a turkey; how to slow-roast it; and how to bone it out, form it into a jelly roll around fennel sausage, and serve it in neat slices as kind of a turkey porchetta. My favorite butcher decided not to stock turkey at all this season. There is nothing like a Turkey of the Year. Even some usually happy cooks seem to be limping toward this holiday, wondering if anyone will notice if we substitute bottled chestnuts for fresh in the stuffing or canned squash for pumpkin in the pie.\u00a0 Thanksgiving is the happiest day of the year for passionate home cooks. This year, we are seeing a little less joy. Instead, more people may be gathering at Friendsgiving parties, at which the guest list is determined by compatibility rather than by accident of birth. A lot of publications, including this one, have been suggesting neat bourbon instead of wine as the proper Thanksgiving drink. Your best Thanksgiving yet Open link But even in this year, when events have pushed us apart,\u00a0where slights suffered in April still smart in the fall, when half of your crowd isn\u2019t talking to the other half and the weekly poker game hasn\u2019t convened since August, nothing has quite as much power to bring us together as an hour or two at the table \u2014 an hour or two devoted to family and friends, grace and gratitude for the blessings of America. We eat together and talk together as people with a single purpose. We are happy together at least until the bowl of cranberry sauce runs low. It was this idea of reconciliation, the idea of a single America, that led Abraham Lincoln to establish the first national Thanksgiving in 1863, at the height of the Civil War. \u201cIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u201c \u2026 order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict.\u2019\u2019 At the moment of the nation\u2019s deepest despair, Lincoln set aside the last Thursday of November as a \u201cday of Thanksgiving and Praise.\u2019\u2019 So in this difficult year we may need Thanksgiving more than ever \u2014 even if you\u00a0rarely tackle anything more taxing than a stir-fry or a grain bowl the rest of the year, even if you have yet to decide whether to truss the legs, make giblet gravy, or roast the bird on a bed of carrots instead of on a rack. Guests who wonder how they are going to react if Uncle Morris gets into one of his moods need Thanksgiving. So do people whom Cousin Rose hasn\u2019t acknowledged\u00a0since November 1980. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re dining on turkey biryani, turkey adobo, Persian turkey with barberries or clay-roasted Chinese beggars\u2019 turkey stuffed with black mushrooms and mustard greens. Or turkey made with the classical technique and stupendous amounts of butter; or the turkey that your mother learned how to make from Betty Crocker. Is crisp, brittle skin worth slightly dry meat? Is Deb going to show up with that big bowl of ambrosia again? Is a heritage bird worth the extra four dollars a pound? If\u00a0your oldest friend and your sister-in-law decide to bring pecan pies, which of the pies are you going to serve first? If all else fails, Salt and Straw is offering ice cream spiked with turkey-skin brittle; the Dog Haus, turducken sausages with gravy; and Trader Joe\u2019s, turkey-flavored potato chips.\u00a0But you are going to be at the table this afternoon, and so am I.

The shooting occurred at about 1:30 p.m. while the park was crowded with people attending the annual Juice Bowl football game, Louisville Metro Police Department spokesman Dwight Mitchell said. When officers arrived on the scene, they found two deceased black males, police said in a statement. Four other individuals were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment with non-life-threatening injuries, according to police. \"This is very tragic what's happened here,\" Mitchell said, according to local ABC affiliate WHAS . \"I'm saddened. We've had over 100 homicides in our city, something that hasn't happened in a long time. And we consider ourselves one of the safest cities in America but when you have a tragedy like this it certainly puts a damper on that.\" The shooting is under investigation. 0 Shares ",

What is happening in North Dakota is just a mere continuation of 500 years of colonization,\" Goldtooth said.

Stephanie Keith/Reuters Protesters block highway 1806 in Mandan during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, Nov. 23, 2016. \"An important thing to remember is that this movement and that this resistance is not born out of hate for others, but out of love and celebration for our continuous existence,\" Goldtooth said. Goldtooth said that many of the activists, who call themselves \"water protectors,\" celebrated this at the dinner Thursday night. \"There is a meal being served to the community of Cannon Ball to show our appreciation. That is the one that Jane Fonda is a part of, that meal is being served to the Cannon Ball community as a way of saying thanks for putting up with us,\" Goldtooth said. Goldtooth added that in the coming weeks, activists are expecting scores of veterans to \"deploy\" to Standing Rock, in order to show support for the \"water protectors.\" \"They\u2019re supposed to be coming over the next week or so. There has been a lot of support from veterans. It\u2019s a pretty beautiful thing to see,\" Goldtooth said. Energy Transfer Partners announced last week that it filed for a court order seeking the right-of-way to finish construction of the pipeline without further intervention from the federal government. The latest legal move followed a statement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that said it would delay issuing the final approval that the pipeline needs in order to complete construction in North Dakota, and invited the tribe to engage in further discussions. 0 Shares ",

Costco, REI, Home Depot, IKEA and even the Mall of America are just some of the more than 50 national retailers that pushed back and stayed shuttered on Thanksgiving Day. According to ShopperTrak, Thanksgiving Day sales dropped 12.5 percent in 2015, giving some retailers a good reason to give their employees the day off. \"They're listening to customers, how they shop, and making business decisions on that,\" said Ellen Davis, senior vice president of research and strategic initiatives for the National Retail Federation. For the first time in eight years, Legends Outlets in Kansas City, Kansas, was closed for the holiday, said Jennifer Wojcik, the mall's general manager. People shop for deals Thursday morning at a Big Lots store in Alhambra, California. Frederic J. Brown / AFP - Getty Images \"I think the first couple of years you saw a big boost in sales by opening on Thanksgiving, and then it was pushed earlier and earlier everywhere,\" Wojcik told NBC station KSHB of Kansas City, Missouri. \"But we've seen a lot of shifting the sales around throughout the weekend, and not necessarily increasing them.\" In Moorestown, New Jersey, Maria Butkovic got to stay home on Thanksgiving for the first in three years. She manages two malls in the area. Related: So Which Stores Are Closed on Thanksgiving? \"Well, I'm pretty excited,\" she told NBC News. \"I can relax a little and spend time with my family. I don't have to leave my own party early.\" Stores that stayed open saw a huge opportunity to steal foot traffic from their competitors as they face the end of a weak year in the retail industry.

(Shasta County Sheriff's Office) (Newser) \u2013 Sherri Papini, the mother of two who vanished after going for a jog Nov. 2, has been found alive. USA TODAY Sherri Papini (Photo: Provided) REDDING, Calif. \u2014 Sherri Papini, the Mountain Gate mom who went missing Nov. 2 after going on a jog, was located safe, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office announced Thursday . According to the sheriff's office, Papini was reunited with husband, Keith Papini. She is \"safe, in stable condition and receiving medical clearance at an undisclosed hospital.\" Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said at a news conference Thurday afternoon that a reward that was offered for Sherri Papini played no role in her safe discovery. Anonymous donor offers $50K 'ransom' for missing Calif. woman Bosenko says his office was notified at 4:30 a.m. Thursday that Papini had been released by her captor on a rural road near Interstate 5 in Yolo County. She was bound with restraints, but got help from a passing motorist on Interstate 5 near a county road, he said. The California Highway Patrol, Yolo County Sheriff's Office and medical personnel immediately responded to her location, he said. A family spokesman thanked law enforcement officers for their work and residents for support and prayers that were answered Thursday. \"This is a Thanksgiving beyond belief for all of us,\" Rod Rodriguez posted on the Facebook group Redding Crime 2.0. \"Although I have no details yet we are joyous that Sherri is alive and Keith is reunited with her at the hospital.\" Developments in the case came about two hours after friends, family and supporters gathered at Diestelhorst Landing in Redding for a somber balloon release to bring awareness that she was missing and to keep hope alive in finding her. Turkey Trot participants watched as hundreds of yellow balloons floated in the sky. Papini family friend Scott Bruland kept his hopes up as he addressed a crowd and recited a poem Keith Papini had written to his wife. Later during the event, Bruland said he was hopeful there would be a break in the case. \"We hope Sherri is found and is returned safely very soon.\" His wife, Jessica Bruland, passed out yellow ribbons during the event. She asked people to keep her friend in the eye of the public. Separately, a ransom-turned-reward website created by a mystery donor has been shut down. A check of the site around the time of the sheriff's office's announcement showed it was blank. A call to negotiator Cameron Gamble was not immediately returned.

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times It is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump \u2019s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nation\u2019s education system. For nearly 30 years, as a philanthropist, activist and Republican fund-raiser, she has pushed to give families taxpayer money in the form of vouchers to attend private and parochial schools, pressed to expand publicly funded but privately run charter schools , and tried to strip teacher unions of their influence. A daughter of privilege, she also married into it; her husband, Dick, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan a decade ago, is heir to the Amway fortune. Like many education philanthropists, she argues that children\u2019s ZIP codes should not confine them to failing schools. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls \u201cfailing government schools.\u201d Conservative school choice activists hailed her on Wednesday as a fellow disrupter, and as someone who would block what they see as federal intrusion on local schools. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where Ms. DeVos helped push legislation establishing tax credits for scholarships to private schools, called her an \u201coutstanding pick,\u201d a \u201cpassionate change agent to press for a new education vision.\u201d \u201cHer allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next,\u201d he wrote on Facebook . Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a \u201csmart, principled small-government conservative who\u2019s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy.\u201d But to teachers\u2019 unions, she is anathema. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos \u201cthe most ideological, anti-public education nominee\u201d since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago. Even some groups that share her support for charter schools worried that picking someone so closely identified as a champion of vouchers signaled that the Trump administration would try to starve public schools. As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed steering $20 billion in existing federal money toward vouchers that families could use to help pay for private or parochial schools, perhaps tapping into $15 billion in so-called Title I money that goes to schools that serve the country\u2019s poorest children. He called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issues of our time.\u201d Photo Betsy DeVos, the pick for secretary of education, has advocated charter schools and vouchers. Credit Drew Angerer/Getty Images Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education Trust-Midwest, an advocacy group in Michigan that supports charters but has been critical of a Michigan charter school law that Ms. DeVos has spent millions to defend, said the pick had \u201cthe potential to undermine the nation\u2019s hard-won progress by diverting resources from the young people who most need them, or by failing to uphold the federal government\u2019s responsibility to protecting the needs and interests of all students \u2014 especially the most vulnerable.\u201d Michigan is one of the nation\u2019s biggest school choice laboratories, especially with charter schools. The Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids school districts have among the nation\u2019s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by for-profit organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation. ",

(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and activist Ja'Mal Green speak to the media\u00a0Nov. 24, 2016, about the fatal shooting by police of a\u00a019-year-old man. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Elvia Malagon and Rosemary Regina Sobol Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A 19-year-old man was fatally wounded late Wednesday after a police sergeant said the man pointed a gun in his direction, but a grid search Thursday morning failed to uncover a weapon,\u00a0officials said.\u00a0 \"We were not able to locate a weapon as of yet,'' said Chicago police Superintendent\u00a0Eddie Johnson, who briefly made remarks about the shooting at a 1 p.m. news conference at headquarters. \u201cWe have some missing information in our timeline,\u2019\u2019 Johnson said. \"There are still many unanswered questions.\u2019\u2019 Police, including an Englewood District police sergeant responded at 11:07 p.m. to a battery in progress in the 1400 block of West 65th Street, said Johnson. The sergeant spotted a man that \"matched the description of the offender,\" in the battery, Johnson said. The sergeant identified himself as an officer and approached the man but he began running away. The sergeant gave chase. At some point during the pursuit the man \"turned and pointed\" a weapon at the sergeant two separate times, causing the sergeant to shoot him, Johnson said. The man, identified by his family as Kajuan Raye, was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where he was later pronounced\u00a0dead. \u201cUnfortunately, we still don\u2019t have a complete synopsis of exactly how and what transpired,\u2019\u2019 Johnson told reporters. \"There is still a lot of investigating going on.\" Fatal Police Involved Shooting Ahkeya White describes the events after her cousin was fatally shot Nov. 23, 2016, by a member of the Chicago Police Department in the 6500 block of Marshfield Avenue in Chicago's West Englewood neighborhood. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune) Ahkeya White describes the events after her cousin was fatally shot Nov. 23, 2016, by a member of the Chicago Police Department in the 6500 block of Marshfield Avenue in Chicago's West Englewood neighborhood. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune) A grid search for ballistics evidence of the area was completed overnight but no gun was found, Johnson said. There weren't any officers injured during the incident.\u00a0 Early Thursday, police blocked off the intersection of 65th Street and Marshfield Avenue along with surrounding alleys. Officers searched vacant lots using rakes and flashlights. An officer with a K-9 could be seen searching a parking lot near the intersection. The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting. IPRA spokeswoman Mia Sissac said the Englewood District does not have body cameras, so investigators are looking for witnesses that may have seen the incident or may have captured it on video. \u201cWe would hope that people would allow for some time. As we continue to go through the process we will learn more about the case,\u201d Sissac said. The sergeant will be placed on administrative duties for 30 days pending the outcome of the investigation.\u00a0 Community activists also spoke to reporters outside police headquarters, and decried what they said was a lack of transparency in the Police Department.\u00a0 \"I'm sickened,\" said Ja\u2019Mal Green. \"It does not take a day to find a gun. They (cops) messed up. \"Right now the city has to pay for what it has done,\" Green said. Ald. Raymond Lopez, who represents the 15th Ward, where the shooting occurred, was also at police headquarters.\u00a0 \"It's just sad,\" Lopez said. According to Cook County court records, Raye had pleaded guilty to a theft charge in September 2015, and he was given one year of court supervision. In 2016, records show Raye violated supervision and an arrest warrant was issued in his name July 25. Standing outside of a family home in the Brainerd neighborhood Thursday morning, Ahkeya White said the family was told that her cousin, Raye, had been standing with a friend at a bus stop near the intersection of 64th Street and Ashland Avenue just before the shooting happened.\u00a0 The bus stop is less than half a mile away from where police said the sergeant had responded for the battery call.\u00a0 After spending time at a home of a friend's mother, White said her cousin was waiting for a bus to return to Dolton when the officer approached him.\u00a0 \"They are saying that it was, you know, a battery, but if that's the case, the police officer showed up, it was only one person in the car,\" she said. \"If they are responding to a call, why is it only one person in the car? Then you pull up to the bus stop. So something is off and we need answers.\" She said the officer got out of his car and told his cousin and friend to go to the police car. That's when her cousin and friend ran from the officer, prompting the sergeant to run after her cousin.\u00a0 Raye was shot once in the abdomen, White said.\u00a0 She disputes that her cousin was armed during the incident, saying she is sure Raye didn't have a gun. \u00a0 \"There was no gun,\" she said. \u00a0 Man fatally wounded by police in West Englewood Provided by Kajuan Raye's family Family members identified Kajuan Raye, 19, of Dolton, as the man who was fatally shot by police.\u00a0 Family members identified Kajuan Raye, 19, of Dolton, as the man who was fatally shot by police.\u00a0 (Provided by Kajuan Raye's family) As news began spreading about the shooting and relatives gathered at the hospital, White said she wondered why the shooting happened. \"Why, because I know he didn't do anything to deserve it,\" she said. \"We want answers, but there's really no explanation for what happened other than this is what's been going on, and it seems, you know, that this is the norm. But it's unacceptable, it's unacceptable.\" \u00a0 She described her cousin as a typical 19-year-old who was figuring out what he wanted to do. The family had been urging him to return to school to get his GED.\u00a0 \"Tears are flowing and we are praying,\" she said. \"We'll miss him greatly.\" Wednesday's shooting happened about a mile from where officers last Friday fatally shot a man after seeing him shoot and wound another man, according to officials.\u00a0 Chicago Tribune reporter Grace Wong contributed.

Dozens of Shiite pilgrims were targeted for attack Thursday after the holiday, which marks the end of the 40-day mourning period after the anniversary of the 7th century martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson. Karim Kadim/AP A truck bomb detonated Thursday in the Iraqi city of Hilla and killed at least 57 civilians, including many Iranians, according to NPR's Alison Meuse. She said the attack targeted Shiite Muslims returning from an annual religious pilgrimage. Alison told NPR's Newscast unit: The truck bomb exploded next to a rest stop frequented by Iranian travelers. An official with Iraq's interior ministry says the explosives were concealed by the truck's cargo of vegetables. It was detonated as a group of Shiite pilgrims left a nearby restaurant. In addition to the dead, dozens of civilians were wounded and cars parked nearby were incinerated. The attack, which happened about 70 miles south of Baghdad, targeted Shiite Muslims returning from Karbala for the religious pilgrimage of Arbaeen. Alison said the Sunni extremist group ISIS, sometimes also known as ISIL, considers Shiites heretics and typically claims such attacks. In a statement Thursday, National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the violence \"was clearly intended to stoke sectarian tensions. The United States remains steadfast in its partnership with the Iraqi people and government, and this attack only serves to strengthen our resolve in defeating ISIL.\" NPR thanks our sponsors ",

    "text": "Email REDDING, Calif. -- A northern California mother of two who vanished nearly a month ago is safe after being found bound alongside an interstate, Shasta County sheriff\u2019s officials reported Thursday. Sherri Papini, 34, disappeared Nov. 2 after leaving home to jog, her family said. Her cellphone and headphones were found near the site where she was last seen. Her husband reported her missing when she didn\u2019t arrive to pick up their two young children from day care.\u00a0 Police and dozens of volunteers previously searched an area around Mountain Gate, an unincorporated community near Redding. Shasta County sheriff Tom Bosenko said investigators now believe Papini was abducted. Bosenko said she was released by her captor or captors early on Thanksgiving Day along I-5 in northern Yolo County. Allegedly bound with restraints, she flagged down a passing driver for help.\u00a0 Papini was freed from her restraints and taken to a local hospital where she was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and released, Bosenko said Bosenko said investigators have not located a suspect or suspects. He said they\u2019re searching for a dark colored SUV with two Hispanic females armed with a handgun. He said he didn\u2019t know a possible motive or whether the abduction was targeted or random. Papini and her husband Keith have been reunited. Papini\u2019s husband is \u201coverjoyed\u201d that his wife is safe, Bosenko said. He had previously been cleared as as suspect after taking a lie-detector test.\u00a0 Sheriff\u2019s officials said she\u2019s being interviewed by detectives from the major crimes unit. The Yolo County Sheriff\u2019s Office is assisting in the investigation. \u201cWe were all hopeful to have Ms. Papini recovered and brought home safely,\u201d Bosenko said. \u201cThat did work out...we had not given up hope.\u201d Family members previously said they believed Papini was abducted. They called her a \u201csuper mom\u201d who would never abandon her family. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Jason Arres said. The incident occurred at about 2 a.m. in the 1400 block of Fairway Drive, when the victim and five of his friends were returning from an evening out and got into a \"verbal dispute\" with a man who was driving through the complex, Arres said. The suspect, described as Hispanic and in his 20s, pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots before fleeing in a white SUV, he said. The shooting victim, a West Chicago resident, was hit in the shoulder. He has been admitted to Edward Hospital in Naperville, Arres said. It's not yet known how many shots were fired or what type of gun was used, he said. Police do not believe the incident was gang related. At least one of the five people involved in the lives in the apartment complex, Arres said. None of them knew the suspect prior to the incident, he said. Anyone who may have witnessed the shooting or has information about it is asked to call the investigations division at 630-420-6666. ",

    "text": "House GOP business-tax plan upends U.S. policy, bares corporate fault lines By Richard Rubin Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The rotunda of the U.S. Capitol is seen, Friday evening, Feb. 18, 2011, as Republicans and Democrats square off over a spending bill in the House of Representatives with votes and activity scheduled throughout the night on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Fault lines inside the corporate world are emerging over a\u00a0proposed\u00a0rewrite of the U.S. tax code, pitting\u00a0importers against exporters. At the heart of the fight is\u00a0a Republican plan in Congress that would impose corporate taxes on imports\u00a0while eliminating them from exports,\u00a0a move that would upend decades of tax policy. The proposed shift in effect would curtail existing\u00a0incentives for U.S. companies to move profits and operations abroad, but\u00a0it would also\u00a0pose new challenges for some global businesses. Retailers selling imported products and refiners using imported oil could be hardest hit, while some exporters could see their tax bills vanish. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the big importers fighting the big exporters,\u201d said\u00a0Lisa Zarlenga,\u00a0a former U.S. Treasury official and now a partner at international law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP. The proposal is part of House Republicans\u2019 blueprint for overhauling the entire U.S. tax code and has been around since June. While still not legislation, it has gained fresh momentum\u2014and scrutiny from corporations\u2014since\u00a0the November election sweep gave the GOP the chance to advance its ideas with its newfound one-party control of Congress and the White House. Lawmakers must now weigh competing business interests to\u00a0achieve\u00a0the country\u2019s first major tax revamp since 1986. \u201cTax reform always hits different industries differently,\u201d said Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to rise above those differences that makes tax reform hard.\u201d Other crucial elements of the business-tax plan would also be a major departure for the U.S. and include dropping the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. Companies would also be able to write off capital expenses immediately but couldn\u2019t deduct net interest. ",
