Published               November 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump claimed several early projected victories Tuesday night, while Hillary Clinton notched her first projected win in Vermont, as polls began to close in the historic 2016 presidential election \u2013 though the candidates remained locked in tight contests in key battlegrounds. \u00a0 Fox News projects that the Republican presidential nominee will win South Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana, where running mate Mike Pence is governor. But while Clinton has a lead in North Carolina, it\u2019s too early to declare a winner in the key swing state. It\u2019s also too early to declare a winner in the bellwether state of Ohio. In Virginia, where Clinton\u2019s running mate Tim Kaine serves as the state\u2019s junior senator, she has a lead over Trump, though it is too early to project a winner. It is also too early to say who will win Georgia.\u00a0 The incoming returns follow a frenzied day of voting across America marked by long lines and last-minute appeals for support from both campaigns.\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 While the race has tightened in recent days, the Democratic nominee still seemed to enter Election Day with the edge on the electoral map in her quest to become the first woman elected U.S. president. But Trump voiced confidence Tuesday about his chances in key battlegrounds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win a lot of states,\u201d the Republican nominee told Fox News, as he aims for an upset victory to cap his improbable campaign which came from behind to vanquish 16 competitors in the rowdy Republican primaries. The general election race between Clinton and Trump has been no less grueling. The presidential debates were marked by outbursts, interruptions and name-calling, as the candidates dealt before, during and after with a slew of campaign twists that kept the race in flux all the way to Election Day. The most recent bombshell was FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement 11 days before the election that the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton\u2019s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but Trump already was using the brief probe to revive the email controversy in the final days. The WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account also has become a constant distraction for the Democrat\u2019s campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal ethical concerns about the Clinton family\u2019s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries. Meanwhile, Trump dealt with \u2013 and denied \u2013 numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault that came out in October, following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women. The candidates swept all that aside in the closing hours of the race, as Clinton cast herself as a unifying force after a divisive election and Trump cast his bid as the vehicle to bring jobs and security back to America. \u201cToday is our independence day, today the American working class is going to strike,\u201d Trump said in Grand Rapids, Mich., overnight. Clinton, in North Carolina, said, \u201cWe have to bridge the divides in this country.\u201d No matter who wins, the 45th president will take office to an anti-establishment mood in the electorate and deep voter dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. Concerns about health care, the economy, terrorism and illegal immigration dominated the race and are unlikely to be settled by Tuesday\u2019s vote. Voters are also deciding Tuesday whether Republicans should keep control of both the Senate and House of Representatives. That decision will have a big impact on the success of the next president\u2019s agenda. Meanwhile, hundreds of state and local races including hot-button ballot initiatives are being decided as well. Advertisement ",

    "text": "by Julia Jacobo 11/8/2016 7:03:00 AM Election Flashback: 2012 ABC\u2019s ADAM KELSEY Four years ago, President Barack Obama won reelection over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by a margin of 332-206 electoral votes. Television networks began to call the election for Obama shortly after 11 pm, when a combined 74 electoral votes came in for the president upon the closure of polls in California, Oregon and Washington, and 18 votes from Ohio -- which had been too-close-to-call since closing earlier in the night -- put the Democrat over the top. Despite the apparent results, Romney waited almost three more hours to call Obama to concede, leaving the candidates to give their concession and victory speeches early Wednesday morning. Romney, expecting victory, reportedly did not draft a concession speech in advance, eschewing the norm of preparing two speeches. Both candidates urged the political parties to work together in the aftermath of the election. \u201cThe nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing,\u201d said Romney. \u201cOur leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.\u201d Added Obama, \u201cI believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America.\u201d by Adam Kelsey 11/8/2016 9:06:00 AM Election Day is here! From the candidates to polling stations all over the country, ABC News will have live updates from election coverage all day.\u00a0 \u00a0 by Julia Jacobo 11/8/2016 1:45:11 PM From ABC News' Alexander Mallin: \u00a0 Obama's Basketball Tradition Continues President Obama isn't risking a break with tradition on this Election Day, He shot some hoops with friends in Washington, D.C., early this morning. \u00a0 Obama was an avid basketball player before taking office in 2009, but admitted that his \"game is broke\" after spending more time on the golf\u00a0course. \u00a0 The president made an official commitment to play a game every Election Day after he broke with the routine the day of the 2008 New Hampshire primary, and lost that race to Hillary Clinton. He vowed \"never again\"\u00a0to skip the practice. \u00a0 His 2012 Election Day pickup game in Chicago featured special guest NBA hall of famer Scottie Pippen. \u00a0 by Julia Jacobo 11/8/2016 2:00:36 PM As Election Day arrives, here's a look back at the candidates' biggest tweets of the campaign season:\u2026 twitter.com/i/web/status/7\u2026 by ABC News via twitter edited by Julia Jacobo 11/8/2016 2:05:09 PM TODAY WE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! by Donald J.

    "text": "Election Day 2016: Voter turnout heavy as Chicagoans cite urgency to vote Election Day around the Chicago area on November 8, 2016. Jodi S. Cohen and Dawn Rhodes Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Bosnian immigrant Enver Agic didn't just go to the polls once on Tuesday. He made 11 trips to his polling site \u2014 taking with him nearly three dozen of his Bosnian neighbors so he could translate the ballot for those needing help and ensure their voices were heard. For four hours Tuesday morning, he rang their doorbells and then walked with them to the polling site in West Rogers Park. Agic, 48, who was wearing a shirt with an American flag that said, \"Keep Calm and Wave On,\" said he had never done that before. But he felt compelled to help Hillary Clinton get elected \u2014 particularly because of Donald Trump 's anti-immigrant comments. \"This time is very important. It is tight between Hillary and Trump. This is special, very special,\" said Agic, who became a U.S. citizen in 2001 after leaving his war-torn country in 1994. He said he has two sons, ages 9 and 14. \"Who will make a better future for my kids?\" Like Agic, many voters around the region said they felt an urgency to participate. Business was brisk at many polling places, with lines in the early morning and the expectation of more in the closing hours of balloting. For some voters, the choice was simple. Others talked about agonizing over the decision in recent weeks. Binyomin Weisswasser said he had a hard time deciding who to vote for, but ultimately chose Trump. \"This was not an easy election for me,\" said Weisswasser, 39, an ultra-Orthodox Jew who voted at the Croatian Cultural Center on Devon Avenue. Election Day 2016 People vote at O'Keeffe Elementary School on Election Day Nov. 8, 2016, in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 People vote at O'Keeffe Elementary School on Election Day Nov. 8, 2016, in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 See more videos \"We have seen our country take a downturn in the eyes of the world. We need to go in a different direction,\" he said. \"Trump's not a politician, and he has shown it in good ways and bad ways. ... I like that he is not always politically correct and speaks his mind. It gives me the feeling you know what you see is what you get. You may not like it, but you know what it is.\" In addition to choosing between presidential contenders Clinton and Trump, voters face choices for Illinois' junior U.S. Senate seat as well as contests that will determine control over the state legislature. The election, perhaps the most bitter and divisive in history, could end with the country electing its first female president. Dozens of voters, the majority of them African-American, poured into O'Keeffe Elementary School in the South Shore neighborhood during the first hour polls were open. Marilyn Hall, 60, did not say which candidate she voted for but acknowledged the potential for a momentous occasion. Voters cast their ballot among the vegetables Voters in Huntley cast their ballot at Tom's Farm Market on Nov. 8, 2016. Huntley High School students Emily and Sarah Glass talk about why it's important to vote today. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Voters in Huntley cast their ballot at Tom's Farm Market on Nov. 8, 2016. Huntley High School students Emily and Sarah Glass talk about why it's important to vote today. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"It's something to think about a woman president. Wow,\" she said, smiling. \"I wish her all the luck.\" No matter who prevailed, Hall said she would rely on her Christian faith to help guide the next leader. \"Somebody will become president today whether we like it or not,\" Hall said. \"I just hope they do a good job for all of us, not just some of us.\" Voting got off to a somewhat difficult start at O'Keeffe as election officials struggled to direct the stream of voters for four different precincts. Voters piled into one line that snaked through the school hallway without being told that there were different stations inside the gym designed to assist voters in specific precincts. \"They have no idea what's going on,\" one man said to a fellow voter. \"Everyone here at this table is new, and they don't know what they're doing.\" Those who finished casting their ballots took it upon themselves to help other frustrated voters and prevent them from making the same mistakes. By around 7 a.m., operations had smoothed out and lines moved along more quickly. At Lombard Village Hall, about 100 people waited in line to vote at 8 a.m. An election judge apologized to the people waiting. \"It's sort of good, though. We have more people waiting than we sometimes have voting for an entire day,\" he told the crowd. The statewide elections will serve as a referendum on voters' allegiances to either GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner or Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan . Millions of dollars have been spent on contests that will decide whether Democrats can keep their state House and Senate supermajorities or whether Rauner and the Republicans will gain more influence in the legislature. The Democrats' current majorities in Springfield \u2014 71-47 in the House and 39-20 in the Senate \u2014 have not been enough to overrule Rauner during a 16-month budget battle. Senate Republicans have no mathematical chance to get a majority in the Senate but hope to cut into the Democrats' edge. Further up the ballot, the race for the U.S. Senate seat pits Republican Mark Kirk, who is seeking a second term, against Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth . The race is among a handful that will determine which party controls the Senate next year. Polls have shown Duckworth has a comfortable lead. Many voters Tuesday said they were looking forward to the end of the 2016 election cycle, the nastiest in decades. Clinton, who grew up in suburban Park Ridge, is expected to pick up Illinois' 20 Electoral College votes. Illinois has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since 2000. In the Little Village neighborhood, Jazmin Moreno, 25, said she wasn't awed by either of her presidential choices, saying she really got into Bernie Sanders ' campaign during the primaries. Given two undesirable boxes to tick, she reluctantly leaned one way. \"I'd just rather it be Hillary than Trump,\" said Moreno, of Little Village, voting at Farragut Career Academy midmorning. \"I just don't think he'd be a good leader.\" Moreno said she hoped that a Clinton administration could involve Sanders, even informally, and bring some of his policy ideas to fruition. \"Maybe both of them could guide each other,\" Moreno said. Many voters said they were glad that the presidential campaign is over. \"We were given two horrible candidates,\" said Joanne Kennedy, of La Grange, who voted at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in La Grange with her husband, Mark. Both cast ballots for Trump. \"People are just voting against something,\" Joanne Kennedy said. \"I think society as a whole is this way. They're not voting for someone. They're voting to keep someone out.\" \"Trump is an idiot and Hillary's a crook. I think it's the least of two evils,\" Mark Kennedy said. Chicago Board of Elections officials said roughly 832,000 city voters had submitted ballots as of about 2 p.m. The voter turnout was on pace to rival the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. About 47 percent of those ballots were from early or mail-in voters, Allen said, and about 52 percent were from voters who visited polling sites on Election Day. Early voting in Chicago and suburban Cook County exceeded records. In Chicago, 325,112 voters cast early ballots through Monday, breaking the record of 260,378 votes cast in the 2008 presidential election , when President Barack Obama won his first term. In suburban Cook County, 321,495 voters had cast early ballots through Sunday, an increase from the previous record of 228,695 in the 2012 presidential election. There are more than 8 million registered voters in Illinois. Under a new state law, voters can register for the first time \u2014 or update their registration status \u2014 on Election Day. Voters arrived at a Wrigleyville polling site at 6 a.m. to find a line already snaking down the block, resembling the crowds that gathered a week ago to watch the Cubs in the World Series. The young voters were at Yak-Zies, a popular bar within sight of Wrigley Field. One election official wore a Cubs jersey while another used a flashlight to see ballots in the dark bar. Many voters wore Cubs hats, shirts and jackets and were recalling the long lines outside the bars during baseball season. \"It's nice to see the same crowds showing up for voting,\" said Katie Deplaris, 24. She said it felt odd to vote in a bar, though she welcomed the proximity to her home. \"It's almost like they knew we will need a drink after this one,\" she said about the historically bitter election. \"I can't wait for it to be over.\" Shannan Carlson brought her 3-year-old daughter to vote at Yak-Zies before going to work. She was surprised to see the long lines at 6 a.m. \"I thought I would be in and out, not 100-plus people waiting this early, she said. \"I've lived here 15 years and have never seen it like this. It makes me happy.\" Chicago Tribune's Annemarie Mannion contributed. ",

    "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Pinterest Share on Twitter Email Because almost everybody seems to love potatoes, it's worth mastering more than a few ways to make them. Mashed potatoes turn into potato cakes and shepherd's pies; scalloped potatoes can be an everyday side or a luxurious main; baked potatoes can be dinner, or hash browns. Read on for even more ideas and techniques. Before You Start When you're shopping, it's good to know which potato varieties are best suited to which cooking methods. Here's a breakdown. High-starch, like Idaho and other russets, are good for baking whole, mashing, roasting, salad and frying. Medium-starch, like Yukon Gold, Yellow Finn, Katahdin and Kennebec, are good for mashing, roasting, salad and boiling. Low-starch, a k a waxy potatoes, like Red Bliss, Norland, White Rose, most fingerlings and new potatoes, are good for roasting, boiling, salad. For an all-purpose potato to keep on hand, buy russets or Yukon Golds and keep them in a cool, dark place. Mashing Mashed potatoes are still the simplest and most satisfying potato dish for many meals. Whether you like them whipped and creamy, dense or fluffy, they are easy to pull off on a weeknight but special enough for a holiday. And when plain mash seems too \u2026 plain, expand on them with endless variations on herbs, aromatics and cheeses. Karsten Moran for The New York Times Basic Method Our favorite method for making mashed potatoes is in the video above. Here's how you do it: Put a large pot of water on to boil, adding a tablespoon of salt for each gallon of water. While the water heats, peel the largest potatoes you have (two per person is a good rule of thumb) and roughly cut into large chunks, about the size of a jumbo egg. Boil until tender all the way through (start testing after 10 minutes). Meanwhile, heat any flavorings (buttermilk, milk, cream, butter, stock) you plan to add. When potatoes are tender, scoop out and set aside a cup of cooking water. Drain potatoes and return them to the pot. Place over low heat and shake until most of the steam has dissipated. Add some of your flavorings, mash, and taste. Add salt. Repeat until mashed and seasoned to your liking. Adjust the texture with cooking water. Serve immediately or cover tightly and set aside for up to 30 minutes. Karsten Moran for The New York Times Tips Choose large potatoes to minimize peeling. It\u2019s better to overcook the potatoes than undercook them; be sure to cook them so they are thoroughly tender. Try adding garlic cloves and bay leaves or other aromatics to the cooking water; it adds another layer of flavor to the potatoes. Shake the drained potatoes in the pot over low heat, to get rid of excess water and add fluffiness. The traditional squiggle masher is not as efficient as those with a flat face and a grid pattern. A ricer makes the fluffiest mashed potatoes. Do not use a blender or food processor. Make sure everything you plan to add to the potatoes \u2014 milk, cream, butter, stock, cooking water \u2014 is very hot before you begin mashing. Quickly mashed potatoes are the fluffiest. The longer you work them, the denser and creamier the mash will become. Mashed potatoes will stay hot in a ceramic or glass serving bowl for at least 30 minutes. To keep them hot longer, place bowl inside a pan of simmering water on the stove and cover it tightly. You can also reheat cold mashed potatoes in this way; stir occasionally to redistribute the heat. Add another root vegetable to the mash. Some classic combinations: \u2154 mashed celery root to \u2153 mashed potato; \u00bd mashed turnips or parsnips to \u00bd mashed potato; \u00bd mashed cauliflower to \u00bd mashed potato. ",

Police are responding to an active shooting in Azusa. (KTLA-TV Channel 5) Veronica Rocha , Richard Winton, Joseph Serna and Ruben Vives One person was killed and at least three others were wounded Tuesday after an assailant armed with a military-style rifle opened fire in a residential area of Azusa, forcing authorities to secure the neighborhood and shut down nearby polling places,\u00a0sending voters scrambling to find alternate locations. Authorities said police were dealing with at least one female suspect who was heavily armed.\u00a0But several witnesses interviewed by The Times said the shooter was a man. \u201cThis is an active situation,\u201d said Azusa Police Chief Steve Hunt, adding it\u2019s too early to determine whether the violence was in any way related to the election. \u201cIt\u2019s very early to tell what the motive is, but it appears to be concentrated on the residential side, not at the polling station,\u201d Hunt added. At least one of the victims was headed to the polling station to vote,\u00a0a law enforcement source told The Times. Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Ron Singleton said\u00a0two people were airlifted\u00a0to an area hospital. The third victim, a\u00a0man in his 70s, was dead at the scene, he said. The shooting began about 2 p.m. after\u00a0a report of gunfire\u00a0in the 300 block of North Orange Avenue,\u00a0Hunt said. Officers arrived to find multiple shooting victims and a suspect with a rifle, he said. The suspect was armed with an assault rifle with \u201ca rapid fire capability,\u201d Hunt said. Police don\u2019t know if the rifle is fully or semi-automatic. The shooter immediately fired at least 20 shots at police, said the source. Under a hail of gunfire, officers took cover and returned shots at the assailant, who retreated into a home in the 500 block of Fourth Street, said the source, who requested anonymity because the case was ongoing. No officers were injured in the shooting. \u201cAfter the initial exchange of gunfire, there were victims down at the scene,\u201d Hunt\u00a0said. \u201cWe had to extract them from the scene.\u201d Officers had the shooter\u00a0surrounded, and were evacuating the area, the source said. \u201cThis is a very volatile and critical situation,\u201d Azusa Police Officer Jerry\u00a0Willison said. Roberto Chavez, 67, and his wife were sitting outside on their porch when they saw a heavily armed man fire at least 10 rounds at a group of people.\u00a0 Police quickly responded, Chavez said. About 20 officers swarmed into the neighborhood in the 600 block of West Fourth Street, he said. The gunman, who wore a white shirt and black pants, ran into a home about three doors down from Chavez\u2019s house, he said. Chavez said he recognized the man as someone who frequently visits and hangs out at his neighbor\u2019s home. He didn\u2019t know the man\u2019s name. He said some of the victims appeared to be neighbors in the area. Police told him to remain indoors because the gunman had barricaded himself inside a home. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous situation,\u201d he said. Fabiola Moreno, 47,\u00a0had just finished making a sandwich for her 5-year-old granddaughter\u00a0and was walking to the living room where her granddaughter\u00a0was watching television when she heard three gunshots. \u201cI thought it was just fireworks,\u201d Moreno said, \u201cBut then I thought about it and it really sounded more like gunshots.\u201d Moreno walked outside of her home to look and saw a man dressed in a white T-shirt\u00a0with a black vest and black pants. He was armed and was walking away from the parking lot of Memorial Park. She said the man stopped to reload his weapon and noticed her. \u00a0 \u201cI just ran inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI secured the door, grabbed my granddaughter\u00a0and ran into the bathroom, and we locked ourselves there.\u201d She said from inside, she heard police sirens and more gunshots. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he shot at the police or they shot at him, but it was several gunshots,\u201d Moreno said.\u00a0 \u201cI was afraid a bullet would come through the walls of the house.\u201d Moreno spoke to The Times by phone while locked in the room. Police said there appears to be someone \u201cdown\u201d inside a house but did not provide further details. Azusa Unified School District issued a\u00a0lockdown for Slauson Middle and Mountain View Elementary schools about 2:15 p.m.,\u00a0officials said. A nearby daycare center and preschool was also locked down. Los Angeles County Registrar Dean Logan said the shooting affected two polling stations. He urged voters to avoid the area and \u201cif necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location.\u201d Los Angeles Times staff writer Matt Hamilton contributed to this report. ",

She and DCCC Chair Ben Ray Lujan didn\u2019t sound optimistic about picking up a large number of House seats, much less retaking the House.

Ryan told a group of reporters Monday in Wisconsin that he is \u201cnot worried\u201d about any change in his position. \u201cI feel very good where I am,\u201d Ryan said outside of a local Republican party office, according to Politico. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve gotten such a great outpouring of support from members.

    "text": "CreditChet Strange for The New York Times But a handful of key states on the East Coast remain too close to call shortly after polls closed at 7 p.m., reflecting an intense battle for votes that could lead to a long night before a White House victor is determined. The two candidates campaigned intensely in Virginia, where it remained too early to determine a winner as polls closed across the commonwealth. And in Georgia, a Southern state where Democrats had expressed hope for a surprise victory, the race also appeared too close to call shortly after balloting ended. A race that has been dominated by ugly, personal attacks appears to have taken a toll on voters, and the country\u2019s mood appears darker and more pessimistic than it was four years ago, with about 60 percent of voters saying the country is seriously on the wrong track. Voters said they were eager for change in Washington, though they expressed dismay that issues had been overlooked in the brutal, long and nasty campaign. Here are some of the day\u2019s other highlights: \u2022 Does anyone trust the presidential hopefuls? Months of personal character attacks by both candidates appear to have left voters largely dissatisfied with their choices, according to early exit polls: Only about four in 10 voters viewed Mrs. Clinton as honest and trustworthy, while slightly fewer said that Mr. Trump was honest. \u2022 Whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is better? Mrs. Clinton\u2019s experience appears to pass the test with voters, about half of whom said the former senator and secretary of state was qualified to serve as president. Fewer than four in 10 said the same of Mr. Trump, who has embraced his status as a businessman and a Washington outsider. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u2022 How did the scandals play? More than four in 10 voters said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email controversies bothered them \u201ca lot,\u201d while a larger proportion \u2014 six in 10 \u2014 said they were bothered a lot by Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women. \u2022 So is this a record-breaking day for voter turnout? It is hard to say just yet. The Times\u2019s Steve Eder reports that voting was robust in the bellwether state of Florida; by 1 p.m., more than 900,000 voters had cast ballots in Miami-Dade County, surpassing the total turnout from four years ago. But in Lucas County, Ohio, data from the first part of the day suggested that voting tallies would be on par with 2008 and 2012, officials with the board of elections said. \u2022 The Hispanic population, a sleeping giant, is now awake. The Hispanic turnout will be far higher than it was in 2012. It has the best shot of deciding the election in Florida, where Hispanic voters represent a well-above-average share of the population. Trump campaign sues over Nevada voting. Video Nevada Judge Denies Trump Campaign\u2019s Suit A Nevada judge denied a request by Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign to preserve documents from early voting sites in Las Vegas, after the campaign alleged voting irregularities. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Judge Gloria Sturman asked Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer in one exchange. embed The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to have votes in Nevada impounded on the grounds that poll workers illegally extended early-voting hours to accommodate people who were waiting in long lines. Thousands of Hispanic voters lined up outside polling places to vote on Friday in Clark County, which is home to Las Vegas and has the state\u2019s largest Hispanic population. Record turnout has raised fears among Republicans that they could lose the battleground state, and Trump campaign officials have been complaining that the extension of hours in some locations is evidence that the election is rigged. The lawsuit alleges that the people were allowed to vote illegally because they cast ballots after the published closing times at polling places. The campaign also sent a letter to Nevada\u2019s secretary of state asking for an investigation into the allegations of \u201cegregious violations.\u201d Clinton and Trump vote. Parents held their children in the air to get a glimpse as Mrs. Clinton voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y., on Tuesday morning. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s a humbling feeling,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. Trump appeared to be in good spirits when he arrived at a Manhattan polling place on the Upper East Side just before 11 a.m. with his wife, Melania, to vote for himself . He was met with a mix of cheers and boos as he left his motorcade and waved to pedestrians. Inside Public School 59, Mr. Trump shook hands with other voters and offered high-fives to some children who came along with their parents. The vice-presidential candidates also voted in the morning.

Uncredited/AP hide caption toggle caption Uncredited/AP A judge has delayed jury selection in the trial of Dylann Roof, the white man charged in the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners during Bible study at a Charleston, S.C. church last year. The judge has ordered another competency exam for Roof. Uncredited/AP Dylann Roof, the man who allegedly killed nine African-American parishioners in Charleston, S.C., last year, has been ordered to undergo another competency evaluation by a federal judge hearing his case. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Gergel issued the order , writing that he expects a report based on that evaluation to be delivered to him on Nov. 14. He will hold a hearing two days later and rule on Roof's competency on or before Nov. 18. Jury selection has been suspended until Nov. 21. \"The Court is mindful that this delay in jury selection may be disappointing to some, but it is the Court's duty to conduct a fair trial and follow procedures which protect the legal rights of the Defendant,\" wrote Gergel. \"Under the present circumstances, the Court finds this brief delay in jury selection to serve the ends of justice.\" Roof faces 33 counts of hate crimes and other charges related to the killings at a Bible study meeting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015. He allegedly attacked after sitting in the gathering for almost an hour. Authorities say he left three people unharmed so that they could report on what happened.

For the latest exit poll data from the ABC News Analysis Desk, be sure to bookmark and refresh this page. If you're using the ABC News mobile app, star this page so you can get back to it easily. You can also check out Exit Poll Results and Analysis from Key Battleground States This is preliminary data and can change \u2014 sometimes materially \u2014 as the evening progresses. Be sure to check back for the latest. We've received the first batch of exit poll data and are updating with analysis as we receive it. The Candidates' Attributes Much of the campaign focused on Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s personal qualities. Both reached record levels of unpopularity for presidential candidates, with sharp divisions on their fitness for office on items such as qualifications, temperament and honesty. In preliminary national exit poll results 54 percent of voters see Clinton unfavorably, and 61 percent say the same of Trump. Comparable numbers in 2012 were 46 for Barack Obama and 50 for Mitt Romney . Substantial numbers say both Clinton and Trump are not honest and trustworthy \u2014 59 percent in Clinton\u2019s case and 65 percent in Trump\u2019s. It\u2019s unprecedented even to ask this question in an exit poll. Clinton does better, Trump less well, on qualifications and temperament. Fifty-three percent of voters say she\u2019s qualified for office, and 56 percent say she has the right personality and temperament for the job. Those decline to 37 percent and 34 percent for Trump, respectively, in these preliminary exit poll results. The exit poll also asks which of four other candidate qualities are most important. In preliminary results, 38 percent say it\u2019s someone who can bring about needed change versus 22 percent who say it\u2019s experience and 22 percent who cite good judgment. Only 15 percent say it\u2019s \u201csomeone who cares about people like me.\u201d Among Clinton supporters, experience and judgment are most important, while among Trump supporters, it\u2019s nearly all about change. Fear Factor Trump incites greater fear than Clinton, especially among women: 43 percent of women say they\u2019d feel scared if Trump were elected, compared with 31 percent of men. Nearly twice as many women as men say they\u2019d feel excited by a Clinton win, 22 vs. 12 percent, respectively. And, 72 percent of Clinton supporters feel scared by a Trump presidency, 59 percent of Trump supporters are scared by a Clinton presidency. Right Track / Wrong Track When it comes to views on whether the country is headed in the right direction, just 31 percent of Clinton voters say the country is \"seriously off on the wrong track.\" Compare that to Trump voters -- a whopping 93 percent of whom say the country is on the wrong track. Shelby Lum/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP Voters line up in voting booths to cast their ballots at Robious Elementary School in Chesterfield, Virginia, Nov. 8, 2016. Trump's Treatment of Women and Clinton's Emails Trump\u2019s treatment of women and Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state have been highly controversial issues. In preliminary exit poll results, 51 percent of voters say Trump\u2019s treatment of women bothers them a lot, while fewer, 45 percent, say the same about the situation regarding Clinton\u2019s emails. (Note: Interviews representing as much as 40 percent of the national exit poll were conducted in advance of the FBI\u2019s announcement Sunday that it\u2019s renewed review found nothing to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.) Anxiety and Dislike Given their unpopularity, Clinton and Trump alike are seeing lukewarm support \u2014 including many voters who chiefly oppose their opponent rather than supporting them. This is especially so in Trump\u2019s case, and far different from what we saw in 2012, when 70 percent of Obama\u2019s voters strongly supported him, as did 60 percent of Romney\u2019s, compared with only 10 percent who voted against their candidate\u2019s opponent. Many voters express concern about a Clinton or Trump presidency, and excitement is subdued. Seventeen percent are excited about the prospect of a Clinton presidency, while 29 percent are downright scared about it. On the flip side, just 13 percent are excited about a possible Trump presidency in preliminary exit poll results; 37 percent, scared of it. The divisions are profound. Among Clinton supporters, 72 percent are scared of Trump in office; among Trump voters, 60 percent are scared of what Clinton would do. Previous positive and negative anticipation peaked in 2008, when 37 percent of voters were excited about an Obama presidency and 33 percent were scared about McCain. When Voters Made Their Decisions When did voters make their decision? Despite the frantic finish and a series of major events near the end of the race, 75 percent of voters say they decided on their vote more than a month ago. Still, 24 percent of voters say they made their choice in the last month. They\u2019ll both be important groups to watch as the night goes on. State of the Country Whatever their divisions, many voters share a sense of frustration with the political situation. Sixty-one percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results say the country\u2019s on the wrong track. That\u2019s similar to its level in 2012 when Barack Obama won re-election and down from 75 percent in 2008 at the peak of the economic crisis, but well above its level from 1996 to 2004. Sixty-nine percent are dissatisfied with the way the government is working, including 23 percent who are angry about it \u2014 a sentiment especially prevalent among Trump voters. And 49 percent say the government\u2019s doing too many things best left to individuals and business, similar to most previous elections. Clinton and Trump voters are vastly different on these measures, with Clinton\u2019s much more positive and Trump\u2019s much more negative. For example, 92 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters feel the country\u2019s on the wrong track and 88 percent are dissatisfied with the how the government\u2019s working, or angry about it. On the Economy The state of the economy relates to these sentiments. Eight years on from the Great Recession, 62 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results still rate the economy negatively \u2014 \u201cnot good\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d Still, that\u2019s well down from 76 percent in 2012 and a vast 93 percent in 2008. Thirty percent say their family\u2019s financial situation has improved in the last four years, but about as many, 27 percent, say it has gotten worse. (The rest say it\u2019s about the same.) It\u2019s the first time \u201cbetter\u201d has outnumbered \u201cworse\u201d on this question since 2004 and the lowest \u201cgetting worse\u201d result since 2000. Expectations, though still not great, are better than they\u2019ve been: In preliminary results, 37 percent of voters think the next generation will be worse off, but 33 percent think it will be better off, again the least negative differential since 2000. Again pessimism is far higher among Trump supporters. Amber Arnold/Wisconsin State Journal/AP Photo Voters cast their ballots at the Wil-Mar Neighborhood Center on the Near East Side of Madison, Wis., Nov. 8, 2016. Integrity of the Vote Just 28 percent of Trump voters say they\u2019re very confident their votes will be counted accurately versus 68 percent of Clinton voters. There was no partisan gap on this question when it was asked in the 2008 exit poll, and the division this year is bigger even than the one between Kerry and Bush voters in 2004, after the contentious 2000 election. On the Issues Preliminary exit poll results indicate that the economy/jobs is the top issue for voters (52 percent), followed by terrorism (18 percent), foreign policy (13 percent) and immigration (12 percent). There\u2019s a big difference, though by candidate support, with Clinton\u2019s supporters relatively more focused on the economy and foreign policy, Trump\u2019s on terrorism and immigration. Voters split roughly evenly on whom they trust more to handle the economy (46 percent say Clinton versus 48 percent who pick Trump), while Clinton has a clear advantage on foreign policy (53 percent versus 42 percent) and a slimmer one on serving as commander in chief (49 percent of versus 46 percent). Immigration Many more voters say undocumented immigrants should be given a path to citizenship or be deported (71 percent versus 25 percent). And more oppose rather than support one of Trump\u2019s signature policies, building a wall along Mexican border (54 percent versus 40 percent) in preliminary exit poll results. Not surprisingly, Clinton and Trump voters differ widely on these immigration policy issues. Also, 9 percent of voters were not born in the United States \u2014 a group to watch in later results. The Obama Factor Fifty-four percent of voters approve of the job Obama is doing as president, 34 percent strongly so in preliminary exit poll results. That may help Clinton, but it\u2019s no guarantee: In 2000, a robust 57 percent approved of Bill Clinton\u2019s job performance when Al Gore tried unsuccessfully to follow him. Slightly more voters think the next president should continue Obama\u2019s policies (29 percent) or change to more liberal ones (18 percent). Forty-six percent say the next president\u2019s policies should be more conservative that Obama\u2019s. Turnout Turnout among key groups is critical. ABC News/Washington Post pre-election polls indicated that, apart from partisanship and ideology, Clinton\u2019s success is dependent on turnout among women, college-educated whites (especially college-educated white women), nonwhites and young voters. Trump needs turnout from men, whites overall, non-college-educated whites (especially non-college-educated white men) and evangelical white Christians. Turnout and vote margins among these groups will be worth watching tonight. Early turnout across partisan lines looks quite similar to 2012, 37 percent Democrats, 32 percent Republicans. On race, whites could be slightly down \u2014 70 percent in preliminary exit poll results, 30 percent nonwhite, including 12 percent black and 11 percent Hispanic. Women outnumber men in 2016 early results, as they have since 1984. If the gender gap that was evident in pre-election polling holds tonight, it\u2019ll be an advantage for Clinton. Early exit poll results show a record level of turnout among college-educated voters, 50 percent versus 50 percent non-college-educated voters. Again, these are early results, but it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on and would be another Clinton advantage if it holds. College-educated white women outnumber non-college-educated white women (20 percent versus 17 percent), which would be a first in exit polls. College-educated white women are by far Clinton\u2019s strongest group among whites. There\u2019s no indication in early results of increased turnout among non-college whites, Trump\u2019s core group. White evangelical Christians make up 27 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results, similar to 2012, and a very strong group for Trump in pre-election polling.

MANDEL NGAN / AFP - Getty Images Republican nominee Donald Trump continued to question the integrity of American elections throughout the day Tuesday, repeatedly claiming without evidence that the polling places and electoral system is \"rigged.\" \"We have to keep the system honest. We have a very, very, we have a very, very serious situation with the whole process, and I've been talking about the rigged system for a long time,\" Trump said on Fox News on Tuesday afternoon, adding moments later: \"It's largely a rigged system. And you see it at the polling booths, too.\" You don't, actually: Voter fraud in person is extremely limited. One Loyola researcher tracked a billion ballots and found 31 credible cases of voter fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found it more likely for an individual to be struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud. Long lines, broken machines, and problems with voter rolls are typical on a day when millions cast their ballots. Nearly everyone agrees the voter rolls are riddled with inaccuracies and out-of-date voter information, but what is missing from Trump's argument is any evidence that those problems are being used to falsify or defraud election results and ballots.

See all of our maps: State-by-state results and the California races and propositions An hour-by-hour guide to when polls close and what happens next. Exit pollsPresident Nov. 8, 2016, 3:10 p.m. Exit polling indicates Clinton has strong advantage among Hispanic voters, similar to Obama Michael A. Memoli (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Early exit poll data indicates that Hillary Clinton is trouncing Donald Trump among Hispanic voters, just slightly behind the advantage President Obama enjoyed over Mitt Romney in 2012. Those voters broke 65% for Clinton, compared with\u00a027% for Trump, according to exit polling. In 2012, Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote,\u00a0to 27% for Romney. Throughout the race, Clinton's campaign has faced questions about how well she would perform among the so-called \"Obama coalition\" \u2014\u00a0primarily young voters, minorities and women. Of late, the campaign has responded by touting what they call the\u00a0\"Clinton coalition\" \u2014\u00a0one that may not see the same strength among African American voters but potentially offsets it with a stronger Hispanic vote, and the support of Republican-leaning women. The initial wave of voter interviews finds that Clinton is lagging slightly in both categories. Obama enjoyed 93% support among black voters, and Clinton is at 87%, exit polling suggests. But these totals are subject to change, and the\u00a0margin of error could mean she's holding her own. Latest updates ",

That\u2019s more than what consumers spend on cereal ($6 billion), pet grooming ($5.4 billion) and legal marijuana ($5.4 billion). The nonprofit\u00a0 Center for Responsive Politics \u00a0estimates spending on the Clinton-Trump contest at more than $2.65 billion, actually down a bit from $2.76 billion in 2012 when Democratic incumbent Barack Obama defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney. \u00a0 --CBS News\u2019 Jonathan Berr 6:21 p.m. ET\u00a0Ohio Governor and former presidential candidate John Kasich is wasting no time after Election Day -- he plans to deliver a speech on his vision for the future of the GOP just two days after voters cast their ballots, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported Tuesday.\u00a0 Kasich refused to back Trump\u2019s candidacy and did not attend the Republican convention, though it was held in Cleveland. The Enquirer reported that Kasich is likely to give the speech even if Trump wins.\u00a0 Kasich voted for John McCain , who was the GOP nominee in 2008. 6:06 p.m. ET Here are more findings from the national early exit polls and how voters feel about several top issues: Seventy-one percent of voters say that illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 25 percent say they should be deported. Almost 9 in 10 Clinton voters want illegal immigrants offered a chance to apply for legal status, while Trump voters are split with 49 percent supporting legal status and 45 percent saying they should be deported.\u00a0 There is more division over building a wall along the border with Mexico: \u00a054 percent of voters oppose the wall and 40 percent support it. Eighty-eight percent of Clinton voters oppose building a wall, while three quarters of Trump voters support it.\u00a0 Voters also have very different views on the effects of international trade on U.S. jobs: 41 percent of voters say that trade takes away jobs, 39 percent say that it creates more U.S. jobs, and 11 percent say that it has no effect. Clinton voters are more likely to believe that trade creates jobs while Trump voters say that it takes away U.S. jobs.\u00a0 --CBS News poll analyst Stanley Feldman 5:30 p.m. ET Some early state-level exit polling is coming in as well.\u00a0 In Georgia, Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia the majority of voters said the most important issue facing the country was the economy. \u00a0When voters were asked, finding a president who can bring needed change is the most important quality when deciding their vote for president. Here, for example, is a breakdown of voters\u2019 most important candidate qualities in Ohio: CBS News More Ohio voters, 46 percent, think trade with other countries takes away jobs. The majority of Florida voters (70 percent) believe that illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Over half (59 percent) say that immigrants in the U.S. do more to help the country than hurt the county. Almost half of New Hampshire (46 percent) and Pennsylvania (42 percent) voters are dissatisfied with the federal government. \u00a0 Two-thirds of Virginia voters say that the American economic system favors the wealthy. --CBS News poll analyst Melissa Herrmann 5:15 p.m. ET The first round of early exit polls are in. Here are a few highlights:\u00a0 Voters nationally said they were looking for a candidate who can bring needed change, followed by experience and judgment. Asked about the most important candidate quality they were looking for, 38 percent said change, 22 percent said someone who has the \u201cright experience,\u201d 22 percent \u00a0named \u201cgood judgment\u201d and 15 percent said they were looking for someone who \u201ccares about people.\u201d Most voters, 61 percent, say the country is on the wrong track (and 35 percent say it\u2019s headed in the right direction). The percentage of \u201cwrong track\u201d voters is up from 2012, when 52 percent said the country is on the wrong track, but is lower than 2008, when 75 percent said the country is on the wrong track. In addition, 69 percent say they are dissatisfied or angry about the way the federal government is working. The economy was by far the top issue among voters this fall. Asked to name their most important issue, 52 percent named the economy; 18 percent said terrorism, 13 percent said foreign policy and 12 percent said immigration. --CBS News\u2019 Emily Schultheis 5:02 p.m. ET\u00a0Continuing on his theme of predicting a \u201crigged\u201d election, Trump has tweeted alleging voting machine problems in Utah -- a state in which he\u2019s getting a strong challenge from independent candidate Evan McMullin. In the tweet, Trump cites a CNN report on voting irregularities in Utah, which appears to be from this blog : Just out according to @CNN : \"Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016 4:43 p.m.\u00a0ET\u00a0It\u2019s no secret that many major Republican Party figures have not endorsed Trump -- and this afternoon, two of them declined to vote for Trump when they went to the polls. A spokesman for former President George W. Bush said Tuesday that Bush did not vote for either Trump or Clinton. The spokesman, Freddy Ford, told CBS News that Bush and his wife Laura \u201cleft the top box blank and voted Republican downballot.\u201d The Bushes voted early, casting their ballots two weeks ago. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), one of Trump\u2019s former GOP primary opponents who has been critical of the Republican nominee in the months since, tweeted that he voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin: I voted @Evan_McMullin for President. I appreciate his views on a strong America and the need to rebuild our military. #3 \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 8, 2016 4:23 p.m. ET GOP nominee Donald Trump tweeted about his election night plans: I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016 2:53 p.m. ET\u00a0 In the Nevada complaint on early voting , Trump\u2019s campaign asks that the court isolate ballots that were cast at the time and location in question at four locations: Cardenas Market, Deer Springs Town Center, Silverado Ranch Plaza, and the Las Vegas Strip.\u00a0 But Trump lawyers also went beyond that, asking for the names of pollsters and data from machines.\u00a0 At the 2 p.m. emergency hearing, the judge seemed skeptical of the lawyers\u2019 request, saying it will likely run into serious privacy concerns. The judge seemed particularly bothered by the request to sequester ballots from a location \u2013 to match them up with specific people \u2013 and said that there is no way to do that. The judge eventually denied the Trump campaign\u2019s petition to isolate ballots that were allegedly cast after polls closed, suggesting the team pursue other administrative remedies first. --CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid ",

(Photo: Robert Deutsch) 15 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE No one wants a repeat of the Karl Rove scene this year. While appearing on Fox News as an analyst on the election night in 2012, the Republican politico threw a hissy fit shortly before midnight ET as the conservative news network projected President Obama winning his second term. \u201cThis is premature,\u201d he said, as Ohio was still being counted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful about calling things.\u201d In their own diplomatic ways, his colleagues at Fox\u2019s decision desk basically told him it was over for Mitt Romney. And the riveting scene of the internal strife now lives on forever on YouTube, with well over a million views. Caution again is the operative word for the networks and other major news organizations as the hours tick on toward the finality of one of the most contentious presidential races in history. Chastened by the 2000 fiasco -- when several news organizations projected early a Florida victory for Al Gore \u2013 the networks are emphasizing accuracy over speed. \u201cThe race to be the first was more of an issue before\u201d 2000, says Joe Lenski, co-founder and executive vice president of Edison Research, whose exit polling data is used by major news organizations. \u201cI think the priority now is to be correct. And frankly, there\u2019s not 100% trust of the media by a lot of people. We saw that in 2012 with Karl Rove.\u201d Still, impatient voters are addictively seeking the latest updates and projections, however premature. Any they'll get their fix in other places this year as social media, particularly Twitter, and other upstarts finagle their way into the crowded media landscape covering the elections. Posted!

By Aaron Blake November 8 at 7:03 PM Follow @aaronblake Donald Trump assured us at various points in his campaign that he was going to win or compete for oodles of blue states, up to and including California and New York . The bar on Election Day has been set considerably lower. Indeed, it seems the Trump campaign is preparing to put a good face on a well-fought defeat. As voters headed to the polls to decide the next president on Tuesday, the Trump campaign and its top surrogates have conspicuously sought to set expectations lower than their candidate himself has \u2014 and lower than outright victory. Heck, even Trump himself seems to be lowering\u00a0the bar. In a morning appearance on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said he would win in Iowa and also, he \"thinks,\" Ohio and New Hampshire. Beyond that, though, the usual Trump bluster about\u00a0winning everything was gone. He said he thought he would do well in states like Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin, but he didn't promise victory in the kinds of states that he needs to actually win the presidency. \"We're going to win a lot of states. I mean, who knows what happens ultimately,\" he said. Then he quickly checked himself: \"We're going to win.\" His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, also seemed to begin the process of offering excuses for his likely loss \u2014 pointing, as expected, to the lack of unity and support from the GOP establishment. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday that he had voted for independent Evan McMullin rather than Trump, and George W. Bush also reportedly abstained from voting for president . Conway told MSNBC that Trump \"didn\u2019t have the full support of the Republican infrastructure\" and that it would be \" really too bad \u201d if Trump lost because Bush and former\u00a0GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney didn't support him. (She followed that up with a tweet explaining she wasn't blaming the RNC, but rather other establishment Republicans.) Trump Campaign & RNC @Reince hand in glove. This is about GOP elected officials bragging they voted 3rd party or skipped top of the ticket https://t.co/qOoTXUHOFL \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 8, 2016 Earlier in the day on Fox News, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer seemed to suggest that success would be judged not by victory overall, but by winning states that President Obama won in 2008 and 2012 and doing better than John McCain and Mitt Romney. \"We are going to have more electoral votes tonight than we\u2019ve had in the last two cycles, and I think that\u2019s an important thing to note for all of the media, mainstream media narrative,\" Spicer said. \"We will do very, very well tonight. We will bring millions of people into this process, and I think we\u2019ll see a resounding victory in more and more states that Obama carried twice.\u201d And deputy Trump campaign manager David Bossie appeared on MSNBC and seemed to admit to the narrow path to victory that his candidate faces. He said the path requires winning North Carolina, Iowa, Florida and Ohio, but seemed to acknowledge the next state wasn't quite so obvious. \"And then we start looking at their map,\" Bossie said.

By Mark Berman , William Wan and Sari Horwitz November 8 at 7:58 PM Follow @markberman Follow @thewanreport Follow @sarihorwitz Many people were excited to vote on Election Day, but not everyone chose to post a selfie with their \"I Voted\" sticker. Some people took to social media to post irregularities they spotted at the polls. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) As voters flooded polling places across the country on Election Day, some reported problems such as broken machines, long lines and voter intimidation in states ranging from Texas to Pennsylvania. While voting appeared to proceed without headaches in many locations, election observers said they expect a significant increase in the number of issues reported nationwide. In particular, voters in jurisdictions across the country encountered problems with malfunctioning voting machines, highlighting issues with the aging infrastructure expected to support tens of millions of voters turning out on Election Day. One major area experiencing technological problems was\u00a0Durham County, N.C., which has more than a quarter-million residents outside Raleigh. Officlas there had technical issues with electronic poll books used to check in voters. As a result, state authorities told Durham officials to use paper poll books, rather than electronic ones, eventually leading to some delays. (Durham was already using paper ballots.) Local officials asked the\u00a0North Carolina State Board of Elections to extend voting hours in some precincts, a request that was echoed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. On Tuesday evening, state officials agreed to extend voting in eight precincts , pushing back the closing of polls by as much as an hour in some Durham locations and by 30 minutes in Columbus County. A group had also filed a lawsuit Tuesday afternoon seeking to keep the Durham polls open until 9 p.m. Violence also erupted Tuesday near a polling location outside Los Angeles, although police there said it did not appear to be related to the election or voting. The first high-profile legal action of the day saw Donald Trump\u2019s campaign headed to court for a hearing in Nevada after\u00a0 filing a lawsuit \u00a0arguing that polls were improperly kept open late during early voting in Clark County. According to the lawsuit filed by the Republican nominee, this was done \u201cto help Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent. Trump\u2019s campaign asked for the voting machines and ballots involved \u201cbe set aside, sequestered and impounded\u201d to preserve the status quo \u201cin the event of post-election challenges.\u201d A spokesman for Clark County noted that early voting records already have to be preserved under state law and said that no polling precincts were improperly kept open.\u00a0At a hearing Tuesday morning, a skeptical judge questioned the Trump campaign\u2019s attorney and denied the request to preserve evidence in the case. This lawsuit follows a raft of recent legal wrangling in the days leading up to the election.\u00a0As the bitter presidential campaign rumbled toward its conclusion, officials across the country have been bracing for the possibility of confusion and chaos on Election Day , owing to a flurry of new voting restrictions and Trump\u2019s calls for his supporters to closely monitor polling places.

Nov. 8, 2016 People line up to vote in New York. Matt McClain/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Voters in Florida, a key battleground, reported multiple accounts of voters saying they have encountered aggressive, intimidating behavior,\u00a0according to a nonpartisan group monitoring election issues nationwide. \u201cIn Florida we continue to receive a substantial amount of complaints about voter intimidation,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019\u00a0Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is running an independent effort to field voter complaints and questions. Clarke said her group received reports from Miami-Dade County of \u201cyelling, people using megaphones aggressively.\u201d In Jacksonville, in the northeast corner of the state, Clarke said, \u201can unauthorized individual was found inside [a] polling place.\u201d This person was at St. Paul\u2019s Methodist Church, a polling precinct in what Clarke described as a part of Jacksonville with predominantly black residents. \u201cHe was asked to leave and refused,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough\u00a0our intervention and calls, that individual has been removed. Unauthorized individuals have no place in the polls.\u201d [ Live updates on Election Day 2016 ] During early voting, Clarke\u2019s group also received reports from Hollywood, Fla., about \u201caggressive individuals hovering around individuals as they approach the polling site,\u201d she said during a briefing with reporters. \u201cSome have turned away because they did not feel able to freely cast [a] ballot.\u201d Clarke said her group has received reports from about 80,000 voters since the beginning of early voting and expects that figure to reach 175,000 reports by the time the polls close. In 2012, the group received 90,000 calls total on Election Day. Voters wait at Grady High School in Atlanta. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) On Tuesday afternoon, Colorado officials reported what could have been one of the biggest disruptions of the day. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State\u2019s office said that voter registration system was down in parts of the state, which meant that clerks could not process mail ballots and also meant that in-person votes would be viewed as provisional. The issue was resolved shortly before 3:30 p.m. Denver time. During a telephone interview Tuesday on Fox News, Trump did not say whether he was expecting to argue with the outcome of the election, but he said he believed there were reports of voter fraud happening across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s happening at various places today, it\u2019s been reported,\u201d he said. \u201cThe machines, you put down a Republican and it registers as a Democrat, and they\u2019ve had a lot of complaints about that today.\u201d It was not immediately clear what accounts Trump was referring to when he mentioned \u201ca lot of complaints\u201d about the issue. A\u00a0 report out of\u00a0Clinton Township, an area near Pittsburgh, quoted some voters saying their tickets were switching from Trump to Clinton. According to that report, officials there said the machines were fixed and the problem resolved. There have been other issues with machines, including some cases of them showing incorrect votes , though it was unclear how widespread this was. [ Trump campaign files lawsuit in Nevada aimed at early voting ] Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said that they are seeing more problems with voting machines than they have seen in past election years. \u201cThere are more machine breakdowns and more malfunctions all over the place,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s really widespread.\u201d These breakdowns are not a surprise, Weiser said, because 42 states are using machines that are 10 or more years old. There have been issues with machines in South Carolina, New York, Missouri, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois and Indiana. \u201cThese machines are just degrading,\u201d Weiser said. The problem with voting machines has long been predicted by voting experts. In a report last year, the Brennan Center found that in 14 states, voting machines set to be used in the election will be 15 or more years old. The center said that the machines were \u201cperilously close to the end of most systems\u2019 expected lifespans,\u201d noting that nearly every state is using some machines that are no longer manufactured, making it hard to find replacement parts. \u201cOld voting equipment increases the risk of failures and crashes \u2013 which can lead to long lines and lost votes on Election Day,\u201d according to the 2015 report . Although voting machines in use across the country debuted around 2000, they were actually designed and engineered in the 1990s, the report said, and \u201ctoday\u2019s systems were not designed to last for decades.\u201d One specific problem highlighted by the report and mentioned Tuesday by Weiser was \u201cvote flipping,\u201d which is what Trump seemed to be referencing. This occurs when a voter presses a button on a touch screen for one person but the machine shows them voting for another candidate. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen more malfunctions and more vote flipping all over the place,\u201d Weiser said. But it was not clear how many machines were seeing vote flipping. Mark Thomas, director of elections in Utah, said that on Tuesday morning, local officials in\u00a0Washington County found that none of their voting machines were working. They wound up using paper ballots as a backup; the issue with fixing the machines was finished by noon, he said. Issues with machines caused lines earlier Tuesday at precincts in Virginia, Clarke\u2019s group said. Her group also heard similar complaints from Philadelphia, one of the cities specifically cited by Trump during speeches in which he claimed that voter fraud is \u201call too common\u201d and asked his supporters to closely monitor other voters. Donald Trump has called for his supporters to \"watch\" the polls in some cities. But claims of election rigging didn't begin with Trump's candidacy. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The office of Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams said it has assembled a task force including more than 70 prosecutors and dozens of detectives to tackle complaints of voter fraud, intimidation and electioneering. \u201cWe, as expected, had kind of a busy call volume in the morning,\u201d Cameron L. Kline, a spokesman for Williams, said Tuesday morning in a telephone interview. Kline said the task force was not seeing an unusual volume of calls or complaints. \u201cSo far the trend is historically rolling the right way.\u201d [ Election Day: An acrimonious race reaches its endpoint ] The Philadelphia Republican Party posted on Twitter that poll workers in the northern part of the city were handing out literature supporting Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, while inside a polling station. Advocates worry that voters are not clear on the current rules surrounding photo ID and early voting. The Post's Sari Horwitz visited North Carolina, where voting laws have recently changed, to find out more ahead of Election Day. (Monica Akhtar,Sari Horwitz/The Washington Post) There were also other problems\u00a0reported across the country. In complaints submitted to The Washington Post, voters described\u00a0confusion over identification requirements in Pennsylvania, Texas and D.C., among other issues. Volunteers with\u00a0Common Cause, a nonpartisan government reform group, fanned out to help at the polls on Tuesday, and they also saw problems with relocated polling places, broken machines and confusion from voters and poll workers alike over new voter ID laws. In Harris County, Texas, the county\u2019s website listed the incorrect polling places for a number of precincts, according to Common Cause. A lot of voters went to one site only to be told that the voting place had been changed. And in one precinct, voters were sent to a third site. \u201cVoters had to go to a lot of trouble to cast a ballot,\u201d said a Common Cause worker in Texas. Also in Texas, there were a \u201clarge number of calls\u201d about voting machines that were not up and working when the polling places were supposed to open. Ohio has mostly been dealing with routine problems, including a power outage. But in one county, Montgomery, there was confusion over the number of pages that were supposed to be on the ballot. Only one page was provided. The poll workers had to call all the voters to return and correct their ballots with the second page. Voters go to the polls in Milwaukee. (Darren Hauck/Getty Images) Clarke said the lawyers\u2019 committee was contacted about sites that did not open on time in Brooklyn and Boston, along with long lines and broken machines elsewhere. In Georgia, Clarke said, people complained of \u00a0\u201c11th-hour polling place changes with no notice issued to voters,\u201d creating uncertainty over where to go. [ In battleground states, confusion lingers over new voting laws ] Leading up to Election Day, there have been some heated confrontations between supporters of Clinton and Trump. The specter of possible violence has loomed over Election Day after a particularly vitriolic campaign, one in which issues of race, class, gender and ethnicity have taken center stage in caustic ways. In a poll last month, half of likely voters said they were worried about violence on Election Day.\u00a0Meanwhile, U.S. officials recently said they were investigating a possible threat from al-Qaeda to carry out pre-election terrorist attacks, although authorities described the threat as vague and said they were unclear whether it was credible. Law enforcement officials from Nevada to Georgia have pledged an increase in officers at some locations, with agencies vowing vigilance and saying they are prepared for possible issues. A police officer looks at people standing in line to vote in New York City. (Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images) The Las Vegas police said units would visit polling locations, though the department noted that early voting in Clark County came and went without any issues of violence at the polls.\u00a0In Chicago, another city named by Trump when he exhorted his supporters to monitor polling locations, police say it is normal procedure for them to have extra officers visiting these sites to ensure safety. Police in New York are preparing for \u201ca very unique set of challenges,\u201d because both Clinton and Trump plan to hold election-night events in Manhattan, said James O\u2019Neill, the police commissioner. But O\u2019Neill said police are prepared to secure more than 1,000 polling locations across the city, as well as the Clinton and Trump events just two miles apart later on Tuesday night. \u201cPlanning for security events like this is a big part of what we do,\u201d O\u2019Neill said during a briefing Monday. \u201cThis is nothing new to us.\u201d Katie Zezima contributed to this\u00a0report has been updated multiple times.\u00a0 Further reading: ",

I'm not nearly that imaginative. Even if we were trying to go for something with this kind of tone, we couldn't have scripted this.

(Twitter.com) A security vulnerability discovered\u00a0in Donald Trump's website Tuesday night briefly allowed users to publish whatever they wanted on a section of his website. It worked like this: By adding a few words of text \u2013 whatever you wanted \u2013\u00a0to his website's URL, those words would appear at the top of the site. (Think of it as being able to write your own headlines for stories on latimes.com and share them.)\u00a0The glitch wasn't a big one: The changes would\u00a0not be visible to users coming to www.donaldjtrump.com, only to users who had created their own URLs.

Early exit polls conducted by\u00a0Edison Research found 47.2% of voters agreed that Clinton is an honest and trustworthy candidate. Just 17.2%\u00a0said the same of Trump. But nearly a third of California voters (30.7%) said they don't trust either candidate.\u00a0Just 1.9% said they trust both. Voting issues Nov. 8, 2016, 4:40 p.m. North Carolina, New Hampshire officials extend poll hours after voting issues Jaweed Kaleem In North Carolina, where voting machines glitches\u00a0were reported in several counties, the state's elections board decided Tuesday evening to extend polling hours by 20 to 60 minutes at\u00a0eight precincts\u00a0in Durham County, which had experienced the most widespread\u00a0machine issues in the state. The elections board also said it would keep one polling site in Columbus County open by an extra 30 minutes. Polls were originally scheduled to close at 7:30 p.m. In Dover, N.H., elections officials said they would extend voting until 8 p.m. The decision came in response to a request from Democrats, after an email was sent to about 250 residents with the wrong information about the poll closing time. Isolated polling machine issues were reported at polling places\u00a0earlier Tuesday in several states, including Virginia, Texas, New York, Kentucky and Utah. Malfunctions, which are common, were quickly handled at most sites by letting voters use paper ballots while machines were fixed. L.A. propositions Nov. 8, 2016, 4:48 p.m. 'I see it every day': L.A. voters grapple with homelessness issue Bettina Boxall and Angel Jennings Tents line the sidewalks along 5th Street in L.A.'s skid row earlier this year. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) Although much of the chatter Tuesday revolved around Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Angel Hubert of Hyde Park said she was drawn to the polls by a local measure. The 47-year-old said she had lived on the streets of Pasadena for 15 years. And now that she has a place to call home, she's dismayed that lawmakers have not done more to house those in need. So Hubert voted for Proposition HHH , a general obligation bond that would raise money to build housing for chronically homeless people \u2014 and urged others to do the same. \"Use our taxpayer money to put these homeless people in places,\" she said. Across town, Leslie Foster, 32, went to the 7th Day Adventist Church in Hollywood to cast his vote in favor of the homeless housing bond measure. The filmmaker said he used to work as a janitor at the church. \"I think it will make a difference,\" he said of Proposition HHH. \"Hopefully people will see the wisdom of having housing in different places.\" A few hundred feet from the voting booths, two young homeless women sat in the shade at the edge of the parking lot.\u00a0 \"I see it every day,\u201d said Jennifer Laughlin, 35, of Los Feliz, who also said she voted for HHH. \u201cIt's very sad to see people who don't have a place to go.\" President ",

USA TODAY NETWORK The craziest presidential campaign in modern history is coming to an end (hopefully) tonight! Will it be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump ? Who will win the Senate ? We will have all the latest right here as the votes are counted. In the meantime, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening so far: Buckle up and grab some caffeine ... Both Trump and Clinton picked up expected wins in a slew of states that have not been competitive in the polls. But neither has notched a key battleground state victory yet. The race remains too close to call in Florida, North Carolina,\u00a0Pennsylvania and Virginia, among others. \u00a0 Republicans win two key Senate races, Dem pickup in Illinois In Florida, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio\u00a0bested Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy to win re-election, projections show.\u00a0In Indiana, GOP Rep. Todd Young topped former Democratic\u00a0senator Evan Bayh to fill the seat vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats. Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth ousted Republican Sen. Mark Kirk in Illinois. Duckworth is a two-term congresswoman and\u00a0a veteran who lost both legs in Iraq. Kirk suffered a massive stroke in 2012, and a recent Illinois poll found more than half of voters did not believe he had recovered enough to perform his Senate duties. Thank you for making me the next senator from Illinois. This victory would not have been possible without your support. \u2014 Tammy Duckworth (@TammyforIL) November 9, 2016 Several more key Senate races have yet to be called, including\u00a0in Nevada, Missouri, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. Congratulations on the great victory, @marcorubio ! Florida is critical to keeping the Senate. \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 9, 2016 Breaking: Paul Ryan re-elected Well, not really that breaking. The House speaker was overwhelmingly expected to beat Democratic challenger\u00a0Ryan Solen in Wisconsin's first congressional district. And he and other Republicans are expected to retain majority control of the House of Representatives , but that call hasn't been made yet. W. votes none of the above George W. Bush left the presidential portion of his ballot blank, Carly Mallenbaum reports : \"A spokesperson for the Bush family,\u00a0Freddy Ford, told USA TODAY that the 43rd president\u00a0and\u00a0former First Lady\u00a0Laura Bush\u00a0voted 'None of the Above'\u00a0for President, and went Republican for the rest of the ballot.\" More on that here . Twitter | @realdonaldtrump Donald J. Trump on Twitter Outside Trump Tower, meanwhile, police asked a mariachi band to move along , saying they were creating a \"huge disturbance.\" One dead, several injured after shooting near polling place USA TODAY's Melanie Eversley has the latest: \"A gunman shot several people Tuesday in the Azusa community of Los Angeles County, killing one, scattering would-be voters, and forcing a lock-down of two polling sites. \"Up to five people may have been injured.\" The shooter was cornered in a standoff, according to police. Situation has transitioned from active to barricade/containment... All those near scene shelter in place all others stay out of the area \u2014 Azusa Police (@AzusaPD) November 9, 2016 A (mostly) burned out electorate While we wait for all of the official polls to close , here\u2019s what we know from an early survey of voters: They just want it to be finished already. A Morning Consult/Politico poll of voters found them feeling this way: \u2022 85% Just want it to be over \u2022\u00a072% Anxious \u2022\u00a029% Proud \u2022\u00a025% Happy They also found that 36% said they wanted a strong leader, while 29% said they favored a candidate with a vision for the future. Only 16% want someone who cares about them or shares their values. Not too burned out to tweet Twitter reports that 25 million tweets were sent about the election between midnight and 6 p.m. Eastern.

There were plenty of reports of long lines and voting snafus, which are typical of such large elections, as Richard Wolf and Kevin McCoy report . There were some scattered reports of skirmishes: FIGHT:  700 blk S. Saginaw St.  St. Pauls.  Fighting at the polls.

Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Downtown resident James Evans, 59, cast his ballot at the polling place inside the Midnight Mission on skid row. Downtown resident James Evans, 59, cast his ballot at the polling place inside the Midnight Mission on skid row. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Gale Holland Contact Reporter Prodded\u00a0by a registration campaign, phone banking\u00a0and\u00a0a ballot measure to fund homeless housing, skid\u00a0row voters hobbled out of their tents and welfare hotels in force Tuesday, lining up at times to cast ballots at\u00a0four polling stations in the 50-block district.\u00a0 \u201cPride most of all,\u201d said skid row activist Wendell Blassingame, explaining what he described as an unusually large voter\u00a0turnout in the impoverished neighborhood. Some voters such as Phillip Evans, 60, who lives in the street and said he sleeps mainly on buses, were casting their first-ever ballots. \u201cI got talked into it,\u201d he explained as he shuffled\u00a0into a\u00a0polling station at Los Angeles Mission, leaning heavily on his pushcart for balance. \u201cAll I know is I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d\u00a0 Measure HHH,\u00a0a $1.2-billion bond measure to build housing for the city of L.A.\u2019s 28,000 homeless people, was a big\u00a0draw,\u00a0Blassingame said, and would address what he described as a worsening problem. Gesturing at a cardboard\u00a0encampment\u00a0across from the Los Angeles Mission, he said, \u201cLook at that. They don\u2019t even have blankets; they\u2019re using boxes to stay warm.\u201d \u201cI need help, and my brother here needs help,\u201d said James Evans\u00a0as he and friend David Chavarria sat\u00a0outside the Midnight Mission in wheelchairs, resting after Evans voted. Evans, 59, a former Manual Arts High School and Long Beach State athlete, said he was paying for his sports career, recovering from a hip replacement. Chavarria, 52, said he has cirrhosis of the liver, which recently landed him in Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center in a coma. Chavarria, whose stomach was scarred by old stitches from a gaping\u00a0wound repair, had spent a sleepless night in the cold and kept nodding off during the conversation. \u201cWe have to get all these people off the streets,\u201d\u00a0said Kennedy Maxwell, 58, a formerly homeless man who now works as a City of Commerce landscaper and\u00a0voted yes on HHH. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic.\u201d Skid row is home to more than 10,000 people in various stages of sobriety and employment, united only by their poverty. Perhaps counterintuitively, several skid row residents said they turned out to vote the homeless housing initiative down. Tina Larrimore, 51, said she believes\u00a0homeless people aren\u2019t using the resources that are already available. \u201cThey\u2019ve been here forever,\u201d she said of the homeless population. Tyrone Taylor, a skid row activist known to many as \u201cDa Mayor,\u201d said he didn\u2019t vote on the\u00a0measure because he didn\u2019t understand it. \u201cI\u2019m 67 years old and I\u2019m just now learning how to vote,\u201d said Taylor, a laid-off Pittsburgh steelworker who spent 20 years homeless before his grown daughter found him in the streets of skid row. \u201cNow I\u2019m glad to be part\u00a0of society and make my voice heard.\u201d Lebertis Nickolson, 48, agreed it will be tough to get someone who spent 20 or 30 years in the streets\u00a0to take on the responsibility of an apartment, even a heavily subsidized one with supportive services, as the city measure is\u00a0designed to build. But everybody needs to be \u201cgiven an opportunity to do right,\u201d Nickolson said, adding that he had benefited from one of the neighborhood\u2019s many recovery programs.\u00a0 Blassingame, who dispenses social service and job referrals daily from a card table in skid row\u2019s San Julian Park, said\u00a0other cities and states continue to bus their homeless people to skid row. One recent arrival was so mentally debilitated he couldn\u2019t say which state he came from, Blassingame said. \u00a0 The handful of skid row voters informally polled were unanimous on\u00a0their\u00a0one-word choice for president: Hillary. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Hillary will be understanding of people that\u2019s minorities,\u201d Evans said.\u00a0 Larrimore, who works as a caretaker but can\u2019t afford to move off skid row,\u00a0said she had high hopes Hillary Clinton would help single working women like her.\u00a0 There was no love for Donald Trump among the voters.\u00a0 \u201cDown here we know unstable, and Trump is one of us,\u201d Blassingame said. \u201cHe\u2019s not stable at all.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss A security headache with both candidates in New York , Mexico fears the prospect of a Trump victory , FBI director James Comey could be in hot water \u00a0no matter who wins, and what's motivating Californians \u00a0to vote.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss A security headache with both candidates in New York , Mexico fears the prospect of a Trump victory , FBI director James Comey could be in hot water \u00a0no matter who wins, and what's motivating Californians \u00a0to vote.\u00a0 Caption In the race to 270, Clinton is projected to win with 352 electoral votes.

    "text": "By Matea Gold and David A. Fahrenthold November 8 at 8:30 PM Follow @mateagold Follow @Fahrenthold As the polls closed Tuesday, anxious Americans awaited an indication of who would prevail at the end of a historically bitter presidential contest -- whether Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would hold on to her narrow pre-election lead or Republican Donald Trump would secure a stunning upset. By 8 p.m. Eastern time, voting had ended in more than two dozen states that together represent 272 electoral votes. Clinton was quickly projected to win the District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and Vermont, giving her 44 electoral votes, according to the Associated Press. Trump locked down Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia, racking up 60 electoral votes. Voting also ended in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- pivotal states that were too close to immediately call. View Graphic Clinton is hoping to outperform President Obama in Virginia\u2019s northern suburbs outside Washington, D.C., where a growing immigrant population has helped Democrats expand their hold. Obama won Virginia by 6.3 percent in 2008 and 3.9 percent in 2012 -- the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to prevail twice in the state. [ Live updates on the presidential race and other contests ] Both candidates have fiercely contested North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes, considered one of the pivotal states that Trump needs for victory. In 2008, Barack Obama narrowly edged out GOP nominee John McCain in North Carolina, but Mitt Romney wrested it back for the Republicans in the 2012 race. Trump has also been banking on winning Ohio and its 18 electoral votes. The bellwether state has backing the losing presidential candidate only once since 1944. The GOP nominee appealed directly to the sense of economic grievance in the Buckeye State, which has been buffeted by a declining manufacturing industry. During the day on Tuesday, there were reports of long lines at some polling places, and scattered reports of intimidation by people outside. The loudest complaints came from Trump\u2019s campaign. In Nevada, it filed a lawsuit arguing that polls were improperly kept open late during early voting in Clark County, home of Las Vegas. The county said it was following the law, by allowing those who were in line at the time polls closed to continue and vote. A judge in the case seemed skeptical of the Trump campaign\u2019s claims, and denied its request to preserve evidence in the case. How the electoral college works View Graphic How the electoral college works In a possibly worrisome sign for the GOP, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd about 6:15 p.m. that Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t have the full support of the Republican infrastructure.\u201d Trump was monitoring the returns early Tuesday evening from his apartment in Trump Tower, according to former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. The GOP nominee, he said in an interview, was \u201cwatching everything even though I\u2019m telling him not to.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s calm. We\u2019re all cautiously optimistic,\u201d Giuliani said when asked to describe the mood within Trump\u2019s home. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be very, very close. We know there is a populism across the country that\u2019s powerful and he has been lifted by it.\u201d Earlier Tuesday, Trump himself tweeted out what he said was a CNN headline: \u201cUtah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.\u201d CNN reporters quickly replied that Trump\u2019s message contained a key typo: the problems in Utah had been reported across a county, not the entire United States. Washington County \u2014 in the southwest corner of the state \u2014 had experienced some problems with voting machines on Tuesday morning. They used paper ballots in the meantime, and had the problem with the machines fixed by noon. [ Voters encounter machine breakdowns, describe intimidation at the polls ] As of early evening on the East Coast, preliminary exit polls reflected one of the dominant themes of the campaign: the deep unpopularity of both candidates. Majorities of voters in early exit polling said they have an unfavorable view of Trump and Clinton, with Trump\u2019s negatives somewhat higher. Indeed, at the end of a bitter, sharply personal campaign, some voters were eschewing both contenders. That included former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush, who did not cast a ballot for either major-party presidential nominee this year. \u201cThey didn\u2019t vote for Hillary; they didn\u2019t vote for Trump,\u201d spokesman Freddy Ford wrote in an email to The Texas Tribune. Preliminary exit polls indicated that turnout shares among Republicans, Democrats and independents would be comparable to 2012. Democrats had a narrow advantage at the polls in the past two Obama elections, edging Republicans by roughly six percentage points. [ These races will determine whether Republicans hold their Senate majority ] Leaders of both parties braced for election results that will be shaped by the nation\u2019s changing demographics as well as an unconventional presidential race. Democrats expressed confidence that increased voting by Hispanics as well as strong participation by African Americans, Asian Americans and young voters would provide Hillary Clinton with the margin of victory in several states. Republicans, however, said Donald Trump\u2019s appeal among working class whites would allow him to wrest the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt away from her. Early voting totals are up in seven of 10 key swing states, most of all in Florida, where it rose 36 percent over 2012. Much of that rise was driven by Latinos in counties such as Miami-Dade and Broward, which helps account for why Democrats have an 88,000-vote edge in the state\u2019s early voting count. In North Carolina, early voting increased 17 percent compared to four years ago, with an 86 percent increase among Hispanics and a 74 percent increase among Asian-Americans. Republican National Committee officials said in a phone call with reporters Tuesday that they were not concerned that high levels of Latino turnout in Florida boded badly for their candidates, saying the party had made large gains in voter registration in the state. They noted that in Ohio, counties such as Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton that supported President Obama in 2012 saw a drop in early voting, while counties such as Warren, Miami and Greene that backed Mitt Romney saw an increase. \u201cWe feel very confident about winning today,\u201d said Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser. But Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who heads the think tank NDN, said Republicans and many political pundits have failed to grasp \u201chow much the U.S. population is changing.\u201d He noted the number of eligible Hispanic voters has increased from 18 million to 27 million since 2008, and the number of millennial voters has risen from 35 million to 70 million during that period. Since those two voting blocs currently favor Democrats, Rosenberg said, the change poses \u201can existential threat\u201d to Republicans \u201cif they do not start to create a solution to these demographic trend lines.\u201d Longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie said in an interview he was not worried about these population shifts because the GOP could prevail if it appealed to African Americans and Hispanics on issues such as school choice, opposition to abortion and criminal justice reform. \u201cThe Republican establishment has not been focused on issues that appeal to the minorities,\u201d Viguerie said, adding the party would shift right after the election. \u201cBasically, the establishment Republicans have self-destructed. They have written themselves out of leadership going forward.\u201d In a sign of how Democrats are courting African Americans, for example, Michelle Obama taped 15 separate radio shows Tuesday, most of which primarily reach black audiences. Two of the ones she did \u2014 the \u201cWillie Moore Jr. Show\u201d and \u201cThe Tom Joyner Show\u201d--were ones that the president called into last week. On Tuesday, Obama taped six radio interviews from the White House, talking to hosts whose listeners live in Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. He also walked through the White House colonnade and pointed at the cameras held by members of the White House press corps. \u201cGo vote,\u201d he instructed their viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d As Americans cast their votes Tuesday, the nation\u2019s demographic schisms were visible. In Manassas, Va., where there is both a sizable immigrant population and support for Trump, James Bowers, 72, said working-class Americans like himself have seen their personal liberties erode with a Democrat in the White House. \u201cThese eight years are the worst eight years I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a dictatorship, and if Hillary wins, she\u2019ll continue that dictatorship.\u201d But 43-year-old Yesenia Luna, the daughter of an immigrant from El Salvador, said she voted for Clinton because \u201cwe have to be the difference for all the other Latinos in this country.\u201d Some voters said they hoped that the election could change a dynamic that has frustrated Americans from both parties. Steve Glanz, 42, was registered Republican and had supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania\u2019s April primary. But once inside his south Philadelphia polling place, he voted for Clinton and for the Democrats\u2019 Senate challenger, Katie McGinty. \u201cI voted basically straight Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get some Supreme Court justices confirmed at some point. Having the Senate belong to the same party as the president would help that. If they keep letting the justices die off, once it\u2019s under five members, they can\u2019t even render decisions.\u201d But many Republicans still expect their party to continue to probe Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and possible conflicts of interest raised by her role at the Clinton Foundation, which could complicate her relationship with Congress if she wins the White House. Lori Schwabenbauer, 54, voted in Chester County, Pa., then drove into Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday. She is a Republican, and Trump and Sen. Pat Toomey received her vote, but she was expecting a Clinton win. Asked whether she would want Republicans to continue probing Clinton\u2019s scandals if she won, Schwabenbauer gave a qualified yes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s above the law,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want her to be jailed just because I don\u2019t like her.\u201d And Trump, who was joined by his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka as he voted a few blocks from Trump Tower, refused to say for certain Tuesday whether he would concede the race if TV networks and others call it for Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d said Trump, who was booed by some voters as he entered Manhattan\u2019s P.S. 59. He added the early returns were \u201cvery good.\u201d But on Tuesday afternoon Trump called into the Fox News Channel for the second time of the day, and complained about the nation\u2019s political and media establishment. \u201cIt\u2019s largely a rigged system,\u201d he said. RNC officials noted that they had increased get-out-the-vote operation nationwide, having deployed 5,250 paid organizers and 2,350 trained fellows around the country. That represents a massive increase over the 876 staffers that the party and then-nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign jointly had in 2012. Clinton campaign spokeswoman Lily Adams, meanwhile, emailed reporters to say that \u201cmore than 10,000 volunteers were on the doors for our first 8AM shift in battleground states with thousands more on the phones.\u201d By early afternoon Tuesday, voters across the country were making their choices, with long lines in many polling stations. In North Hollywood, Calif., some voters brought beach chairs to stake out a place in line before dawn. At one polling station in Detroit, people waited up to 90 minutes to reach the ballot booth. At Stonewall Middle School in Manassas, nearly 170 people were lined up when voting began at 6 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m a determined voter,\u201d said 37-year-old Michael Barnes, an account executive for Freddie Mac who showed up at 5 a.m. and backed a straight Democratic ticket. \u201cI\u2019m feeling relieved that I\u2019ve at least done my part.\u201d [ Clinton holds edge in swing state Virginia ] For Laurie Jarman, an office manager in Fairfax County, it was antipathy for Clinton that drove her vote. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I trust him, either, but I feel that Hillary will be worse,\u201d said Jarman, 46, who arrived at Stonewall Middle School about half-an-hour after Barnes. After voting in Richmond, Clinton\u2019s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said that if he and Clinton were \u201cfortunate enough to win this evening,\u201d they would work to heal the deep rifts in the country that this year\u2019s race had exposed. \u201cIn the tone of the things that we say, in the team that we put together, and the policies that we promote, we have to show that we want to govern for all, not just those who voted for us,\u201d he said. Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, cast their ballots at Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary in Chappaqua, N.Y., at 8 a.m. Just four hours earlier, they had arrived from an early-morning rally in North Carolina. Clinton, who spent much of the rest of the day at home before heading to a Manhattan hotel to await returns, was greeted by chants of \u201cMadam President!\u201d as she walked outside. \u201cIt is the most humbling feeling because I know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country,\u201d she told reporters, when asked what it felt like to cast her ballot. Asked by a reporter if she thought about her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born in the year before women gained the right to vote and who died in 2011, Clinton responded with a smile: \u201cOh, I did.\u201d [ The evolving election map ] As the possibility of Clinton\u2019s victory drew near Tuesday, voters flocked to the Rochester, N.Y., grave site of suffragist Susan B. Anthony, who died in 1906 without getting the right to cast a vote. Mount Hope Cemetery officials extended its hours until 9 p.m. as people waited in long lines to paste \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers on her headstone, many of them emotional. Anne Gearan in White Plains, N.Y.; Sean Sullivan in New York; Scott Clement, Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin and Brian Murphy in Washington; David Weigel in Philadelphia; Laura Vozzella in Richmond; Antonio Olivo in Manassas, Va.; and Kelsey Snell in Janesville, Wis., contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Democrats are defending 10 Senate seats, while Republicans are fighting to keep 24 seats.

    "text": "Read the story Clinton asked voters to keep the White House in her party's hands for a third straight term. She cast herself as heir to President Barack Obama's legacy and pledged to make good on his unfinished agenda, including passing immigration legislation, tightening restrictions on guns and tweaking his signature health care law. \"I know how much responsibility goes with this,\" Clinton said after voting Tuesday at her local polling station in Chappaqua, New York, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at her side. \"So many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country, and I will do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today.\" Trump, the New York real estate developer who lives in a gold-plated Manhattan penthouse, forged a striking connection with white, working-class Americans who feel left behind in the changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of many problems plaguing the nation and called for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Full coverage: 2016 election Open link \"I see so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn't happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership,\" he said by telephone on Fox News before casting his own ballot in Manhattan. \"And people are hurt so badly.\" Seven in 10 Americans who went to the polls Tuesday said immigrants now in the country illegally should be allowed to stay, while just a quarter said they should be deported. More than half oppose building a border wall, according to the exit polls, which were conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. The Republican Party's tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting \"none of the above\" when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford. Trump set both parties on edge when he refused to say in the third and final debate whether he would accept the election's results, citing with no evidence the possibility of a rigged outcome. His statement threatened to undermine a fundamental pillar of American democracy and raised the prospect that his fervent supporters would not view Clinton as a legitimate president if she won. Asked Tuesday in an interview with Fox News if he would accept the election results, Trump continued to demur, saying \"We're going to see how things play out.\" Most problems that did pop up at polling places Tuesday appeared to be routine \u2014 the kinds of snags that come every four years, including long lines, machines not working properly and issues with ballots or voter rolls. Even before Tuesday, almost 45 million people had cast ballots for president. Many expressed relief the end was in sight after an election season in which personal attacks often drowned out the issues. Clinton has denounced Trump for calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and promoting a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and for his long line of remarks about women that culminated in an audio in which he bragged about grabbing their genitals. Her campaign was hoping high turnout among Hispanics push her over the top in states like Florida and Nevada. \"I grew up in a Hispanic family, and the way that Donald Trump has referred to illegal immigrants \u2014 being from illegal immigrants, I took that to heart,\" said Angel Salazar, a 22-year-old sanitation associate from Oklahoma City. \"I don't like anything that he said. I don't like his views. So I voted for Hillary Clinton because she supports us.\" Trump called his opponent \"Crooked Hillary\" for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her complicated ties to the family's Clinton Foundation. In the final days, Clinton was buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's weekend declaration that he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. Comey announced the inquiry late last month, sapping Clinton's surging momentum and threatening Democrats in down-ballot races.\u00a0 Associated Press ",

Donald Trump joked that it was a \"tough decision.\" USA TODAY NETWORK Clinton supporters watch the results come in at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on election night. (Photo: Seth Harrison, USA TODAY Network) Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump was the projected winner in seven early states while Democrat Hillary Clinton claimed six and the District of Columbia as polls began closing Tuesday across the nation in the historic campaign to elect the nation's 45th president. Democrats also were hoping to gain\u00a0four Senate seats needed to gain a majority while\u00a0Republicans appeared well positioned to retain a solid majority in the House. Polling places across presidential battleground states of Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia also were closing as the arduous and bitterly fought campaign raced to a close.\u00a0Polling places in North Carolina, another swing state, were mostly closed although some precincts were being kept open due to computer glitches. The lead was on a see-saw and too close to call\u00a0in\u00a0Florida, perhaps the night's biggest prize, with about 90% of the votes tallied. Trump claimed early victories in Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Indiana.\u00a0Indiana is a historically red state and home to Trump's running mate, Gov. Mike Pence. \"Thank you Indiana for making our state first on the board to vote to Make America Great Again! @realDonaldTrump ,\" Pence tweeted . Clinton was quickly projected the winner in Rhode Island,\u00a0Maryland, Massachusetts, Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont and D.C. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, is from swing Virginia, which was not immediately called. Trump and Clinton mostly shunned public appearances as the day wore on, although Trump conducted radio interviews and their social media accounts were far from silent. \"Don't let up, keep getting out to vote - this election is FAR FROM OVER! We are doing well but there is much time left. GO FLORIDA!,\" tweeted Trump, who, aides say, handles his own Twitter account. Clinton's account chimed in with \"Our neighbors in battleground states need your help. Make calls to remind Hillary supporters to go vote.\" Voters faced long lines at many polling places but no major impediments, even as an estimated 90 million Americans filed through schools, churches, public libraries, civic centers and grocery stores to\u00a0cast ballots.\u00a0 Fears of voting problems \u00a0pushed voting rights advocates, conservative watchdogs and even international observers to monitor voting. How to make sense of what's happening as polls close on election night When Utah, a red state,\u00a0reported problems, Trump pounced, tweeting \"Just out according to @CNN : \"Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.\" Not so, CNN's Brian Stelter tweeted : \"No. Utah officials reported machine problems across one entire COUNTY, not the entire COUNTRY.\" In the Senate, early Republican victories in Florida and Indiana gave the party breathing room in its effort to retain a majority. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had said while running for president that he would not seek re-election. He changed his mind and provided his party with a boost. In Indiana, former senator and governor Evan Bayh was beatend by relative unkown GOP Rep. Todd Young. Voters in several states had complained of long waits and, on occasion, supply disruptions and technical glitches, from reliably blue Massachusetts to the battleground states of Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Michigan. In California, violence forced a lock-down of two polling places. Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan tweeted that voters in Azusa should seek alternate polling sites after a shooting affected two voting locations, including an elementary school.\u00a0A gunman shot several people, killing one, and scattered would-be voters, police said. Across the nation, surveys\u00a0of voters leaving their polling places revealed an electorate more diverse, more educated and more upset than four years ago. The surveys also showed that\u00a0black and Hispanic voters continued to grow as a percentage of the electorate, while the white vote slipped slightly. Is it Trump or Clinton? The surveys, from\u00a0National Election Pool Survey by Edison Research, also showed nearly a quarter of Americans described themselves as \u201cangry\u201d about the way government is functioning. Those people were at the core of Trump\u2019s support. In 2012, about a fifth of voters described their feelings toward the Obama administration as \u201canger.\u201d The controversy over Trump's comments about women notwithstanding, the \u201cgender gap\u201d appears to be comparable to what voters reported in both 2012 and 2008 \u2014\u00a0female voters were more likely to support Clinton and male voters were more likely to support Trump. And while men favored Trump, his numbers appeared to be little changed from Mitt Romney's in 2012. It was not immediately clear where turnout stood compared to four years ago.\u00a0In battleground Ohio,\u00a0the state's elections office said turnout appeared to be robust, with relatively few problems. Matthew McClellan, a spokesman for Secretary of State Jon Husted, said it was too soon to say if Tuesday's turnout would break records. Contributing: Stephen Reilly, Greg Toppo Posted!
