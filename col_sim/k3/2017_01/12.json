    "text": "Mr. Rubio set off on an aggressive line of questioning, initially posing a simple query: \u201cIs Vladimir Putin a war criminal?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI would not use that term,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Rubio, outlining a list of grievous Russian offenses in Syria, said he hoped Mr. Tillerson might adjust his answer. \u201cThose are very, very serious charges to make, and I want to have much more information,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Rubio, saying there was plenty of public information \u2014 \u201cthe videos and pictures are there,\u201d he noted \u2014 said that \u201cit should not be hard to say that Vladimir Putin\u2019s military has conducted war crimes in Aleppo.\u201d Mr. Tillerson did not budge. \u201cI find it discouraging, your inability to cite that,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. As the senator continued to cite the deaths of Mr. Putin\u2019s opponents, Mr. Tillerson said he hoped to learn more once he could receive classified information on the matters. \u201cNone of this is classified, Mr. Tillerson,\u201d Mr. Rubio shot back. \u201cPeople are dead.\u201d Photo Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, during the hearing. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Tillerson favored arms for Ukraine Mr. Tillerson also told the committee that if he had been serving in office when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 , he would have recommended that the United States provide arms and intelligence support to the government of Ukraine, and said the Obama administration\u2019s reaction was viewed in Moscow \u201cas a weak response.\u201d Mr. Tillerson\u2019s prescription came in the opening two hours of his confirmation hearing, where he went out of his way to portray himself as a hard-liner in confronting Russia \u2014 an effort to defuse questions about his business relationships with Mr. Putin. But in doing so, he put himself in direct opposition to the position taken by Mr. Trump, who said in interviews with The New York Times last year that he doubted the utility of the sanctions the United States led against Russia. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWhat the Russian leadership would have understood is a powerful response,\u201d said Mr. Tillerson, until recently the chief executive of Exxon Mobil. His message to the Russian leadership, he said, would be, \u201cYes, you took Crimea, but this stops right here.\u201d Kaine challenges Tillerson on climate change views Mr. Tillerson, facing questions about Exxon Mobil\u2019s history with climate science, admitted to at least a measure of strategic obfuscation during his testimony. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said that despite Mr. Tillerson\u2019s view on climate change, Exxon continued to provide funding to groups that obscure the scientific consensus. He asked Mr. Tillerson to clarify what Exxon Mobil knew about climate change despite its public claims through the years. \u201cSenator, since I\u2019m no longer with Exxon Mobil, I\u2019m in no position to speak on their behalf,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Kaine reminded Mr. Tillerson that he was asking about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s own experience, which included more than four decades at Exxon. \u201cDo you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or do you refuse to answer my question?\u201d Mr. Kaine asked. \u201cA little of both,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, to laughs. Mr. Kaine also pressed Mr. Tillerson on Mr. Trump\u2019s potential business conflicts abroad. Mr. Tillerson said he had no knowledge of any of Mr. Trump\u2019s business relationships in Russia or elsewhere. Mr. Kaine asked about the ramifications of conducting diplomacy with foreign officials \u201cwho know more about the president\u2019s financial interest and exposure than you do.\u201d Mr. Tillerson said that \u201cas long as the objective of a negotiation is clear, that\u2019s all that matters\u201d to a prospective secretary of state. Advertisement C-suite and Foggy Bottom are different Photo Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland questioned Mr. Tillerson during the hearing. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, got to the key critique of Mr. Tillerson in an opening statement that challenged the nominee to explain what additional sanctions he would advocate against Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election and its activities in Syria. \u201cHaving a view from the C-Suite at Exxon is not at all the same as the view from the seventh floor of the Department of State,\u201d Mr. Cardin said, referring to where the secretary\u2019s office is. \u201cAnd those who suggest that anyone who can run a successful business can, of course, run a government agency do a profound disservice to both.\u201d Mr. Cardin argued that \u201cserving the narrow market-driven interests of Exxon shareholders is not the same as serving the national interests of all of the American people.\u201d And he challenged Mr. Tillerson to indicate whether he \u201cmay ignore Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, his illegal annexation of Crimea and his intervention in Syria,\u201d all of which President-elect Trump indicated, in an interview with The Times, were not high on his list of concerns. Mr. Cardin added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s prepared opening remarks included no mention of Russian hacking, adding that he also planned to press Mr. Tillerson on his prospective business conflicts. Sessions criticized over comments on Trump tape Mr. Sessions was an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump, even after a tape surfaced in October revealing Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women and describing how he grabs them by their genitals. Testifying on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sessions said that behavior amounted to sexual assault. But his earlier comments, in an interview with T he Weekly Standard , resurfaced on Wednesday. SESSIONS: This was very improper language, and he\u2019s acknowledged that. TWS: But beyond the language, would you characterize the behavior described in that [video] as sexual assault if that behavior actually took place? SESSIONS: I don\u2019t characterize that as sexual assault. I think that\u2019s a stretch. I don\u2019t know what he meant \u2014 TWS: So if you grab a woman by the genitals, that\u2019s not sexual assault? SESSIONS: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not clear that he \u2014 how that would occur. Amita Swadhin, the founder of the advocacy group Mirror Memoirs, cited those comments on Wednesday and Mr. Sessions\u2019s opposition to expanding hate crimes laws as evidence that he should not be confirmed. \u201cWe have no reason to put our faith or our trust in Senator Sessions as attorney general,\u201d she said. Home court advantage Ms. Chao was to reintroduce herself to senators Wednesday morning \u2014 not as a former, long-serving labor secretary under George W. Bush, nor as the spouse of their majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, but as the choice to head the Transportation Department.

By Drew Harwell January 11 at 7:17 PM Follow @drewharwell President-elect Donald Trump will retain ownership of his company while shifting assets into a trust managed by his sons, a step that Trump and his advisers said will eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his public duties and private business. The move, announced Wednesday in Trump\u2019s first news conference since July, followed weeks of criticism from ethics experts and congressional Democrats who have said his financial entanglements could improperly steer his presidential decision-making. The announcement included a pledge from a Trump lawyer that the company would make \u201cno new foreign deals whatsoever\u201d during Trump\u2019s presidency, and that any new domestic deals would undergo vigorous review, including approval by an independent ethics adviser. In addition, Trump is giving up his position as an officer at the company, the Trump Organization, ceding all management responsibilities and agreeing to what his lawyers described as strict limits on communications with company executives beyond receiving regular profit-and-loss statements. Sheri Dillon, a tax adviser at global law firm Morgan Lewis, said Trump has sought to isolate himself from the business that will be managed by Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr. and Eric and company executive Allen Weisselberg. 1 of 18 Photos from Trump\u2019s first news conference in six months View Photos President-elect Donald Trump took questions in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Caption President-elect Donald Trump took questions in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Jan. 11, 2017 President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by his family, arrives for the news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump, she said, \u201cwill only know of a deal if he sees it in the paper or on TV.\u201d She added that Trump also terminated all pending international deals. But Trump\u2019s continued financial stake in a global real estate and branding company is likely to remain a point of contention between the president-elect and federal ethics officials, who have said that full divestiture remains the only way to prevent conflicts. Dillon, who also wrote a widely shared letter last year that asserted Trump\u2019s tax returns were under audit, argued that taking steps recommended by some vocal ethics experts would trigger additional problems. A sell-off would have created additional conflicts, she said, while a blind trust would have been unrealistic for a real estate company with high-profile assets. \u201cPresident Trump can\u2019t unknow he owns Trump Tower,\u201d Dillon said, and he \u201cshould not be expected to destroy the company he built.\u201d The announcement inspired an unusual, and highly critical, response from the top federal official at the agency that works closely with presidential transition teams to ensure they abide by ethics requirements. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, took the stage at a Wednesday event for the Brookings Institution think tank to say that Trump\u2019s decision \u201cdoesn\u2019t meet the standards . . . that every president of the past four decades has met.\u201d Shaub, appointed by President Obama in 2013, said the trust \u201cadds nothing to the equation\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cnot even close\u201d to a blind trust, and called other Trump provisions \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d Shaub, whose agency administers financial disclosure filings and advises executive branch officials on avoiding conflicts of interest, does not have the power to force Trump\u2019s hand. The director said he spoke out in hopes the president-elect would fully divest. Some ethics experts also expressed alarm Wednesday that the changes leave plenty of room for foreign interests and others to enrich the president and affect U.S. policy. Richard Painter, who was ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House, said the setup will not prevent Trump from knowing his business\u2019 sources of revenue or block him from receiving income from the trust. Trump Tower projects still stand, for instance, in the Philippines, Turkey, Uruguay and other hot spots where foreign buyers or governments could still lavish money on the Trump brand. \u201cHe still has businesses all over the world, and we still do not know who is financing those businesses and who he\u2019s indebted to,\u201d Painter said. Referring to the yet-unnamed expert who would be hired to sign off on new deals, Painter added: \u201cThat ethics adviser is going to have a lot of work to do. Sounds like he\u2019ll need air support.\u201d Trump also retained his ownership share of the luxury hotel he opened last year in the Old Post Office Pavilion down the street from the White House, despite criticism that foreign leaders might try to curry favor with the administration by doing business there and at his other hotels, possibly violating the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments clause.\u201d The clause has never been tested in the courts, but it is upheld by threat of impeachment, and some scholars say Trump risks violating it the day he\u2019s sworn into office. The Washington hotel, of which Trump owns 76\u00a0percent, has been frequented by foreign diplomats since the election. Trump himself has signed for hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate loans from foreign banks and is currently involved in deals with foreign investors across several continents. Dillon, Trump\u2019s attorney, dismissed the suggestion of a problem, saying the clause would not apply to \u201carms\u2019-length transactions the president-elect has nothing to do with,\u201d such as hotel stays for foreign diplomats. Nevertheless, Dillon said, the hotel would donate \u201call profits from foreign government payments\u201d from the Trump International Hotel to the U.S. Treasury. In his news conference Wednesday at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump showcased his signature theatrics. He stood by several stacks of what he said were legal papers related to the Trump Organization changes. He noted repeatedly that the president is not covered by any conflict-of-interest laws, and that he was sure he could do a good job leading both the company and the country if he so chose. \u201cI could actually run my business and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. But, he added later, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don\u2019t have.\u201d And if his sons \u201cdo a bad job,\u201d Trump added, he will tell them his catchphrase from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Trump said his commitment to focus on the presidency has already cost him business, adding he had in recent days turned down $2\u00a0billion to do \u201ca number of deals\u201d in Dubai with Hussain Sajwani, the billionaire chairman of the Damac Properties development firm and a man Trump has called a friend. A Damac executive said the company \u201cconfirms that the discussions took place as stated in the media briefing but the proposals were declined by the Trump Organization,\u201d and that the proposals \u201cwere for a variety of different property deals.\u201d Trump\u2019s plan will also include tapping a \u201cchief compliance counsel\u201d at the Trump Organization who will monitor the Trump businesses for \u201cany actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency,\u201d Dillon said. Neither Trump nor Dillon said who would fill the position, and requests to speak with company representatives were not immediately returned. The Trump Organization is a vast, worldwide collection of golf courses, hotels, condo towers and other commercial holdings spread across more than 500 business interests, financial filings show. Much of the company\u2019s revenue stems from deals with real estate developers and merchandisers, who pay the company millions of dollars to use Trump\u2019s name and image. Presidents are exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that force virtually all other executive-branch officials to sell off their business interests, as well as recuse themselves from public decision-making that could benefit their private finances. The president must still abide by bribery, fraud and corruption laws that could arise from potential financial conflicts. Modern presidents have followed a tradition of selling potentially problematic assets or sequestering them into a blind trust, overseen by an independent manager with unassailable control. The trust agreement outlined Wednesday will not be truly blind, critics said, due to Trump\u2019s family relationship to its leaders, his sons. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka will also step down from management of the Trump Organization and her name-brand fashion, jewelry and licensing companies, lawyers said. She will also restructure her involvement in potentially profitable Trump Organization deals and, instead, receive fixed payments from the revenue of what lawyers called a \u201cdiversified pool\u201d of unidentified projects. Fixed-income agreements are common approaches to addressing conflicts for spouses of those stepping into government. But, like her father, Ivanka Trump has not committed to selling off her ownership stake, leaving one of her largest conflicts unresolved. Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who Trump will name as a White House adviser, will sell off much of his New York real estate and media fortune and resign from the family business to avoid conflicts, his lawyers said this week. Many questions remain. Trump has not released his income tax returns, which would give the most precise look yet at Trump\u2019s holdings, business interests and foreign accounts. Trump has blamed several years of Internal Revenue Service audits, among other factors, for his reluctance to release the returns. Presidents, by law, are audited every year and not required to release their returns. Trump\u2019s sons, too, have already run into the minefield of potential conflicts awaiting the president\u2019s family. Eric Trump said recently that he will leave his foundation, following worries that donors could receive special access or favors from the Trump administration. Congressional Democrats on Monday introduced a law that would force Trump and future presidents to divest their business interests and other potential conflicts. But their Republican counterparts have largely stayed silent on Trump\u2019s entanglements, or said they trust his judgment, drawing the law\u2019s success into question.

    "text": "News Nation & World National politics How much do Americans actually care about Trump's potential business conflicts? President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference since July 27, 2016, on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. Scott ClementThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump 's media event announcing plans to shift his assets into a trust managed by his sons, but not to give up ownership of the Trump Organization, marks the greatest detail Trump has provided on how he would try to avoid conflicts between his business interests and service as president. While the coming weeks will tell whether Trump's announcement shifts public views of his business conflicts, polls beforehand showed a majority was concerned about potential conflicts of interest, and clear majorities say he should disclose more information about his business dealings. Two surveys released Tuesday offer a fresh look at Americans' view of Trump's potential conflicts. A Pew Research Center poll found 57 percent of adults are very or somewhat concerned that Trump's \"relationships with organizations, businesses or foreign governments conflict with his ability to serve the country's best interests.\" One-third said they are \"very concerned\" about the issue. Separately, a Quinnipiac University poll found a similar 60 percent of registered voters were very or somewhat concerned that \"Trump would veto a law that would be good for the country because it would hurt his business interests.\" Some 4 in 10 were \"very concerned\" about this possibility. These two polls found differing results on whether concern is on the rise (Quinnipiac) or falling (Pew), but their overall level of concern is quite similar despite asking different questions. While Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say they are at least somewhat concerned about Trump's conflicts influencing his decisions (89 percent vs. 27 percent), a 63 percent majority of self-identified independents said they are concerned Trump would veto that would damage his business interests. The Quinnipiac poll also found 52 percent of voters think Trump has more potential for conflicts than most politicians; only 10 percent said he has fewer conflicts, while 35 percent said he has about the same amount.

Trump announced a new ethics plan to avoid conflicts of interest with his vast business holdings, but experts are already warning that it's woefully inadequate and could violate the Constitution.

Hours later, Buzzfeed published an unverified dossier from a non-government source claiming to detail Russia's efforts to cultivate Trump -- including by direct interactions with Trump surrogates -- and to collect damaging material about him. Related: Donald Trump Wasn't Told About Unverified Russia Dossier, Official Says NBC News reported that the material in question was prepared for the briefing but, according to a U.S. Intelligence official with knowledge of the briefing preparation, Trump was not personally briefed on that information, which was originally generated as part of anti-Trump Republican opposition research. Here are some of the big questions coming out of Trump's first news conference as president-elect. Does Trump's ethics plan actually solve anything? Trump brought a lawyer, Sheri Dillon, to outline a plan for the president-elect to avoid conflicts of interest as president and his team briefed reporters on its details before the event. But legal experts who have been raising the alarm about Trump's business for months say the new plan did little to address their concerns. \"The president-elect's disregard for ethics and precedent and the Constitution in his press conference today is going to precipitate an ethics and a Constitutional crisis from the day he's sworn in,\" Norm Eisen, a Brookings fellow and former White House ethics lawyer under President Obama, told MSNBC. The main plank of Trump's plan is to turn his business over to his sons to run, place his assets in a trust (but not a \"blind trust\" typically used by politicians), and appoint officers at his company to vet deals for potential conflicts.

Since Trump still owns his business empire, it's possible for foreign actors or domestic interests to try and influence him by padding his company's profits. Making matters worse, his sons, rather than an independent caretaker, still have direct control over his business, offering him very little distance from its operations. Trump's lawyers say he will not be allowed to request detailed information on his business, but someone could potentially buy a property at a high price, or arrange a favorable loan for his sons, or invest in a major project, and then tell Trump themselves. \"Foreigners and others will continue to be able to ingratiate themselves by doing business with Trump organizations, which enriches Trump,\" Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University specializing in ethics, told NBC News. \"It's really quite simple.\" Oddly enough, Trump offered a perfect illustration of potential conflicts at his press conference by announcing that he had recently turned down a $2 billion deal from a Dubai investor. Under his plan, Trump's companies would not invest in \"foreign jurisdictions,\" but there was no indication foreign actors couldn't invest in Trump projects in the United States. Trump also set forth a legal fight over the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which experts have warned prevents the president from receiving revenue from foreign governments through his companies. His lawyers argue this does not apply to \"fair value exchanges,\" like a stay at one of his hotels at normal rates, and added that he would turn \"profits\" from such stays over to the Treasury Department. But ethics lawyers argue that Trump can't accept any payments at all from foreign governments, not just those above \"fair value.\" There's a good chance this dispute will spark legal challenges. Finally, Trump offered no explanation as to how the public would be able to judge for themselves whether he or his business is affected by conflicts. He has yet to release his taxes -- and reiterated at the press conference he had no plans do so -- and has put out only limited information on his business operations and debts. What is Trump's stance towards Russia? Trump's transition has been roiled by ongoing fallout from what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a major hacking campaign ordered by Vladimir Putin to help boost his candidacy against Hillary Clinton. When it came to hacking, Trump's answers were confusing and it was difficult to tell how he will handle relations with Russia going forward. On the one hand, he said for the first time that he accepted the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind hacks, but he added later \"it could have been others.\" He said Putin \"shouldn't be doing it\" and even suggested he might support sanctions levied by President Obama in response. But Trump also declined to condemn Putin and added \"If Putin likes Trump, I consider that an asset.\" Nor did he sound upset about a Russia cyberattack on American democratic institutions: Echoing his old campaign rallies, he urged the press to \"look at what was learned from that hacking\" of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference in nearly six months at Trump Tower in New York. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) During his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly promised voters a \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d an Obamacare replacement \u201c immediately \u201d and a new era for a Veterans Affairs agency that had \u201cfailed\u201d service members. He acknowledged Wednesday that none of it would be so simple. Trump, who was often content to gloss over details while campaigning,\u00a0is quickly grappling with the complexities of governing. Though\u00a0 Republicans will have majorities in the House and Senate\u00a0and control of the White House for the first time in 10 years, fissures have begun to emerge on how to deliver on their campaign promises. Repealing the Affordable Care Act, a Trump priority and\u00a0the animating force within the GOP since the law passed six years ago, has run into roadblocks since Congress convened last week. The debate centers\u00a0on whether to repeal immediately\u00a0without a replacement plan, which would leave millions of Americans without healthcare.\u00a0 Trump said he would produce his own plan as soon as his Health and Human Services secretary takes office \u2014\u00a0something that could take weeks \u2014\u00a0just one day after demanding that Republicans both repeal and replace the health law as soon as next week. He promised that both parts would happen together. \u201cIt'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously,\u201d he said, calling such a move\u00a0\u201cvery complicated stuff.\u201d Republican leaders have considered a more staggered approach where they would pass\u00a0repeal legislation now that would allow them as much as two years and\u00a0perhaps more time to develop\u00a0a\u00a0replacement. \u201cWe need to do this right. We need to make sure there is a stable transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said. \u201cThis is how we will keep our promise.\u201d The strategy is already in jeopardy. Resistance is growing among Republicans to take a first step toward repeal, approving a procedural budget package. The move had been\u00a0expected later this week, but some lawmakers are worried that it will set a repeal in place before an alternative is ready. A preliminary whip count showed the budget vote was in trouble. President-elect Trump's first press conference: What's clear and what was left unsaid Jan. 11, 2017, 3:24 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration: A breakdown of what Trump revealed to the media today, from business conflicts to Obamacare... (David Lauter) \u201cYou can\u2019t repeal it and replace it quickly. That\u2019s an oxymoron,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), one of the earliest Trump backers in Congress.\u00a0\u201cHe wants us moving it through so we can put it on his desk right away.\u201d Trump once again offered no details about what his plan might look like, other than promising to produce something \u201cfar less expensive and far better\u201d than the current law. As importantly, Trump provided no indication of how he plans to get support from congressional Democrats, who will be needed to pass any replacement to Obamacare. He said simply that the repeal and replacement would probably happen \u201con the same day.\u201d It \u201ccould be the same hour.\u201d And after months in which he blasted the Obama administration for mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs, his opening remarks included a surprise announcement: David Shulkin, a VA undersecretary, is his choice to lead the department.\u00a0 The selection\u00a0came as a shock to veterans groups and represented a considerable setback to the network of nonprofits funded by billionaire industrialists Charles and\u00a0 David Koch . Trump had earlier left the impression he would be cleaning house at the department to implement a free-market approach favored by the Koch organizations that could shift a considerable amount of the care provided by\u00a0VA\u00a0facilities over to the private sector. Shulkin has been an outspoken critic of such an approach, making him a favorite target of the Koch-funded nonprofit Concerned Veterans for America. In a blog post in April, the group characterized Shulkin\u2019s performance taking questions from a congressional\u00a0committee as a \u201cshow of incompetence\u201d and reflective of \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with the VA.\u201d But Trump, who embraced much of the Koch-backed organization\u2019s reform plan during the campaign, passed over contenders for the VA post who favored the blueprint championed by Concerned Veterans for America. Trump appears to have balked amid warnings from mainstream veterans groups representing millions of former soldiers against abandoning the reforms implemented by the Obama administration in favor of an approach more oriented toward privatization. And on the border wall, Trump reminisced about the call-and-response at his rallies of \u201cWho\u2019s gonna pay for it?\u201d \u201cMexico!\u201d But he backed off of\u00a0 his pledge that he would demand Mexico pay for the wall right away, saying he was impatient to begin construction but that talks with Mexico might take longer. \u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u00a0And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.\u201d Trump\u2019s dilemma is not uncommon for presidents-elect, said Martha Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. \u201cIn a campaign, it\u2019s black and white: Your proposals are good and the other guy\u2019s\u00a0aren\u2019t. And you lay out things that really aren\u2019t practical,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it better to just stick with what you said during the campaign, or is it better as you learn more to make changes?\u201d The challenge can be more pronounced for someone with as little governing experience as Trump. \u201cYou have to make compromises. It\u2019s the only way you do it,\u201d Kumar said.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Dec. 8, 2016: Workers construct the viewing stands ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's January inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. \u00a0(Reuters) The stage is set for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2013 not just the traditional swearing-in platform on Capitol Hill, but a massive security presence amid protest plans to \u201cshut down\u201d the nation\u2019s capital. Most crowd estimates for the Jan. 20 festivities are far short of the record-setting 1.8 million visitors for President Obama\u2019s historic 2009 inauguration. But the throngs of spectators and protesters alike are enough to create transit, security and hospitality challenges. \u201cSecurity is my greatest concern,\u201d Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, chairman\u00a0of the\u00a0Joint\u00a0Congressional\u00a0Committee on Inaugural\u00a0Ceremonies, recently said. \u201cNo question that on inaugural day, this would be the most appealing target in the world.\u201d He suggested the city could have as many as 750,000 demonstrators alone. More than three-dozen law enforcement agencies are working together on security and safety plans in anticipation, including the Capitol Police, FBI, Secret Service and National Guard. Roughly 7,500 Guardsmen from across the country will come to Washington, along with about 3,000 police officers from various states, with the Secret Service taking the lead on security.\u00a0\u00a0 Essentially everybody involved already is rehearsing for the big weekend, which kicks off next Friday morning with the swearings-in on the Capitol\u2019s West Front, followed by official events including the traditional parade on Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House and the inaugural balls. The Joint Task Force -- National Capital Region -- 58th Presidential Inauguration has held several \u201ctable top\u201d sessions in which agencies plot strategy over a large-scale, three-dimensional map. \u201cIt\u2019s a rehearsal, but in the military we call it a drill,\u201d Navy Cmdr. Jonathan Blyth, the group\u2019s spokesman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this since the last inauguration. We\u2019re focused to protecting and honoring a new commander in chief.\u201d The task force and its Capitol Hill counterpart are holding a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d this weekend for the swearings-in, the Presidential Review of troops and the parade along the roughly 2.5-mile stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue. Several protest groups planning large-scale demonstrations have permits in place and have already held organizational meetings, among them the collaborative DisruptJ20. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a series of massive, direct actions that will shut down the inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations,\u201d the group says. \u201cWe\u2019re also planning to paralyze the city.\u201d Organizers say they are targeting everything from the parade to the balls and plan to use blockades and protesters to stop traffic, public transit and parties. The group RefuseFacism.org is planning a small-scale protest Saturday in the city\u2019s McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, that organizers hope will grow into larger inauguration-weekend protests. The group burned U.S. flags this summer at the Democratic and Republican national conventions and this week tried to disrupt the Senate confirmation hearing for Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions to become Trump\u2019s attorney general. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to meet with [Trump], but I would say to him, \u2018You\u2019re a fascist. Your regime is illegitimate.\u2019 And it must not be allowed to take power,\u201d the group\u2019s Carl Dix told Fox on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Dix acknowledged the group doesn\u2019t have a federal or city permit to protest but still intends to \u201cstop the regime.\u201d The two major groups with permits are a pro-Trump organization and the ANSWER Coalition, which turned out the largest anti-war protests during the Bush years and next weekend has a permit for a mass protest at Freedom Plaza, near the parade route.\u00a0 The other group is Bikers for Trump, a familiar presence on last year\u2019s campaign trail and visitors to both 2016 major-party conventions. The group\u2019s permit shows members at John Marshall Park, near the Canadian Embassy and close to the parade route. The biggest protest is expected to take place the following day -- the Women\u2019s March on Washington. Organizers have finally received a permit and estimate 200,000 attendees, with celebrities such as Amy Schumer and Scarlett Johansson reportedly among them. Blyth said the big variable next weekend, as usual, will be the weather. Eight inches of snow fell the night before John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration in 1961. \u201cThe weather is always the biggest challenge,\u201d Blyth said. \u201cWe\u2019re reading the Farmer\u2019s Almanac and always checking forecasts.\u201d The 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee will hold at least two official -- or \u201csanctioned\u201d -- balls.\u00a0 Among the other balls that week will be the Deplorables Inaugural Ball , at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and the Salute to the Heroes Inaugural Ball, at the Renaissance hotel downtown. Trump boasted this week that so many people are attending balls and other events that dress shops are sold out. However, Calypso St. Barts women\u2019s shop, in Georgetown, said Wednesday it has plenty of options still available. \u201cWe still have many nice pieces, including some cocktail dresses,\u201d store manager Briona Jackson said. \u201cWe have items on sale and can get gowns from our other stores.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Griff Jenkins contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Pavel works for Town and Country Pest Solutions, a family-owned business in Rochester, New York, that follows a simple rule: \u201cLove God, Love People, Serve Others, Tell Everyone.\u201d Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! On Tuesday, Pavel was on his way to a pest control appointment when he came across a motorist standing in the roadway. \u201cI was approaching a red light and I saw the man standing at the back of his car,\u201d Pavel told me. \u201cI thought maybe he was trying to flag someone down.\u201d It was clear the man was in distress. It turns out he was choking to death. Pavel jumped out of his vehicle and rushed to the man\u2019s side \u2013 while the dash cam video in the company van recorded the entire incident. Click here to preorder Todd\u2019s NEW book \u2013 The Deplorables\u2019 Guide to Making America Great Again! He tried patting the man on the back \u2013 hoping that would dislodge whatever was in the guy\u2019s throat \u2013 but it did not work. And performing the Heimlich maneuver proved to be a bit difficult because the victim was a bit larger than Pavel. In addition to being a fighter, Pavel appeared on two seasons of the hit television show \"America Ninja Warrior.\" So, he knows a thing or two about improvisation. And that\u2019s how he came up with the idea to employ a maneuver he normally uses on fighters during cage matches. \u201cI got a Gable Grip on the guy and just picked him up off the ground,\u201d Pavel said. The improvised emergency maneuver did the trick and the blockage was cleared in a matter of just a few seconds. \u201cHe thanked me but it all happened so fast I didn\u2019t even get his name,\u201d he said. Back at the pest control company, Pavel\u2019s co-workers were shocked by the video. They called him a hero \u2013 but that\u2019s not how Pavel sees things. \u201cI just helped somebody out. I took 30 seconds out of my day to help somebody,\u201d he said. Caleb Fabry, the president of Town and Country Pest Solution, sent me a copy of the video on Facebook. \u201cThis guy showed us in this video that nothing matters but life and love,\u201d Mr. Fabry said. \u201cI think that is one of the most touching parts of this whole video.\u201d And that brings me back to the company\u2019s ethos. \u201cYes, we kill bugs and remove animals from people\u2019s homes, but more importantly, we do what we do because we love helping others, plain and simple,\u201d Mr. Fabry said. \u201cWe believe that our business is successful and in the good place that we are in only because of our God. We give Him all the glory.\u201d I believe there is a lesson for us to learn from this modern-day parable that unfolded on a street corner in Rochester.

Tribune news services Contact Reporter A defiant President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday adamantly denied reports that Russia had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him, calling it a \"tremendous blot\" on the record of the intelligence community if such material had been released. The incoming president, in his first news conference since late July, firmly chided news organizations for publishing the material late Tuesday night. After weeks of scoffing at reports that Russians had interfered in the election, he conceded publicly for the first time that Russia was likely responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. \"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" he said and quickly added that the United States is hacked by other countries as well, including China. Trump's extraordinary defense against the unsubstantiated intelligence report, just nine days before his inauguration, dominated a highly anticipated press conference in which he also announced a new Cabinet member, detailed his plans to disentangle himself from his sprawling global business empire, gave his outlook on the future of the \"Obamacare\" health care law and said he would soon nominate someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \"I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting,\" he said, a reference to a classified briefing he received from intelligence leaders. \"It's all fake news, it's phony stuff, it didn't happen,\" Trump said in a news conference that saw him repeatedly joust with reporters. \"It was gotten by opponents of ours.\" Asked about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump boasted that it is an improvement over what he called America's current \"horrible relationship with Russia\" and did not criticize the Russian leader for any interference in the election. \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset not a liability. I don't know if I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin \u2014 I hope I do \u2014 but there's a good chance I won't.\" Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer also denounced the report about Russia's influence on Trump, and the incoming president said it never should have been released. He thanked some news organizations for showing restraint. Tribune news services Donald Trump 's business will continue to pursue deals in the United States, though not abroad, while he is president, and he will relinquish control of the company, a lawyer who worked with the Trump Organization on the plan said Wednesday. Trump will put his business assets in a trust and take... Donald Trump 's business will continue to pursue deals in the United States, though not abroad, while he is president, and he will relinquish control of the company, a lawyer who worked with the Trump Organization on the plan said Wednesday. Trump will put his business assets in a trust and take... (Tribune news services) A U.S. official told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that intelligence officials had informed Trump last week about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the intelligence community's findings last week, the official said. Media outlets reported on the document late Tuesday and Trump denounced it on Twitter before his news conference as \"fake news,\" suggesting he was being persecuted for defeating other GOP presidential hopefuls and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the election. The dossier contains unproven information about close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians about hacking into Democratic accounts as well as unproven claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump among other suggestions attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated any of the claims. ",

By Lisa Rein January 11 at 6:45 PM Follow @Reinlwapo Walter Shaub, head of the Government Ethics Office The head of the federal Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday denounced President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plan to separate the presidency from his business empire as \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d and said it does not meet the standards met by the \u201cbest of his nominees.\u201d \u201cThe ethics program starts at the top,\u201d Director Walter Shaub said at a Brookings Institution forum in Washington. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk creating the perception that government officials will use their positions for personal profit.\u201d The unusual and lengthy statement from the government\u2019s top ethics lawyer came hours after Trump outlined plans to shift his assets into a trust managed by his sons and give up management of his private company. Shaub said that Trump should place all of his assets in a blind trust instead to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the White House, echoing arguments that ethics lawyers have made in recent weeks. \u201cThis is not a blind trust,\u201d Shaub said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close.\u201d [Tr ump announces plan to shift assets and management of his company\u00a0 ] Shaub, whose staff is poring over the financial holdings of Trump\u2019s nominees for Cabinet posts, was unusual in his public condemnation of the incoming president. He praised former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, for putting his vast retirement package into a trust that will be independently managed\u00a0and cannot invest in\u00a0the company he headed. \u201cIt\u2019s a sterling model for what we\u2019d like to see with other nominees,\u201d Shaub said. Then he added: \u201cThe cost is often greater\u00a0the higher up you go.\u201d Shaub said Trump \u201cstill has time\u201d to resolve his ethical conflicts properly. He also spoke for the first time about a tweetstorm\u00a0 from his office\u00a0a few weeks after the election. The tweets congratulated Trump on divesting himself of his business holdings and were composed, public records requests have revealed, by Shaub himself. But the president-elect had not, and still has not, agreed to that plan. Shaub said Wednesday that he was \u201ctrying to use the vernacular of the president\u2019s favorite social media platform to encourage him to divest\u201d when he sent the tweets. The ethics office does not have enforcement power, so there is not much Shaub can do to force Trump\u2019s hand on his business conflicts. \u201cBut public outcry can make a difference,\u201d said Norman Eisen, a Brookings fellow who served in the Obama White House from 2009 to 2011 as special counsel and special assistant to the president, helping lead the administration\u2019s ethics policies. Eisen and\u00a0Richard Painter, the chief ethics lawyer for former president George W. Bush, led the Brookings event. powerpost ",

Donald Trump's attorney explains how the president-elect is turning over his business to a trust run by his sons, but he won't divest. Watch Trum... Instead, Trump will move his assets into a trust controlled by his two oldest sons, who will also manage the Trump Organization. They will not pursue new international deals, and will hire an ethics adviser to oversee new deals in the U.S. They will also not consult with Trump on business matters. \u201cI hope at the end of eight years I\u2019ll come back and say, \u2018oh, you did a good job.\u2019 Otherwise, if they do a bad job I\u2019ll say \u2018you\u2019re fired,\u2019\u201d Trump said. On Wednesday, Walter Shaub, the head of the government ethics office, called the plan \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d Walter Shaub CBS News \u201cThe plan the [president-elect] has announced doesn\u2019t meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting, and that every president in the past four decades has met,\u201d Shaub said. The arrangement means Trump could have dealings as president with foreign countries where he also has a financial stake. CBS News has counted at least 10 countries , including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, where the president-elect has business interests . \u201cHe needs to sell the businesses, free himself of conflicts of interests,\u201d said Richard Painter, the ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush. Painter said Trump could violate a constitutional provision that forbids a government official from receiving payments from foreign governments. For example, a state-run Chinese bank is a tenant in Trump Tower New York. ",

By David Nakamura and Abby Phillip January 11 at 1:20 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @abbydphillip President-elect Donald Trump acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he believes Russian operatives hacked the Democratic Party during the election, but he continued to dispute intelligence reports that Moscow acted to help him win. \u201cI think it was Russia,\u201d Trump said at a news conference in New York when asked who was responsible for the public leaks of Democratic emails during the campaign. But Trump emphasized that he believes Russia also would have released damaging information about him had they obtained such information. He angrily denounced news reports that U.S. officials had obtained an unsubstantiated dossier of potentially compromising personal information Russia has allegedly gathered about him, citing denials from the Kremlin that it has any such intelligence. U.S. officials reportedly included a two-page summary of the dossier in classified briefings of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election to President Obama and, separately, to Trump last week. Trump and his aides, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, called the leaks of the information a smear campaign that aimed to damage Trump politically. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that that information would be let out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI saw the information; I read the information outside that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news \u2014 phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump also addressed questions about his relationship with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, with whom he has expressed a desire to improve bilateral relations. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what folks, that\u2019s an asset not a liability,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get along with Vladi\u00admir Putin . . . but even if I don\u2019t does anyone in this room think Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Putin than me? Give me a break.\u201d Trump made his remarks in his first news conference as president-elect, ending a period of 167 days since he has fielded questions from the full media contingent. Past winners of the presidency have traditionally faced the media much earlier. An estimated 250 journalists were crowded into the lobby of Trump Tower, where Trump aides had set up 10 American flags in front of a blue curtain. During the news conference, Trump announced that he has tapped David Shulkin, a physician who is serving in the Obama administration as Veterans Affairs undersecretary, to lead VA. And he detailed plans to shift his business assets into a trust managed by his sons and give up management of his private company, a step that will help the business executive move closer to resolving potential conflicts of interest. He also again resisted the idea that he should release his tax returns, saying \u201cthe only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters\u201d and suggesting the public does not care about the issue. Earlier in the day, Trump had charged via Twitter that his \u201ccrooked opponents\u201d are trying to undermine his electoral victory. He accused the intelligence community of leaking the information to get in \u201cone last shot at me,\u201d saying, \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d 1 of 18 Photos from Trump\u2019s first news conference in six months View Photos President-elect Donald Trump holds the meeting in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Caption President-elect Donald Trump took questions in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Jan. 11, 2017 President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by his family, arrives for the news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post [ Intelligence chiefs briefed Trump and Obama on unconfirmed claims Russia has compromising information on president-elect ] At the news conference, Pence and Sean Spicer, who has been tapped to be White House press secretary in Trump\u2019s administration, also denounced news organizations for their reports on the unsubstantiated dossier. Trump and his aides took particular aim at CNN, which broke the story that intelligence officials had included it in their briefings, and BuzzFeed News, which published a copy of the dossier in full. Trump refused to allow a CNN reporter to ask a question. \u201cYou are fake news,\u201d Trump said to the reporter, Jim Acosta, who had shouted out in an attempt to be called upon. The president-elect called BuzzFeed \u201ca failing pile of garbage.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace what took place, and I think they ought to apologize to start with,\u201d he said. U.S. officials said that intelligence agencies have not corroborated the allegations contained in the dossier but believed the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Earlier Wednesday, a spokesman for Putin called the allegations that Russia has collected compromising information about Trump an \u201cabsolute fantasy.\u201d Soon after, Trump tweeted: \u201cRussia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \u2018A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\u2019 Very unfair!\u201d Speaking Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Trump adviser Reince Priebus called the BuzzFeed report \u201cphony baloney garbage.\u201d He denied that Trump had engaged in compromising behavior in Russia and that Trump aide Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian officials. Both allegations were contained in the document published by BuzzFeed. \u201cThere was no craziness in Russia. There was no meeting in Prague,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt is not an intelligence document. Cohen has never been in Prague. And all of this stuff isn\u2019t even fit to print in the New York Times.\u201d In an interview Tuesday night with NBC News, Obama said that he had not seen the reports and declined to comment on classified information. [ Two cities, two dramas and one day of tests for Donald Trump ] On immigration, Trump insisted he will build a wall \u2014 not a fence \u2014 along the southern U.S. border with Mexico, reiterating that Mexico will \u201creimburse\u201d the United States for the cost after it is initially funded by taxpayers. Republican leaders in Congress have been working with Pence and other Trump aides to develop legislation to start the process, which is projected to cost billions of dollars. \u201cMexico, through some form . . . will reimburse us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat will happen. Whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference\u201d if the payment is a reimbursement, Trump added. \u201cI want to get the wall started. I don\u2019t want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u201d Wrapping up the news conference, Trump pointed to a work table piled with a massive stack of folders bursting with papers that was set up next to the lectern. The documents related to his business holdings, Trump said, and they represented some of the assets he would turn over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric to oversee under the new arrangement in which he will not be involved in management decisions. \u201cI hope at the end of eight years I\u2019ll come back and say, \u2018Oh, you did a good job,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, before falling back on a catchphrase he made famous on his television show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he added, \u201cif they do a bad job, I\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019 \u201d Drew Harwell, Jena McGregor and John Wagner contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

John Lewis and other prominent Democrats within the Congressional Black Caucus testified against Sen. Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, staking a clear opposition to the Alabama senator's appointment as attorney general. Lewis, Sen. Cory Booker, Rep. Cedric Richmond and others marked Day 2 of a heated confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee by telling their congressional colleagues that Sessions was unfit to lead the Justice Department. Minority lawmakers worry that Sessions, a conservative who has voted against measures aimed at criminalizing attacks on gays as hate crimes and the Violence Against Women Act, will not aggressively protect the rights of marginalized groups. Sen. Cory Session, D-N.J. listens at left as Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2017, at the second day of a confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Cliff Owen / AP \"We need someone who is going to stand up, speak up and speak out for the people who need help, for the people who have been discriminated against,\" Lewis said. The clash was history making. Before Wednesday, no sitting senator had ever testified against a Senate colleague in their confirmation hearings for a Cabinet position. But the break of congressional norms is a marker of contentious confirmation battle ahead for many of President-elect Donald Trump's top picks to lead his new administration. \"I believe, like perhaps all of my colleagues in the Senate, that in the choice between standing with Senate norms and standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for my country, I will always choose conscience and country,\" Booker said.

Scott Olson/Getty Images A Pew survey of police officers across the U.S. found that most officers believe their jobs have grown more difficult and more dangerous following a series of high-profile deaths of black citizens during encounters with police. The survey also uncovered sharp disparities between the perceptions of black and white officers \u2014 and between officers and the general public \u2014 over the state of race relations in America. Pew calls the survey \"one of the largest ever conducted with a nationally representative sample of police.\" The survey addressed a range of topics, but a number of questions examined what Pew described as \"high-profile fatal encounters between black citizens and police officers,\" and how police perceived the impact. Concerns Over Safety, Effectiveness Some of the most striking results: 86 percent of police officers say such incidents have made their job harder, and 93 percent said they have made them more concerned about safety. NPR's Martin Kaste, who covers law enforcement, says that 93 percent stat jumps out \"in this post-Ferguson era.\" He also highlighted another statistic in the Pew survey: 72 percent of respondents say after recent high-profile incidents, they have become less willing to stop and question people who seem suspicious. Some people \u2014 including attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions \u2014 have suggested that public criticism of police has led to a drop in police morale and to a spike in crime in certain cities. The Pew survey is indicative of one way morale and crime rate might be linked, Martin says . Here's more of Martin's reporting on the issue: \"Eugene O'Donnell, former NYPD [officer and] former prosecutor, now on the faculty of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice ... says it's clear to him that the broad criticisms of the last couple of years has made cops less eager to do their jobs in places like Chicago. \"They have no clear mandate, they have no clear mission, they believe they're not going to be supported, and the major thing you hear from Chicago cops is stay fetal \u2014 go fetal, stay fetal,\" [O'Donnell said]. \"With Donald Trump about to become president, that's become the ascendant narrative in American policing: that cops are going fetal because of unfair criticism, which leads to higher crime. Chicago has become this argument's case in point, but that's not entirely fair, says Lori Lightfoot. She's been at the forefront of the reform efforts there. \" 'I mean, in Chicago, yes arrests are down, yes investigatory stops are down, but at the same time, they're taking 8,000 illegal guns off the street every year,' [Lightfoot said]. 'You don't do that if you're sitting back and not doing your job.' \" Martin Kaste on 'Morning Edition': Reformers In An 'Uphill Battle' ",

In Donald Trump's first press conference as president-elect, he spoke about his ties to Russia, the upcoming inauguration, and bringing jobs to t... In a tweet hours later, Mr. Trump described the press conference as \u201cgreat,\u201d but also slammed \u201cfake news\u201d outlets.\u00a0 We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Though the motivation for the news conference was to outline how he will deal with his complex web of business interests once he\u2019s in the White House, much of the press conference ended up focusing on Russian election interference and on reports Tuesday that the intelligence community\u2019s classified report on Russian hacking had an addendum with unverified details of potentially compromising information that Russia has gathered on the president-elect, and that Mr. Trump was briefed on last week. Here are some of the highlights: Russian hacking, and reports of Russia holding \u201ccompromising information\u201d on him Mr. Trump said he\u2019s not allowed to discuss information that was presented during his intelligence briefing -- but confirmed that outside the briefing, he did in fact see the memo in question on compromising information, calling it a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump slams reports that Russia has potentially compromising information about him. \u201cI saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news -- it\u2019s phony stuff, it didn\u2019t happen and it was gotten by opponents of ours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a group of opponents who got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.\u201d Asked whether he accepts the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia actively worked to influence the 2016 election, Mr. Trump said he believes Russia was responsible for the hacking -- but stopped short of saying he believed they had an influence on the campaign. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people and I can say that when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that, that was something that was extraordinary.\u201d Asked if he had a message for Putin about future hacking activities, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it, he won\u2019t be doing it.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump talks about his potential relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cRussia will have much greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it than when other people have led it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see that.\u201d He said he considers Putin\u2019s praise of him to be \u201can asset, not a liability,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t yet know whether he and Putin will \u201cget along.\u201d \u201cNow I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get along with Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I do, but \u2026 do you honestly believe that Hillary [Clinton] will be tougher on Putin than me?\u201d Separation from business empire Though Mr. Trump asserted that he would have been able to continue running his business from the White House if he wanted to, he said his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr., along with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, would take over his businesses while he\u2019s president.\u00a0 Donald Trump's attorney explains how the president-elect is turning over his business to a trust run by his sons, but he won't divest. Watch Trum... \u201cI could actually run my business ... and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that looks but I\u2019d be able to if I wanted to.\u201d The stacks of manila folders on the table next to Mr. Trump at the podium were, he said, \u201csome of the many documents I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control.\u201d \u00a0 Mr. Trump introduced Sherri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, a lawyer who has been working on the plan for the Trump business empire. Dillon said Mr. Trump\u2019s business holdings and investments will be put in a trust before Inauguration Day to be overseen by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Mr. Trump also said that his two adult sons will run the company. Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared Kushner is set to become a senior adviser to the Trump White House, will have \u201cno further management\u201d role in the company. There will be \u201cno new foreign deals\u201d made during the duration of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Dillon added, and domestic deals will be subject to \u201csevere restrictions.\u201d To people who suggest Mr. Trump should sell his business, Dillon said that would only \u201cexacerbate\u201d the possibility for conflicts. Additionally, in order to ensure that \u201cit is the American people who will profit\u201d going forward, Mr. Trump has directed that all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels will be donated to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d Media criticism At the start of the press conference, Mr. Trump thanked news organizations that did not run stories on Russia\u2019s alleged compromising information about him.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Pentagon could be poised for a rapid about-face under the Trump administration, with the Obama administration\u2019s push for social reform surrendering to what could be an old-school emphasis on combat readiness and the spirit of the United States military, experts told FoxNews.com. Under President Obama, the military sought to integrate transgender persons into the ranks, allow women into special operations forces and purge the nomenclature of gender-specific words, adopting what some critics say was a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d liberal agenda. That\u2019s a contrast to the traditional U.S. military approach. In addition, some Navy ships have been named for civil rights activists.\u00a0 And while the Obama administration has taken an inclusive approach on some issues, it has also worked to minimize expressions of Christianity in the ranks. For example, several officers have been disciplined for displaying Bibles or gospel verses in their quarters. Veterans and military experts told FoxNews.com that, while some of Obama\u2019s civil rights advancements may be locked in, neither Trump nor his choice for secretary of defense, Gen. James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, are likely to make social experimentation a priority. \u201cHere in [the Pentagon], we don\u2019t say merry Christmas, and I think we have been misguided when it comes to our history and who we are as a nation, and political correctness is indicative of that,\u201d Department of Defense contractor and retired Army Col. Robert Maginnis told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt has struck this building in a big way and we need to get away from that. Our focus is defending this country, and we should not spend so much time on social engineering.\u201d Mattis, who on Thursday goes before the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation process, will likely \u201cbring the warrior ethos back to the Pentagon,\u201d Maginnis said. That mentality was \u201cdrained by the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be known as a good soldier or Marine and not by your sexuality, your gender or your particular faith. We need everyone to pull in the same direction and not espouse a particular personal agenda that doesn\u2019t fit into the nation\u2019s best long-term interest.\u201d Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News contributor, said the strong emphasis on social reform in the last eight years sometimes came at the expense of the military\u2019s core objective. \u201cSocial engineering was a distractor from what the main mission of the United States military was about,\u201d Keane said. \u201cWe were involved in conflict and war, and these reforms achieved a level of prominence that subordinated the issue of war itself.\u201d A spokesperson for the outgoing Obama Department of Defense said Pentagon Secretary Ash Carter has \u201cmade it clear\u201d that he will let the incoming administration make their own policy decisions, despite disagreements. \u201cThe principle, put simply by Secretary Carter, is that if a service member wants to serve and is qualified to serve, and meets requirements to serve in that position, they should do so, and that is the principle that underlines all of this,\u201d the spokesperson told FoxNews.com. \u201cBut it is entirely up to the next Administration and we are focused on ensuring they have all of the support that we can provide to ensure they enjoy a smooth, seamless transition.\u201d Under a Mattis-led Department of Defense, Maginnis expects the issue of women in combat to be re-visited. One year ago Secretary of Defense Ash Carter opened direct land combat jobs in the infantry and special operations to women. Last year, Mattis said women should not be in combat because, if they were, the nation\u2019s enemies wouldn\u2019t fear \u201cAmerica\u2019s awesome determination to defend herself.\u201d He said physical standards for combat jobs would become more lax, and women would not have privacy for their \u201cbodily functions.\u201d In a book on civilian-military relations, co-edited with Kori Schake, Mattis warned of the danger of civilian leaders with a \u201cprogressive agenda.\u201d His book also warns that \u201can uninformed public is permitting political leaders to impose an accretion of social conventions that are diminishing the combat power of our military.\u201d That\u2019s an opinion Maginnis agrees with. \u201cPolitical appointees have a lot of political persuasion,\u201d Maginnis said. \u201cThey are essentially political animals kowtowing to their political masters who have an agenda.\u201d \u201cI think the seriousness Mattis will bring to this building will be translated through every policy we begin to execute,\u201d Maginnis said. \u201cI think he will put a stamp on the organization that will be positive \u2013 no more political correctness, just a focus on being warriors.\u201d In addition to facing the normal confirmation process, Mattis needs a waiver from the legal requirement to have been out of uniform for seven years before accepting a political appointment. President-elect Trump also appointed Florida Panthers owner and billionaire Vincent Viola as secretary of the Army. Viola, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., achieved the rank of major in the U.S. Army Reserves, but has spent much of his career as one of the nation\u2019s foremost leaders in electronic trading. That career background contrasts to that of current Army Secretary Eric Fanning, most of whose work has been in the public sector and is the first openly gay head of any branch of the U.S. military.

    "text": "Jim Puzzanghera President-elect Donald Trump's plan to let his sons run his business drew a biting attack Wednesday from the\u00a0federal government's top ethics official, who said Trump is setting a bad example for the rest of government. Walter M. Shaub, Jr., director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said in remarks at the Brookings Institution that Trump\u2019s \u201cperplexing\u201d plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every president in the past four decades has met.\u201d Trump said he would retain ownership of his businesses but step back from running them, placing them in a trust to be run by sons Donald Jr. and Eric. He and his attorney said Wednesday that the plan would mean he has no involvement in decisions and little information about what his sons are doing. Shaub said that didn't solve anything. \u201cThe only thing this has in common with a blind trust is the label \u2018trust,'\" Shaub said. \u201cHis sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns.\u201d \u201cStepping back from running his\u00a0business is meaningless from a conflict-of-interest perspective,\u201d Shaub said, adding that it is \u201cquite obviously not true\u201d that the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest. Just because the federal conflict-of-interest law doesn\u2019t apply to the president doesn\u2019t mean no conflicts will occur, he said. \u201cFor that reason, it\u2019s been the consistent policy of the executive branch that the president should act as though the financial conflict-of-interest law applied,\u201d Shaub said. Shaub, a former deputy general counsel at the nonpartisan agency, was nominated by President Obama and confirmed\u00a0by the Senate for a five-year term that ends next year. He said he was speaking out in hopes that \u201csome constructive feedback\u201d from the office could encourage Trump to change his plan. He also pushed back on an argument from Trump's lawyer that it would be unfair to expect Trump to dump\u00a0his businesses at a \"fire sale.\" \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the president is now entering the world of public service,\u201d Shaub said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk\u00a0their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don\u2019t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the\u00a0president.\u201d ",

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump takes questions during his first news conference since the election. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption toggle caption President-elect Donald Trump takes questions during his first news conference since the election. Seth Wenig/AP This has been updated at 3:50 pm ET. President-elect Donald Trump denounced as \"fake news\" Wednesday reports that Russia had compromising information about him before the election. He also acknowledged for the first time that Russia was behind the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee, although he seemed to couch it later in the news conference by saying it \"could have been others.\" Trump Outlines Plan To Avoid Business Conflicts, Addresses Hacking In his first news conference since last summer, the president-elect additionally said he would be handing over control of his businesses to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric; refused once again to release his income tax returns; and said his administration would reveal its plan to replace the Affordable Care Act as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is confirmed by the Senate. Trump said the unverified and unsubstantiated reports about the Russian intelligence were put together by political opponents, whom he called \"sick people.\" The reports, he said, were \"a disgrace,\" and he vehemently denounced BuzzFeed News, which published a 35-page memo purportedly outlining the Russian intelligence, as \"a failing pile of garbage.\" He also denied a question from a CNN reporter, which first broke the story of an intelligence report but did not publish the documents or the lewd details. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Announces David Shulkin As Pick For Secretary Of Veterans Affairs But Trump didn't answer a question as to whether his presidential campaign had been in contact with the Russian government, which the report alleged. CNN reporter Jim Acosta noted later on the network that reporters followed up on that point as Trump was heading to the elevators off camera, and Trump said no one \"associated with him or his campaign was in contact with the Russians\" during the campaign. Watch Live: Rex Tillerson Pressed On Russia At Secretary Of State Hearing Trump was also critical of U.S. intelligence agencies for \"maybe\" leaking the report to news organizations, charging that a meeting he had recently with the agencies immediately leaked out even though he had kept it secret from his closest staff. Trump said, \"I think it was Russia\" who hacked into the DNC's servers but added \"it could have been others also.\" U.S. intelligence publicly stated last October \u2014 and in congressional hearings and an unclassified report since \u2014 that the Russian government was to blame for the cyberattack. Trump called hacking \"bad\" and said he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin \"he shouldn't have done it. I don't believe he will be doing it more.\" But he also said he would consider it \"an asset, not a liability,\" if Putin likes him. \"I don't know if I'll get along\" with the Russian leader, Trump said, \"I hope I do.\" Trump also denied taking part in any salacious behavior in a Moscow hotel room, saying he always tells people to be very careful when he travels abroad, because \"you have cameras in the strangest places. You'd better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.\" Plus, he added, \"Does anyone really believe that story? I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way. Believe me.\" Trump held his news conference in the marble-lined lobby of Trump Tower in New York, speaking alongside a table piled with manila file folders, which he said were the agreements he has signed giving control of the Trump Organization to his oldest sons. He introduced attorney Sheri Dillon, of the firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, who said that at Trump's request she had designed a structure \"that will completely isolate him\" from the management of the company. Trump is conveying leadership and management of the company to his adult sons and longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg. Dillon said the three will \"make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever\" by Trump. Dillon also said the trust agreement \"imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration\" of Trump's presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through \"a vigorous vetting process.\" Trump will not be informed of such deals and will only learn of them if he \"reads it in the paper or sees it on TV.\" And, she said, Trump will donate to the U.S Treasury all profits made from foreign governments who stay at his hotel. On health care, Trump said \"the easiest thing\" would be to let the Affordable Care Act \"implode\" this year, because of increased premium rates. He said Obamacare \"is the Democrats' problem,\" but that he will offer a plan to repeal and replace that is \"gonna take the problem off the shelves for them.\" The plan will be \"far less expensive and far better,\" he said, and will be submitted almost simultaneously as his HHS secretary is confirmed. Trump also revealed he will be nominating David Shulkin as secretary of the Veterans Administration. Shulkin is currently the No. 2 at the troubled agency and would be one of the first holdovers from the Obama administration. Trump called him an incredibly gifted doctor. Trump also took a shot at the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, which he charged \"has been disastrous.\" He said drugmakers have been leaving the country left and right and that new bidding procedures are needed for the industry \"because they're getting away with murder.\" Trump's comments caused drug stocks to fall on Wall Street ",

(Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) Tim Tebow did not get an invitation to the New York Mets' major league spring training camp, despite his manager's wishes. Instead, he will report to the Mets' minor-league camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla. to continue\u00a0his\u00a0pursuit of a major league career. Tebow was omitted from the list of major league camp invitees announced by the Mets on Wednesday. At last month's winter meetings, manager Terry Collins expressed his desire about having Tebow at spring training. MLB announces 2017 Spring Training schedule \u201cI will tell you if he\u2019s not in our camp, I\u2019ll get him over,\" Collins said. \"I think he\u2019s a name in Florida. He\u2019s a star in Florida. He should be. I think it would be fun to have Tim come over. And certainly one thing about our players, they\u2019re athletes, too. They\u2019re fans, too. They would probably like to know how to run a quarterback sneak one day.\u201d It remains possible that Tebow play in Grapefruit League games, as teams commonly utilize players from minor league camp, particularly early in the spring season. The Mets' Grapefruit opener is Feb. 24 against the Boston Red Sox in Fort Myers. Collins visited Arizona and watched Tebow play in the Fall League,\u00a0but admitted he did not\u00a0meet with Tebow. Tebow, the former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, had his moments in the Fall League, but struggled against some of baseball's best young pitchers. In his\u00a019-game stint, he\u00a0batted .194 with 20 strikeouts in 62 at-bats. Pitchers and catchers are expected to report on Feb.\u00a014 with the first full workout scheduled for Feb.\u00a019.

Separately, Rohit Kachroo, security editor for NBC News British partner ITV News, reported that his name is Christopher David Steele, a former officer with MI6 who was posted to Moscow in 1990. The memo was originally generated on behalf of Republican opponents of Trumps but was later shopped to the media by Democrats. Play Trump: 'Disgraceful' for Intel Agencies to Let Out 'Fake' News 1:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170112044802if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/852603459965\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Orbis director Christopher Burrows told the Wall Street Journal he wouldn't \"confirm or deny\" that Orbis had produced the report, and a neighbor of Steele's told the newspaper he would be away for a few days. A two-page summary of the 35-page memo was included in supporting material prepared for the officials who briefed President-elect Trump on Friday about a U.S. intelligence report on Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential elections, according to multiple officials. However, Trump was not orally briefed on the two-page \"annex\" outlining the allegations about him, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official with the knowledge of the preparation of the briefing. Trump said he learned the gist of the summary \"outside that meeting.\" The two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material was made available to the briefers to provide context for Trump should they want to draw a distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted \"disinformation,\" according to the official. The briefers also had available to them unvetted \"disinformation\" about the Clinton Foundation, though that was not briefed to Trump either. The existence of the two-page synopsis was first reported by CNN yesterday afternoon. Their decision to report on the synopsis, as well as the publication of the complete 35-page memo by BuzzFeed, was harshly criticized by Trump. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) \"I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake to get out,\" Trump said a press conference in New York today. \"That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.\" The memo, which suggested that Trump could be blackmailed by Russian intelligence, was circulated among Trump opponents over the summer and was eventually passed to the FBI. Today, Republican Senator John McCain admitted that he also passed the memorandum to the FBI. Hans Nichols ",

    "text": "Trump Says Sons Will Take 'Complete and Total Control' of the Business By Alexander Mallin Jan 11, 2017, 11:59 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Tax Lawyer Lays Out Trump's Plan for Businesses 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump announced this morning that he will hand \"complete and total control\" of his vast business empire to his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and to Alan Weisselberg, a longtime Trump business executive, through a financial trust. In a long-awaited press conference, Donald Trump Sr. introduced Sheri Dillon, a lawyer at firm Morgan Lewis in Washington, D.C. , who he said organized a way to \"completely isolate [Trump] from the management of the company.\" Despite Trump's previous pledge to put his business assets into a blind trust, Dillon said that would not be possible. \"You cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses,\" she said. \"President Trump can't un-know he owns Trump Tower.\" Dillon announced Trump's protective plans to ensure he is not in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits officials from accepting gifts or emoluments from foreign governments \u2014 which ethics experts have alleged Trump could violate without complete divestment from his businesses. \"The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here, but just like with conflicts of interest, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires,\" she said. \"He is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.\" Dillon said that Trump's decision to separate himself from the Trump Organization was made \"voluntarily\" and noted that under U.S. conflict of interest laws the president and vice president \"are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets.\" \"He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit,\" she said. Trump suggested that he would be capable of handling his business responsibilities and the presidency concurrently. \"I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don't like the way that looks. But I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can't do that in any other capacity,\" he said. According to Dillon, Trump is relinquishing leadership and management of his real estate empire and will no longer be involved in decision-making with the company's new leadership. Several ethics experts contacted by ABC News after today's announcement scoffed at the suggestion Trump was effectively distancing himself from his business. \"Tragically, the Trump plan to deal with his business conflicts announced today falls short in every respect,\" said former Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen. \"Mr. Trump did not make a clean break with his business ownership interests as his predecessors for four decades have done, did not establish a blind trust or the equivalent, as bipartisan experts and [the Office of Government Ethics] called for ... Mr. Trump's ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption.\" Richard Painter, the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said the plan announced by Trump \"doesn't work.\" \"He still maintains ownership \u2013 the assets are not being sold,\" he explained. \"The sons are in charge of his assets which is a problem, but the bigger problem is that assets are not being sold.\" More importantly, \"President-elect Trump needs to release tax returns so we get a sense of involvement with Russia,\" Painter said.

USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11, 2017. It was his first press conference in nearly six months. (Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) President-elect Donald Trump brought his campaign against what he considers fake news to his first major press conference since\u00a0winning the election. What played out could suggest\u00a0contentious times ahead\u00a0for mainstream media outlets while covering the incoming administration. At one point, the president-elect shouted down CNN reporter Jim Acosta, labeling the cable news network as \"fake news\" for its report that U.S. intelligence agencies had briefed the incoming president and President Obama with allegations that Russian operatives claim to have potentially compromising personal and financial information about Trump. Getting\u00a0worse criticism was BuzzFeed, which published the 35-page classified document\u00a0on its site as part of its coverage. Trump described the classified report as \"false and fake and never happened\" and called BuzzFeed a \"failing pile of garbage. Writing it, I think they are going to suffer the consequences.\" Intel chiefs briefed Trump, Obama on unverified, salacious allegations concerning Russia and president-elect In getting publicly called out by Trump, Acosta and CNN \"was somewhat suffering for the sins of BuzzFeed in this case,\" said Kyle Pope, editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review . The faceoff, in what was Trump's first press conference in more than five months, portends things to come. \"The bigger picture here is that this is going to be a deeply combative relationship between this president and the press,\" Pope said. \" Ed Wasserman, dean of the graduate school of journalism at\u00a0the University of California-Berkeley,\u00a0found the televised event \"fairly demoralizing and disappointing,\" he said. \"I had hoped for a more substantive and spirited exchange where he would actually submit to questioning by answering the questions.\" Instead, Trump's engagements with the press will be \"kind of a\u00a0ritualized interaction in which Trump reiterates his contempt for the press and the press once again re-earns its reputation for being hypercritical and adversarial.\" New Facebook project aims to strengthen ties with media When the stories broke Tuesday night, Trump took to Twitter calling the\u00a0reports\u00a0\"fake news\" and a \"witch hunt.\" He followed that up Wednesday morning with another tweet: \"Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\" During the press conference, the president-elect complimented many news outlets about their handling of the report, including The New York Times, which did not reference or link to BuzzFeed in its initial story. \"I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were some news organizations \u2026 that were so professional, so incredibly professional, that I\u2019ve just gone up a notch on what I think of you,\" he said. Regardless, coverage of the classified briefing is real news, not fake news, and Trump should have expected this story to come out\u00a0between the briefing and the earlier circulation of the classified document, said Nsenga Burton, digital editor for Grady Newsource and an instructor at the University of Georgia's Cox Media Institute for Journalism, Innovation & Management. \u00a0\"CNN could not not have a story about that briefing that was circulating and call itself a news organization,\" she said. About BuzzFeed's publication of the document, \"we can argue if that is news or journalism. At least they provided some context and said they were in the process of vetting it. ... But that is news. Not (what is in) the document, but the fact the document exists.\" As a business person, Trump should know that it would be more helpful to have \"a working relationship\" with outlets such as CNN, she said. \"You can't call someone from CNN a liar and think that is going to end well for your administration,\" Burton said. Trump and the Russia report: What you need to know Pope wondered whether other reporters should have come to Acosta's aid and asked a question for him or ceded their time to CNN. \"The challenge for the press is the media basically has to come to grips with the fact they have a president who is going to do absolutely nothing to help them and is going to put as many roadblocks in front of them as he possibly can and also is going to do all he can to discredit them and undercut any trust they have between them and their readers.\" Some came to CNN's defense later in the day. During his afternoon broadcast Fox News\u2019 Shep Smith said, \u201cCNN\u2019s exclusive reporting on the Russian matter was separate and distinctly different from the document dump executed by an online news property. Though we at Fox News cannot confirm CNN\u2019s report, it is our observation that its correspondents follow journalistic standards and that neither they nor any other journalists should be subjected to belittling or delegitimizing by the President-elect of the United States.\u201d National Press Club President Thomas Burr called it\u00a0\"dangerous and unhealthy to\u00a0declare a news item as 'fake news' to distract from facts that you may not like or don't favor your perspective,\" in a statement issued about the president-elect's press conference. \"Our incoming president must treat the news media as the vital cornerstone of our democracy that it is,\" he said. \"To label something as 'fake' in an effort to undermine news outlets endangers the trust granted journalists by the public and is antithetical to our country's values.\" The @PressClubDC raises concerns about Trump's use of \"fake news\" phrase to discredit news he doesn't like https://t.co/UNEnF5QU7A \u2014 Thomas Burr (@thomaswburr) January 11, 2017 In another oddity from the press conference, Trump was asked about his Wednesday morning tweet questioning \"Are we living in Nazi Germany?\" His response was that it was a \"disgrace\" that the intelligence agencies leaked it. \"That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,\" Trump said. \"I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\" Ironically, that tweet came very close to\u00a0invoking an iconic Internet meme known as Godwin\u2019s Law. First coined in 1990 by attorney and author Mike Godwin, it says \u201cAs an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.\u201d The theory is that once someone in a discussion begins comparing anything to Hitler, the discussion is over and whoever had invoked the Nazi comparison has lost the debate.

Sarina Jepsen/AP hide caption toggle caption The U.S. has designated the rusty patched bumblebee an endangered species. Sarina Jepsen/AP The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated the rusty patched bumblebee an endangered species \u2014 the first such designation for a bumblebee and for a bee species in the continental U.S. The protected status, which goes into effect on Feb. 10, includes requirements for federal protections and the development of a recovery plan. It also means that states with habitats for this species are eligible for federal funds. \"Today's Endangered Species listing is the best\u2014and probably last\u2014hope for the recovery of the rusty patched bumble bee,\" NRDC Senior Attorney Rebecca Riley said in a statement from the Xerces Society, which advocates for invertebrates. \"Bumble bees are dying off, vanishing from our farms, gardens, and parks, where they were once found in great numbers.\" Large parts of the Eastern and Midwestern United States were once crawling with these bees, Bombus affinis, but the bees have suffered a dramatic decline in the last two decades due to habitat loss and degradation, along with pathogens and pesticides. Indeed, the bee was found in 31 states and Canadian provinces before the mid- to late-1990s, according to the final rule published in the Federal Register . But since 2000, it has been reported in only 13 states and Ontario, Canada. It has seen an 88 percent decline in the number of populations and an 87 percent loss in the amount of territory it inhabits. Article continues after sponsorship Bees Added To U.S. Endangered Species List For 1st Time This means the species is vulnerable to extinction, the rule says, even without further habitat loss or insecticide exposure. Canada designated the species as endangered in 2012. The bees live in large colonies that can be made up of 1,000 individual workers. All types of the species have black heads, the rule states, \"but only workers and males have a rusty reddish patch centrally located on the abdomen.\" Habitat degradation may be particularly harmful to these bees because of their feeding habits, as described in the rule: \"The rusty patched bumble bee is one of the first bumble bees to emerge early in the spring and the last to go into hibernation, so to meet its nutritional needs, the species requires a constant and diverse supply of blooming flowers.\" Last October, the Fish and Wildlife Service gave endangered status to seven species of yellow-faced bees native to Hawaii, the first time any U.S. bees received this kind of protection. Report: More Pollinator Species In Jeopardy, Threatening World Food Supply Pollinator decline is a global trend. A recent major global assessment sponsored by the U.N. suggested that about 40 percent of invertebrate pollinator species are facing extinction. Since some 75 percent of food crops rely at least partially on pollinators, that raises serious concerns about the future of the global food supply. ",

Jenie Chang told ABC News today that she had just pulled up to her parents' house in Fairfax, California, on Tuesday evening to pick up her two girls, ages 10 and 4, when she realized a \"massive fallen tree\" was blocking the way up to the house. \"It was surreal,\" Chang said. \"I had to use my high beams to make sure I was really seeing what I was seeing.\" West Virginia Landslide Swallows House, Forces Residents to Evacuate The massive tree had \"completely crushed the detached garage\" next to home, Chang said, adding that it -- along with other smaller trees and shrubs -- \"completely covered\" the 64 stairs leading up to home's main entrance. Chang said she immediately called her parents inside, who told her they were all safe but had been unaware of the mess just outside their door. Chang's parents then called for help, and within minutes, a unit from the Marin County Fire Department was on the scene, she said. KGO Firefighters rescued two young girls and their grandparents who were trapped in a house in Fairfax, California, on Jan. 10, 2017, after a landslide came to the front door. Firefighters used chainsaws to cut through several fallen trees, and they created a makeshift path up the muddy hill to the house's front door, according to Battalion Chief Bret McTigue, public information officer for the Marin County Fire Department. Firefighters then escorted the girls and their grandparents one by one down the path to safety, McTigue told ABC News today. He added that all four family members were OK and that no one suffered any injuries.

Tillerson was awarded Russia's\u00a0Order of Friendship in 2013\u00a0and has been the subject of scrutiny for his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Jan. 11, 2017. During his Senate confirmation hearing, nominee for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson answers questions from Marco Rubio about whether Vladimir\u00a0Putin is a war criminal, to which the former Exxon Mobil CEO declined to comment. Tillerson was awarded Russia's\u00a0Order of Friendship in 2013\u00a0and has been the subject of scrutiny for his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Jan. 11, 2017. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Barraged by questions about Russia, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state promised a far more muscular approach toward the Kremlin on Wednesday, abandoning much of the president-elect's emphasis on improving ties between the Cold War foes. Instead, Rex Tillerson suggested the outgoing Obama administration responded too softly to Moscow's takeover of Ukrainian territory. The surprising shift in tone by Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil CEO and Russian \"Order of Friendship\" recipient, reflected the difficulty Trump will have in persuading Democrats and Republicans to broach a broad rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin's government. Calling Russia a \"danger\" to the United States, Tillerson said he would keep U.S. sanctions in place and consider new penalties related to Russian meddling in the presidential election. Although he said he hadn't read last week's classified assessment by the U.S. intelligence community, Tillerson said it was a \"fair assumption\" that Putin would have ordered the operation that purportedly included hacking, propaganda and internet trolls to harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy and advance Trump's. But in a puzzling revelation, Tillerson conceded he hadn't yet talked with Trump about a Russia policy. \"Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,\" Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He added that Trump's administration would be committed to the defense of America's NATO partners, an obligation the president-elect called into question during the campaign if allies failed to meet defense spending pledges. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. While his prepared statement reflected some of Trump's desire for improved ties, Tillerson quickly pivoted under pressure from both sides of the aisle. On Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimea region, he said, \"That was a taking of territory that was not theirs.\" Still, he criticized President Barack Obama's sanctions on Russia, which ended up costing Exxon hundreds of millions of dollars. And he declared that he would have responded by urging Ukraine to send all available military units to its eastern border with Russia and recommending U.S. and allied support through defensive weapons and air surveillance, to send a message to Moscow. \"That is the type of response that Russia expects,\" he said in a response to questions from Sen. Marco Rubio, Tillerson's toughest GOP inquisitor, who later lectured the oil man on human rights and hinted he might withhold his support. \"If Russia acts with force,\" Tillerson said, \"they require a proportional show of force.\" Trump offered a sharply different account of Ukraine during the presidential campaign and never proposed a show of U.S. military force in Ukraine. In an August interview, he claimed Russia would not enter Ukraine, not seeming to know Russian troops were already there. He suggested Crimea didn't count because the peninsula's people preferred being part of Russia, restating Putin's reason for taking the territory in 2014. Like Trump, Tillerson vowed complete support for Israel, which he called America's \"most important ally\" in the Middle East. Caption Sen.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Coats would face a daunting task as the bridge between Trump and the intelligence community. He said the new administration would undertake a full review of the Iran nuclear deal to deny the Islamic republic the ability to acquire an atomic weapon. He said that might only be possible if Iran can no longer enrich uranium, which the accord permits under strict constraints and without which Tehran wouldn't have made the deal. Some of the questioning reflected the traditional friction between a Congress that wants to prescribe foreign policy and an executive branch that traditionally seeks to maintain broad flexibility in its international affairs, tinted by Tillerson's vocal opposition to economic sanctions as a business leader. Addressing some of Congress' most experienced architects of U.S. economic pressure, Tillerson called sanctions \"a powerful tool\" in deterrence that could, however, also project weakness if applied poorly. He said neither he nor Exxon had lobbied against sanctions. But the company did try to influence sanctions legislation on Russia two years ago, congressional records and data from the Center for Responsive Politics show, and Tillerson made numerous White House visits, to no avail. Given a second chance on the subject, Tillerson sought to clarify his answer by saying he had expressed concerns related to security in shutting down an Exxon operation newly prohibited under the sanctions. President-elect Donald Trump 's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson , goes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017. Tillerson represents a break in a longstanding tradition of secretaries of state with extensive military, legislative, political or diplomatic experience. Yet his supporters point to Tillerson's lengthy career as a senior executive in a mammoth multinational company as proof he has the management and negotiating skills to succeed in the State Department's top post, particularly when facing tough foreign governments. \"It's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying,\" Trump said of Tillerson during a news conference in New York that occurred as Tillerson was testifying. \"He ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it.\" His Exxon experience, however, has been criticized by Democrats for possible conflicts of interest because of the company's far-flung business dealings. Tillerson, who stepped down as CEO at the end of 2016, said he understood being secretary of state meant different responsibilities. He pledged to be a steward for U.S. national interests rather than corporate ones. \"He is not prepared to be our secretary of state,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. If all 10 Democrats on the committee vote against Tillerson, and Rubio or any other Republican joins them, the nomination would then be referred to the full Senate with \"no recommendation.\" That would be an embarrassment for such a high-profile Cabinet nominee and could signal a larger confirmation battle. \"He's got to convince me he sees Russia for who they are,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, another skeptical Republican. On Tillerson's proposed response to the election hacking charges, Graham said, \"Real fuzzy answer.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump Gives First Press Conference Since Becoming President-Elect 0 Shares At Trump Tower in New York, Donald Trump held his first press conference since becoming the president-elect. Here are some initial thoughts on what we witnessed today: A Wall, but No Wall Yes, Trump remains committed to a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But when it comes to a wall between Trump and his business interests, the arrangement he announced Wednesday doesn\u2019t come close to what ethics experts have recommended. Putting his sons in charge of his empire won\u2019t provide meaningful financial separation between the president and the businesses he helped build, said Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush. Trump even bragged during the press conference about turning down a $2 billion deal in Dubai that he said he could have accepted, saying, \u201cI could actually run my business and run government at the same time.\u201d He isn\u2019t quite doing that, but there\u2019s nothing in this arrangement that could stop the perception or the reality of that happening, other than the honor system. Russia Love Notably, Trump said he now accepts that Russia was most likely behind the cyberattacks during the campaign that intelligence officials say were intended to help his candidacy. But he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to say bad things about Russian President Vladimir Putin or to even question his motives. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability,\u201d Trump said. He continued to blame the Democratic National Committee for not having adequate cyberdefenses. Asked directly what his message to Putin is regarding hacking, Trump responded, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it. He won\u2019t be doing it.\u201d Trump\u2019s hope is that projecting U.S. strength will change the relationship with Russia. But he\u2019s still handling the bear with kid gloves. Trump Says Sons Will Take \u2018Complete and Total Control\u2019 of the Business Intel War Perhaps the harshest words Trump had for any group in his press conference were for the intelligence community. \u201cA tremendous blot on their record,\u201d he said in accusing intelligence officials of leaking details of what he\u2019s been briefed on in classified sessions. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace ... That\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.\u201d He will, of course, be the main consumer of intelligence information in nine days. He\u2019s entering the presidency in the midst of an unprecedented war of words with intelligence professionals \u2014 with real consequences soon enough. Congress? Whatever In talking about some legislative priorities, it\u2019s clear that Trump has little patience for the traditions and niceties of Congress, at least for now. He mocked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 \u201cHe is going to crack that 1 percent barrier one day\u201d \u2014 even though Graham will be a needed ally on Capitol Hill. More significant, Trump pointed to a preferred path for repealing and replacing \u201cObamacare\u201d that isn\u2019t under serious consideration in the House or the Senate. Without offering details of how to do it, he said repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act would \u201cmost likely be on the same day or the same week but probably the same day. Could be the same hour.\u201d And he offered this unusually frank piece of advice on the issue to his own party: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to own it. We don\u2019t want to own it politically.\u201d \u2018Fake News\u2019 Belongs to Trump Too The term that\u2019s been used to describe malicious attempts to spread falsehoods and misinformation? The incoming president plans to use it as well. \u201cFake news\u201d is what Trump labeled the unsubstantiated information about him that circulated widely this week after being included in an intelligence briefing. It\u2019s also the term he used to describe news outlets that reported on that information on Tuesday. The label has been most commonly associated with efforts to influence politics through deliberate falsehoods circulated online. But Trump and his team are twisting that meaning. \u201cI think it\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have to live with,\u201d he said of fake news. \u201cI guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back.\u201d That Was Weird Trump press conferences look as if they will be quite different from his predecessors\u2019, if today\u2019s was any indication. His long-delayed first press conference as president-elect featured props, sparring with reporters, a meandering opening statement and a long section in which a lawyer read a statement about Trump\u2019s business plans. Along the way, he dropped news tidbits about his Cabinet, Supreme Court timeline, his legislative priorities and why he would never do anything untoward in a hotel in Moscow. His exchanges with the press appear unlikely to be dull affairs. They might also be extraordinarily combative, as with his repeated refusal to allow a CNN reporter to ask a question. This ride is going to be wild. 0 Shares ",

U.S.-Mexico border Bill Wechter / AFP A pair of fences separate Mexico, left, and the U.S. south of San Diego. A pair of fences separate Mexico, left, and the U.S. south of San Diego. (Bill Wechter / AFP) North American Free Trade Agreement It\u2019s by now a\u00a0predictable pattern. Every few days, President-elect\u00a0 Donald Trump repeats his threat\u00a0to build a massive border wall \u2014 and force\u00a0Mexico to pay for it. And each time, Mexican leaders\u00a0respond the same way.\u00a0 \u201cNeither today, nor tomorrow nor never Mexico will pay for that stupid wall. If Trump wants a monument to his ego, let him pay for it!!\u201d former Mexican President Vicente Fox tweeted on Wednesday shortly after Trump made the border claim again at a news conference. \u201cThere is no way,\u201d\u00a0Luis Videgaray, Mexico\u2019s new foreign secretary , said this week. For Mexico, he said, the\u00a0wall issue is \u201ca\u00a0matter of national dignity and sovereignty.\u201d\u00a0 Trump has vowed\u00a0to begin construction on\u00a0the wall soon after his\u00a0Jan.\u00a020 inauguration. He plans to press Congress to fund the project and then find ways to have Mexico reimburse those costs later. The caustic back and forth between Trump\u00a0and top Mexican officials, which along with fears of a\u00a0trade war has\u00a0sent the value of the peso plunging,\u00a0raises the question:\u00a0Can Trump really force Mexico to pay for the wall? We talked to several experts about that \u2014\u00a0as well as\u00a0what\u00a0Trump\u2019s threats against Mexico\u00a0could mean for the economies of both countries.\u00a0 Will Trump be able to persuade Mexico to pay for the wall?\u00a0 \u201cThe Mexican government isn\u2019t willing to pay for the wall in any way,\u201d said Alfredo Couti\u00f1o, Latin America director for Moody\u2019s Analytics. Handing over billions of dollars for the construction of the wall\u00a0would be a politically\u00a0suicidal decision for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who saw his approval ratings sink after he met with Trump in Mexico City last fall. But besides that,\u00a0there is a more practical concern.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMexico doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for it,\u201d Couti\u00f1o said. An already shaky economic and political situation was made more unstable Jan. 1 when the Mexican government deregulated gasoline prices. Gas prices rose as much as 20%, triggering angry demonstrations across the country. In recent weeks, Trump has acknowledged that it is unlikely the U.S. would receive\u00a0a direct payment from Mexico, whose economy has been plagued by slow growth and rising inflation.\u00a0 \u201cMexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall,\u201d Trump\u00a0said Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cThat will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment.\u201d \u201cProbably less likely that it's a payment,\u201d he added. \u00a0 (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) How could the U.S. try to recoup the costs? One way is taxing remittances, an idea Trump has floated in the past.\u00a0 In 2015, Mexico received nearly $25\u00a0billion in remittances from citizens living outside the country, most of them from the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Bank of Mexico, the country\u2019s central banking system. Trump has suggested much of that money is sent\u00a0from people who are living in the United States illegally, although according to PolitiFact,\u00a0 there is no way \u00a0to track the legal status of remittance senders. If Trump pushed Congress to approve, say, a\u00a010% tax on remittances, that could generate $10 billion dollars for the U.S. government over four years.\u00a0 Trump could \u201cslice and dice\u201d the situation to make it appear that Mexico is paying a tax to fund a border wall, said\u00a0Edward Alden, a senior fellow specializing in U.S. trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. But ultimately, it would be Mexican immigrants who were paying. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly and regressive tax, because you\u2019re essentially taxing poor people,\u201d Alden said. Is there a precedent for taxing remittances?\u00a0 Yes, at least on the state level. Since 2009,\u00a0Oklahoma has charged a 1% fee \u2014 critics call it a tax \u2014 on all personal wire transfers of cash to accounts outside the state. The fee is a withholding on state income tax, and when residents file taxes, they eventually get the money back. However, those in the country illegally who send money abroad\u00a0do not receive the cash back \u2014 a move that in effect taxes them.\u00a0 Could the U.S. only target remittances sent to Mexico? That could be difficult. Any federal tax on remittances probably would have to be applied across the board to people sending money to all countries, analysts say. \u201cTaxing one specific group of people on their remittances could be considered discriminatory,\u201d said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. What about Trump\u2019s pledge to tax imports from Mexico? With the help of Congress, Trump could immediately impose new taxes on goods imported to the U.S. from Mexico. He could claim that is one way Mexico is paying the costs of the wall. But new taxes could draw lawsuits, Wilson said,\u00a0because the\u00a0 North American Free Trade Agreement \u00a0bars the U.S. from assessing tariffs on goods made in Canada or Mexico. Trump has pledged to immediately start renegotiating\u00a0that deal to make it more fair for American workers, but that process could stretch years.\u00a0 How would changes to free trade deals\u00a0affect the economy?\u00a0 Canceling or making serious changes to NAFTA could paralyze major American industries, like the automotive and food and beverage industries,\u00a0Courti\u00f1o said. If that happens,\u00a0\u201cthe U.S. runs the risk of going into recession.\u201d\u00a0 The consequences for Mexico also could be devastating. \u201cMexico would almost certainly\u00a0go into recession,\u201d Couti\u00f1o said, because Mexico\u2019s\u00a0faltering economy wouldn\u2019t allow officials to\u00a0lower interest rates and pump money into the economy like U.S. leaders did during the Great Recession. A recession in Mexico, Courti\u00f1o said, could unleash major unintended consequences in the U.S. that could undermine Trump\u2019s efforts to even the trade playing field and limit illegal immigration. \u201cIn indirectly inducing the weakening of the peso, Trump is making Mexican exports more attractive for American consumers,\u201d Courti\u00f1o said.\u00a0 \u201cIf you block\u00a0Mexico in terms of exports, investing and\u00a0remittances, Mexico\u2019s economy is going to sink, unemployment is going to rise, and guess what? More Mexicans are going to be willing to take the risk of crossing the border into the U.S.\u201d Courti\u00f1o said. \u201cTrump\u00a0is running the risk of increasing immigration from Mexico.\u201d This would create a certain irony.\u00a0Though Central Americans have been trying to reach the U.S. in greater numbers, net migration from Mexico has remained zero for several years, with U.S. and Mexican government data showing more people returning home to Mexico than entering the U.S. illegally each year. What can Mexico do about Trump\u2019s plans? Mexico has little say in several of the changes Trump has proposed. There is nothing Mexico could do to block a tax on\u00a0remittances. And although it could impose trade tariffs on imports from the U.S., that would not have a big effect because Mexico exports more than it imports.\u00a0 Although Mexico could withhold\u00a0cooperation with U.S. officials on security issues and immigration enforcement at Mexico\u2019s southern border as a bargaining chip, neither of those things is in Mexico\u2019s interest, experts say.\u00a0 \u201cMexico,\u201d Courti\u00f1o said, \u201cis basically at the mercy of the U.S.\u201d \u201cThe most likely scenario is that the Trump administration will find some way to claim that they have forced Mexico to pay for the additional border fencing,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd Mexico will claim that it was paid for by Congress and the Trump administration.\u201d Linthicum reported from Mexico City and Lee from Los Angeles.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 11, 2017 11:12 PM EST The mechanism Congress will use to undo Obamacare is the arcane budget process known as \u201creconciliation.\u201d This enables Senate Republicans, who hold a slim majority of 52 - 48, to get around the requirement for a supermajority of 60 votes to pass the repeal. Under reconciliation, they just need a simple majority. But it still won\u2019t be easy.\u00a0 Some Obamacare enrollees hope to see it repealed Senate approval -expected early Thursday - and then House passage as early as Friday would trigger committee action to write repeal legislation that could come to a vote next month. A full replacement would follow sometime after that, presuming Republicans can come up with one.\u00a0 \u201cWe must act quickly to bring relief to the American people,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \u00a0 On Wednesday, starting at around 6:30 p.m. ET, Senate Republicans will take the first step by passing the budget blueprint for the current 2017 fiscal year, along with the reconciliation bill, both of which will just require a simple majority. However, both measures are also subject to unlimited amendments, which are invariably stacked until the end and result in an hours-long series of votes that typically stretch until after midnight. This is called \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d It\u2019s not the repeal itself -- it just sets the repeal process in motion. And it also won\u2019t carry the force of law -- it\u2019s just a blueprint for Congress, and the president will not be signing it. Usually budget resolutions make projections about spending and taxes. The current measure is a \u201cshell\u201d bill that projects almost $10 trillion in new debt over a decade, but enabling action on repeal. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a strong fiscal conservative, has railed against fellow Republicans about adding to the debt. Amendments will be posted by the Senate Budget Committee here .\u00a0 The ensuing repeal legislation - a budget \u201creconciliation\u201d bill in Washington-speak - would be written by a handful of House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over health issues. It\u2019ll first go to the House, where debate should be fairly routine. When the Senate takes up its version, however, Democrats will have many opportunities to offer amendments. The House and Senate would have to work out their differences before passing a final version and sending it to the White House for Trump\u2019s signature. ",
