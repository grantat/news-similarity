    "text": "By Greg Miller January 10 at 7:23 PM Follow @gregpmiller A classified report delivered to President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump\u2019s personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations, but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. A senior U.S. official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at least in part to underscore that Russia had embarrassing information on both major candidates, but only released material that might harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered U.S. spy agencies\u2019 conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump win. The inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report, a development first reported Tuesday by CNN, adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine American democracy. If true, the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging information \u2014 known in espionage circles by the Russian term \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2014 that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White House. The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report, an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and representatives of Moscow. U.S. officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising material were based not on information through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British intelligence official. The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in October. U.S. officials said that while the FBI had so far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims, U.S. officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm, considered them credible, and determined that it was plausible that they would have first-hand knowledge of Russia\u2019s alleged dossier on Trump. The CIA, the FBI and the White House declined to comment on the matter. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. K.T. McFarland, Trump\u2019s designated deputy foreign service adviser, declined to respond to a question about the report. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the story that you\u2019re talking about that\u2019s broken. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate\u2026I know in Washington people prefer to talk about something about which they know nothing, but I\u2019m going to refrain,\u201d she said during participation in a panel at the U.S. Institute of Peace. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had. I think I\u2019d just say what [Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, Jr.] said, which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome.\u201d Clapper, however, testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election result. The two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three separate versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last week, including an abbreviated declassifed draft that was made public. It was unclear whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI, CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report, of whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts\u2019 conclusions. Senior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report on declined to comment. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Ca.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team, said that \u201cwe can\u2019t comment on what goes on in\u201d classified briefings, but added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on U.S. leaders \u201cshould not be a surprise to anyone.\u201d \u201cThe Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be news.\u201d Asked whether he was aware of any contacts between the Trump team and Russia, Nunes said, \u201cNo. I found that hard to believe. I have not heard that.

Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! Got it (The Washington Post) By Abby Phillip , Lena H. Sun and Lenny Bernstein January 10 at 5:55 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @bylenasun Follow @LennyMBernstein Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a proponent of a widely discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump asked him to chair a new commission on vaccines. Hours later, however, a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s transition said that while Trump would like to create a commission on autism, no final decision had been made. If Trump follows through, the stunning move would push up against established science, medicine and the government\u2019s position on the issue. It comes after Trump \u2014 who has long been critical of vaccines \u2014 met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws. \u201cThe President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas,\u201d Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. \u201cThe President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. \u201cThe President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of autism with many groups and individuals,\u201d she added. (CNN) [ The facts about vaccines, autism and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s conspiracy theory ] Speaking to reporters earlier Tuesday in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Kennedy said that Trump called him to request the meeting and that he accepted the offer of a position on the commission during the meeting. \u201cPresident-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cHis opinion doesn\u2019t matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science. \u201cAnd that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have \u2014 he\u2019s very pro-vaccine, as am I \u2014 but they\u2019re as safe as they possibly can be,\u201d he added. There is a federal advisory committee on immunization, made up of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on how vaccines are used in the United States. The announcement was met with alarm from health professionals who say that putting a proponent of a conspiracy theory in a position of authority on the issue is dangerous. [ The origins of Donald Trump\u2019s autism/vaccine theory and how it was completely debunked eons ago ] (The Washington Post) \u201cThat\u2019s very frightening; it\u2019s difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science,\u201d said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a nonprofit that works to control, treat and eliminate vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases. \u201cThe science is clear: Massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism, and as both a scientist who develops vaccines for poverty-related neglected diseases and the father of an adult daughter with autism, there\u2019s not even any plausibility for a link,\u201d Hotez continued. \u201cAutism is a genetic condition.\u201d \u201cOur nation\u2019s public health will suffer if this nascent neo-antivaxxer movement is not stopped immediately,\u201d he added. Kennedy has been a proponent of nonmedical exemptions for parents who seek to prevent their children from being vaccinated, which is mandatory in most states. He has argued that mercury-based additives in vaccines explain the link to autism. And he has alleged that government scientists, journalists and pharmaceutical companies have colluded to hide the truth from the public. \u201cThey get the shot. That night they have a fever of 103. They go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said at the premiere of an anti-vaccination film screening in California in 2015 . \u201cThis is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d [ A horrifying reminder of what life without vaccines was really like ] Kennedy is known to be an occasional conspiracy theorist and longtime opponent of mandatory vaccination laws. In 2006, he wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that the Republican Party had stolen the 2004 election from Democratic candidate John F. Kerry. At a 2013 speech in Dallas, he said he doesn\u2019t believe the lone gunman theory of the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy. Trump notably expressed support for the theory that vaccinations are linked to autism at a Republican presidential debate in 2015. [ The GOP\u2019s dangerous \u2018debate\u2019 on vaccines and autism ] \u201cWe had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic,\u201d Trump said. The comments were widely denounced by medical professionals who say that there is no evidence that vaccines lead to autism. In fact, the study that popularized the idea has been retracted and discredited as fraudulent . Multiple high-quality studies have found no link between vaccines and autism. Trump\u2019s claim was rejected on the same debate stage by retired neurosurgeon Benjamin Carson, whom Trump has now nominated to serve as his secretary of housing and urban development. \u201cThe fact of the matter is we have extremely well-documented proof that there\u2019s no autism associated with vaccinations,\u201d Carson said. The controversy began in 1998 after The Lancet, a respected medical journal, published a paper by researcher Andrew Wakefield and colleagues linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. It had a sample of only 12 subjects and speculative conclusions but launched a global movement joined by celebrities including Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, who warned parents to stop vaccinating their children. A drop in MMR vaccinations followed. But the study was a fraud. The Lancet determined that Wakefield had been funded by attorneys for parents who had brought lawsuits against vaccine companies. In 2010, the journal retracted the paper. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. Large studies that examined whether there is an association between vaccines and autism, including one that examined 96,000 U.S. children, found none. [ Robert Kennedy Jr.\u2019s belief in autism-vaccine connection, and its political peril ] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said flatly that there is no link between vaccines and autism and that vaccine ingredients do not cause autism. Scores of studies from around the world since then have shown conclusively that vaccines do not cause autism. Every relevant scientific and medical organization has examined the evidence and concluded that vaccines are safe and effective and that the real danger lies in skipping or delaying them. Still, the theory has retained its adherents. The United States has experienced recent measles outbreaks linked to unvaccinated residents, including one in 2014 that infected 383 people, most of them in Amish communities in Ohio. In 2015, another multistate outbreak was linked to California\u2019s Disneyland theme park. In both years, the source of the infection was believed to be people who brought the virus home after visiting the Philippines. In tweets as early as 2012 , Trump expressed skepticism about vaccines, and in 2014 he said that \u201c doctors lied\u201d about vaccines . In other tweets, Trump has referred to vaccines as the cause of \u201cdoctor-inflicted autism.\u201d \u201cMassive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism,\u201d Trump said in an August 2012 tweet. At the presidential debate in 2015, he claimed that his children had been vaccinated in small doses. \u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause you take a baby in, and I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two- or three-year period of time.\u201d Trump\u2019s statements at the Republican debate in 2015 were denounced as \u201cfalse\u201d by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which released a strongly worded condemnation. [ The challenges to public health under a Trump administration ] \u201cClaims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproved by a robust body of medical literature,\u201d said Karen Remley, executive director of the AAP. \u201cIt is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise.\u201d \u201cThere is no \u2018alternative\u2019 immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer. Vaccines work, plain and simple,\u201d she added. Autism is now considered a spectrum of brain disorders with a multitude of causes. According to Autism Speaks, people with the disorder can have trouble with social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. One in 68 U.S. children are considered to be on the autism spectrum \u2014 a tenfold increase from 40 years earlier, largely due to changes in how autism is defined and diagnosed.

USA TODAY NETWORK Convicted shooter Dylann Roof is escorted June 18, 2015, from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014\u00a0A federal district court jury decided Tuesday to sentence Dylann Roof to death for\u00a0his June 2015 attack on a black church's Bible study group after the panel found that life in prison offered no possibility of redemption for the 22-year-old. Jurors took about three hours to make their decision after listening to closing arguments from prosecutors and Roof, who told the panel in a brief, disjointed statement that he continues to stand by his\u00a0slaying of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church here. Roof looked\u00a0down and shuffled\u00a0papers as U.S. District\u00a0Judge\u00a0Richard\u00a0Gergel read his death sentence. Following the decision, Roof asked Gergel\u00a0to appoint a new defense team in preparation for a motion in which he will ask for a new trial. The judge said he would take that matter up after a formal sentencing hearing, scheduled for Wednesday morning. Roof, who served as his own attorney, had been represented by David Bruck and Kimberly C. Stevens, who continue to serve as his standby counselors. Following the sentencing, the team sent out a brief statement. Is death for Dylann Roof justified? \"We want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof\u2019s actions,\u201d the statement read. \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that\u00a0despite our best efforts\u00a0the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.\" In his brief address to jurors, Roof clarified a confession he made to FBI agents the day after the June 17, 2015, attack, one in which he told them, \u201cI had to do it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do anything, and no one made me do it,\u201d Roof said, his voice carrying no emotion. \u201cWhat I meant is I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.\u201d His five-minute address came in response to a two-hour closing statement from a federal prosecutor who repeatedly urged the jury of 10 women and two men to vote for a death sentence. Roof asked the jurists to consider a life sentence, telling them only one of them needed to vote for life for that sentence to be imposed.\u00a0Gergel later instructed the panel that a hung jury would result in a sentence of life in prison rather than a mistrial. Full statement from Roof lawyers and family. pic.twitter.com/l0ZEKNzQe4 \u2014 Maurice Chammah (@MauriceChammah) January 10, 2017 If the U.S. District Court jury had not decided on the death penalty, Roof would have faced a death-penalty trial in South Carolina's 9th Judicial Circuit Court. Whether he will still go on trial in state court\u00a0is now unclear. Judge J.C. Nicholson on Thursday ordered that trial to be put on hold indefinitely. It was to have begun Jan. 17. In December, Roof was convicted of 33 federal counts in his attack on Emanuel AME Church, which included charges based on hate crime laws. In the sentencing phase, Roof represented himself in a successful bid to keep his team of capital defenders from offering evidence that he might suffer from a mental illness. Had his lawyers been at the helm, they were expected to offer testimony from mental health experts and other witnesses that would have lasted at least a week, much of it likely centering on an undisclosed mental defect. Instead, Roof offered no evidence or witnesses and asked no questions of the government\u2019s witnesses. \u201cHe spent years acquiring this deep hatred. ... He chose to target them knowing they would be particularly good people.\u201d Jay Richardson, U.S. Attorney's Office In his convoluted address to jurors, Roof seemed to contradict his earlier insistence that he is not mentally ill. \u201cI think that it\u2019s safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go to a church and kill people,\u201d the self-avowed\u00a0supremacist said. \u201cAnyone, including the prosecution, who thinks that I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hate is.\u201d Tuesday's closing arguments began with\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson framing the crime, one that struck at both race and religion, with a subtle Biblical reference. The parishioners gathered at Mother Emanuel that June were a group of 12 who learned from one another and worked together, Richardson told jurors, an allusion to Christ's disciples. \u201cWe heard how after they started the Bible study, they welcomed a 13th\u00a0person that night,\u201d Richardson said of the stranger who concealed a .45-caliber Glock handgun in his utility pouch. In another bit of symbolism, Richardson reminded the panel that Roof carried 88 hollow-point bullets into the church. The letter \u201cH\u201d is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 is often used in white supremacist circles as a reference to \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d In jailhouse writings, Roof said the Nazi leader would one day become a saint. Dylann Roof jail writings: 'I've done all I can do' In telling jurists to vote for death, Richardson chronicled the lives of the nine church members killed, from the congregation's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney; to the lost, bright future of Tywanza Sanders, 26; to Susie Jackson, who at age 87 remained dedicated to her church. \u201cHe went to Mother Emanuel to find the best among us, and he did indeed find them,\u201d Richardson said, saying he shot each victim because \"to him they were brute animals,\" part of his racist ideology that looked at African-Americans as subhuman. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do anything, and no one made me do it. What I meant is I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.\u201d Dylann Roof, convicted killer The prosecutor noted that Jackson and two other older victims were particularly vulnerable, urging the panel to use that aggravating factor as a reason to impose a death sentence. The prosecutor outlined eight other aggravating factors, including Roof\u2019s racism, his planning of the murders, his lack of remorse and his attempts to incite others. Those outweighed any mitigating factors such as Roof's age, his lack of a felony conviction or history of violence, he said. In determining Roof's sentence, the jury was to weigh\u00a0any aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances. In a capital case, defense lawyers typically offer mental health evidence as a possible mitigator. In Roof\u2019s case those efforts were blocked not only by a client who relegated them to the role of standby counselors, but also by the presiding judge, who twice ruled that Roof was competent to stand trial and serve as his own attorney. The high school dropout rested his case Monday, offering neither witnesses nor evidence in his defense. Convicted killer Dylann Roof: 'I am not sorry.' Jurors began deliberating at 1:35 p.m. ET Tuesday, and about two hours later asked several questions about the mitigating factors presented to them on a verdict form. The gist of two questions went to any danger he might pose in inciting violence should future prison writings be released, and in a third question, the jury asked to see a video of one of Pinckney's speeches. Pinckney\u00a0also was a state senator at the time of his death. Prosecutors presented their sentencing case in about 3\u00bd days\u00a0and questioned\u00a025 witnesses, most of them family members of victims who suffered multiple gunshots in a rampage that came after Roof sat with the parishioners in their Bible study for about 40 minutes. Roof shot Pinckney with a Glock .45 as the worshipers bowed their heads in prayer.\u00a0As others tried to hide beneath folding tables, he moved around the room, firing more than 70 bullets, most finding a human target. U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, in a statement released Tuesday, said \"We hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston \u2013 and the people of our nation \u2013 with a measure of closure.\" \"Dylann Storm Roof sought out and opened fire on African-American parishioners engaged in worship and bible study . . . He did so because of their race.\u00a0 And he did so to interfere with their peaceful exercise of religion,\" Lynch said. For Roof counsel, a life\u2019s work fighting the death penalty During the trial proceedings, Roof\u2019s mother, Amy Roof, appeared at opening statements\u00a0while his grandparents came to the courtroom a handful of times. Following the sentencing decision, Roof\u2019s family sent out a statement. \u201cWe will always love Dylann. We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt. We continue to pray for the Emanuel AME families and the Charleston community.\" Tonya Maxwell reports for the Asheville (N.C.) Citizen-Times;\u00a0Tim Smith reports for The Greenville (S.C.) News.

    "text": "Jan. 10, 2017, 5:22 p.m. Trump is hit with allegations that Russia gathered compromising information on him Del Quentin Wilber On the eve of his first news conference in more than five months, President-elect Trump faces unverified allegations that Russian officials had gathered compromising information about his personal life and political associates, further deepening the controversy over Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The information is contained in a 35-page file that was published Tuesday by BuzzFeed , which said it was publishing the material in the interest of \u201ctransparency,\u201d but had not been able to corroborate it. Several news organizations reported that senior U.S. intelligence officials had included a two-page synopsis of the file in the materials they presented to Trump when they briefed him last week on evidence of Russian involvement in the election and that they had also informed top leaders of Congress about the allegations. The purpose of including the material was to back up their conclusion that Russia had acted to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, gathering information on both sides in the election, but only publicly releasing information damaging the Democrats, according to CNN, which first reported on the briefing. Trump responded in a tweet Tuesday evening that did not address any of the specific allegations, but denounced the stories. The material alleged that Russia for years had been \u201ccultivating, supporting and assisting\u201d Trump\u2019s political rise and possessed damaging personal and financial information that could be used to blackmail the president-elect. According to BuzzFeed and CNN, the dossier was compiled by a former British intelligence agent who was hired to do opposition research by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and later by Democrats. The report was prepared over the summer and was provided to U.S. analysts. The two-page summary contained allegations that there was a \u201ccontinuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for Russian government,\u201d CNN reported, citing two national security officials. It also alleged that information sharing between Trump\u2019s team and the Russians went both ways. The Russians provided Trump\u2019s aides with \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d on Clinton, the report said, while Trump\u2019s associates gave Russian operatives information about Russian oligarchs. CNN reported that the U.S. intelligence community vetted the former British operative and found him and his network of sources to be credible enough to justify including some of the information in reports provided to elected officials. The existence of the file has circulated among political figures and reporters in Washington since at least October, when then-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey saying that the FBI possessed \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.\u201d Mother Jones ran an article at that time reporting on the existence of the file and saying that the former British intelligence operative had provided his dossier to the FBI. The report on Tuesday became a viral sensation on social media, and even provided fodder for questioning at Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 Senate confirmation hearing. Sessions (R-Ala.), who was picked by Trump to be his attorney general, said he was not aware of the report and had no contacts with the Russian government. Latest updates ",

    "text": "SocjosensPG/Getty Images SocjosensPG/Getty Images Jamaica is facing a crisis as specialized nurses leave the island to take jobs in North America and Europe. The exodus has forced Jamaican hospitals to reschedule some complex surgeries because of a lack of nursing staff on their wards. James Moss-Solomon, the chairman of the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, says the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom are, in his words, \"poaching\" Jamaica's most critical nurses. \"Specialist nurses is the problem. We have tons of regular nurses,\" he says. He's talking about nurses trained to work in such settings as intensive care units, operating theaters and emergency rooms. They're the ones being lured away. Moss-Solomon says it's very hard to replace them. \"We do very good training of specialist nurses here,\" he says. \"We train them at a fraction of the cost of what it costs you in the United States or Canada or the U.K.. So it's an economic issue. There's a great saving [for foreign countries] in just poaching instead of training.\" Article continues after sponsorship Moss-Solomon says the exodus is crippling hospitals across Jamaica. Last week his hospital was forced to cancel several complex elective surgeries because it didn't have the staff to handle the procedures. Jamaica has tried to re-staff those wards by offering free training for nurses to get advanced degrees. The nurses agree to work for three or four years in Jamaica in exchange for the heavily-subsidized education. But those efforts have backfired as foreign recruiters have snapped up the newly minted specialists the moment they graduate. The nurses are slapped with a fine of typically $5,000-$6,000 if they skip their in-country service. But the recruiting agencies simply pay off the obligation. Kevin Allen, the CEO of the University Hospital of the West Indies, says Jamaica simply can't compete with the deep pockets of hospitals in North America and Europe. The starting salary for a nurse in Jamaica is less than $8,000 a year. With some specialized training and working overtime, she (and the island's nurses are almost all women) could possibly make up to $20,000 a year. Recruiters are offering two to three times that to take a job in the U.S. or London. About 200 of the country's 1,000 specialist nurses left the country last year, says Janet Coore-Farr, the head of the Nurses Association of Jamaica. She says this hemorrhaging of nursing staff has continued in the first week of 2017. In one 500-bed hospital, ten nurses have left since the new year, she says, \"and more are leaving. And these nurses are trained in accident and emergency.\" As more nurses leave, the work load grows even heavier for those who stay behind. Coore-Farr says many nurses in Jamaica are now regularly expected to work double shifts, which might make some of them think about taking a job in Phoenix or Toronto. \"There's no retention strategy for the nurses who are here,\" she says. \"We feel quite frankly that nobody cares. But it's a serious problem.\" The Jamaican Minister of Health says he does recognize the huge problem the island is facing with the loss of nurses. In the short term, University Hospital of the West Indies is bringing in 25 nurses next month from Cuba to help staff some wards and has plans to recruit nurses from India and the Philippines in what's become a crazy global race that extends far beyond Jamaica to snap up health care professionals.

    "text": "What to Expect From President Obama's Farewell Address By Jordyn Phelps Jan 10, 2017, 4:32 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Obama to Deliver Farewell Address 0 Shares Email President Barack Obama will return to his adopted hometown of Chicago on Tuesday to deliver a farewell address to the American people. In an email announcing the speech to supporters last week, Obama said the speech would be \"a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey \u2026 and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.\" In giving a final speech, Obama is continuing in a tradition first started by the President George Washington in 1796 and continued by many outgoing presidents since. Most recently, President George W. Bush gave a farewell speech eight years ago from the East Room of the White House. On Monday, the White House said Obama was still deeply involved in crafting and revising the speech, which White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest described on Friday as \u201cforward-looking\u201d and \u201cheartfelt.\u201d Earnest, who read an early draft of the speech, said the president will \u201cbriefly\u201d discuss the accomplishments of his own administration in the speech before turning to offer his thoughts on addressing \u201cthe challenges that lie ahead.\u201d \u201cMost of those solutions, in the mind of the president, rest on the deeply held values that just about every American subscribes to,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThe president believes that obviously, that diversity of this country is a strength. And that for all our differences, there's much more unites us than that separates us. And, our country is stronger when we remember that principle and we draw upon those common values.\u201d In describing the president\u2019s writing process, Earnest said the president dictates large portions of the speech to his speechwriters, who then work to refine drafts that the president then further revises. \u201cIt is not uncommon for the president to take a typewritten piece of paper, and in his very compact left-handed script, to be including detailed edits on that piece of paper,\u201d Earnest said. The decision to return to Chicago for the speech is not only because it is his adopted hometown but also because it is significant as the place where his career in service, as a community organizer, began, Obama said. \u201cThe running thread through my career has been the notion that when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together in collective effort, things change for the better,\u201d the president said in his weekly address released Saturday. The speech will take place at McCormick Place and is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. ET. The trip will also mark the last time the president is expected to travel outside of Washington, D.C ., as president and the final time he will ride on Air Force One . ",

USA TODAY NETWORK In this Dec. 28, 2016, file photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) During a special briefing last Friday, leaders of the intelligence community gave President-elect Donald Trump a synopsis of unsubstantiated and salacious allegations that Russian operatives had obtained potentially compromising personal and financial information about the president-elect, a U.S. official confirmed Tuesday. The official who is not authorized to comment publicly, said that the document was provided along with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. The separate document presented to the president-elect represented a summary of a much larger 35-page compilation of documents prepared by a former foreign intelligence officer.\u00a0The officer, the official said, is known to U.S.\u00a0intelligence, but the contents of the specific contents of the document have not been verified. Trump responded Tuesday evening by Twitter, calling the report \"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\" Read more: Clinton allies react to reports on Russia, Trump The decision to present the information to Trump, first reported by CNN , was made after it was determined that the document \u2014 in many forms \u2014 had been circulated widely to political opposition researchers, U.S. lawmakers, journalists and others. CNN said it reviewed the compilation of the memos, described as originating as opposition research first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats.\u00a0Buzzfeed has\u00a0 posted the intelligence documents . In the end, U.S. authorities determined that Trump needed to know the information, if he didn\u2019t know its existence already, the official said, adding that the contents remained the subject of investigation.\u00a0The official declined to comment on Trump's reaction to the presentation. And the president-elect, who has scheduled his first news conference Wednesday , did not immediately comment on the revelations. The summary document also includes allegations that information was exchanged over a long period of time between the Russian government and Trump representatives. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, accused of meeting with a Russian operative in Prague last year, said in a tweet that \"I have\u00a0never been to Prague in my life.\" The news came on a day in which the Senate Intelligence Committee\u00a0conducted hearings into the reported Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and emails provided to the website Wikileaks. Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C.,\u00a0said the panel will conduct an independent review of the intelligence community's report about Russian interference to help Trump. FBI Director James Comey declined to answer questions from\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about whether the FBI is investigating possible contacts between the\u00a0Trump campaign\u00a0and the Russian government during the presidential campaign. \"I think the American people have a right to know this,\" Wyden said. \"And if there is a delay in declassifying this information and releasing it to the American people, and it doesn\u2019t happen before Jan. 20\u00a0(Inauguration Day), I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to happen.\" Wyden declined comment late Tuesday about the unsubstantiated reports that Russians have compromising information about Trump. The senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, also had no comment, said spokeswoman Rachel Cohen. Read more: Putin ordered hacking to help Trump, intelligence report says Then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., angry over FBI statements about the email investigation of Clinton, referenced these allegations in an October letter to the bureau. It said in part, \"it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.\" Rep. Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., said late Tuesday that she finds the latest reports about Russia and Trump alarming and called on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to appoint a special counsel to continue investigating the allegations \"until all facts have been unearthed.\" \"I find troubling these reports that Russian intelligence apparatuses sought compromising information on the Republican candidate, as well, but released only information related to Democrats,\" the congresswoman said. \"However, particularly alarming are suggestions that surrogates for an American presidential campaign were actively exchanging information with Russian government intermediaries.\" She said the allegations \"raise important legal issues that need to be investigated quickly, thoroughly and impartially, without political interference.\" Contributing: Erin Kelly Posted!

Wakil Kohsar /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Wakil Kohsar /AFP/Getty Images Afghan security personnel arrive at the site of two bombs on Tuesday near the Afghan parliament in Kabul. Wakil Kohsar /AFP/Getty Images Two bomb blasts near the parliament building in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, have killed at least 30 people and injured at least 70. \"The first bomb exploded near a parked minibus,\" NPR's Nishant Dahiya reported. \"The second, when the police arrived to help the victims.\" It happened during the evening rush hour as parliament staff were leaving work. A female lawmaker was said to be among the injured, Nishant added, and other parliament staff were also reportedly victims of the attack. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the bombings. \"We planned this attack for quite some time and the plan was [to] target some senior officers of the intelligence agency. We sent one suicide bomber to target a mini bus that was carrying these officers,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, according to Reuters. \"We did exactly what we planned.\" Dozens Killed In Attack On Protest March Of Minority Hazara Community In Kabul It happened during a period of relative calm in Kabul, Nishant said. This appears to be the deadliest attack in the capital since July , when at least 80 people were killed during a protest march of the minority Hazara community. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State group. There were at least two other bombings today in other parts of Afghanistan. In the southern province of Kandahar, a blast killed five people, according to the Associated Press. It happened at the provincial governor's guest house, injuring the United Arab Emirates' ambassador to Afghanistan and \"a number of Emirati diplomats who were accompanying him,\" according to a statement from the UAE Foreign Ministry . The ambassador was on a \"humanitarian mission\" to Kandahar, the Foreign Ministry added. Article continues after sponsorship Another bombing, in the capital of Helmand province, killed at least seven people, according to the BBC . President Ashraf Ghani vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, the broadcaster reported. \"The Taliban shamelessly claim credit for the attack on civilians and they're proud of it,\" Ghani said in a statement.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 As President Obama returns to his adopted hometown of Chicago to give his farewell speech Tuesday night, a dark cloud hangs over the city where the record-setting murder rate is so high there are pleas to declare a state of emergency. \u201cWhen there is a fire in America, a tornado, a hurricane, they call it a state of emergency, federal funds come in, and help rebuild that town or that community,\u201d said prominent anti-crime activist, Father Michael Pfleger.\u00a0 \u201cWell, hell, we have a state of emergency in Chicago.\u201d In 2016, 762 people were murdered in Chicago. That\u2019s a 63 percent increase from the 468 murders recorded in 2015 and almost double the murders in 2014, according to Chicago Police. Shootings also are way up -- 4,331 people were shot in Chicago in 2016, up from 3,550 in 2015, according to police. In recent months, the president has been mostly quiet about an aggressive solution to Chicago\u2019s violent crime epidemic. The city saw more murders in 2016 than New York and Los Angeles combined, yet is considerably smaller in population than either city. Chicagoans wonder if the president will address the city\u2019s crime \u2013 the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2013 during his speech Tuesday night. \"I cannot recall a time that President Obama said directly about Rahm Emanuel that he needs to do something about this violence,\u201d said Chicago community leader and activist Pastor Corey Brooks. In a series of interviews last week previewing his speech and visit to Chicago, Obama discussed the city\u2019s carnage, noting a lot of the crime is happening in the \u201cbackyard\u201d of the home he and the first lady own on the city\u2019s South Side. \u201cWe've been trying even from the federal level to provide assistance to the city. I don't think that we're going to be able to reverse these things overnight,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOn the other hand, the fact that crime overall is much lower around the country when it was when I took office and that Chicago is the one big city where you've seen this huge spike means that there's something specifically happening there and that means we can fix it if we work together.\u201d Community leaders all agree Chicago\u2019s violent crime and murder rate is unacceptable but the exact cause and how to fix it is a matter of debate. The issues most often pointed to are the city\u2019s uncontrollable illegal gun market, gang wars, cheap heroin and increasing disrespect for law enforcement. Former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who is credited with a drop in the city\u2019s crime up until 2015 through his community-policing approach, says officers haven\u2019t felt a ton of support from the Obama administration. \u201cI can't help but just look at criminal justice, and criminal justice in this country has not had a friend in the federal government during this administration,\" McCarthy said. Lori Lightfoot, president of the Chicago Police Board\u2014an independent entity tasked with investigating complaints into misconduct and corruption\u2014says Chicago\u2019s crime is not something police can arrest their way out of and requires all levels of the government and community to work together beyond analyzing crime stats and police performance. \u201cWe need to make sure we are out there with job training, everything we can to drive down unemployment, make sure kids aren\u2019t living in poverty, good schools,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cThis really does take a multi-faceted approach.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has already weighed in, making headlines when he tweeted that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal help if he can\u2019t fix the city\u2019s crime\u2014which also raises the question if policing in the city and even nationwide might grow beyond a state and local operation under the Trump administration. \u201cPresident-Elect Trump is directly putting the ball in the mayor\u2019s court and that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d Brooks said. Emanuel\u2019s spokesperson replied to the Trump tweet with a statement, in part writing, \u201cAs the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety\u2026we are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.\u201d All this comes as the Department of Justice is in the midst of a patterns and practice investigation into the Chicago Police Department for allegations of racism and police brutality. This follows the release of a highly controversial, graphic dash cam video depicting a Chicago police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The DOJ\u2019s findings are expected to be released before or shortly after the inauguration of Trump on Jan. 20 and could result in an expensive Consent Decree with CPD that will continue to keep Chicago\u2019s crime problems in the national spotlight. Pfleger said he reached out to Trump during the campaign but did not hear back. He says he hopes the DOJ\u2019s findings and the new administration could make a difference in Chicago. \u201cThe question being will they reach out and want to really see some substantive changes and make a difference or do they\u00a0just want to continue to Band-Aid,\u201d Pfleger said.\u00a0 Matt Finn is a Fox News correspondent based in the Chicago bureau.

The 22-year-old man charged with killing nine black worshipers at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. faces two death penalty trials, a first in U.S. history. Jenny Jarvie A federal jury on Tuesday condemned unrepentant white supremacist Dylann Roof to death for the June 2015 massacre of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina Bible study class. Roof stood stone-faced, showing no emotion, as U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel announced the jury's unanimous verdict, which came after about three hours of deliberation. Relatives and friends of the victims were quiet. Some left court smiling and embracing. \"Today we had justice for my sister,\" Melvin Graham, the brother of slain churchgoer Cynthia Hurd,\u00a0said outside the courthouse. \"This is a very hollow victory because my sister is still gone.\" Graham said the\u00a0death penalty was fitting for Roof, who last month was convicted of the killings, because his act was so brutal and he\u00a0showed no remorse. \"He just took them away from us because he wanted to,\" Graham\u00a0said. \"He decided the day, the hour, the moment my sister was going to die. And now someone is going to do that for him\u2026. He's in God's hands now.\"\u00a0 Before the jury began deliberating, Roof, who decided to represent himself during the sentencing phase of the trial,\u00a0offered the panel\u00a0no explanation or apologies for the shooting, saying that he felt he had to do it. In his last words to jury members before they decided whether to punish him with death or life in prison without parole,\u00a0Roof said he was misunderstood. Yet he ultimately declined to give jurors any explanation for the massacre or a single reason to spare his life.\u00a0 Roof acknowledged that he told FBI investigators after he was arrested that he had to do it. \u201cBut obviously that\u2019s not really true,\u201d he told the jury. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do it. I didn\u2019t have to do anything.\u2026\u00a0What I meant when I said that was that I felt that I had to do it, and I still do feel like I had to do it. \u201cAnyone, including the prosecution, who thinks that I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hate is,\u201d Roof said awkwardly, his face flushed as he read haltingly from notes. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything about me. They don\u2019t know what real hatred looks like. They think they do, but they don\u2019t really.\u201d White supremacist Dylann Roof opened fire June 2015 at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., killing nine people: six women and three men. A federal jury on Jan. 10 condemned Roof to death. Here is what we know about the victims: Cynthia Hurd,... (James Queally, Christine Mai-Duc and Kurtis Lee) Prosecutors, in turn, told jurors that Roof was a cold and calculated racist who dismissed a whole class of people as \u201cbrute animals\u201d and continued to believe the shootings were worth it, even after hearing of the \u201cimmeasurable loss\u201d of\u00a0his victims\u2019 loved ones. \u201cHe wants you to believe that you have been misled and that indeed he was justified,\u201d Assistant\u00a0U.S. Atty. Julius \u201cJay\u201d Richardson told the panel of nine white and three black jurors. \u201cHe wants you to believe he was justified in committing a modern-day lynching. Don\u2019t let that be.\u2026\u00a0Render the full measure of justice for this defendant. Sentence this defendant to death.\u201d The jury began deliberating Tuesday afternoon after Roof\u2019s closing arguments. Earlier, as federal attorneys wrapped up their case, they provided\u00a0a lengthy list of aggravating factors that they said justified the death penalty, rather than\u00a0life in prison. Not only had Roof killed multiple people and endangered others, prosecutors said, but he also conducted substantial planning, was motivated by racial prejudice\u00a0and hoped to incite others. They insisted\u00a0Roof continued to show \u201cnot one ounce of remorse.\u201d Last month, the same jurors found Roof guilty of all 33 charges related to the June 2015 massacre at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, including multiple counts of committing a hate crime against black victims, obstructing the exercise of religion and using a firearm to commit murder. Roof, who has developed a tense relationship with his defense team, asked the judge whether he would appoint new lawyers to help file a request for a new trial. Gergel told Roof he was \"strongly disinclined\" to appoint new attorneys but would listen to any motions Roof made Wednesday. Anyone, including the prosecution, who thinks that I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hate is. \u2014 Dylann Roof In closing arguments, the trial\u2019s lead prosecutor offered a window into each of the nine victims\u2019 lives, showing jurors family photos of them at ballgames, weddings, vacations and graduations.\u00a0 \u201cYou now know the last moments this last group of 12 spent together,\u201d Richardson told the jury, reminding them the nine victims were among a dozen who had gathered together that muggy June evening to study the gospel of Mark\u2019s parable of the sower. \u201cYou also now know how extraordinarily good these people were. \u201cThey welcomed the defendant with a kind word, a Bible, a handout and a chair,\u201d he said. Yet Roof \u201chad come not to learn, not to receive the word.\u2026 He\u2019d come with a hateful heart and a Glock.\u201d After showing images of Roof posing with a pistol and a Confederate flag, and engaged in target practice in his backyard, Richardson argued that the defense had failed to show any possibility that Roof was capable of any meaningful change or redemption. \u201cWe may indeed wish it to be true, but there\u2019s no evidence to support it,\u201d Richardson said. The 22-year-old high school dropout addressed the jury for only a few minutes during an opening statement in the death penalty hearing\u00a0last week to insist he was not mentally ill. \u201cOther than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn\u2019t, there is nothing wrong with me psychologically,\u201d he told the jury, referring to his attorneys\u2019 attempts to present evidence of mental health problems. Although Roof admitted he wanted to prevent his attorneys from presenting such evidence, he said, \u201cit isn\u2019t because I have a mental illness that I don\u2019t want you to know about and it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m trying to keep it a secret from you. The point is, I\u2019m not going to lie to you.\u201d At the beginning of the penalty phase of the trial, jurors learned that Roof had continued to show no remorse\u00a0weeks after the crime. \u201cI would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,\u201d Roof wrote in a journal found in his jail cell six weeks after his arrest. \u201cI am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.\u201d Roof added that he did feel sorry for the \u201cinnocent white children forced to live in this sick country\u201d and \u201cI have shed a tear of self-pity for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place.\u201d Usually during the sentencing phase of a death penalty case, the defense tries to mitigate the prosecution\u2019s case by presenting evidence about background issues, such as childhood upbringing and mental health problems, in an effort to encourage jurors to be more lenient. Yet from the beginning, Roof has resisted any idea of mounting a defense on the premise that he is mentally ill. \u201cI am morally opposed to psychology,\u201d he scrawled in a journal that investigators found in his car after the massacre. \u201cIt is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don\u2019t.\u201d In his statement to the jury Tuesday, as he spoke about how he felt the need to commit the killings, Roof\u00a0said: \u201cI think that it\u2019s safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go into a church and kill people.\u201d Over the last week, Roof declined to cross-examine any of the prosecution\u2019s 25 witnesses or present any witnesses of his own. Yet he filed several motions last week objecting that the prosecutor\u2019s victim impact testimony was excessive. \u201cThis part of the trial can be easily prejudiced by so much victim impact evidence, and I think the limits of due process have already been passed,\u201d Roof wrote last Thursday, objecting not only to the number of people testifying, but to the \u201cextent and depth\u201d of the testimony.

Sessions of Misrepresenting His Record on Civil Rights 0 Shares Email During today's Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general, Sen. Al Franken , D-Minnesota, accused Sen. Sessions, R-Alabama, of misrepresenting the number of desegregation cases he filed as United States attorney in Alabama. \u201cOur country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their level of involvement on any given issue,\u201d Franken said. In a 2009 interview with the National Review, Sessions said he handled \u201c20 or 30\u201d civil rights cases -- a claim he was not able to prove when pressed by Franken. \u201cTell me, did you file 20 or 30 desegregation cases, or is it some other number?\u201d Franken asked. Sessions conceded that the number of desegregation cases he filed had been distorted, and blamed his memory. \u201cIt is important, first, to be accurate,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThe records don't show that there were 20 or 30 actually filed cases. Some of the cases involve multiple defendants and multiple parties, like to a school board and a county commission being sued for racial discrimination or things of that nature, but the number would be less than that, as we've looked at.\u201d Alex Brandon/AP Photo Sen. Al Franken questions Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions on Capitol Hill in Washington,Jan. 10, 2017, during the committee's confirmation hearing for Sessions. In a questionnaire submitted by Sessions for his Senate confirmation, he answered a prompt about the \u201cten most significant litigated matters you personally handled.\u201d Sessions answered that he personally litigated four civil rights cases during the 1980s, but Franken challenged the level of his actual involvement. In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, three former Department of Justice attorneys, J. Gerald Hebert, Joseph D. Rich, William Yeomans, wrote that Sessions had \u201cno substantive involvement\u201d in any of the desegregation cases referenced by Sessions, an accusation Sessions denied. The three attorneys wrote in their op-ed: \u201cWe worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, which brought those lawsuits; we handled three of the four ourselves. We can state categorically that Sessions had no substantive involvement in any of them. He did what any U.S. attorney would have had to do: He signed his name on the complaint, and we added his name on any motions or briefs. That\u2019s it.\" Franken said that while he\u2019s not a lawyer, he thinks \"filed\" means more than having a name at the top of a case. \u201cWe need to be accurate in what we say,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWhen this issue was raised, I did do a supplemental that said I provided assistance and guidance to civil rights division of attorneys and had an open door policy with them and cooperated with them on these cases. I signed them. I supported cases, and I attempted to be as effective as I could be in helping them be successful in these historic cases. I do feel that they were the kind of cases that were national in scope and deserved to be listed on the form. If I'm in error, I apologize to you. I don't think I was.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Jeff Sessions , Donald Trump \u2019s pick to become the next attorney general, further clarified today his position on controversial comments the president-elect made about women, telling a Senate panel that grabbing women by the genitals without their consent would \"clearly\" be sexual assault. Several months ago , Sessions came under fire for saying that it would be a \u201cstretch\u201d to call such behavior sexual assault -- a position he clarified shortly afterwards. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, Sessions, R-Alabama, went even further. \"Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?\" Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont, asked the Republican nominee. Sessions was unequivocal: \"Clearly it would be ... Yes.\" Leahy, who until recently was the top Democrat on the committee, then pushed Sessions on whether he would be able to prosecute and investigate \"a sitting president or any other high federal official ... accused of what the president-elect described\" on tape, assuming federal laws were implicated. \"The president is subject to certain lawful restrictions, and they would be required to be applied by the appropriate law enforcement official,\" Sessions replied. Sessions said he could not recall exactly what Trump said on the tapes, including whether the talk included \u201cunwanted\u201d advances. But, Sessions said, \"if that\u2019s what the tape\" indicated, then \"certainly it would meet the definition\u201d of sexual assault. In October 2016, just a month before Election Day , the New York Times obtained and released video from a 2005 interview with Trump for \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d \u201cYou know, I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful [women] \u2014 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump could be heard telling TV personality Billy Bush . \u201cGrab \u2019em by the p----. You can do anything.\u201d During a presidential debate days after the video surfaced, Trump described the recorded discussion as just \u201clocker room talk.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologized to the American people,\" he said. \"Certainly, I am not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\u201d Trump said he never actually did the things he described on the tapes, insisting he has \u201ctremendous respect for women.\u201d Shortly after the debate, Sessions came under fire for appearing to suggest he did not believe Trump\u2019s taped comments about women amounted to sexual assault. \u201cI don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that's a stretch,\u201d Sessions was quoted by The Weekly Standard as saying. Two days later, Session issued a statement saying he was confused by the questions posed to him \u201cin a chaotic post-debate environment,\u201d and the subsequent \u201cinaccurate article ... misrepresented my views.\u201d \u201cOf course it is crystal clear that assault is unacceptable. I would never intentionally suggest otherwise,\" Sessions said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

And we've reaffirmed the belief that we can make a difference with our own hands, in our own time.\" Speaking to NBC News' Lester Holt Tuesday aboard Air Force One, President Obama said he hoped he could properly convey the gratitude he felt, both for his staff and his supporters. \"You know when you when you reflect back on eight years, for all the highs and the lows, the one thing that is a constant is the incredible dedication of the people who got you there,\" Obama said, adding that he meant everyone from his staff to \"the people who, you know, would say that the work we did made a difference.\" \"I think that that sense of gratitude that I feel for those folks, I just hope I'm able to express that,\" he said.

The crew reportedly enjoyed a day at the waterfall and even swam with dolphins.\u00a0 But the bus driver that took them back from the cruise ship drove recklessly, the passengers claimed, and continuously changed lanes while speeding. When passengers asked to slow down, according to TMZ , the driver reportedly said that he was driving \u201cthe way everyone typically drove in Jamaica.\u201d That \"way\" wound up being deadly. INSIDE THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE CRUISE SHIP SUITE As the bus entered the port city of Falmouth, a major collision occurred in which one passenger was killed and three others were wounded. The crash also involved a truck, a panel van and another car, according to Cruise Critic . According to the lawsuit, the excursion group's driver had a slow reaction to a vehicle that had entered their lane. The passengers said the driver didn\u2019t get out of the way and the bus was subsequently broadsided, causing it to flip multiple times. At the time, Royal Caribbean released a statement called the accident a \"terrible incident.\" \"We are saddened to report that one of our guests passed away,\" the line said on Jan. 15, 2016. \"Three other guests were injured and are being treated at the local hospital. Crew members are at the hospital with our guests in order to help respond to this terrible incident. The other guests that were on the bus have been treated and released, and have continued on the ship.\" FOR THE LATEST TRAVEL FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK Those suing the cruise line say that Royal Caribbean placed them with an inept driver and thus failed to provide a safe experience even though the driver was not directly employed by the line. Independence of the Seas was sailing a five-night itinerary that departed from Florida with port calls to Labadee, Haiti and Falmouth, Jamaica. Advertisement ",

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama arrives before speaking at McCormick Place in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP) President Obama called for Americans to seek solidarity over division in a celebratory farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday, calling for a \"new social compact.\" Obama's final major speech as president was the same sort of rallying cry to activism that propelled him to the national stage a decade ago, asking supporters to continue the work to \"form a more perfect union.\" \"For all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title:\u00a0Citizen,\" he said to a crowd of approximately 18,000. \"Ultimately, that\u2019s what our democracy demands.\u00a0It needs you.\u00a0Not just when there\u2019s an election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime.\" Lamenting racial, economic and social divisions in the country, he exhorted Americans not to retreat into their \"bubbles.\" \"If you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life,\" he said. The address mentioned his successor only once, promising to facilitate \"the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next.\" But it was hard not to see in Obama's parting words a repudiation of a Trump era that has already begun. \"If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,\" he said. Obama lauded the contributions of immigrants and Muslim-Americans\u00a0and denounced \"naked partisanship,\" income inequality and a splintering media.\u00a0And he exhorted Americans not to \"retreat into our own bubbles\" of neighborhoods or churches or even social media feeds. \"Increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that\u2019s out there,\" he said. The \"selective sorting of the facts\" was self-defeating, he said, \"because as my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.\" Read more: In speech to Greeks, Obama warns against nationalist impulses He singled out climate change as an example. \"We can and should argue about the best approach to the problem.\u00a0But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our founders,\" he said. Obama's farewell covered the gamut of administration accomplishments, from the auto bailout to the Affordable Care Act to the killing of Osama bin Laden. But like George Washington, whose farewell address Obama quoted from, Obama warned against internal divisions. \"After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America.\u00a0Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic,\" he said. \"For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u00a0I\u2019ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago \u2014 you can see it not just in statistics, but in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.\" Obama consciously chose Chicago as the venue for the speech, departing from a modern tradition that has mostly used the Oval Office as the set for a televised address. \"I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life,\" he said. \"It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills.\u00a0It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.\u00a0 This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it. \"After eight years as your president, I still believe that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just my belief.\u00a0 It\u2019s the beating heart of our American idea \u2013 our bold experiment in self-government.\" Early on, the speech was interrupted by cheers and shouting. \"Four more years!\" Read more: Full text of Obama's farewell speech \"I can't do that\" \"I can't do that,\" Obama said.\u00a0\"In ten days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy:\u00a0the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next,\" he said, to a smattering of boos. On the way to Chicago, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that Obama is \u201cnot one to be overly sentimental,\u201d but it would be unrealistic for anyone in his position tonight not to feel some nostalgia But Obama teared up when he addressed first lady Michelle Obama. \"You took on a role you didn\u2019t ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,\" he said. \"You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.\u00a0And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.\u00a0You\u2019ve made me proud.\u00a0You\u2019ve made the country proud.\" The speech also hearkened back to the campaign rhetoric of 2008, ending in the chant of \"Yes we can!\" Obama did not specifically address his post-presidential plans. \"There will be a time and place\u201d for Obama to speak at length about that, Earnest said. But Obama promised to remain engaged in the causes of his presidency. \"I\u00a0won\u2019t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\u00a0 For now, whether you\u2019re young or young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president \u2014 the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. \"I am asking you to believe.\u00a0 Not in my ability to bring about change \u2013 but in yours. \"I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written.\" A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "CBS News January 10, 2017, 1:21 PM Robert Kennedy Jr. says he will chair \"vaccination safety\" committee for Trump Activist author Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes part in a panel discussion following a screening of the film \u201cTrace Amounts\u201d on March 24, 2015 in New York City. Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Trace Amounts Email President-elect Donald Trump met with Robert Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday. According to incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, the two discussed \u201cthe issues pertaining to vaccines and immunizations.\u201d After the meeting concluded, Kennedy told reporters that Mr. Trump had asked him to \u201cchair a commission on vaccination safety and scientific integrity.\u201d Kennedy said he told Mr. Trump he would chair such a commission, and that their meeting was held at Mr. Trump\u2019s request.\u00a0 Kennedy, the eldest son of liberal icon Sen. Robert Kennedy, was best known as an environmental advocate before increasingly devoting his time to the supposed dangers of vaccines.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has repeatedly shared his belief that there is a link between vaccines and autism .\u00a0 \u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a 2015 GOP primary debate. \u201cBut I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump--I mean, it looks just like it\u2019s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we\u2019ve had so many instances, people that work for me. ... [in which] a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back and a week later had a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d He also also tweeted about the issue multiple times:\u00a0 Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2014 Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose. Kennedy has argued that vaccines, specifically those containing the element thimerosal, may cause autism, a view unsupported by scientific evidence and dismissed as a conspiracy theory by experts. \u201cResearch does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder,\u201d says the Center for Disease Control on its website. Moreover, studies linking vaccines and autism have been repeatedly been debunked and discredited, although many parents continue to insist that their children were damaged by immunizations. Kennedy, who criticized Mr. Trump during the election campaign, has also written a book and promoted a documentary on the subject. During one showing of that documentary, according to the Sacramento Bee, Kennedy compared the damage done by vaccines to \u201ca holocaust.\u201d \u201cThey get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said at the screening in 2015. \u201cThis is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d It was a comment which he later apologized for , saying, \u201cI employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Six months after a Democratic National Committee staffer was gunned down on a Washington, D.C., street, suspicion that he may have been the source who passed incriminating DNC emails on to WikiLeaks persists despite his own parents' strong doubts. Seth Rich, who was killed July 10 and would have turned 28 earlier this month, worked as a DNC data analyst and had recently built a database for spurring voter turnout. Despite speculation -- fueled by WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's own cryptic comments -- that he may have provided some of the emails that rocked the 2016 presidential election, Rich's father rejects such rumors. \u201cAnyone who knew Seth knew that wasn\u2019t the way he would have handled the problem,\" Rich\u2019s father, Joel Rich, told FoxNews.com in an exclusive interview, calling Assange\u2019s statements \u201cbizarre.\u201d \"He would not go outside the system.\u201d Seth Rich, shown here with his mother, Mary, had long dreamed of working in Washington. (Courtesy: Rich family) Like the Washington police, Rich believes his son was more likely killed in a robbery gone awry. \u201cThe reason Seth was killed is probably because he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d said his father. \u201cThere are all kinds of scenarios, but until something else is proven, these are just scenarios.\u201d Rich was a cheerful, compassionate person, who wanted to make a positive impact, said his father. \u201cSeth above all wanted to make a difference in the world,\" Rich said of his son. \"At work, Seth was able to extend his desire to make everyone feel included to the basic right to vote in American elections.\u201d Expand / Contract Rich often dressed in patriotic colors, and believed his job with the DNC allowed him to serve his country. (Courtesy: Rich family) One reason for the speculation that Rich may have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks is that Assange offered a $20,000 reward leading to the arrest of the killers. That sum, added to Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman's $100,000 reward and the D.C. police's $25,000, tally more than any other reward offered in such a case in the nation\u2019s capital. During an Aug. 9 interview on Dutch television and in subsequent media interviews, Assange implied that Rich was killed because he was the WikiLeaks source of emails from top DNC officials showing they conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party\u2019s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz having to resign as DNC chairperson. \u201cWe're interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeaks sources, Assange later told Fox News Channel. On the morning of his death, Rich had left his favorite watering hole, Lou\u2019s City Bar, about 1 a.m. to walk home, something that normally took 20 or 30 minutes. He tried twice to call his father, who had gone to sleep. He then called a fraternity brother and after that had two separate conversations with his girlfriend, Kelsey Mulka. Around 4:17 a.m., when Rich was about a block and a half from his home, his girlfriend heard other voices over the phone but was reassured by Rich that he was nearly home. Two minutes later, Rich was shot multiple times. Rich died at a nearby hospital. Security footage from a nearby market showed two men following Rich through a crosswalk by his home moments before he was shot, FoxNews.com has learned. The camera only captured the assailants\u2019 legs and Rich after he was shot and fell onto the street. Police said Rich, who was shot twice in the back, was likely the victim of a robbery, though nothing of value, including his wallet, phone, keys, watch and gold necklace, were stolen. \u201cThe Metropolitan Police Department is committed to bringing the person or persons responsible for Seth Rich\u2019s death to justice, D.C. police told FoxNews.com in a statement. \"As we mark the six-month anniversary of his death, we urge anyone with information to come forward and help bring his family the answers they deserve.\u201d Rich would have had access to sensitive DNC information. His main duty at the DNC was to build an online system to get out the vote. The system, which combines government data, technologies and formats from all 50 states, allows anyone to check if they are registered to vote and, if not, where to register and how. His talent was noticed. Four days before he was killed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign had offered Rich a job, according to his father. His parents believe he would have accepted the position. On August 3 of last year, Rich\u2019s parents went to D.C., where they attended a tribute to their son at Lou\u2019s City Bar. \u201cAbout 150 people came and the event went on for hours,\u201d his father said, noting many of his friends shared fond memories. Many of those same friends have done work in the community in his honor. On Jan. 3, just a day before what would have been his 28th birthday, Rich's friends volunteered at the D.C. Humane Society, a place Rich had served. \u201cThis was rewarding and made my wife Mary and I feel good that Seth touched people who also want to make a difference.\u201d Joel Rich said his son was a people person, someone who went out of his way to welcome new people into his circle. He was a patriot, who often dressed in red, white and blue and slept with an American flag above his bed. \u201cWhat makes Seth stand out is wanting to help others and wanting to make a difference,\" his father said. \"As a parent, you always think your children are great, but after speaking to people who knew him who started calling the day after he was killed, we realized we didn\u2019t have to be as modest about what we said about him.\u201d Advertisement ",

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP President Obama waves to supporters at an election night party in Chicago to proclaim victory in the 2012 presidential election. Carolyn Kaster/AP President Obama's adopted hometown of Chicago is often the stage for pivotal moments in his career. He claimed victory in Chicago in 2008 and again in 2012. And it's where he will give his farewell address on Tuesday night. Many Chicagoans use the word \"pride\" when talking about Barack Obama. You can hear it in their voices. In this city, where President-elect Donald Trump got only 12 percent of the vote, admiration for President Obama is strong. Kim Chisholm stood with thousands of others in the bitter cold this weekend to get a ticket to Obama's speech. Scorecard For A Departing President: Assessing Obama's Successes And Shortcomings \"I'm so excited,\" she says. \"History in the making. I never made it to the White House, but I will see him here in Chicago.\" Chicago officials say there are pluses and minuses to having such close ties to the Obama administration. On Monday, the city won a federal grant for nearly $1 billion to upgrade a major portion of the city's elevated commuter rail line. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's first White House chief of staff, worked to make sure the funding came through before the administration changed hands. \"This will over the next four years create 6,000 jobs in the city of Chicago,\" he says. Illinois' senior U.S. senator, Dick Durbin, says the city has been able to make significant infrastructure improvements with the help of federal funds, including high-speed rail and upgrades to O'Hare International Airport. \"Time and again, the Obama administration has not forgotten where he came from,\" Durbin says. \"[He] has not forgotten the city of Chicago.\" Article continues after sponsorship Obama's Farewell Address: How Presidents Use This Moment Of Reflection That's in part because the administration included a bevy of Chicagoans as Cabinet members and advisers, such as former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, advisers Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Tuesday night's speech and talk about an Obama legacy in Chicago are much more personal for some. Jacky Grimshaw worked in Chicago government under Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, and was Obama's next-door neighbor for years. She says the country's first black president faced the same sort of opposition that Washington did and both men prevailed. \"And he put through the stimulus package that allowed communities across the country to deal with infrastructure projects that needed to get done,\" Grimshaw says of Obama. Some community organizers take a more nuanced stance. Jitu Brown of the Institute for Educational Leadership says that while the president conducts himself with grace, he disagrees with many of his administration's education policies. \"And I think the disappointment is in a president who started as a community organizer. I would have really hoped there would have been space to really listen to the voices of the people directly impacted,\" Brown says. 'That's Our Guy': Chicagoans Welcome Obama Back To D.C. At Valois Restaurant, not far from the president's Chicago home, customers can order a variety of Obama specials on the menu. Kimberly Barnes Staples was eating breakfast with her husband. \"For Chicago, specifically, he gave us a national profile,\" she says. \"He showcased who we are as Chicagoans. He made us proud.\" And Devi Austin, a retiree, says she personally benefited from policies Obama advanced. \"Because of the laws that he put in place for people who had just bought homes and was underwater, I got forgiven \u2014 forgiven, not modified \u2014 forgiven $60,000,\" she says. \"I will miss President Obama.\" Obama Says Goodbye This Week, But His Message Hasn't Always Gotten Through Jan. 8, 2017 While some Chicagoans express disappointment that the president didn't provide more help to deal with gun violence and gangs, others give him a pass, saying that's a problem for the mayor, not the president. So as Obama says farewell, Patty McNamara, a museum consultant, says she will be watching wistfully. \"It's kind of bittersweet,\" she says. \"It's going to be a tough transition, I'm afraid.\" There will be a tangible Obama legacy for Chicagoans, though. His presidential library and foundation will be built on Chicago's South Side. That means that even if the Obamas don't return there to live, the president will remain engaged in the city that gave him his political start. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story A change in tone on marijuana Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic. He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs, said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol, and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana. He said in 2015 : It\u2019s still a federal offense to deal in marijuana in the United States, and so even though a state doesn\u2019t have that law, the federal government does. They said, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t enforce it, we won\u2019t enforce it.\u2019 Another relaxation of federal law. Flash forward to Tuesday. Mr. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the Justice Department behind drug prosecution in those states. Doing so would set up a huge fight over states\u2019 rights and federal drug policy. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be an easy decision,\u201d he said. No vitriol Senate Democrats do not have the votes, by themselves, to prevent Mr. Sessions from becoming attorney general, and they have spared their colleague any vitriol, doing little to undermine his confirmation. Mr. Sessions was prepared to face renewed questions about race and comments he was accused of making in the 1980s regarding the N.A.A.C.P., the American Civil Liberties Union and \u201cun-American\u201d views. Liberal activists have repeatedly disrupted the hearing, screaming \u201cK.K.K.\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d But the questioning from Democrats has mostly focused on his Senate record and whether he would enforce laws that he disagreed with. He has said he would. Photo Code Pink members protesting before the confirmation hearing for Senator Jeff Sessions. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times In short, there is no indication so far that his confirmation is in jeopardy. No workaround on waterboarding Mr. Sessions, who has supported the use of waterboarding as an interrogation tactic, said that current law makes it \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal.\u201d That\u2019s important because it suggests that Mr. Sessions sees no workaround that would allow Mr. Trump to reinstate such tactics. Mr. Sessions has previously said he supported the Justice Department legal analysis that authorized harsh interrogation in C.I.A. prisons, and has said that waterboarding works. By saying that the law against waterboarding is clear, Mr. Sessions makes it much harder, if not impossible, for Mr. Trump to bring it back. No support for Muslim ban In response to a question about whether he supported a temporary ban on Muslim immigration, as Mr. Trump has suggested, Mr. Sessions said he did not. \u201cI have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious groups should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has since clarified that the restriction should be on immigration from countries that support terrorism. He said religious views \u2014 where, for example, they include justification for violence against Americans \u2014 should be considered as part of the visa progress. Would you support a law that says, \u2018You can\u2019t come to America because you\u2019re a Muslim\u2019? asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Sessions replied. A promise to recuse Mr. Sessions was a top surrogate for Mr. Trump during a campaign in which \u201clock her up!\u201d was a rallying cry against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sessions said that if there were lingering investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server or her family foundation, he would recuse himself. \u201cYou intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email matter and any investigation involving the Clinton foundation, if there are any?\u201d asked Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t punish its political enemies.\u201d Photo Senator Jeff Sessions was sworn in at the start of the hearing. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times A more forceful denial Mr. Sessions last faced the Judiciary Committee three decades ago, for a seat on the federal bench. His nomination failed, in part over allegations that he had described civil rights groups as \u201cun-American\u201d and that he had suggested a white lawyer was a disgrace to his race for representing African-Americans. At the time, he said his comments were misunderstood or taken out of context. He offered a more forceful denial this time: \u201cI never declared that the N.A.A.C.P. was \u2018un-American\u2019 or that a civil rights attorney was a \u2018disgrace to his race,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sessions said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 1986 he described it this way: The N.A.A.C.P. and other civil rights organizations, when they leave the basic discriminatory questions and start getting into matters such as foreign policy and things of that nature and other political issues \u2014 and that is probably something I should not have said, but I really did not mean any harm by it. And here\u2019s how he described the \u201cdisgrace to his race\u201d exchange. Photo Mr. Sessions testified in 1986 that he could not remember saying that a white lawyer might be a disgrace to his race for representing black clients. But he did not contest the allegation, made by a colleague. Offering assurances Mr. Sessions assured his Senate colleagues that he would strictly adhere to the Constitution and stand up to the president if needed. He\u2019s been consistent for years that senators should apply that test to Justice Department nominees. The Republican theme of the hearing is that Mr. Sessions is a known entity, and he reinforced that in his opening remarks. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I believe in.\u201d Mr. Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, has been a consistent voice for conservative policies for nearly two decades in the Senate. Here are some of his positions on the issues. The bottom line Mr. Sessions has been in the Senate for nearly 20 years and is liked by his colleagues. Moderate Republicans and at least one Democrat have said they will vote for him, which all but guarantees his confirmation. And General Kelly is likely to be easily confirmed. That does not mean Democrats will hold their fire, but they are likely to mount their most vigorous offensive against other nominees, including Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican who is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be health secretary. \u2018Straight-talking, candid, courageous\u2019 While Mr. Sessions faced some tough questioning, the early going for General Kelly was more gentle. Mr. Gates, a former defense secretary under Mr. Obama and George W. Bush, introduced General Kelly as a \u201cstraight-talking, candid, courageous leader who will say exactly what he thinks.\u201d But what sets him apart, Mr. Gates said, is his character. Photo Retired Gen. John F. Kelly at Trump Tower last week. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times \u201cTo put it quite simply, he is one of the finest people I have ever known,\u201d he said. \u201cI would trust him with my life.\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, asked Mr. Kelly to be ready to take tough questions, but thanked him for providing the disclosures necessary by the Office of Government Ethics, whose review was completed this week.

(Chicago Tribune) Barack Obama makes his presidential farewell address from\u00a0McCormick Place, Chicago. Jan. 10, 2017. (Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Barack Obama said goodbye Tuesday night to a nation that delivered him a historic presidency and challenged Americans to fulfill democracy's promise as a new era of government in Washington, led by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump , is about to begin. Even as Obama exits the world and national stage in little more than a week, he pledged to an estimated 18,000 gathered at McCormick Place in his adopted hometown of Chicago that his social and civic activism will continue \u2014 as a citizen. Joined by first lady Michelle Obama, daughter Malia, and Vice President Joe Biden , the president credited Chicago with playing a crucial role in his path to public service. Daughter Sasha remained in Washington because of a Wednesday morning school exam, the White House said. \"I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties and I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose in my life,\" Obama said in a nationally broadcast speech. \"And it was in a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss,\" Obama said. \"Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and come together to demand it.\" President Barack Obama gives his farewell address at McCormick Place in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. (Chicago Tribune) The address presented a dichotomy of Obama's traditional attempts to inspire optimism while also warning his belief that democracy was showing signs of gradual erosion. He cited perceived dangers that include rising income inequality, growing racial tensions, fear of terrorism and a fracturing of media that allows people to exist in their own political preference \"bubbles\" to hear what they want to hear regardless of fact or science. If anything, the speech demonstrated that while Obama is leaving the White House, the 55-year-old president is not headed to quiet retirement amid one-party Republican control of the nation, a controversial successor in the White House and a Democratic Party that finds itself in disarray and without focused leadership. And while he only mentioned the incoming president once by name \u2014 discussing the peaceful transfer of power that will come on Jan. 20 \u2014 Obama's message sought to combat some of the concepts and demographic appeals that Trump embraced to win the White House. Citing the growth of automation in displacing middle-class jobs in the future, Obama called for a new social compact \"to guarantee all our kids the education they need, to give workers the power to unionize for better wages, to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now and make more reforms to the tax code\" so corporations and wealthy individuals don't \"avoid their obligations to the country.\" \"We can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we can't be complacent about the goals themselves. For if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come,\" he said. While Obama said his election as the nation's first black president inspired optimism toward a \"post-racial America,\" he added that such a vision \"was never realistic.\" He also warned economic divisions have intensified racial divisions, particularly at a time when the growth of the nation's Hispanic population continues. To be serious about race, Obama said laws to fight discrimination in hiring, housing, education and criminal justice must be upheld \u2014 and \"hearts must change.\" President Barack Obama is a good and decent man.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I thought, over and over, as I watched his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago.\u00a0 This is a good and decent man. Among some, that\u2019s a wildly unpopular opinion. Obama, they shout or tweet or comment, is a tyrant! A racist! Un-American!... President Barack Obama is a good and decent man.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I thought, over and over, as I watched his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago.\u00a0 This is a good and decent man. Among some, that\u2019s a wildly unpopular opinion. Obama, they shout or tweet or comment, is a tyrant! A racist! Un-American!... (Rex Huppke) \"For blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face,\" Obama said, including \"the middle-aged white man who, from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages, but who's seen his world upended by economic, cultural and technological change.\" For whites, Obama said, \"it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the '60s, that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; when they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment but the equal treatment that our founders promised.\" Noting the increasing partisanship that marked his tenure as president, Obama warned another threat to democracy was the trend of people becoming \"so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions instead of basing our opinions on the evidence is out there.\" \"Without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent is making a fair point and that science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible,\" he said. In what may have been his most direct criticism of Trump, Obama spoke of the threat of terrorism as he hailed the vigilance of first responders and the military and vowed \"ISIL will be destroyed.\" But the president also warned that \"democracy can buckle when we give in to fear.\" \"So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are,\" Obama said. \"That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,\" he added, drawing loud applause. \"That's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights \u2014 to expand democracy and human rights, and women's rights, and LGBT rights \u2014 no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem.\" Here's the text of President Barack Obama 's farewell address Tuesday at McCormick Place in Chicago: THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Chicago!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s good to be home!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 All right, everybody... Here's the text of President Barack Obama 's farewell address Tuesday at McCormick Place in Chicago: THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Chicago!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s good to be home!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 All right, everybody... Read the story Obama also warned of complacency toward government and politics, particularly among younger Americans. He urged citizens, regardless of party, to \"throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.\" Democracy's potential, he said, only works \"if our politics better reflects the decency of our people\" and if everyone helps to \"restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.\" \"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life. If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures and run for office yourself,\" Obama said. \"Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose.\" It was a celebratory atmosphere that greeted Obama for his final return as president to the city that shaped his career, the place he moved after becoming the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review to get his start as a community organizer, then to serve as a state and U.S. senator and ultimately for eight years as president. Chicago-area native Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam helped lead the Chicago Children's Choir in \"People Have the Power\" as a prelude to the speech and supporters chanted one of the Obama campaign themes, \"Fired up! Ready to go!\" as the lights dimmed. The president walked on stage, standing before a blue background filled with flags as a large presidential seal loomed atop. After initially failing to persuade people to sit down, Obama joked, \"You can tell I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions.\" The speech represented a continuation of a tradition launched by the nation's first president, George Washington, to present a farewell message to the country. By delivering it in Chicago, Obama gave a nod to the city of his politically formative years. But his address of about 50 minutes was not Chicago-centric and was one of the few instances in recent visits in which he did not touch upon one of the city's most troubling problems \u2014 the issue of gun violence \u2014 after last year saw more than 760 homicides. His remarks were interrupted early on when a woman shouted at him from the audience, holding a sign saying, \"Pardon us all now.\" That prompted supporters to try to shout down the protester by chanting, \"Four more years.\" Police removed the protester. The president only briefly touched on a list of accomplishments during his tenure, including the Affordable Care Act, which has provided health insurance to 20 million previously uninsured, that the new GOP administration and leadership in Congress has promised to dismantle.

Barack Obama during a rally against war with Iraq in front of the Federal Plaza in Chicago on Oct. 2, 2002. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Leonor Vivanco Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune After eight years in office, President Barack Obama is set to give his last speech as the nation's leader in a farewell address Tuesday evening in Chicago, where he says it all started. But before he entered the race for the nation's highest office, coined the slogan \"Yes, we can\" or celebrated his historic presidential victory in Grant Park, the Chicago Tribune revisited Obama's political rise from a relatively unknown community organizer to lawyer to elected official. One of the first stories published in the Tribune that mentions Barack Obama \u00a0appeared in 1985, the year he moved to Chicago. He worked with the Calumet Community Religious Conference, which was a recipient of a $40,000 grant awarded by The Campaign for Human Development, a nationwide Roman Catholic antipoverty program. Obama said in the story that the grant was to be used to assess skills of unemployed workers and to aid them in finding jobs. Obama spoke to the Tribune a number of times before he hit the national stage. In several instances, his first name was misspelled and later corrected. Here are five excerpts from the newspaper's archives, many of which foreshadow his political future.\u00a0 Read the story here. Harvard Law Review president In 1990, at age 28, Obama was named the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, the nation's most prestigious student legal journal. \"People don't feel that they can have much impact,\" Obama said at the time . \"I want to get people involved in having a say in how their lives are run. More and more of that needs to be done.\" He said he planned to spend a couple of years practicing law after he graduated from Harvard and most likely return to community organizing \u2014 and maybe politics. \"I'll definitely be coming back to Chicago,\" he said.\u00a0 Read the story here. Minority law partners A few months later,\u00a0 Obama spoke to the Tribune about a survey that showed law firms were slow to hire minority partners, with minorities representing only nine of the 250 new partners brought into Chicago's 21 top law firms. As a Harvard Law School student, editor of the Harvard Law Review and summer associate at Chicago-based Hopkins & Sutter firm, Obama said the problem stemmed from how law firms recruited students. \"If these law firms want to solve these problems, they should go beyond Yale and the University of Chicago to recruit,\" Obama said. \"I think there are a lot of excellent minority law students who have families that can't incur a $25,000 debt for a law school education. So they don't go to nationally ranked schools.\"\u00a0 Read the story here . State Senate seat State Sen. Alice Palmer decided to throw her name in for the congressional seat vacated by U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds, who was convicted of sex crimes. But after losing to Jesse Jackson Jr. in a Democratic primary in 1995, Palmer sought re-election to the state legislature. By then, she had backed Obama as her successor. \"Since she endorsed me, I can always use, 'Even my opponent wants me' as a campaign slogan,\" Obama said in 1995 . Palmer withdrew her bid for the office after signatures on her nominating petitions were challenged. Obama went on to claim victory in 1996 and served in the Illinois Senate until he was elected in 2004 to the U.S. Senate.\u00a0 Read the story here. Congressional run In 1999, Obama set his sights on a congressional run against Bobby Rush, an incumbent who was seeking a fifth term after losing the mayoral election months earlier as a challenger to Richard M. Daley. \"I think an elected official's vision is more important than his seniority,\" Obama told the Tribune . \"Rep. Rush was unconcerned with seniority when he ran against his prior incumbent because he felt he would bring more energy to the office, and that's what I intend to do.\" Obama came in second behind Rush in the 2000 primary, claiming only 30 percent of the vote. It would be four more years before he won a U.S. Senate seat.\u00a0 Read the story here . Missing a vote Obama was visiting his grandmother in Hawaii around Christmastime in 1999 and missed a vote on a gun control bill during a special session in Springfield. He was criticized for it.\u00a0 Obama said his 18-month-old daughter Malia was sick with the flu, and he decided to stay with his family. \"We have a lot of politicians who like to talk about family values. At some point you have to live those families values,\" he said.\u00a0 Read the story here . ",

Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 The chiefs of America\u2019s intelligence agencies last week presented President Obama and President-elect Donald J. Trump with a summary of unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. Trump, two officials with knowledge of the briefing said. The summary is based on memos generated by political operatives seeking to derail Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Details of the reports began circulating in the fall and were widely known among journalists and politicians in Washington. The two-page summary, first reported by CNN, was presented as an appendix to the intelligence agencies\u2019 report on the Russian hacking of the election , the officials said. The material was not corroborated, and The New York Times has not been able to confirm the claims. But intelligence agencies considered it so potentially explosive that they decided Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders needed to be told about it and that the agencies were actively investigating it. Intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed Mr. Trump of its existence, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the summary is classified and talking about it would be a felony. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More The decision of top intelligence officials to give the president, the president-elect and the so-called Gang of Eight \u2014 Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress and the intelligence committees \u2014 what they know to be unverified, defamatory material was extremely unusual. The appendix summarized opposition research memos prepared mainly by a retired British intelligence operative for a Washington political and corporate research firm. The firm was paid for its work first by Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals and later by supporters of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The Times has checked on a number of the details included in the memos but has been unable to substantiate them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memos suggest that for many years, the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has looked for ways to influence Mr. Trump, who has traveled repeatedly to Moscow to investigate real estate deals or to oversee the Miss Universe competition, which he owned for several years. Mr. Trump never completed any major deals in Russia, though he discussed them for years. The former British intelligence officer who gathered the material about Mr. Trump is considered a competent and reliable operative with extensive experience in Russia, American officials said. But he passed on what he heard from Russian informants and others, and what they told him has not yet been vetted by American intelligence. The memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump in a 2013 visit to a Moscow hotel. The videos were supposedly prepared as \u201ckompromat,\u201d or compromising material, with the possible goal of blackmailing Mr. Trump in the future.

Energized by Republican moves to roll back the Affordable Care Act , leading patient advocates, consumer groups, labor unions and Democratic officials are mobilizing a nationwide campaign to defend the law and protect millions of Americans who depend on\u00a0the law and other government health\u00a0programs. ... (Noam N. Levey and Michael A. Memoli) Obama will convene friends, longtime supporters and alumni of his campaigns and his White House to deliver his parting message. He\u2019ll be near the scene of the speech he gave in Grant Park on the night of his historic election in 2008, but with temperatures forecast in the 30s,\u00a0he will speak inside the sprawling McCormick Place convention center near Lake Michigan. Senior advisors say Obama knows that many progressives, religious and ethnic minorities, and immigrants are feeling apprehensive\u00a0with the approach of the handover to\u00a0Trump, who was elected after promising to crack down on immigration, scrutinize Muslims in the U.S. and challenge what he termed political correctness. Elections have consequences, Obama told fellow Democrats recently, and they need to work hard to elect candidates they believe in. But he also wants to remind supporters that they are not powerless just because Democrats are out of power in the White House and Congress. \u201cThis is the great gift our founders gave us: the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, toil and imagination \u2014 and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a greater good,\u201d Obama was to say. The remarks are expected to be Obama\u2019s final address in office, though he may still conduct one more news conference before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidency, Obama has used his bully pulpit to inspire, condemn and cajole. He was always heavily involved in writing his biggest speeches, and his team of young speechwriters spent as much time with him as did more senior staff. Chicago writers have always been at the heart of his craft. His earliest message guru was Chicago political mastermind David Axelrod , who helped him come up with the \u201cyes, we can\u201d concept that propelled him into office. In his second term, his head speechwriter has been Chicago native Cody Keenan, who worked with Obama on the farewell address throughout the holidays. Obama also worked on\u00a0it for hours over the weekend. He was still at work on it Monday as his team prepared for the trip to Chicago. After he leaves office, he plans to take time to \u201cquiet\u201d himself and contemplate the last eight years, said\u00a0Valerie\u00a0Jarrett, the president\u2019s longtime advisor and family friend. He wants to give Trump space\u00a0to operate and won\u2019t comment on relatively small developments, friends say. He wants to give Trump \u201croom to do his homework,\u201d Jarrett said. At the same time, Obama is aware that he can command attention when the moment is right. And if something troubles him, he may speak out, he has said. For now, though, he hopes to leave a message of hope as he walks off the world stage. It\u2019s time for the \u201cpassing of the baton,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the White House communications director..

By Matt Zapotosky , Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima January 10 at 3:34 PM Follow @mattzap Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @nakashimae (Video: Reuters; Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Sen. Jeff Sessions sought to assure the American public Tuesday that he could set aside campaign rhetoric and fairly enforce the law as the next U.S. attorney general, asserting repeatedly at his confirmation hearing that he would not let his personal views interfere with court precedent or the will of Congress. Sessions (R-Ala.) said, although his politics might indicate otherwise, that he would abide by the Supreme Court decision underpinning abortion rights, and that he would similarly follow the 5-to-4 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He said he understands that the waterboarding of suspects to elicit information is \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal,\u201d and, though he voted against a law that banned the government\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records, that he would uphold it as attorney general. He declared that he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices or her family\u2019s charitable foundation \u2014 mindful that his previous comments \u201ccould place my objectivity in question.\u201d \u201cWe can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute,\u201d he said. On the first day of his two-day confirmation hearing, Sessions came under tough questioning from Democrats about his conservative, often controversial views on immigration, hate-crimes legislation and national security matters. He answered politely, although often forcefully, and frequently referred to his decades of experience in the Senate. He is expected to be confirmed. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cYou know what I believe in. You know that I am a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do.\u201d On some topics, Sessions, 70, held his ground. He said, for example, that he supports the continued operation of the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for terrorism suspects. He said would not object if \u00adPresident-elect Donald Trump abandoned an executive action by President Obama that allows people who came to the United States illegally as children to receive work permits and a reprieve from possible deportation, although he offered no solution for what to do with those who had received such reprieves. He refused to agree to keep intact consent decrees prompting reform in police departments across the country, saying such agreements and the lawsuits that prompt them \u201cundermine the respect for police officers\u201d and should be approached with \u201ccaution.\u201d Justice Department officials have been pressing to negotiate such reforms in Baltimore and Chicago before the end of the Obama administration. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t commit that there would never be any changes in them, and if departments have complied or reached other developments that could justify the withdrawal or modification of a consent decree, of course I would do that,\u201d Sessions said. He said, though, that he would enforce existing agreements. Sessions declined to say that he would adopt the policies of former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. when it comes to investigations involving the news media, including a promise not to jail reporters for doing their job. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said when asked whether he would keep that Holder promise. \u201cI have not studied those regulations.\u201d But Sessions also seemed to recognize that, if confirmed, he would have to abandon his persona as a far-right lawmaker and an unabashed Trump supporter. He said that the attorney general should enforce the law regardless of the president\u2019s views, and that if the president presses for illegal action, the attorney general should resign. \u201cHe or she must be willing to tell the president or other top officials \u2018no\u2019 if he or they overreach,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cHe or she cannot be a mere rubber stamp.\u201d Sessions spoke in a room packed with demonstrators, reporters and his family members, and the proceedings were interrupted several times by protesters declaring him \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d Capitol Police said 25 were arrested \u2014 18 at the hearing and seven in Sessions\u2019s office. The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Sessions for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations of racially insensitive remarks, and civil rights advocates and others have mounted a campaign to deny him the attorney general post. Democratic senators took up many of their issues Tuesday, questioning Sessions on his opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate-crimes law to include sexual orientation and gender identity, and his decision not to support an iteration of the Violence Against Women Act that gave Native Americans special protections . Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Sessions about prior comments in which he suggested, after a video emerged of Trump talking about grabbing women by the genitals, that such conduct was not necessarily sexual assault. \u201cSenator, is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?\u201d Leahy said. \u201cClearly, it would be,\u201d Sessions responded. He later suggested that a sitting president could be prosecuted for doing so \u201cif appropriate.\u201d Sessions said that he supported the Violence Against Women Act broadly, and that he thought hate crimes \u201cwere being prosecuted effectively in state courts where they would normally be expected to be prosecuted.\u201d He sought to portray the allegations that sunk him in 1986 \u2014 when even Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., urged Congress to turn him down \u2014 as inaccurate. Sessions said his controversial prosecution of civil rights advocates \u2014 rather than being an effort to stifle voting \u2014 was done in response to complaints from African American incumbent officials. He assailed white supremacists. \u201cI abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,\u201d he said. He denied calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d \u2014 a charge leveled against him by a fellow lawyer. \u201cI hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate,\u201d he said. Sessions\u2019s assertion on the Clinton investigations was an early highlight of the hearing, notable because the future of the inquiries has long been a source of public speculation. Trump said during the campaign that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton, his Democratic rival, even after the FBI concluded that it could not recommend criminal charges. But he has since softened that stance and suggested that he wanted to move past the matter. Sessions has been critical of the Clinton email investigation, and he has said it \u201cseems like\u201d the FBI had not fully investigated the dealings of the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state. The two inquiries are separate, and although the email investigation has ended, the status of the foundation matter is murkier. Justice Department public integrity prosecutors told FBI agents last year that they had no case, but agents have apparently continued to press the matter. A defense attorney for Clinton declined to comment on Sessions\u2019s claim that he would recuse himself. Later in the hearing, pressed on whether he would recuse himself on Trump investigations, Sessions said he \u201cwould review it, and try to do the right thing.\u201d Of Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the United States, Sessions said he thought the president-elect favors stringent vetting of those coming from countries with a history of terrorism. He said he voted against a resolution that would have objected to a Muslim ban because he thought it would not allow for religion to be considered in the vetting process. \u201cMany people do have religious views that are inimical to the public safety of the United States,\u201d Sessions said. He said he would not support an immigration ban that excluded people solely because they are Muslim. Sessions also addressed issues of policing, saying that officers have come to feel \u201cunfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors.\u201d He cited violent-crime statistics, such as Chicago\u2019s 4,368 shooting victims in 2016 and the 11\u00a0percent increase in homicides nationwide from 2014 to 2015 \u2014 and promised that he would prioritize turning the tide. (Reuters) Sessions acknowledged that he is not well-informed about the recent high-profile cyber provocations by Russia. When asked by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) if he thought that the Russian government was behind the hacking of the Democratic Party computers, he said, \u201cI have done no research into that.\u201d When Graham pointed out that the FBI had concluded Russia was behind the intrusion, Sessions observed, \u201cat least that\u2019s what\u2019s been reported.\u201d Later, he allowed, \u201cI have no reason to doubt that,\u201d and he said the response to such action might not be as simple as prosecuting a case. \u201cIn many ways, the political response, the international foreign policy response, may be the only recourse,\u201d he said. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked Sessions whether he would let an investigation of Russian interference continue \u201ceven if it leads to the Trump campaign and Trump interests and associates.\u201d Sessions replied: \u201cIf the law is violated and they can be prosecuted, then you\u2019ll have to handle that in an appropriate way.\u201d On Wednesday, 15 witnesses are scheduled speak about the nominee, including a former attorney general, the president of a national police union, and several civil rights and other advocates. Late Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said that one of Sessions\u2019s colleagues, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is expected to testify against him. Read more: ",

    "text": "Jan 10 2017, 3:38 pm ET Trump's Call For 'Quick' Obamacare Replacement Complicates GOP Efforts by Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe Share advertisement President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wants to see Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act soon and pass a replacement \"very quickly or simultaneously.\" His urging contradicts Republican leaders who have been cautioning that overhauling the massive health care law would take time. Trump would like Obamacare repealed within days and contended that \"the replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter,\" he told the New York Times in an interview Tuesday . \"Long to me would be weeks,\" Trump added. Trump's statements could be an effort at public persuasion but they are complicating efforts for congressional Republicans working to plot out plans to repeal and replace the ACA in a manner that would be politically and economically viable while maintaining the support of enough Republicans to pass the legislation. While the repeal effort is scheduled to be complete by the end of January, if all goes according to plan, Republican leaders have said replacement could take much longer, possibly months or even years. Play How quickly will GOP replace Obamacare? 3:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170110222559if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/850747459849\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Republican leaders are feeling pressure from some rank-and-file members who are feeling jittery to speed up the multi-step process and replace the health care law at the same time it is repealed. House Speaker Paul Ryan indicated Tuesday morning, before Trump's comments, that he is taking into consideration the concerns of some in his GOP conference about a long lag between repeal and replace. \"It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently,\" Ryan said for the first time. \"We are going to use every tool at our disposal through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal so we can save people from this mess.\" Related: More Republicans Express Concern About Repealing Obamacare The Senate and House are expected to vote on the first step of the repeal process this week as part of a budget resolution known as reconciliation. The legislation directs that the second part of the repeal process, which would actually start to dismantle the health care law, be complete by January 27. But Trump's latest remarks have put him in front of the debate, putting even more pressure on Republican leaders to speed up the process. Republican leaders Tuesday declined denounce - or support - Trump's timeline and insisted they are on the same page. Trump's plans are \"not any way inconsistent with the timeline we're aiming for,\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said. One member of leadership, Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said that Trump's public pronouncements and apparent lack of understanding of the complexities of how Congress works - and the difficulty in passing legislation so quickly - are complicating their efforts. \"From a messaging standpoint, yes I worry,\" Thune said about Trump's comments. Trump had been publicly cautioning Republicans for the past week, telling them via Twitter to \"be careful\" in their health care repeal efforts, which could be politically challenging. Five Republican senators have proposed an amendment that would postpone the repeal deadline until March 3, giving legislators enough time to draw up a replacement plan to vote on simultaneously. There is division among Republicans about that idea and Republican leaders haven't committed to allowing a vote on it. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, is one of the members sponsoring that amendment. He said about Trump's accelerated timeline: \"I'm looking forward to hearing how they would anticipate that occurring.\" Leigh Ann Caldwell ",
