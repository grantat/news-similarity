USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) President-elect Donald Trump, in a fresh peek at his\u00a0foreign policy views, says he is\u00a0open to lifting sanctions against Russia and is not committed\u00a0to a longstanding agreement with China over Taiwan. Beijing swiftly responded to the latter remark,\u00a0calling\u00a0any revision of the longstanding \"One China\" policy \"non-negotiable.\" Trump's comments came\u00a0in an hour-long interview with\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal \u00a0on Friday in which he said he will keep the sanctions on Russia in place \"for a period of time\" but is open to lifting them if Moscow cooperates on issues of mutual interest. While several\u00a0sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014 over\u00a0its annexation of Crimea, the latest measures, as well as\u00a0 the expulsion of\u00a035 Russian diplomats, \u00a0were imposed by the Obama administration last month\u00a0in response\u00a0to evidence Russia hacked Democratic Party officials during the presidential election. Senate intel panel to examine possible campaign links with Russia Trump's latest views on Russia comes only\u00a0days after\u00a0 CNN's report regarding classified documents \u00a0presented to Obama and Trump during an intelligence briefing last week that contained\u00a0unsubstantiated and\u00a0potentially compromising information about the president-elect. \"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\" Trump said in the Journal interview. He added, however, he would keep the latest sanctions in place \"at least for a period of time.\" Trump acknowledged\u00a0for the first time this week that he accepts Russia was behind the hacking. But he questioned whether officials were leaking information about their meetings with him, warning that would be a \u201ctremendous blot\u201d on their record. Trump says 'I have nothing to do with Russia.' That's not exactly true The president-elect also told the\u00a0Journal\u00a0he is\u00a0willing to meet with\u00a0Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin after he takes office next week. \"I understand that they would like to meet, and that's absolutely fine with me,\" Trump added. Regarding China, Trump was specifically asked whether he supports the U.S. \"One China\" policy on Taiwan, which declares the province as part of China. Trump's response: \"Everything is under negotiation, including One China.\" He described it as leverage in any talks\u00a0with Beijing over\u00a0trade and currency issues. China: Trump\u2019s Taiwan comments spark \u2018serious concern\u2019 The remarks come only weeks after Trump's unprecedented phone conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen shortly after the November election. There has been no communication between the leaders of the United States and Taiwan since 1979. The latest comments brought a swift and pointed response from China.\u00a0 In a statement Saturday , Lu Kang, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, called the One China policy \"non-negotiable\" and the \"political foundation\" of China-U.S. relations. Four ways Trump could tangle with China \"To avoid disruption to the sound and steady development of the China-U.S. relations and bilateral cooperation in key areas, we urge relevant parties in the U.S. to fully recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question, approach Taiwan-related issues with prudence and honor the commitment made by all previous U.S. administrations of both parties on adhering to the one-China policy,\" Kang said. Why China matters in Trump's economic policy Trump's comments appear to represent\u00a0a departure from remarks by his advisers in early December that the phone call to Taiwan's leader did\u00a0not signify any formal shift in long-standing U.S. relations with Taiwan or China. In mid-December, An Fengshan, a spokesman for China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, warned of more serious consequences if U.S. shifts positions on the Taiwan issue. \"If this basis is interfered with or damaged, then the healthy, stable development of China-U.S. relations is out of the question, and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait will be seriously impacted,\" he added, according to the BBC ..

    "text": "Team Trump: Flynn called Russia ambassador, no sanction talk 'plain and simple' Published               January 14, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Donald Trump transition team has acknowledged that its incoming national security adviser has been in contact with Russia's ambassador but denies reports they were plotting over recently imposed sanctions on Moscow. A transition team official acknowledged a call on Dec. 29, the day President Obama hit Russia for election-related hacking, but said the conversation was about \u201clogistics\u201d for a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, who on Friday is sworn-in as president. \u201cThat was it. Plain and simple,\u201d the official told reporters on the team\u2019s daily conference call. The official said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, texted Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to wish him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. He said Kislyak, in a return text, requested and was granted a phone conversation in late December about the \u201clogistics of setting up call with the president of Russia and the president-elect.\u201d Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. \u201cI believe Ignatius will print an update now that he has been provided information to clarify,\u201d the transition official also said. It's not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office. But repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions raised questions about whether Trump's team discussed -- or even helped shape -- Russia's response. Reuters reports that Flynn and Kislyak talked several times on Dec. 29. Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the move, a decision Trump quickly praised. More broadly, Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador suggests the incoming administration has already begun to lay the groundwork for its promised closer relationship with Moscow. That effort appears to be moving ahead, even as many in Washington, including Republicans, have expressed outrage over intelligence officials' assessment that Putin launched a hacking operation aimed at meddling in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. In an interview published Friday evening by The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he might do away with Obama's sanctions if Russia works with the U.S. on battling terrorists and achieving other goals. \"If Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions?\" he asked. During a news conference Wednesday, Trump highlighted his warmer rapport with the Russian leader. \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia,\" he said. The sanctions targeted the GRU and FSB, leading Russian intelligence agencies that the U.S. said were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other groups. The U.S. also kicked out 35 Russian diplomats who it said were actually intelligence operatives. Trump has been willing to insert himself into major foreign policy issues during the transition, at times contradicting the current administration and diplomatic protocol. He accepted a call from Taiwan's president, ignoring the longstanding \"One China\" policy that does not recognize the island's sovereignty. Asked about that Friday by the Journal, he responded, \"Everything is under negotiation.\" He also publicly urged the U.S. to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, then slammed the Obama administration for abstaining and allowing the measure to pass. Questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia have deepened since the election, as he has dismissed U.S. intelligence agencies' assertions about Russia's role in the hacking of Democratic groups. In briefing Trump on their findings, intelligence officials also presented the president-elect with unsubstantiated claims that Russia had amassed compromising personal and financial allegations about him, according to a separate U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. The Senate Intelligence Committee announced late Friday that it would investigate possible contacts between Russia and people associated with U.S. political campaigns as part of a broader investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump acknowledged for the first time this week that he accepts that Russia was behind the hacking. But he questioned whether officials were leaking information about their meetings with him, warning that would be a \"tremendous blot\" on their record. Flynn's own ties with Russia have worried some Republicans who are more skeptical of the Kremlin than Trump appears to be. After leaving his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, Flynn made appearances on RT, a state-run Russian television network. In 2015, he was paid to attend an RT gala in Moscow, where he sat next to Putin. As national security adviser, Flynn will work in the West Wing close to the Oval Office and will have frequent access to Trump. Unlike Trump's nominees to lead the Pentagon, State Department and other national security agencies, Flynn's post does not require Senate confirmation. Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. The U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press was not authorized to confirm the contacts publicly and insisted on anonymity. The Trump team's account of Flynn's contacts with the Russian envoy changed throughout the day Friday. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer initially said there was one phone call between Flynn and Kislyak on Dec. 28, as well as a Christmas greeting via text messages over the holidays. He said sanctions were not part of the discussions. Later Friday, a transition official said Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on Dec. 29, following a text message from the ambassador the day before. During the call, the Russian ambassador invited U.S. officials to a conference on Syria later this month that is being held in Kazakhstan, according to the transition official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and insisted on anonymity. The official also confirmed a phone call between the men earlier in December. The U.S. official who spoke to the AP Friday described the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak as \"very frequent.\" It's unclear how U.S. officials became aware of the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak, who has served as Russia's envoy to the U.S. since 2008. U.S. monitoring of Russian officials' communication within the United States is known to be common. Flynn has spoken with other foreign officials since Trump won the November election, as have incoming White House senior advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he saw nothing inappropriate in Trump's transition team contacting Russian or any other foreign officials. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Trump kicks off Martin Luther King weekend by sharply criticizing civil rights icon John Lewis John Lewis in 1965 Associated Press A young John Lewis is seen in the foreground being clubbed by a state trooper during a civil rights protest in Selma, Ala., in 1965. A young John Lewis is seen in the foreground being clubbed by a state trooper during a civil rights protest in Selma, Ala., in 1965. (Associated Press) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Unwilling to let criticism pass, Donald Trump on Saturday pilloried as\u00a0\u201call talk \u2026 no action\u201d national icon John Lewis, who was repeatedly beaten by police and nearly lost his life during protests in the long struggle for civil rights. Trump\u2019s Twitter comments about the Georgia congressman\u00a0came in response to Lewis\u2019\u00a0assertion in an interview Friday that he did not see Trump as a \u201clegitimate\u201d president because of Russian involvement in the defeat of his opponent, Hillary Clinton . The president-elect\u2019s comments were rife with irony. At the start of \u00a0a weekend dedicated to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Trump was using his potent social media platform to hurl insults at a civil rights leader. And the trigger for the outburst was doubt being raised about Trump\u2019s legitimacy, even after Trump himself led a more than five-year effort to delegitimize President Obama by falsely claiming that he was foreign born. Trump also used racially freighted language when he said that Lewis\u2019 Atlanta district was \u201ccrime infested\u201d and \u201cfalling apart.\u201d The district, which is mostly African American,\u00a0includes many\u00a0of the Atlanta area\u2019s most prominent\u00a0neighborhoods. A motel room once used by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to plan civil rights protests is the centerpiece of a new national monument in Alabama. President Obama signed an order creating the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in one of his final acts as the nation's first black president.... A motel room once used by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to plan civil rights protests is the centerpiece of a new national monument in Alabama. President Obama signed an order creating the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in one of his final acts as the nation's first black president.... (Associated Press) The furor,\u00a0along with continued investigations into the Russian activities, threatened to mar a period during which an\u00a0incoming president would traditionally want to unify the nation. Trump will be inaugurated on Friday. The back-and-forth began with the release of part of an interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in which anchor Chuck Todd asked Lewis if he would try to work with Trump despite their political differences. \u201cI believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the president-elect as a legitimate president.\u201d The veteran Democrat said he believed \u201cthe Russians participated\u201d in Trump\u2019s election and added: \u201cThey helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d As a result, he said, he would not attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. I don\u2019t see the president-elect as a legitimate president. \u2014 John Lewis, civil rights leader Rep.

John Lewis, D-Ga., testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at the second day of a confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. (Cliff Owen / Associated Press) Lewis\u00a0is\u00a0among a handful of congressional lawmakers to announce\u00a0they will not attend the inauguration, but the first to be called out by Trump.\u00a0Lewis had already emerged as a high-profile Trump opponent on Capitol Hill; on Wednesday he appeared before a Senate committee to urge that it turn aside Trump\u2019s designation of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as his attorney general. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. Trump\u2019s assessment does not match Lewis\u2019 district. It is home to Atlanta\u2019s airport and\u00a0upscale neighborhoods; it houses corporate headquarters like those of Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines. Most of the area\u2019s many colleges and universities are situated in the 5th District, where the average annual household income is $73,000. The area is at the national average for college degrees, if somewhat higher\u00a0on measures of poverty and unemployment. Trump\u2019s transition team did not immediately elaborate on the basis for Trump\u2019s statement. About 12 hours after his initial communication, Trump added another tweet: \u201cCongressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s assessment also does not reflect the views of Lewis, a nearly universally admired\u00a0figure of moral authority in a Capitol usually divided by partisanship. Even among those\u00a0who disagreed with Lewis\u2019 criticism of Trump, there was shock at the president-elect\u2019s decision to hit back at someone of his\u00a0stature. Lewis was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, by then already a central figure in the efforts of African Americans to secure civil rights. For years, he was repeatedly arrested and beaten at Southern protests. In 1965, during the celebrated \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march at the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Ala., Lewis was clubbed so severely that he suffered a skull fracture. He recovered and led other protests, and 30 years ago he was elected to Congress. In 2011, President Obama awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. \u201cGenerations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind \u2014 an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now,\u201d Obama said as\u00a0he presented the award. In 2015, Obama joined Lewis and other civil rights veterans for a 50th anniversary walk over the bridge where Lewis was wounded. Trump\u2019s remarks were\u00a0reminiscent of his summer attack on a Gold Star family who spoke against him at the Democratic convention. In that case, as seemed to occur Saturday, Trump made assumptions based on the people he was criticizing. After Khizr Khan criticized Trump from the convention stage,\u00a0his wife standing silently by his side, Trump suggested that she had not been allowed to speak. She and her husband later said that she was too distraught to speak as the convention displayed a picture of her son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in a 2004 car bombing in Iraq while trying to save his fellow soldiers. Democrats on Saturday swiftly defended Lewis. \u201cJohn Lewis is an icon of the civil rights movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality,\" tweeted\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris, the California Democrat. \"He deserves better than this.\u201d New York\u2019s Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, declared that \u201cAs we honor MLK, I'll always stand by my friend, American hero @repjohnlewis . We'll lock arms & resist any effort to roll back civil rights.\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has long disagreed with the president-elect, tweeted a reproach to Trump: \u201cJohn Lewis and his \u2018talk\u2019\u00a0have changed the world.\u201d Earlier, Sasse had implored Lewis to attend the inauguration to celebrate the \u201cpeaceful transfer of power.\u201d Other\u00a0Republican elected officials were largely silent Saturday, although well-known party activists criticized Trump\u2019s decision to take on Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s telling, I\u2019m afraid, that Donald Trump treats Vladimir Putin with more respect than he does John Lewis,\u201d tweeted Bill Kristol, the founder and editor-at-large of the Weekly Standard\u00a0and a former aide to Republican Vice President Dan Quayle. Added John Feehery, a veteran aide to Republican members of Congress: \u201cPicking a fight with John Lewis is stupid.

    "text": "WATCH Cabinet Picks Who Broke With Trump's Policy Positions 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump unleashed a Twitter attack on Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, after the lawmaker said he wouldn't attend Trump's inauguration because he doesn't see him as a \"legitimate president.\" Lewis in an interview with NBC on Friday cited Russia's meddling in the election for his view on the legitimacy of the presidential election results, and his comments stoked controversy with Republicans and debate inside the Democratic Party . \"I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said. Trump hit back, slamming Lewis today for \"falsely complaining about the election,\" and called him \"all talk, talk, talk -- no action or results!\" Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 Trump\u2019s tweets spurred a backlash on social media, including by some who said Trump was dismissing Lewis' accomplishments in the struggle for civil rights on the weekend before Martin Luther King Jr. Day . Lewis himself responded to Trump today in a DNC fundraising email in which he said, \"I've been beaten bloody, tear-gassed, fighting for what's right for America. I've marched at Selma with Dr. King. Sometimes that's what it takes to move our country in the right direction.\" Lewis is one of the last surviving central organizing figures of the U.S. civil rights movement and was beat by police in a march for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama . John Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality. He deserves better than this. https://t.co/WX1QDCKfzP \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 14, 2017 . @repjohnlewis knows true sacrifice. @realDonaldTrump has no clue. When cluelessness collides with power oppression results. Resistance! https://t.co/Eu1vWbetsl \u2014 Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 14, 2017 Ahead of #MLKday2017 , let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 14, 2017 Some other critics complained about the president-elect calling Lewis' congressional district in Georgia \" crime infested\" and \"falling apart.\" Lewis has represented his district since 1986, and it includes some of the more affluent areas around Atlanta. It is home to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several Fortune 500 companies, and well-known universities and colleges including Emory University, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Georgia Tech and Georgia State University, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Now, Mr. Pruitt, tapped to head Donald J. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency , will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in Washington. If confirmed by the Senate, he is expected to shelve the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency is charged with policing, many of which have helped him advance his political career. The impact would stretch from the nation\u2019s waterways to the planet\u2019s climate, since the E.P.A. carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming. \u201cHe has advocated and stood up for the profits of business, be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters, at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air,\u201d said Mark Derichsweiler, who led the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality division responsible for overseeing the poultry-related cleanup. Mr. Derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state, frustrated with Mr. Pruitt\u2019s approach. Photo Algae, caused by phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure, on a rock pulled from the Illinois River in Tahlequah, Okla. Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Times Mr. Pruitt declined a request to comment. But his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy that states understand their needs best and should be allowed to regulate their own environment. On Thursday, a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination, in advance of his confirmation hearing, set for Wednesday. \u201cSome claim Mr. Pruitt opposes clean air and water. This could not be further from the truth,\u201d wrote the groups , which include the political action committee Club for Growth; the American Energy Alliance, which has advised Mr. Trump on energy policy; and Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by the anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist. Mr. Pruitt, the endorsement said, \u201cunderstands that many of the nation\u2019s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pruitt, if confirmed, will take over the agency in an odd position: He has spent the last seven years suing it to block regulations that he would be expected to put into effect and enforce. Some legal scholars say he should recuse himself from major pending environmental matters, while groups like the Environmental Defense Fund are urging Congress to reject his confirmation. \u201cThe president\u2019s choices deserve a lot of deference from Congress and even environmental groups,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cBut at some point when the nominee has spent his entire career attempting to dismantle environmental protections, it becomes unacceptable. That\u2019s why Mr. Pruitt is the first E.P.A. nominee from either party that the Environmental Defense Fund has opposed in our 50-year history.\u201d Some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases, environmental protection is probably not one of them. Smog and toxic chemicals that foul the air and waterways of one state may originate from one or several others, necessitating federal oversight of pollution. \u201cPollution doesn\u2019t respect state boundaries,\u201d said Patrick A. Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. \u201cStates have limited ability to regulate pollution from outside the state, and almost every state is downstream or downwind from other pollution.\u201d Case in point: the \u201cGreen Country\u201d chicken battle that Mr. Pruitt inherited in eastern Oklahoma. The phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure were causing algae blooms in the ponds, streams and lakes of the 1.1-million acre Illinois River watershed, which reaches from Arkansas into Oklahoma. In 2005, Attorney General Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, sued Tyson Food, Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution and to force them to change the way they disposed of 300,000 tons a year of animal waste. Photo Drew Edmondson, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor as Oklahoma attorney general, arrived for closing arguments in the state\u2019s case against the Arkansas poultry industry in February 2010. Credit Cory Young/Tulsa World, via Associated Press As Mr. Pruitt ran for election, at least $40,000 in contributions poured into his campaign from nearly 30 executives at poultry companies named in the lawsuit or attorneys at law firms representing them, including Mark Simmons, the founder of Simmons Foods; Donald J. Smith, then the chief executive of Tysons Foods; and Gary Weeks, a lawyer listed on the court papers as representing George\u2019s, another company targeted in the lawsuit, according to data assembled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and confirmed by The New York Times. That money represents about 4 percent of the total $1 million he raised in the 2010 campaign, records show . After Mr. Pruitt took over, instead of pushing the federal judge for a ruling that, seven years later, still hasn\u2019t been issued, he negotiated an agreement with Arkansas and the poultry companies to conduct a study of the appropriate level of phosphorus in the Illinois River. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cRegulation through litigation is wrong in my view,\u201d Mr. Pruitt told The Oklahoman newspaper in 2015. \u201cThat was not a decision my office made. It was a case we inherited.\u201d J. D. Strong, director of Oklahoma\u2019s Wildlife Department and the state\u2019s former Secretary of Environment, praised Mr. Pruitt for negotiating the settlement. \u201cYou can\u2019t force a judge to rule,\u201d Mr. Strong said. \u201cPruitt didn\u2019t sit back and wait or badger the judge for a ruling. He worked to get the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas around the table.\u201d A spokesman from Tyson Food noted that the contributions to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s campaign were made by the company\u2019s executives and employees \u2014 including two former chief executives and members of the Tyson family \u2014 rather than by the company itself. \u201cWe\u2019ll point out that our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels, and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit,\u201d Worth Sparkman, the spokesman for Tyson, said. But Mr. Pruitt quietly allowed the expiration of a 2003 agreement that Mr. Edmondson helped negotiate with Arkansas to reduce poultry waste pollution \u2014 and to monitor the progress \u2014 without seeking another formal extension of the deal. And Mr. Pruitt shut down the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies. What do you think senators should ask Mr. Pruitt during his confirmation hearing to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? That environmental unit had broad jurisdiction, forcing pork-producing farmers to spend millions of dollars on their own cleanups and collecting tens of millions of dollars to clean up toxic sites in the state, including poisonous waste left at an abandoned lead and zinc mine known as Tar Creek. Mr. Pruitt, in response to questions, provided a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure, but the list includes cases that were largely initiated under Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Edmondson. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Mr. Pruitt said that while the environmental unit had been closed, environmental cases continued to be handled by the state solicitor general\u2019s unit. \u201cUnder the leadership of Attorney General Pruitt, this team has held bad actors accountable and protected stewardship of Oklahoma\u2019s natural resources.\u201d But Mr. Edmondson said that prosecution of such environmental crimes fell as a result of the shuttering of the unit. \u201cUnder his tenure as attorney general, I don\u2019t think environmental crimes have disappeared,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said of Mr. Pruitt, in an interview. \u201cIt is just the filing of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely disappeared.\u201d Residents who live in eastern Oklahoma, where local ponds and streams are still often clogged with algae, said they, too, were frustrated. Phosphorus levels have declined considerably \u2014 a total of about 70 percent between 1998 and 2015 \u2014 but the largest reductions took place before Mr. Pruitt became attorney general, as wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and more poultry farmers have shipped chicken waste for proper disposal. Still, the levels remain far above the state standard and the decline in pollution has been slower than some hoped. \u201cI want an attorney general \u2014 and a head of our E.P.A. \u2014 who is not averse to protecting Oklahoma\u2019s most outstanding waterways,\u201d said Ed Brocksmith, who is a co-founder of a group called Save the Illinois River . At the same time that he was retreating from his predecessor\u2019s more aggressive approach, Mr. Pruitt sent a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists and then put on his state government stationary, open records obtained by The New York Times in 2014 showed. The letters pressed the federal government to back down on proposals to tighten controls over energy production, such as oil and gas wells that can release planet-warming methane. Photo Ed Brocksmith near the Illinois River, which he crosses several time a day. He said he wanted a state attorney general and head of the Environmental Protection Agency who was \u201cnot averse to protecting Oklahoma\u2019s most outstanding waterways.\u201d Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Times Mr. Pruitt separately filed a series of lawsuits against the federal government, challenging regulations intended to reduce the discharge of poisonous mercury from coal-burning power plants, carbon dioxide blamed for climate change and other emissions that federal authorities argued were causing unsightly haze in Oklahoma\u2019s air. In total, Mr. Pruitt filed 14 lawsuits challenging federal environmental regulations. In 13 of those cases, the co-parties included companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to Pruitt-affiliated political campaign committees. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pruitt separately has served as a leader of the Republican Attorneys General Association , which since 2013 has collected $4.2 million from fossil-fuel related companies , including Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries, Murray Energy and Southern Company, which in many cases have also supported the lawsuits he has filed. Given the scale of his regulatory challenges, Mr. Pruitt turned to major corporate law firms, which typically defend energy companies fighting these laws, for help. In some cases, that assistance was offered free. BakerHostetler, the Cleveland-based law firm whose clients have included dozens of energy industry players, assigned five of its lawyers to help Oklahoma overturn President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, intended to combat climate change. The law firm did not charge Oklahoma anything for the work, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office confirmed. David B. Rivkin Jr., the lead attorney from BakerHostetler who handled the matter , said that the work was considered charitable, similar to when major law firms give free legal advice to inmates at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay military prison. Environmentalists scoffed. \u201cThe industries and companies, through their corporate lawyers, are renting the state\u2019s seal in order to make it look like their self-interested arguments are being made by Scott Pruitt on behalf of a state,\u201d said David Doniger, director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Counsel. \u201cIt is a disgrace.\u201d Even federal judges are skeptical. Mr. Pruitt joined with Missouri and several other mostly rural states in one federal suit to beat back California\u2019s regulations requiring egg farms, including those in Oklahoma, that wanted to sell in the state to seek more humane treatment of hens. In rejecting the suit, the federal judge admonished the plaintiffs. \u201cThe court concludes plaintiffs have not brought this action on behalf of their interest in the physical or economic well-being of their residents in general,\u201d Judge Kimberly J. Mueller of the United States District Court wrote in her 2014 opinion , \u201cbut rather on behalf of a discrete group of egg farmers whose businesses will allegedly be impacted.\u201d ",

My husband is a court officer and volunteers in the police force. [ President Obama ] didn\u2019t support law enforcement the way he did the community that felt they were being unjustly treated.

Home: Chattanooga, Tenn. Trump\u2019s not a perfect man, by any means. He kind of reminds me of my ex-husband. I think he\u2019s a really good man, deep down. This guy has such potential, and I truly believe he cares about our country and wants to help everyone. I do read things on occasion that he tweets and I think, oh my word. I wish I could have had 10 minutes with him. Listen, Donald, you need to straighten up and stop with this foolishness. What he said about women was disrespectful . But I don\u2019t get offended like some people do. You get through the bad and you focus on the good. Basically these were our choices, and I felt he was the better choice, and I had to overlook the negatives and focus on the positives. At the very beginning of this election, I was leaning toward Bernie Sanders. I looked at all the candidates, what were their ideas to help our country out of debt and make our military strong and be there for our vets. I have so many friends whose health care costs have doubled and are having to get extra jobs just to pay their insurance. And I read all these things about people where their religious liberties are not being taken seriously. _____ \u2018He Knows How to Build Things\u2019 Voter: Deb Alighire, 44. Engineer and program manager at Mopar, a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Home: Clarkston, Mich. I\u2019m very focused on bringing the plants back. In metro Detroit, waiters usually were younger people and during the time of hardship, the bankruptcies, it was very striking to me to go to a Papa Gino\u2019s and have a middle-aged man being a waiter. Usually these people would have some kind of job related to the automotive industry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I\u2019m super excited about Trump. I believe he knows how to build things. My dad worked at a coal power plant for 39 years and they\u2019re freaked out about energy changing too quickly. I\u2019m also concerned about immigration. I went to Minnesota and I had a Somali cabdriver who lectured me for 35 minutes to the airport about how women in America have too much freedom. My thought process on that is that I don\u2019t like seeing people going through the hardship they go through, but I don\u2019t want to go backwards in the feminist movement, either. _____ Taylor Davis Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times Daughter of Engineers Voter: Taylor Davis, 27.

Both my parents are engineers. My mom was an engineer long before many women in the field. When the economy started faltering, she went from a very high position at Pratt & Whitney to being unemployed for a year, and that was heartbreaking. I think that Trump really cares about having high-skilled jobs back here, not necessarily the service industry. Do I think Trump\u2019s trying to send women back to the kitchen? No, his daughter is a great example . She ran the women-who-work campaign long before he ran for president. _____ Didn\u2019t Like Him, Until a Rally Voter: Robin Mueller, 42. Preschool teacher.

Since my husband is in the military, I was concerned about having someone who didn\u2019t have military experience, didn\u2019t have the knowledge of dealing with world leaders. And I kind of thought he had a big mouth. But I had an 8-year-old who was totally on the Trump train. He talked me into taking him to a Trump rally. I expected him to be like what I\u2019d seen on the news, saying hateful things. But his presence was very calming and I liked his talking points. We really are the middle class, and we kind of get swept aside. The first time she ran against Obama, I was all on board for Hillary Clinton. I really wanted to have a female president. I think that\u2019s important. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s her. In the past, her stance on abortion was more the way I feel, just for the first trimester, then she did a 360. She was here in the primary, having a debate with Bernie Sanders. He answered the question honestly. When they asked her the same question, she kind of danced around it. Then she went on \u201cThe View\u201d and said she was for late-term abortions. Just take a stance, be honest. Same thing as with gay marriage, she wasn\u2019t for it, then she was. I\u2019m 100 percent for it. It\u2019s ridiculous the way we tell people who they can and cannot marry. Don\u2019t go back and forth. Don\u2019t pander. Advertisement I voted for Obama the last time. I don\u2019t agree with a lot of what he said, but I felt he was honest. _____ A Racist? \u2018You Don\u2019t Know Me\u2019 Voter: Katie Holder, 39. Owns a weight-loss business. Home: Gulf Shores, Ala. I feel very, very badly for the people who are very scared for their way of life. From what I\u2019m understanding, he\u2019s only really wanting illegal immigrants that have committed crimes to be deported, which I agree with. I feel bad for the lesbian and gay and transsexual community that fear for their way of life. From what I understand, he says he\u2019s not going to mess with that. Somebody called me a racist because I did vote for Trump. Hold on, you don\u2019t know me. Doesn\u2019t that make you a racist by calling me a racist when you don\u2019t know me? I\u2019m looking for a brighter future for me and my children, and honestly I felt l like our country was kind of at risk if we did elect Hillary. _____ Victoria Czapski Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times No Time for Political Correctness Voter: Victoria Czapski, 45. Works in education. Home: Sterling Heights, Mich. I felt he had what it would take to get the country back on track. Being P.C. was going to kill the country. He speaks his mind and because of that, he\u2019s not going to lie to you. I don\u2019t want immigrants, accepting them without doing the background checks. Are these people terrorists ? I don\u2019t want to live in a country where we have to worry about going to the movie theater or the mall. Let\u2019s be on the offensive, versus the defensive. We are a country based on immigrants. But I believe they should go through the process. My great-grandparents came here, they had to learn English. This is a Christian country. The whole bending over backwards. He says what everyone\u2019s thinking and is afraid to say. That doesn\u2019t make anyone bigoted. I\u2019m not saying there are people out there who shouldn\u2019t be helped. I worked in the inner cities. They\u2019re on welfare. They make a certain amount of money and everything gets taken away. That amount of money is so low that they have no incentive to work. Why don\u2019t you allow them to gradually earn more money? Find a way to help people get over the hump. _____ Can\u2019t Put Him in a Box Voter: Pam Cornett, 46. Formerly self-employed, now working in customer service. Home: Chattanooga, Tenn. I voted for Trump because I wanted change. I feel like our economy has totally tanked. People do not have disposable income. I feel the last eight years have been a joke. Obama was out for himself. I don\u2019t think he really respected the office. I think it was more about him being a celebrity than a president. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump\u2019s a successful businessman, and I feel like that\u2019s what America needs to bring our economy back. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is really Republican, to be quite honest with you. He\u2019s not in a box. One of the most attractive things to me is he can\u2019t be boxed. He wants to bring America back to what it was before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s taking us back to women have no rights or slavery days. _____ Paula Filar Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times He Was Egregious, but She Lied Voter: Paula Filar, 71. Retired business owner. Home: Shelby Township, Mich. I thought if he would only have kept his mouth shut during the primary. About the way people looked, about their size. Really? About McCain. I mean, really? All of it was so egregious. I hated it, I cringed. All of that was bad, but it didn\u2019t stop me. And it\u2019s like Hillary has the right to talk about Trump when she stayed with a guy who was in the White House and took advantage of a young intern? Why would you stay with him? Benghazi. The emails . The I.R.S. She\u2019s a liar. The Clintons got wealthy because of their position. I\u2019d rather have someone there who doesn\u2019t need the money. He\u2019s got a message. He\u2019s going to make a change. Her message was all him. All negative ads. I spent a long time in the staffing industry here, worked with the automotive industry. We weren\u2019t competitive. That\u2019s got to be turned around. We have to have incentives for companies to keep their work here. _____ Voter: Tangie Wooden, 44. Learning facilitator for Blue Cross of Tennessee. Home: Ringgold, Ga. When Trump became my only choice, I felt he was the lesser of two evils. I had major issues with Hillary as far as ethics was concerned. It seems she feels that she is above the law and nothing ever seems to stick. I didn\u2019t particularly like everything he was saying as far as building a wall, and doing this to immigrants. I looked at that more as bravado, his audience needed that to get the applause. But there are allegations about killing people who get in her way \u2014 Vince Foster, people like that. Someone who has a big bravado is not as concerning to me as someone who might kill people who get in her way. _____ Voter: Kasia Riddle, 43. Substitute teacher. Home: Murfreesboro, Tenn. I run my household like a business, my classroom like a business. I expect him to run the country in such a manner. You don\u2019t pay more money out than you have. You want to have your budget under control. You want to know the people you\u2019re working with are above average. You want to pick the people based on what they can do, not on what they did for you. He\u2019s not getting large amounts from donors based on what you\u2019ll do for me later. _____ Guzin Karides Credit Julia Rendleman for The New York Times A Voice for Women Voter: Guzin Karides, 49. Homemaker, former attorney. Home: Virginia Beach I laughed Trump off like everyone else did. Once I stopped laughing at him and started listening, I started to support him. I felt like once you got past the bluster, he really was interested in helping everyone. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I do think having a secure border is very important. My father was a Muslim immigrant from Turkey, he went through the process. I don\u2019t agree with a ban on Muslims, but my father was very wary of Muslims who came over if they didn\u2019t have a reason to be here. He would support a full vetting, but not a total ban. I have always considered myself a feminist. For me, I want to be treated the exact same way. That\u2019s not the feel I get from feminists today, they want extra privileges. I gave up my first marriage so I could be a law partner and then I had to give up on my partnership so I could be a better mom. To say women are going backwards would be wrong. Look at how much Trump hires women, how much he does rely on women, how much he relies on his own daughter. I\u2019m sort of amazed by her. She may pull him more into the middle. She\u2019ll be a good voice for women.

    "text": "Jolted by Deaths, Obama Found His Voice on Race Tensions across the country prompted the president to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and YAMICHE ALCINDOR JAN. 14, 2017 WASHINGTON \u2014 Only weeks after 70 million Americans chose a black man for president, shattering a racial barrier that had stood for the entirety of the nation\u2019s 232-year history, no one in the White House, especially the man in the Oval Office, wanted to talk about race. President Obama had made a pragmatic calculation in January 2009, as the financial crisis drove communities across the United States toward economic collapse. Whatever he did for African-Americans, whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others, he would not describe as efforts to specifically help Black America. Mr. Obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of African-Americans \u2014 and knowing that no matter what he did, it would not be seen as enough. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018They are going to hate us one day,\u2019\u201d said Melody Barnes, who is black and served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first domestic policy adviser, recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president. \u201cI knew that we couldn\u2019t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations.\u201d Continue reading the main story The fear inside the West Wing was that promoting a \u201cblack agenda\u201d and aiming programs directly at African-Americans at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash \u2014 the kind that, years later, White House officials would view as helping to elect Donald J. Trump. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAt a minimum, that would have been tone deaf,\u201d said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as the nation\u2019s first African-American attorney general during much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201cand at worst, would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do.\u201d Mr. Obama, who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, wanted to be the president of all America. Framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering, he thought. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to lift the economy over all,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in the summer of 2009 when he was asked about doing more to help African-Americans recover economically. Video Obama\u2019s Evolving Approach to Race President Obama\u2019s comments on racial issues in America changed from an initial reticence to a final bluntness. Michael D. Shear looks back on how his tone shifted during his presidency. Publish Date January 14, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed But over the next seven and a half years, racial tensions across the country forced Mr. Obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. Ultimately he led a national conversation on race ignited by spasms of violence \u2014 police shootings and protests in Florida, South Carolina, Missouri and elsewhere. Inside the White House, aides recall them as among his most painful moments as president. \u201cAfter my election there was talk of a post-racial America,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his farewell speech on Tuesday in Chicago, reflecting on the threat that racial strife poses for the country\u2019s democratic ideals. \u201cSuch a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d After he leaves office, Mr. Obama will continue that conversation in work for My Brother\u2019s Keeper and other programs to help black youths. There is plenty to do. As much as his once-unthinkable presidency has inspired and empowered African-Americans, black unemployment is still about double that for whites. Nearly a quarter of blacks are living in poverty, almost the same as in 1976. \u201cHe made it seem like everything was all good, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Thelonious Stokes, 21, a black artist whose experiences of being racially profiled in Chicago left him jaded about the state of race relations. \u201cWe almost needed Trump to show the true state of America.\u201d The \u2018Beer Summit\u2019 Backlash Continue reading the main story Photo From left, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Sgt. James Crowley of the Cambridge, Mass., police and Mr. Obama gathered at the White House in 2009 for a meeting that became known as the beer summit. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Mr. Obama\u2019s earliest public reflection about race as president backfired. Asked about a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a friend of Mr. Obama\u2019s who was arrested in July 2009 trying to enter his own house by a white officer, Mr. Obama immediately took sides. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt is fair to say,\u201d the president said six days after the arrest at a prime-time news conference, \u201cthat the Cambridge police acted stupidly.\u201d Those words \u2014 and the frenzied reaction to them \u2014 helped deepen the caution about racial issues inside the White House. For days, the president\u2019s critique of the arresting officer dominated the news and the morning staff meetings in the West Wing. Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, was especially agitated, his colleagues recalled, and argued that the White House had to do something to change the subject. Mr. Gibbs succeeded in pushing for what the news media quickly labeled a \u201cbeer summit\u201d on the edge of the Rose Garden in the White House, where Mr. Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, joined Mr. Obama over beer for a discussion . \u201cIt had to be cauterized in a way that it would stop leading the news,\u201d Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s closest adviser, conceded. Professor Gates, for one, was pleased. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody but Barack Obama would have thought about bringing us together,\u201d he said at the time. As a candidate for president in 2008, Mr. Obama had drawn praise for confronting racial divisions during a powerful speech he delivered about his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who had characterized the United States as fundamentally racist and the government as corrupt. \u201cThe profound mistake of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It\u2019s that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress had been made,\u201d Mr. Obama said that March day in Philadelphia, urging people to move beyond old racial wounds. \u201cLet us be our brother\u2019s keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister\u2019s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.\u201d The Obama Era Articles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought to the nation, and how the presidency has changed him.

But the beer summit was deeply disturbing to many of the president\u2019s African-American advisers, who thought he should not have backed down. The officer had acted stupidly, they thought, and the nation\u2019s first black president ought to be able to say so. The meeting \u201cwas demeaning and diminished his leadership and his voice at that moment,\u201d one of them recalled, asking for anonymity to bluntly discuss the topic. \u201cPeople thought we were being punked. I got so many emails, so many phone calls from people I respected: \u2018He was right. Why are you backpedaling?\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inside the West Wing, the impact was clear. Mr. Obama would have to be more cautious when it came to racial issues, particularly ahead of the 2012 re-election campaign. The issue of race was too divisive at a time when Mr. Obama needed to emphasize inclusion. \u201cWhat it did teach us is that you just have to be careful about the words that you choose,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you shy away from issues that arise that deal with race, just as he didn\u2019t shy away from Reverend Wright. But you have to be sensitive to a long history of people reacting strongly to the topic.\u201d Outside the White House, people noticed, too: \u201cHe plainly arrested him because he was black,\u201d said Edward G. Robinson Sr., who is black and works at a box factory in Cleveland. Mr. Obama \u201cbacktracked because he wanted to be everybody\u2019s president.\u201d Like others, Mr. Robinson said the president was met with racially motivated disrespect in Washington, and pointed to the moment when a white Republican lawmaker yelled, \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the president during a congressional address. The White House would go on to publish reports about its efforts to help African-Americans, including details about the impact that the Affordable Care Act was having to help poor blacks. But Mr. Obama rarely talked about race publicly during the next few years. A Personal Connection Continue reading the main story Photo Protesters in New York\u2019s Union Square in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The president\u2019s voice was shaking with emotion. \u201cIf I had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin,\u201d Mr. Obama told Ms. Jarrett and David Plouffe, his senior adviser and former campaign manager, as the three talked in the Oval Office about what the president should say publicly about the death of the 17-year-old African-American at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. \u201cI am going to say that.\u201d It was March 2012, nearly three years after the beer summit. The specter of that meeting still hovered and Mr. Obama was, in a sense, taking sides again. But in personalizing the shooting, his aides recalled, Mr. Obama\u2019s hope was that people might view African-African boys differently if they saw Trayvon through the president\u2019s own eyes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama headed out to the Rose Garden, announced his nomination of a new World Bank president, then took the question from a reporter that everyone knew was coming: \u201cCan you comment on the Trayvon Martin case, sir?\u201d Mr. Obama called it a tragedy , said he was glad the Justice Department was looking into it, reflected on how the nation was doing necessary soul searching and then concluded: \u201cBut my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. If I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u2019\u2019 Moments after Mr. Obama returned to the Oval Office, Gene Sperling, one of his top economic advisers, stopped by with tears in his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what that will mean to my son,\u201d Mr. Sperling, who is white and is married to an African-American woman, told the president, according to a colleague who was there at the time. One of President Obama\u2019s lasting legacies may be the symbolic impact on the generation for whom \u201cpresident of the United States\u201d has always referred to a black man. This time, the president\u2019s comments were embraced by many outside the White House, too. Media reports focused on the emotion Mr. Obama had displayed \u2014 rare for a politician whose usual demeanor was cool and professorial. \u201cFor him to say things like that in front of the entire country and the world, I think sends a strong message to people,\u201d Ryan Shultz, 33, an art teacher in Chicago who is white, said in a recent interview. But others viewed the president\u2019s comments that day as a continuing affront to police officers and a saw in them a willingness to take sides in the racial debate. For at least one person, it went further. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine parishioners in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, later said he was inspired to kill because of media coverage of Trayvon\u2019s shooting. \u201cCrime is still bad and police are still shooting black people left and right,\u201d Mr. Shultz said. \u201cI live in Chicago \u2014 a murder capital of the United States \u2014 and it\u2019s crazy and it hasn\u2019t gotten that much better, I don\u2019t think.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Photo The police and demonstrators clashed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 after a white officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014. Only minutes before, Mr. Obama had arrived on Martha\u2019s Vineyard for his summer vacation, which would soon be dominated by how to respond to the racial violence that Mr. Brown\u2019s death unleashed. The president and his aides, including Mr. Holder and Ms. Jarrett, who were also vacationing on the island, made urgent calls to Missouri\u2019s governor, state police officials and civil rights leaders. They debated whether Mr. Obama should go to Ferguson, and decided against it, knowing that a presidential visit would be disruptive. Mr. Holder would go instead .

Privacy Policy But the more urgent question for the three of them was how to weigh in. The president was wary of putting his thumb on the scale in a case destined to be investigated by the federal authorities. But it was just as clear that tensions between the police and African-Americans were increasing \u2014 not only in Ferguson, but also around the country. If Mr. Obama wasn\u2019t the right person to step into that issue, who was? \u201cYou want to try to calm the situation,\u201d Mr. Holder said, recalling the discussions he had with the president and Ms. Jarrett about what to say. \u201cYou want to reassure the community that an investigation will be done and done fully. But you want to make sure that the people in law enforcement know it is done fairly.\u201d \u201cThere was that trust gap,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was something that had to be dealt with.\u201d As the violence worsened, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama and Ms. Jarrett concluded that the president needed to denounce the violence \u2014 and at the same time criticize the police for their conduct during the protests. \u201cThere is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,\u201d the president said in a televised statement on Aug. 14 from Edgartown, Mass. But he added, \u201cThere\u2019s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.\u201d Photo A demonstrator asking Mr. Obama to visit Missouri during the unrest there. The president instead sent his attorney general to represent the administration. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times For the rest of his presidency, Mr. Obama would strive for the balance he struck in his remarks that day: empathy and understanding for African-Americans and support for the police and the rule of law. But however he weighed in, the events in Ferguson made clear that he could no longer hang back and instead had to lead a national debate about race, violence and unity. \u201cOnce it was so in America\u2019s face, police brutality, it blew the circuit,\u201d said Bill Burton, an African-American who served as deputy White House press secretary during the first term. \u201cIt made it possible to have that conversation that our country had actively not been having.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inevitably, Mr. Obama\u2019s striving for balance often left him vilified by both sides. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, rebuked Mr. Obama for not being \u201chelpful\u201d in discussing police tactics from his vacation. Years later, Mr. Pasco told NPR that the president often struck the wrong tone when he talked about race and policing. \u201cThe president has never been a police officer. He\u2019s never walked in a police officer\u2019s shoes,\u201d Mr. Pasco said last July. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a breakdown in communication more than there is a breakdown in insincerity or intent.\u201d Ja\u2019Mal Green, a 21-year-old Black Lives Matter activist based in Chicago, said he thought Mr. Obama \u201cignored\u201d the calls of organizers for federal policy and funding aimed at stopping police brutality. Mr. Green said he also grew tired of hearing Mr. Obama couple his grief for families in racially charged shooting episodes with statements supporting white police officers. \u201cHe is trying to walk a neutral line and he wants to please both sides,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cHe wants to please black people and then he wants to please police supporters and police officers and police unions. But sometimes you have to pick a side in situations. You need to pick your time when you fight for home or you\u2019ll just have everybody hating you.\u2019\u201d Mr. Stokes, the 21-year-old artist from Chicago, felt similarly disappointed. \u201cChicago is the exact same,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cHe simply opened up, maybe, a lane for young men like me to just maybe be accepted a little bit more to people that don\u2019t accept educated black people. But that\u2019s it, literally. White America is still running everything, and that means that nothing is changing.\u201d A Time for Grace Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Obama embraced Eliana Pinckney at a memorial service for her father, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Less than a year after Mr. Brown\u2019s death in Ferguson, on June 17, 2015, nine African-American parishioners, including a pastor, were gunned down by a 21-year-old white supremacist during a church meeting in Charleston. Two days later, the victims\u2019 families addressed Mr. Roof , the gunman, at a court hearing, where one by one they forgave him. \u201cYou took something very precious away from me,\u201d Nadine Collier, the daughter of 70-year-old Ethel Lance, told Mr. Roof, as her voice rose in anguish. \u201cI will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\u201d It was an extraordinary scene, broadcast live on television, which moved many who saw it to tears. Mr. Obama was traveling and did not see it in real time, but when Eric Schultz, the deputy press secretary, read Ms. Collier\u2019s words out loud to Mr. Obama on Marine One , the presidential helicopter, the president was awed by what he heard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s what we need to recognize here, the ability of people to forgive on the worst day of their lives.\u2019 It really struck him,\u201d Ms Jarrett recalled. \u201cWe sat there and talked about it on the helicopter. About that quality, the amazing grace.\u201d Later, in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama struggled with his chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, to come up with the right words for a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor of the Charleston church and a friend of the president\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say,\u201d Mr. Keenan told Mr. Obama, according to Ms. Jarrett. \u201cYou\u2019ve said everything that one could possibly say on the subject.\u201d Eventually, the president decided that instead of talking about guns he would talk about what black churches stood for and the meaning of grace. \u201cIt would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again,\u201d the president told a hushed audience at the memorial service. \u201cOnce the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual \u2014 that\u2019s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society. To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change \u2014 that\u2019s how we lose our way again.\u201d The week before, during a podcast interview with Marc Maron , the comedian, Mr. Obama had caused a minor stir by using the word \u201cnigger\u201d in answering a question about race relations. He knew it would cause a ripple, an aide with him recalled, but he shrugged. At the beginning of his term, the podcast could have caused a fury and Mr. Obama might have pulled back again. But events in the country \u2014 especially the deaths of young black men \u2014 had given him more opportunities to engage the topic. Mr. Pinckney\u2019s funeral was one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to just whistle in the wind,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a chance to talk to people when they are ready to hear him. He doesn\u2019t ignore moments.\u201d Advertisement ",

By Robert Costa and Philip Rucker January 14 at 4:32 PM Follow @costareports Follow @PhilipRucker Running for president, Donald Trump promised an immediate revolution \u2014 to quickly rebuild America\u2019s cities, overhaul the tax code and deport millions of illegal immigrants. Just this week, Trump vowed to get started right away on building a wall along the border with Mexico (\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait\u201d) and repealing and replacing President Obama\u2019s health-care law (\u201cprobably the same day, could be the same hour\u201d). But ahead of his swearing-in on Friday, the extraordinarily high expectations that Trump has set have been running into the logjam known as American democracy. Every new president confronts Washington\u2019s sluggish culture, but Trump\u2019s more grandiose and hard-line ideas could face unprecedented challenges \u2014 logistical and even constitutional. Trump imagines a presidency of vision and velocity, but his big-ticket goals cannot be achieved by presidential edict, no matter how loud Trump\u2019s demands might be or how assured he is of the popularity of his proposals. They will require consensus on Capitol Hill that emerges from a deliberative process that requires time and the navigation of a labyrinth of constituencies and special interests. Trump\u2019s team has devised a full legislative calendar with congressional leaders that begins with health care, but already, Trump\u2019s ambitions have been slowed somewhat. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate are moving swiftly to dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act but are still discussing how exactly to replace it. A House vote Friday on a budget measure, which included steps to begin repealing the health law, was preceded by hours of skittishness among conservative and moderate members alike about whether Republicans were moving too soon. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Similarly, a spending package to construct roads, bridges and airports \u2014 a priority for leaders of both political parties \u2014 could become bogged down by squabbles over disbursement. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government was built for speed,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who, as Senate majority whip, is the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican. \u201cThings always happen more slowly than you want when you\u2019re in the majority and trying to get something done.\u201d Several Trump advisers acknowledge that congressional procedures dictate that \u201cthe wheels of change move slowly,\u201d as one put it. But Kellyanne Conway, the incoming White House counselor, said she was confident that Trump\u2019s agenda will gain momentum. \u201cThe Trump effect on Washington, D.C., is not going to be a fresh coat of paint on a rusty structure,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of a gut renovation.\u201d Conway predicted that Trump will bring new energy to a city that has operated at a \u201cglacial pace,\u201d as well as \u201cinfuse levels of accountability, metrics and deliverables in a system that seems to lack if not abhor all three of those things.\u201d Yet, for a man who has spent his career as his own boss \u2014 calling shots and inking transactions, running his world from the 26th floor of Trump Tower \u2014 the art of the deal may soon yield to the art of patience. \u201cHe\u2019s never had a boss in his whole life. It will be a sobering reality to have 535 bosses here \u2014 and more to the point, more than 200\u00a0million bosses scattered across the country,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.). \u201cPatience becomes a virtue as one moves from the business world into the body politic.\u201d (The Washington Post) [ In Trump\u2019s Washington, rival power centers and whispers in the president\u2019s ear ] There have been some signs that Trump is starting to internalize his new surroundings. At his news conference Wednesday, Trump said he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs producer that God ever created\u201d \u2014 but then conceded that an economic revival depends not only on his hard work, but also on \u201ca little bit of luck.\u201d The tempo is sure to frustrate Trump. It also risks making him appear ineffective to the masses of voters who bought into his campaign persona as a successful dealmaker and strongman who could blow up Washington and \u2014 seemingly overnight \u2014 better the lives of everyday Americans. Trump\u2019s inner circle is grappling with how to manage expectations and are looking for ways to demonstrate quick action and claim early victories. Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u2014 who spent 12 years in the House before being elected Indiana\u2019s governor and is intimately familiar with the volatility of Congress \u2014 has been central in those talks, according to senior transition officials. There are areas where Trump\u2019s incoming administration sees opportunity to act unilaterally, such as in negotiating trade deals or lifting Obama-era regulations. Trump plans a series of executive actions on a wide range of topics in his first days in office, and he told reporters he wants to have daily bill-signing ceremonies in his first two weeks. Trump also plans in those weeks to announce his pick for the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination is expected to consume partisans on both sides and could take several months to reach confirmation. Another roadblock: public resistance and protests, in particular on immigration, as well as potential resistance among more mainstream Republicans \u2014 including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 to Trump\u2019s most controversial proposals, such as a federal deportation force. [ \u2018I will give you everything.\u2019 Here are 282 of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises. ] \u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Ryan said Thursday when asked about such a force during a CNN town hall forum. Rep. Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.) said, \u201cTrump\u2019s going to come up to the reality of the Republican Senate, which is full of people who have supported immigration reform.\u201d Trump associates privately say that any blame for delay or inaction on the meatier agenda items could be directed at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House: the Capitol. Even as they commended him for tapping into the deep dissatisfaction that Americans feel about the political system \u2014 and Congress specifically \u2014 some Republican lawmakers said they were concerned that Trump has created expectations too great to meet. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Trump could be \u201cgiving false hope to people and, frankly, undercutting a system that works.\u201d \u201cHe needs to inform the American people that, \u2018Yes, I want to drain the swamp, but there is a process in place that was set long before I got here that I think serves the country well,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Graham said. One victim of Trump\u2019s rapid-fire approach to legislating, Democrats say, could be bipartisanship. \u201cThe approach they are taking seems to be explicitly partisan and to try to run as fast as they can,\u201d said Phil Schiliro, who served as White House legislative affairs director during President Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cBut I think there will probably be brakes on the system. It\u2019s just the nature of legislation, the way House and Senate legislators work.\u201d Republican congressional leaders are delicately balancing Trump\u2019s vocal push, and their own desire for rapid change, with the dynamics confronting them in their chambers. In Trump, they see opportunity to pass a raft of legislation and a willing partner as long as the relationship is continually cultivated. Conway said that in meetings with Pence last week, Republican lawmakers found Trump\u2019s leadership style \u201cfascinating\u201d and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can jump on board and keep up.\u201d [ Trump acknowledges Russian hacking even as he attacks U.S. intelligence community ] Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) shrug off Trump\u2019s missives on Twitter and play up their phone calls and meetings with him. They echo his rhetoric about the pace, even as they quietly mention caveats that could delay passage \u2014 anything to keep Trump at ease with an institution he once disdained and is now getting to know. For instance, Ryan has taken care to stay \u201cin complete sync,\u201d as he said Thursday, with the incoming administration. Ryan invited Trump and Pence to speak at a party retreat in Philadelphia this month and hosted top Trump advisers in recent days for an hours-long dinner of pasta and salad in his office to begin discussions on tax reform. \u201cWe agree; we want to make sure we move these things concurrently,\u201d Ryan said when asked about the timing of a replacement for the health-care law. But, he noted, the House will \u201cdo this the way Congress is supposed to work.\u201d For initial policy changes, Republicans are going to use a process called budget reconciliation \u2014 where only a simple majority is needed. But not all parts of the health law can be removed in that fashion, and many other issues will most likely require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. Republicans control the Senate by 52 seats to 48. In pushing to move quickly, Republicans also run the risk of being accused of hypocrisy. Republicans fiercely criticized Obama as moving too rapidly to pass the 2010 health-care law, which was the subject of 14 months of debate as Democrats tried, and failed, to attract GOP support. The Senate held 100 days of hearings and other reviews on the matter, and the House held 79, according to Schiliro. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, extraordinarily complicated issue,\u201d Schiliro said. \u201cA new law can\u2019t be put in by fiat.\u201d Nevertheless, rank-and-file Republicans like what they are hearing from Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to exhort a molasses-like institution to act more quickly,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). \u201cWhen you\u2019re the coach of the team, you always emphasize speed. But how fast the players go is how fast the players go. The coach can only do so much.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Born when a Qing dynasty emperor was on the throne, he went on to help invent the Pinyin writing system used for transliterating the Chinese alphabet. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Zhou Youguang sits at home in Beijing, in 2015. Born when a Qing dynasty emperor was on the throne, he went on to help invent the Pinyin writing system used for transliterating the Chinese alphabet. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Zhou Youguang, the inventor of a system to convert Chinese characters into words with the Roman alphabet, died Saturday at the age of 111. Since his system was introduced nearly six decades ago, few innovations have done more to boost literacy rates in China and bridge the divide between the country and the West. Pinyin, which was adopted by China in 1958, gave readers unfamiliar with Chinese characters a crucial tool to understand how to pronounce them. These characters do not readily disclose information on how to say them aloud \u2014 but with such a system as Pinyin, those characters more easily and clearly yield their meaning when converted into languages like English and Spanish, which use the Roman alphabet. At 105, Chinese Linguist Now A Government Critic While it was not the first system to Romanize Chinese, Pinyin has become the most widely accepted. For Chinese speakers, many of whom speak disparate dialects, its broad acceptance made education easier, giving instructors a single, relatively simple instrument to teach people how to read. Beyond China's borders, Pinyin allowed the standardization of Chinese names. For instance, it's a big reason why the name Westerners commonly use for the Chinese capital shifted from \"Peking\" to \"Beijing.\" And it's why many other such names changed dramatically along with it. And yet Zhou, the man behind one of the most important linguistic innovations in the 20th century, said he was reluctant when asked by the Chinese government to take on the task in the mid-1950s. At the time, he was an economic scholar, only recently returned to China after a stint working on Wall Street in the U.S. He had come back to the country after its 1949 Communist revolution. Article continues after sponsorship \"I said I was an amateur, a layman, I couldn't do the job,\" he told NPR in 2011 , laughing. \"But they said, it's a new job, everybody is an amateur. Everybody urged me to change professions, so I did. So from 1955, I abandoned economics and started studying writing systems.\" Zhou (shown here in New York in 1947) worked on Wall Street, but he returned to China in 1949 after the Communist revolution. Less than a decade after this photo was taken, he went to work on the system that would become Pinyin. Courtesy Zhou Youguang hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Zhou Youguang The committee Zhou led spent three years working on its alphabetic system. \"People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters,\" he told the BBC in 2012. Others took the committee's invention very seriously, however. The Communist government of China introduced Pinyin in schools in 1958. The international community eventually adopted it as the standard romanization for Chinese writing, as well, with the U.N. doing so in 1986. Before Pinyin, 85 percent of Chinese people could not read, according to the BBC. Now, UNICEF says the literacy rate in China hovers at about 95 percent. Lately, Pinyin has also been integral in determining the ways mobile phones and computers transmit Chinese characters. Still, despite the broad acceptance of his system, Zhou went on to become something of a thorn in the side of the country's Communist government. During the Cultural Revolution, in the '60s and '70s, Zhou drew the scrutiny of the Communist Party. In 1969, he was even labeled a \"reactionary academic authority\" and exiled to a labor camp for more than two years, reports The New York Times . But he was not dissuaded from speaking his mind for long. As he aged, he became more vocal about his dissatisfaction with the powers that be. And, as Louisa Lim noted for NPR, Zhou was not afraid to use his stature to point out discrepancies he found in Communist Party doctrine. \"In 1985, he translated the Encyclopaedia Britannica into Chinese and then worked on the second edition \u2014 placing him in a position to notice the U-turns in China's official line. At the time of the original translation, China's position was that the U.S. started the Korean War \u2014 but the encyclopedia said North Korea was to blame, Zhou recalls. \" 'That was troublesome, so we didn't include that bit. Later, the Chinese view changed. So we got permission from above to include it. That shows there's progress in China,' he says, adding, 'But it's too slow.' \" For a man born in 1906, under China's final dynasty, Zhou did more than most to help encourage the change he wished to see in his country. Though he died Saturday after more than a century of life, he is survived by the system he helped father, which continues to live on around the world. Clarification: This post has been updated to make clearer the fact that Pinyin was not the first system of Romanization. ",

(Photo: Krzysztof Zatycki, AP) Polish leaders\u00a0celebrated the arrival of U.S. troops Saturday as part of a NATO deployment that has drawn criticism from Russia. \u201cWe have waited for you for a very long time,\u201d Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said during a ceremony in the western Polish town of Zagan, the Associated Press\u00a0reported. Some 3,000 American troops are being deployed in Poland and six other countries under NATO's \u201cOperation Atlantic Resolve,\u201d which was launched after Russia's takeover of Crimea in 2014. The Polish arrival ceremony comes more than two decades after the last Soviet troops left the country and just ahead of the swearing in of President-elect Donald Trump, who critics fear will embolden Russia. \u201cWe waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only one who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east,\u201d Macierewicz said. Russian President Vladimir Putin's\u00a0spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Thursday that\u00a0the foreign military buildup near its borders was inappropriate and that any other country would feel the same way. The operation marks the first time Western forces are being deployed on a continuous basis to NATO\u2019s eastern border. \"We interpret this as a threat to us and as actions that endanger our interests and our security,\" Peskov said, Russia's TASS news agency reported. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine put on edge many countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states\u00a0that were once under Soviet control. The U.S. deployment includes an armored brigade of 3,500 American troops from Fort Carson, Colo., more than 80 main battle tanks and hundreds of armored vehicles. The Polish government organized several events across the country to welcome the Americans, including in downtown Warsaw. \u201cThis is an important day for Poland, for Europe, for our common defense,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said, the AP reported.

    "text": "Email Protesters gathered Saturday to support immigrant rights at rallies around the U.S., denouncing President-elect Donald Trump for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and his pledges to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and to crack down on Muslims entering the country. A standing-room-only crowd packed into a historic African-American church in downtown Washington for one of dozens of rallies around the nation. \"We are not going to allow Donald Trump to bury the Statue of Liberty,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told participants in Washington. \"We are a nation for all people, regardless of religion, regardless of background, regardless of who you love.\" In Chicago, more than 1,000 people poured into a teachers' union hall to support immigrant rights and implore each other to fight for those rights against what they fear will be a hostile Trump administration. Ron Taylor, a pastor of a Chicago area Disciples for Christ Church and executive director of the United Congress of Community and Religious Organizations, told the audience there, \"Regardless of what happens in the coming days we know that good will conquer evil and we want to say to each and every one of you, you are not alone.\" The protests mark the latest chapter in a movement that has evolved since 2006, when more than a million people took to the streets to protest a Republican-backed immigration bill that would have made it a crime to be in the country illegally. The crowds this weekend at rallies or cultural events in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, California, and elsewhere, are expected to be nowhere near as big as then. Yet the line to enter Metropolitan AME Church in Washington stretched nearly a city block. People attending included immigrants who lack permission to be in the country and their relatives and supporters. Also present were elected officials, clergy and representatives of labor and women's groups. Participants carried signs with messages including \"Resist Trump's Hate\" and \"Tu, Yo, Todos Somos America,\" which translates to \"You, me, we all are America.\" \"I stand here because I have nothing to apologize for. I am not ashamed of my status because it is a constant reminder to myself that I have something to fight for,\" said Max Kim, 19, who was brought to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 6 and lacks legal permission to stay in the country. The Washington crowd urged Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress not to undo the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, aimed at helping people like Kim who were brought to the country as children. Michael Takada of the Japanese American Service Committee urged the Chicago audience to \"disrupt the deportation machine\" that he and others fear will ramp up when under the new president. He also urged them to keep a close eye on their local police departments and speak out if they see those departments help \"ICE to deport our community members.\" Dr. Bassam Osman, chair and co-founder of The Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, elicited one of the loudest cheers from the crowd when he called out the president-elect by name in one of the opening prayers. \"Lord, this land is your land, it is not Trump's land.\" While there was plenty of cheering, there was also uneasiness and fear of what's to come after Trump is sworn in. Rehab Alkadi, a 31-year-old mother of a young son who came to the United States four years ago from war-torn Syria, said she doesn't believe she can be deported because \"there is a war in Syria, but who knows. It's so scary, what Trump says,' she said. \"He said a lot of things bad about the Muslim people.\" Former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn attended the rally in a show of support for immigrants' rights. \"You see the fear in light of the rhetoric that Trump verbalized in the course of his campaign,\" he told a reporter. \"The idea of a registry for Muslim people is wrong and people want to stand up for that.\" President Barack Obama in 2012 launched an executive effort to protect some young immigrants from deportation, after multiple proposals failed in Congress. The creation of the DACA program was heralded as a good first step by advocates who hoped it would be a prelude toward overhauling immigration laws. But that didn't happen, and Republican-led states pushed back against Obama's plans to expand the program. Now the focus is on the next administration. As a candidate, Trump promised his supporters stepped-up deportations and a Mexican-funded border wall, but it is unclear which plans the celebrity businessman will act on first, and when. And many immigrants are fearful of the campaign rhetoric but less motivated to protest in the absence of specific actions. Many participants Saturday said they would keep the pressure on Trump and said they planned to participate in next Saturday's Women's March on Washington. \"The threat of deportation is imminent for our communities,\" said Cristina Jimenez, executive director of United We Dream and one of the rally's organizers. \"We will keep fighting. We're not going back into the shadows.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Don Babwin in Chicago contributed to this story. 0 Shares ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis January 14 at 6:52 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @brady_dennis In the past week, the Obama administration overturned a decades\u00ad-old policy toward Cuban immigrants, forged two major agreements to address racial bias in big-city police departments and approved an unexpected cut in mortgage rates for hundreds of thousands of low-income and first-time home buyers. Officials even made time, after years of lobbying, to add the rusty patched bumble bee to the list of endangered species. In the final days before President Obama leaves office, administration officials are rushing to complete dozens of tasks that will affect millions of lives and solidify the president\u2019s imprint on history. But in many cases, their permanence is uncertain, and President-elect Donald Trump is already pledging to undo some of them after taking office. \u201cHe is clearly using executive power aggressively and trying to do as much as possible in his final days,\u201d Princeton University history and public affairs professor Julian Zelizer said in an email. \u201cIt is clear that a president who was once reluctant to use the power of his own office has changed his heart, especially now that he sees a radically conservative Congress and Republican president-elect are getting ready to dismantle much of what he has done.\u201d On Thursday alone, the administration designated three new national monuments and expanded another two in sites ranging from a forest in the Pacific Northwest to a school for freed slaves in South Carolina; took away one of the special immigration privileges Cubans arriving in the United States without visas have enjoyed for 50 years; announced sanctions designations against 18 senior Syrian officials for their role in the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon in 2014 and 2015; awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Vice President Biden; and accused Fiat Chrysler of cheating on national emission standards for some of its diesel trucks. (The Washington Post) [ Obama beats FDR, creating and expanding most national monuments ever ] For weeks, congressional Republicans and members of the Trump transition team have questioned why the White House is pressing ahead given that the GOP will control both the executive and legislative branch for at least the next two years. On Dec. 5, 23 GOP senators wrote Obama a letter asking that his administration \u201ccease issuing new, nonemergency rules and regulations given the recent election results of November 8.\u201d \u201cIt is our job now to determine the right balance between regulation and free market principles and make sure that our federal government no longer stands between Americans and financial success,\u201d they wrote. Many departments have also accelerated hiring in recent weeks , hoping to bring on as many employees as possible in case Trump proceeds with a planned freeze for federal employees. On Tuesday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) wrote the heads of 18 agencies , asking them to provide details on their current hiring practices. Both Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have vowed to reverse some of Obama\u2019s key policies as soon as they take office. But it will be nearly impossible to erase all of them in the months and years ahead, and to achieve the maximum impact, Trump will have to accept new limits on his own power. The Obama administration\u2019s race toward the finish line isn\u2019t completely out of the ordinary. Last-minute regulatory actions also spiked in 2008 and in 2000, said Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the conservative American Action Forum, which has long been tracking White House regulations. But since Oct. 1, Obama has finalized more economically significant rules \u2014 ones with an estimated economic impact of at least $100 million \u2014 than Bill Clinton did in his final four months in office, according to Daniel P\u00e9rez, a policy analyst at the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University. \u201cWe find routinely that politics influences things, and this is just a manifestation of it,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cWe see how politics can bend these levers of policy.\u201d More broadly, Obama has finalized at least 571 major rules while in office, nearly 63 percent more than George W. Bush did during his two terms. And half of the major rules the White House Office of Management and Budget reviewed during the first five-and-a-half years of the administration had an economic impact of at least $1 billion, P\u00e9rez said. [ Obama to top aides: \u2018What are we doing on bees?\u2019\u2019 ] The tempo of federal regulation can work both ways, Batkins noted. While the Obama administration has been feverishly publishing new regulations in the wake of November\u2019s election, the same White House wasn\u2019t so eager to produce new regulations in the run-up to Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012. That October, by Batkins\u2019s count, just four rules came out of the White House. The president and his aides have been unapologetic about the burst of new policies in recent weeks. \u201cThe administration has made a concerted effort to complete important work that was started months or even years ago,\u201d said White House spokesman Patrick Rodenbush in an email, adding that when it comes to its most recent rules, \u201cwe have followed the same rigorous practices and principles used to develop and review regulations that have been upheld throughout the entirety of this administration and previous administrations.\u201d Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who did not brief members of Trump\u2019s transition team before announcing Monday that the Federal Housing Authority would cut interest rates, told reporters that he had \u201cno reason to believe this will be scaled back,\u201d adding that the change\u201coffers a good benefit to hard-working American families out there at a time when interest rates might well continue to go up.\u201d But Ben Carson, whom Trump nominated to succeed Castro, told lawmakers Thursday he was \u201csurprised to see something of this nature being done on the way out the door, which of course has a profound effect.\u201d \u201cCertainly, if confirmed I\u2019m going to work with the FHA administrator and other experts to examine that policy,\u201d Carson said. The White House\u2019s sense of urgency is probably well founded, given Trump\u2019s commitment to try to roll back the policies of the Obama era. And Obama took much the same approach after assuming office in 2009, essentially halting former president George W. Bush\u2019s pending regulations. In a letter on Jan. 20, 2009, then-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel wrote to the heads of every federal agency, ordering them to halt any regulations that had yet to be published in the Federal Register and to consider a 60-day extension of the effective date of regulations that had not yet taken effect. \u201cIt is important that President Obama\u2019s appointees and designees have the opportunity to approve and review any new or pending regulations,\u201d Emanuel wrote at the time. Such an approach today would effectively freeze an array of Obama policies, including five new Energy Department efficiency standards issued Dec. 28 affecting portable air conditioners, swimming pool pumps, walk-in coolers and freezers, commercial boilers and uninterruptible power supplies. The agency estimates the standards will save U.S. consumers between $15 billion and $35 billion over time, but only one of them is published in the Federal Register so far. Congressional Republicans are hoping to go further, having passed legislation Jan. 4 that would allow lawmakers to overturn any rule finalized in the last 60 legislative days of Obama\u2019s tenure in a single vote, rather than taking them up individually. The White House has pledged to veto the bill, called the Midnight Rule Relief Act, but given that the Senate is not slated to take it up until after Inauguration Day, it could ultimately come to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. Still, it is unclear whether the new president will sign it. P\u00e9rez noted that the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which is what allows Congress to reverse a rule within 60 legislative days of its enactment, prohibits agencies from issuing a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d rule once it is overturned. \u201cThe Trump administration may very well have different policy preferences for any given area of regulation,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cbut disapproval via the [Congressional Review Act] would limit the Executive\u2019s power to implement its own regulatory agenda for any given issue-area.\u201d On Friday, the Obama administration showed no signs of slowing down. It filed a defense brief in a lawsuit brought by states over regulation of the nation\u2019s rivers and streams, defied industry opposition by publishing a rule intended to keep first responders safer after a deadly 2013 fertilizer facility explosion in Texas, took steps to lift decades-old financial sanctions against Sudan and finalized regulations aimed at cracking down on the inhumane treatment of show horses. But even as Obama was churning out his final actions, Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill were taking a first step toward repealing the president\u2019s signature health care law, starting to erase his legacy even before his time in office ends. national ",

John Lewis, D-Georgia, in two tweets Saturday morning, following the congressman\u2019s plans to boycott next week\u2019s inauguration. The president-elect disparaged Lewis as \u201cAll talk, talk talk - no action or results\u201d and attacking him for representing a Georgia district Mr. Trump claimed was \u201ccrime infested\u201d and \u201cfalling apart.\u201d Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 Trump tweeted one more tweet Saturday night, writing that Lewis should focus on the \u201cburning and crime-infested inner cities.\u201d Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 The attacks, launched just two days before the nation celebrates the civil rights legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., follow Lewis\u2019 decision to sit out the presidential inauguration Friday. On missing the ceremony -- the first in three decades that Lewis will not be present for -- the Georgia Democrat told NBC in an interview , \u201cyou cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong.\u201d Lewis also contested Mr. Trump\u2019s legitimacy as president in his NBC interview scheduled to air Sunday. President-elect Donald Trump has responded after civil rights icon John Lewis, a Democratic congressman, said Mr. Trump is an illegitimate presid... \u201cI don\u2019t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d After Mr. Trump\u2019s pointed missives, several Twitter users came to Lewis\u2019 immediate defense, tweeting their own critical messages to the president-elect and reminding him of the Georgia congressman\u2019s record on civil rights. Legislators on both sides of the aisle made public statements on the Democrat\u2019s behalf: Ahead of #MLKday2017 , let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 14, 2017 John Lewis and his \"talk\" have changed the world. https://t.co/qeUloAkeTx https://t.co/aH2vDLjKk9 \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) January 14, 2017 John Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality. He deserves better than this. https://t.co/WX1QDCKfzP \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 14, 2017 One Republican strategist pointed out the irony of lashing out at Lewis, a former chair of the\u00a0 Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who risked his life organizing sit-ins and marches to fight racial injustice in the Jim Crow South, on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. You have to hit back. Can't help yourself. But accusing John Lewis of being all talk on MLK weekend? That's your plan? https://t.co/FlA7a8EyYF \u2014 Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) January 14, 2017 Others mentioned Lewis\u2019 actions during \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in 1965, when he attempted to lead a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, that ended in brutal police action against protesters.

Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 While Trump has a well-known tendency to take to social media to push back against any slight against him, such a strongly-worded rebuke of Lewis and the criticism of his majority-black district was jarring on the holiday weekend celebrating the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders and a top lieutenant of King's, helping organize the March on Washington in 1963 and marching with King across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965, where his skull was fractured. Lewis said during an NBC interview on Friday that he didn't view Trump as a \"legitimate president\" after reports that Russia had worked to influence the election in Trump's favor and to discredit Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Trump has largely dismissed those reports and questioned the validity of U.S. intelligence findings, frequently praising Russia and its president Vladimir Putin throughout the campaign and the election. Article continues after sponsorship Lewis also said he wouldn't be attending Trump's inauguration on Friday, making it the first he's missed since he was elected to Congress in 1986. \"You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right,\" Lewis told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd. Nebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, a frequent critic of Trump during the campaign, defended Lewis on Twitter. On Friday, he'd tweeted a message to Lewis asking him to reconsider attending the inauguration. John Lewis and his \"talk\" have changed the world. https://t.co/qeUloAkeTx https://t.co/aH2vDLjKk9 \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) January 14, 2017 Trump also claimed that Lewis's Atlanta-based district was \"in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).\" As the Atlanta Journal Constitution notes, the district is about 58 percent black, 33 percent white and has a growing Hispanic population. It includes the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the headquarters of Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines. It also includes several top colleges such as the historically black Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University, along with Emory University and Georgia Tech. And while the district does have an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, higher than the national average of just below 5 percent, more than 40 percent in the district have a bachelor's degree or higher, higher than the national average .

The \u00a0report underscores what... What was once a statewide drought this week became a Southern California drought . A week of powerful storms has significantly eased the state\u2019s water shortage, pulling nearly all of Northern California out of drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The \u00a0report underscores what... (Joseph Serna, Matt Stevens) But he notes that warm winter storms also bring benefits. Decades of irrigation in the Central Valley had leached out all manner of salts and heavy metals and pesticides from the soil, and those leachates flow out with the farm runoff to pollute the Sacramento Delta, a vital breeding area for fish. \u201cNow we got a huge volume of water coming down the Sacramento and San Joaquin, flushing the Delta out, cleaning out those fish estuaries.\u201d By Wednesday, the snow level lowered in the mountains. The flakes fell heavy, not as dry Utah powder, but a wet slurry dubbed \u201cSierra Cement\u201d by skiers. Avalanche danger closed ski resorts in Lake Tahoe\u00a0and sections of the roads getting there from the valley. But big concerns of a ravaged snowpack diminished. Down at Chili Bar, the mood was giddy.\u00a0With a whole lot of rain hitting the lower and midslopes, the South Fork was heaving at about 150,000 gallons per second.\u00a0A fun springtime trip for kayakers would run on less than a sixth of that rate. Soberanes put on a thermal shirt, then a fleece jacket, and sealed himself into a drysuit. He kissed his wife Fernanda, and his 10-month-old daughter, Alondra, and paddled upstream through some trees in an eddy. Fernanda got in the their old red Ford F150 and headed down Highway 49 to his takeout spot. Soberanes knew the biggest danger was getting stuck in one of those tree thickets \u2014 \u201cstrainers\u201d in river-runner parlance \u2014 because they catch you like a colander while the fast current pulls you under. He moved into the 45-degree water and was soon in a section of colliding, oncoming waves that thrashed him from all directions. Cold whitewater smashed his face every other second. He launched over massive tepees of brown water and torn up weeds, and then hit several beautiful nonbreaking waves at a rapid called Meat Grinder, one as high as 15 feet. At this rate, he\u2019d finish an 8-mile run that normally took an hour and a half in about 25 minutes. Brian Kallen, a rafting guide\u00a0going down the fork with friends, kept his eye on a 10-foot log floating down next to them for the first 15 minutes. If they got stuck in the trough of a stationary wave, that heavy beast could do a lot of damage, \u201cbreaching like a whale on your boat.\u201d Those deep stationary waves flipped many a\u00a0boat, launching rafters into the roiling current without a chance to fill their lungs, then \u2014\u00a0eventually \u2014\u00a0popping them to the surface to dodge\u00a0deadly strainers and hope they could scramble to shore before the onset of hypothermia. The river Kallen knew had totally changed. Giant boulders he once passed by were now underwater and creating drops and waves he had never seen. Soberanes moved more nimbly in his kayak, so he liked to flirt with such dangers. Soon he was racing down a fast bumpy section, slaloming between trees, hooting along the way, like a powder skier  billowing through the aspen. He crossed under the old Coloma Bridge, then a rock monument \u2014 a good 10\u00a0feet into the river today \u2014 marking the very spot John Marshall discovered gold. The sun shone for the first time in days. At the takeout, Fernanda, 30, sat on a blanket under some mossy oaks, cooing to her baby. The sun lit up big drops hanging from the tips of tree twigs like chandelier crystals. It suddenly felt like a picnic day in the English countryside. She pointed to Soberanes as he rounded the bend. \u201cPapa viene,\u201d she said. Daddy\u2019s coming. He pulled into a little eddy, still amped up on endorphins of the run, and pondered going to the next spot down the river. \u201cNah, I got to get to work,\u201d he ultimately decided. His day job is a tree-trimmer. He\u2019d swap his kayak for his chain saw. The wind had left him plenty of work.

    "text": "Twitter YouTube Just months after a launch pad explosion thwarted its last attempt, SpaceX has successfully launched an unmanned rocket into orbit. The launch, which unfolded Saturday at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base, marked a crucial \u2014 and expensive \u2014 test for the private space company in the aftermath of its recent, very visible misfire . SpaceX Rocket And Its Cargo Explode On Launch Pad In Florida [VIDEO] Shortly after the launch, the two-stage rocket detached its first stage, which subsequently landed safely on a platform in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX live-streamed the entire process along the way. You can watch it here or play the video embedded at the top of this post. The Falcon 9 rocket is bearing 10 commercial satellites for Iridium Communications, which currently operates a network of dozens of mobile communications satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is under contract with Iridium to launch at least 70 satellites into orbit in a series of seven launches for the company \u2014 beginning with Saturday's batch. The new satellites will replace the current network, in \"what will be one of the largest 'tech upgrades' in history,\" according to a press release from SpaceX . Still, a cloud of uncertainty hung over the launch, after an explosion left a wreckage of last September's test in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said at the time that the blast came while workers were still loading propellant into the rocket, though no one was physically harmed in the accident. In addition to destroying the rocket itself \u2014 a Falcon 9, like the rocket being launched Saturday \u2014 last year's blast also obliterated a $200 million communications satellite. The Israeli satellite \"had been leased by Facebook as part of a project to bring high-speed internet to parts of Africa,\" NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports for our Newscast unit. Article continues after sponsorship A months-long investigation by SpaceX dug into what went wrong \u2014 \"the toughest puzzle to solve that we've ever had to solve,\" Musk said. That probe wrapped up earlier this month, concluding the accident \"was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank,\" according to CBS News . The Federal Aviation Administration then signed off on that investigation, approving the new licence for Saturday's launch. Prior to last year's accident, SpaceX had managed a string of high-profile successes, including landing a Falcon 9 on a floating barge. ",

    "text": "By Abby Phillip January 14 at 7:33 PM Follow @abbydphillip A public feud between Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) seemed to jettison any lingering hopes that the inauguration would temporarily ease partisanship in Washington and instead threatened to widen the rift between the two parties. Lewis\u2019s assertion that Trump is not a \u201clegitimate president\u201d and his announcement that he would skip Friday\u2019s inaugural ceremony prompted the president-elect to sharply criticize the civil rights leader Saturday morning. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Trump wrote in two tweets . \u201cAll talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results. Sad!\u201d Late Saturday evening, Trump continued to hammer Lewis in a third tweet . \u201cCongressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d Trump wrote. How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans Rep. John Lewis became the most high-profile Democratic lawmaker to announce that he is boycotting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The president-elect, in response, said the Georiga Democrat was \u201call talk.\u201d (Tasos Katopodis/AFP/Getty Images) The incident has left Democrats and Republicans bracing themselves for yet another showdown between the president and his political opponents \u2014 one that threatens to usher in a new era of the kind of crippling hyper-partisanship that often characterized the eight years of the Obama administration. David Axelrod, former senior strategist and aide to President Obama, called Lewis \u201cas genuine and decent a person as you\u2019ll find,\u201d but he worried that Democrats risk adopting an originally Republican playbook in their dealings with Trump and that it won\u2019t advance the party\u2019s interests. \u201cThe question is how much can a democracy take of cycle after cycle of one side claiming illegitimacy,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cI as much as anybody else appreciate the anger because I was there when we basically faced a Republican blockade, even on things that Republicans had supported in the past. I saw how destructive that was and how difficult that was.\u201d \u201cIf you care about our democracy, how do you proceed now? Do you pay him back in kind?\u201d Axelrod asked. Voicing the anger and disappointment of many Democrats in Congress and beyond, Lewis said in an interview with NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that was published Friday that he does not believe Trump is a legitimate president, citing the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia intervened in the election to bolster Trump. \u201cI think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Lewis said. The comments prompted anger from Republicans \u2014 even those who do not support Trump \u2014 who said that Democrats are disregarding their own breathless warnings during the campaign about the risks of failing to accept the election results. \u201cWe listened to Democrats for the last two months of the campaign say that any suggestion that the elections weren\u2019t legitimate and the results wouldn\u2019t be accepted is dangerous and unpatriotic,\u201d said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist. \u201cNow those same people are trying to delegitimize Trump and say that he shouldn\u2019t be elected president.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were all the more charged as they came at the start of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend and were seen as dismissive of Lewis\u2019s work in the civil right movement, a time when he was subjected to arrest and assault. Adding to the racial overtones is the disparagement of Lewis\u2019s district, which is majority black, as \u201ccrime infested.\u201d Interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile called Trump\u2019s comments an \u201cattack on a living legend and a civil rights hero.\u201d \u201cI say that John Lewis took action. He took action marching from Selma to Montgomery,\u201d she said at a Democratic Party meeting in Phoenix. At least a dozen Democratic lawmakers have joined Lewis, saying that they plan to skip Trump\u2019s swearing-in. And on Twitter on Saturday, many of them jumped to the congressman\u2019s defense. Few Republican lawmakers weighed in. Two, Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Rep. Kevin Yoder (Kan.), tweeted support for Lewis even as they urged him to attend the inauguration. The Lewis tweets capped a week of Twitter flurries by the president-elect in which he went after what he viewed as insults from various people or entities, including Clinton, CNN, the intelligence community, BuzzFeed News and Meryl Streep. \u201cHis fundamental rule is that if you come after me in any way, I\u2019ll come after you,\u201d Axelrod noted. \u201cHe thinks he can bully people into cooperation. My experience has been that can drive people further away and make it harder. \u201cThere are some things that he\u2019s talking about wanting to do that he\u2019s going to need Democratic votes for.\u201d David Weigel in Phoenix contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

As President Obama gave his farewell address to the nation on Tuesday night, he also began the shift to a third stage of his political career. The once young, idealistic senator-turned-two-term-president will soon become an influential strategist and ally to those worried about the future with Donald Trump at the helm of the most powerful nation on the planet. Obama nodded to this new role in his speech Tuesday. He did not directly criticize his successor, but used lines like \"I reject discrimination against Muslim-Americans\" that were clearly aimed at Trump and delighted the audience of more than 20,000 Democrats who crowded into McCormick Place to hear his final address as president.

Prior to November's election, Obama and his aides had hinted that the outgoing president would limit his future involvement in politics and instead focus on writing a book chronicling his eight years in office, use his foundation to expand his \"My Brother's Keeper\" program and give speeches and join boards, as other ex-presidents have done. But now, Obama's chief achievements, such as his climate change policies and the Affordable Care Act, are in danger of being gutted by the Republican Congress, the Democratic Party is in disarray and much of the country \u2014 and the world \u2014 is uncertain what a Trump presidency will bring. So Obama is beginning to telegraph a post-presidency different from George W. Bush, who largely receded from politics altogether after his eight years in office. Obama has said that he will press the Democratic Party to organize more effectively, from fielding strong candidates in school board and state legislative elections across the country to making sure the party's candidates campaign in more conservative areas. Related: President Obama Caps Long Goodbye With Farewell Speech \"I think that if Hillary Clinton had won the election, then I'd just turn over the keys,\" Obama told the New Yorker recently. \"We'd make sure the briefing books were in order and out we go. I think now I have some responsibility to at least offer my counsel to those who will continue to be elected officials about how the DNC can help rebuild, how state parties and progressive organizations can work together.\" US President Barack Obama arrives to speak during his farewell address in Chicago, Illinois on January 10, 2017.                 Barack Obama closes the book on his presidency, with a farewell speech in Chicago that will try to lift supporters shaken by Donald Trump's shock election. / AFP PHOTO / Joshua LOTTJOSHUA LOTT/AFP/Getty Images JOSHUA LOTT / AFP - Getty Images The outgoing president, who will leave office at just 55 years old and in good health, has also promised that if Trump steps over certain lines, he will not be silent. \"I think it's important to give the incoming administration space,\" he told Comedy Central's Trevor Noah last month. But he added, \"There may be occasions where, even in the first year, if I think core values of ours are being threatened. I mean, I've said this, if I thought a Muslim registry was being set up that violates the Constitution and violates who we are and would make us less safe because it'd make it easier for groups like ISIL to recruit and radicalize homegrown terrorists, I might have to say something about that. \"If I saw Dream Act kids \u2014 young people who were brought here as children who are for all intents and purposes Americans \u2014 suddenly being rounded up, contrary to who we are as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, I might have to say something about.\" Some of the president's allies are also preparing for major roles in defending Obama's legacy. The president's close friend and former Attorney General Eric Holder is now representing the State of California as an attorney, looking to defend that state's liberal, Obama-style policies if they come into conflict with Trump's goals. A group of elected officials in blue states, including former Obama chief of staff and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, have promised to oppose Trump if he seeks the mass deportation of undocumented people that he proposed during his campaign. And young Democrats who worked as field organizers on Obama's campaigns and lower-level aides in the White House are now exploring their own campaigns for state legislatures and other local offices.

(Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) People from a dozen organizations and communities gathered to rally for immigrant and refugee rights Jan. 14, 2017, at Chicago Teachers Union headquarters on Chicago's Near West Side. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) Student Cindy Agustin fears her parents will be deported and she'll never see them again. Nareman Taha worries the government will create a Muslim registry to track people of her faith. Teacher Jaime Serrano is concerned about his second-grade students, some of whom are anxious they will be separated from their families. \"It's heartbreaking,\" he said. \"They are really scared.\" Anxiety about the future \u2014 and resolve to change it \u2014 brought more than 1,000 people together Saturday for a Chicago rally against President-elect Donald Trump 's hard-line immigration proposals. Protesters chanted \"no justice, no peace,\" waved signs reading \"We Are Here to Stay,\" and cheered community, faith and labor leaders who called for unity and action. The rally, held at the Chicago Teachers Union headquarters on the Near West Side, coincided with similar protests in dozens of other U.S. cities Saturday, six days before Trump is to be inaugurated. Hundreds of people gathered at Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0headquarters on the Near West Side\u00a0for a pro-immigrant rally Jan. 14, 2017. During his campaign for the White House, Trump adopted strict positions on immigration, including building \"a big, fat beautiful wall\" at the U.S.-Mexican border. But he also sent mixed messages, and now many people wonder exactly what he will do as president. \"I mean, that's the issue with Trump, right? He's completely unpredictable,\" Chicago rally organizer Lawrence Benito said in an interview prior before the event. \"He says one thing and then he walks it back. I don't know what to expect.\" Immigration activists, Benito said, will watch Trump's first 100 days in office closely. \"We're going to be prepared \u2014 for what we can anticipate \u2014 for the fight to come,\" said Benito, head of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, the rally's lead organization. Agustin, a 27-year-old graduate student at the University of Chicago, said in an interview she is an immigrant from Mexico living in the U.S. without legal permission and worries that she won't be able to renew her work permit and find a job upon graduation.

Degnon during a news conference on Dec. 14 at the District of Columbia National Guard armory in Washington. (Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post) Peter Hermann, Dan LamotheThe Washington Post The transition team for President-elect Donald Trump asked the head of the District of Columbia National Guard to remain in command throughout Inauguration Day after media reports that he would leave in the middle of the ceremony created controversy, the Guard said. Maj. Gen. Errol Schwartz told The Washington Post on Friday that he will be removed from his post immediately after Trump is sworn in as president. That irked at least one D.C. Council member because Schwartz will have to abandon his post during one of the Guard's most important operations, helping maintain security and order during Washington's highest-profile event. As is customary for presidential appointees, Schwartz had offered his resignation after Trump was elected. In an interview Friday, Schwartz said he learned he would be replaced on Jan. 20. He said the transition team ultimately asked him to stay in the job for a few additional days, but only after the report of his departure had been published Friday on The Washington Post website. Schwartz said he turned down the transition team's offer because, by then, he had begun packing up his office and notified his staff. He said he believes the offer came only as a result of the negative attention his departure attracted. He declined to comment further. Transition officials for the new administration on Friday said the team asked Schwartz to stay on through the inauguration to maintain continuity. They did not immediately respond Saturday to questions about when and how that offer was extended. Military officials on Saturday backtracked from earlier statements indicating that Schwartz had not been asked to stay on by the new administration. One said he learned he had been mistaken, and that additional paperwork that became available Saturday showed that the transition team had in fact asked Schwartz to maintain his command for several days into the new presidency. That official did not know when that offer was made. ",

His jab appeared to irk Trump, who tweeted that he \"should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\" The last part didn't sit well with Democratic lawmakers, some who noted that Trump was ripping the black congressman \u2014 the son of Southern sharecroppers whose fight against segregation and as an original Freedom Rider is well-documented \u2014 on the weekend ahead of the King holiday. Lewis was beaten during a civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 and had been arrested and jailed repeatedly in opposition to desegregation. Since joining Congress in 1987, he's been a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 14, 2017 5:08 PM EST WALTERBORO, S.C. -- Neighbors knew them for years as a church-going mother and her polite teenage daughter before police swarmed Gloria Williams\u2019 home in this small, quiet South Carolina city.\u00a0 Williams, 51, was arrested on kidnapping charges. Then came the real shocker: Police identified the victim as the 18-year-old woman Williams had raised as her daughter. Investigators said DNA analysis proved she had been stolen as an infant from a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t an abused child or a child who got in trouble,\u201d a stunned Joseph Jenkins said of the young woman who lived across the street. \u201cBut she grew up with a lie for 18 years.\u201d She has learned she was born as Kamiyah Mobley. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams described her Friday as being in good health but emotionally overwhelmed.\u00a0 Some months ago, the young woman \u201chad an inclination\u201d that she may have been kidnapped, the sheriff said. Authorities didn\u2019t say why she suspected this. \u00a0\u00a0 Tesha Stephens, a cousin of Williams\u2019, said the young woman had much to think about. \u201cShe\u2019s probably going to have to take this day-by-day,\u201d Stephens told reporters outside Williams\u2019 home. Mobley got to spend a few emotional moments with Williams, who is also charged with interference with custody, after her arrest. She cried \u201cMomma\u201d through the caged window of a security door after Williams waived extradition to Florida, according to WXJT-TV, which posted a video online. Meanwhile, the young woman\u2019s birth family cried \u201ctears of joy\u201d after a detective told them their baby had been found. Within hours Friday, they were able to reconnect over FaceTime. \u201cShe looks just like her daddy,\u201d her paternal grandmother, Velma Aiken of Jacksonville, told The Associated Press after they were able to see each other for the first time. \u201cShe act like she been talking to us all the time. She told us she\u2019d be here soon to see us.\u201d Mobley was only eight hours old when she was taken from her young mother by a woman posing as a nurse at University Medical Center. A massive search ensued, with helicopters circling the hospital and the city on high alert. Thousands of tips came in over the years, but she had disappeared.\u00a0 Composite image of Kamiyah Mobley, developed after her 1998 kidnapping. WJAX The case broke thanks to a tip received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Robert Lowery, a center vice president. He would not say from whom the tip came. But the center soon reached out to the cold case detectives at the sheriff\u2019s office, and Mobley provided a swab of her cheek for DNA analysis that proved the match, the sheriff said. \u201cThis was something brand new to all of us,\u201d said Stephens, Williams\u2019 cousin. The center has tracked 308 infant abductions since 1983 by nonfamily members in the U.S. Of those cases, 12 were still missing at the end of last month. That\u2019s now one number smaller. The woman has been provided with counseling, the sheriff said. Meanwhile, Aiken is thrilled to know that they can speak with each other as much as they want. \u201cI always prayed, \u2018Don\u2019t let me die before I see my grandbaby,\u2019\u201d said Aiken. \u201cMy prayer was answered.\u201d The family never forgot the little girl ripped from her mother\u2019s arms that day in 1998. Her mother, Shanara Mobley, told the Florida Times-Union newspaper on the 10th anniversary of the kidnapping that on every one of Kamiyah\u2019s birthdays, she wrapped a piece of birthday cake in foil and stuck it in her freezer. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to wake up every day, knowing that your child is out there and you have no way to reach her or talk to her,\u201d Mobley told the paper in 2008. News moved quickly through the community of about 5,100 people early Friday after police cars swarmed Williams\u2019 home. Jenkins said he awoke to see officers searching the house and the shed around back. \u201cAt the fish market, the hair dresser, the gas station, they\u2019re all talking about it,\u201d said Ruben Boatwright, who said he\u2019s known Williams for about 15 years. Lakeshia Jenkins, Joseph\u2019s wife, said Williams and the girl would often come over for cookouts in the yard, or join their family at a nearby water park. Kamiyah seemed to be well cared for, and \u201cMs. Williams, she seemed like a normal person,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cShe went to work, came back here and went to church every Sunday,\u201d she said. Williams also worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 hospital in Charleston, volunteered in the area for Habitat for Humanity and led the youth program at a Methodist church, she said. \u201cShe\u2019s very intelligent, smart as a whip,\u201d Boatwright said. \u201cAll I can say are good things about her.\u201d Now, Williams faces life in prison if she\u2019s convicted in Florida, State Attorney Melissa Nelson said on Friday, according to CBS Jacksonville affiliate WJAX . Bond was denied for Williams, according to the station. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

John Lewis, D-Ga., speaks after being presented with the Liberty Medal for his dedication to civil rights during a ceremony at the National Constitution Center, on Sept. 19, 2016, in Philadelphia. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Slocum, AP) It\u2019s almost as if they were surprised. President-elect Donald Trump sparked outrage (again) Saturday by attacking Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., after the civil rights icon said he would skip Trump\u2019s inauguration and doesn\u2019t consider his election legitimate. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAll talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump blasts Rep. Lewis for saying his election not legitimate The reaction, as one would imagine, was swift. Democrats, celebrities\u00a0and even some Republicans weighed in. \u201cJohn Lewis and his \u2018talk\u2019 have changed the world,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, R.-Neb., tweeted with a link to a photo of Lewis in 1965, when he was badly beaten at the Selma bridge in a voting rights march. Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan., said he disagrees with Lewis\u2019s questioning of the presidential election, but said he is a \u201chero & icon.\u201d \u201cHe deserves all of our respect,\u201d Yoder tweeted . \u201cHe's earned it.\u201d NAACP President Cornell Brooks demanded that Trump apologize and said that by disrespecting Lewis, Trump had \"dishonored Lewis' sacrifice & demeaned the Americans & rights, he nearly died 4.\" By disrespecting @repjohnlewis , @realDonaldTrump dishonored Lewis' sacrifice & demeaned the Americans & rights, he nearly died 4. Apologize. pic.twitter.com/NM3G3X2o54 \u2014 Cornell Wm. Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 14, 2017 Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele had some concise advice for Trump. \u201cNumber one, don\u2019t tweet that. Number two, don\u2019t go there,\u201d he said on MSNBC, adding that the attacks were \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., expressed support for Lewis, a \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cAmerican hero,\u201d and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u00a0noted that many people have tried to silence Lewis over the years. \u201cAll have failed,\u201d she tweeted. As we honor MLK, I'll always stand by my friend, American hero @repjohnlewis . We'll lock arms & resist any effort to roll back civil rights. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) January 14, 2017 Ahead of #MLKday2017 , let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 14, 2017 Newly elected Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also weighed in. \u201cJohn Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality,\u201d she wrote . \u201cHe deserves better than this.\u201d That was mild compared to some of the reactions on Twitter. John Lewis is the conscience of America. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have the moral stature to kiss John Lewis\u2019s feet. \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) January 14, 2017 Trump attacked disabled, gold star family, baby & John Lewis, but not Putin hacking our election. He has no moral or patriotic standing. \u2014 Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) January 14, 2017 Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump could use some lessons in courage and action from John Lewis. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) January 14, 2017 Trump is, in fact, not fit to be a citizen of John Lewis's country https://t.co/BFpSU1grW9 \u2014 Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) January 14, 2017 Leave it to Trump to kick off MLK weekend by attacking civil rights icon John Lewis, reminding us what the 'orange' face of hate looks like. \u2014 Bill Madden (@activist360) January 14, 2017 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ixdbsG Most Popular ",

The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel brought up concerns about the Hawthorne space company\u2019s unconventional fueling operations... A major NASA safety advisory group urged the agency to scrutinize SpaceX \u2019s rocket fueling process ahead of future launches of astronauts to the International Space Station. The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel brought up concerns about the Hawthorne space company\u2019s unconventional fueling operations... (Samantha Masunaga) The company said\u00a0one of three such\u00a0tanks, inside the rocket\u2019s larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank, failed,\u00a0probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel\u2019s aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited. The vessels store cold helium that maintains pressure in\u00a0the liquid oxygen tank. The FAA said last week\u00a0that it accepted the accident report and closed the investigation.\u00a0 SpaceX said it would change the configuration of the vessels so warmer helium could be loaded, as the investigation found that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to form a solid, exacerbating the possibility of oxygen getting trapped. The company also said it would change helium loading operations.\u00a0 A few weeks after the explosion, SpaceX said it expected to return to flight as soon as November. But that date slipped to December, and then January, as the investigation continued.\u00a0 The company initially had been planning to launch on Jan. 8, but the date was pushed back to Monday. The launch then was rescheduled for Saturday because of weather conditions. The 10 satellites SpaceX launched Saturday\u00a0will be operated by Iridium Communications Inc., and will be part of the McLean, Va., company\u2019s new satellite constellation to provide mobile communications services on the ground and in ships and airplanes.

An investigation conducted by SpaceX (with assists from the Air Force, NASA , and the National Transportation Safety Board) concluded that the September 1 explosion was likely caused by a failure of a pressurized second-stage tank. The company, which is run by billionaire Elon Musk , vowed to change the fueling procedures to prevent the incident from recurring, and the FAA granted a launch license. The launch today delivered 10 Iridium satellites to low-earth orbit for use in mobile communications. After separation, the rocket\u2019s first stage landed on the droneship \u201cJust Read the Instructions,\u201d stationed in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX nailed a similar droneship landing back in April. Returning the first stage to earth enables the company to reuse the rocket, drastically reducing the cost of launch. Musk has said his ultimate goal is to start a colony on Mars by reducing the cost of a one-way trip from $10 billion per person to just $200,000. 0 Shares ",

Questioned by the Wall Street Journal about the sanctions on Russia implemented by the Obama administration last month , Mr. Trump said he could nix them if the foreign power was to assist the U.S. in fighting terrorists or in other ways. \u201cIf you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\u201d he said in the Journal interview. But Mr. Trump said he plans to keep the sanctions -- the latest of which were a response to the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Kremlin directed hacks during the U.S. election -- in place for \u201cat least a period of time.\u201d CBS News has confirmed FBI Director James Comey personally briefed President-elect Donald Trump about unverified claims that the Russians have co... The president-elect acknowledged that Vladimir Putin has expressed interest in meeting with him after he takes office, and Mr. Trump said \u201cthat\u2019s absolutely fine with me.\u201d Mr. Trump seemed to concede this week that Russia was behind the extensive cyberattacks on Democratic Party officials, telling reporters that \u201cas far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d But, he seemed to dismiss the import of Moscow\u2019s actions, saying in his first press conference since the election that \u201cI also think we\u2019ve been hacked by other countries, other people.\u201d In the Journal\u2019s wide-ranging interview, Mr. Trump also suggested that he was open to scrapping the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, in which the U.S. recognizes the island nation of Taiwan as a part of \u201cone China.\u201d When asked about the policy, Mr. Trump said \u201ceverything is under negotiation, including One China.\u201d On Saturday, China\u2019s foreign ministry seemed to push back on the assessment, posting on its website that the \u201cOne China\u201d principle was a non-negotiable political basis for China-U.S. relations. It also pushed \u201crelevant parties\u201d in the U.S. to recognize the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue. Since 1979, the United States has recognized Taiwan as a territory of China\u2019s and not a sovereign nation, but in December, Mr. Trump broke protocol by taking a phone call with its president.

The presence of U.S. troops on Polish soil marks a historic moment\u2014the first time Western forces are being deployed on a continuous basis to bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank. \u201c\"We have waited for you for a very long time,\u201d the soliders heard Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz say at Saturday\u2019s event in Zagan amid falling snow. \u201cWe waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only one who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east.\u201d The event also drew hundreds of ordinary Poles.\u00a0 The American deployment includes an armored brigade of 3,500 American troops from Fort Carson, Colorado. It comes in reactions to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its backing of separatist insurgents in Ukraine's east. Those actions have frightened many in Poland, the Baltic states and other countries in Eastern Europe that were once under Moscow's control. \u201cThis is America's most capable fighting force: a combat-ready, highly trained US armoured brigade, with our most advanced equipment and weaponry,\u201d U.S. ambassador to Poland Paul James said at the ceremonies, according to an AFP report . \"This force embodies America's iron-clad commitment to honor our NATO treaty obligation to defend our NATO allies.\" The Polish government organized several other events across the country, including in downtown Warsaw, to welcome the Americans. \u201cThis is an important day for Poland, for Europe, for our common defense,\u201d Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told the U.S. soldiers. The troops are due to fan out across seven countries from Estonia to Bulgaria for exercises. A headquarters unit will be stationed in Germany. After nine months they will be replaced by another unit. NATO will also deploy four multinational battalions to its eastern flank later this year, one each to Poland and the three Baltic states. The U.S. will also lead one of those battalions. The Kremlin has denounced all these deployments, saying it considers them a threat to its own security and interests. One of the newly arrived Americans M.P Peter Gomez told AFP he felt \u201cvery welcome\u201d as he posed for selfies with Polish citizens. \u201cI'm surprised actually,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cPeople are very excited to see us.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

John Lewis, D-Ga., center, takes a seat at the witness table on Capitol Hill in Washington. \u00a0(AP) A growing number of Democrats, Hollywood celebrities and some Republicans came to the defense of civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis amid fallout from Donald Trump's comments earlier on Saturday. Trump said that Lewis, who has argued the president-elect won't be a legitimate leader, should focus more on fixing his Georgia district. \u201cLewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart,\u201d Trump tweeted. The response on Twitter was swift. GOP Sen. Ben Sassse of Nebraska tweeted that \"John Lewis and his \"talk\" have changed the world.\"\u00a0 On this Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, let it be clear that John Lewis is an American patriot. Trump's attacks on him further confirm it. pic.twitter.com/WavPT36Atu \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) January 14, 2017 It's telling, I'm afraid, that Donald Trump treats Vladimir Putin with more respect than he does John Lewis. \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 14, 2017 Trump assumes John Lewis represents a poor district that's \"falling apart\" simply because he is black.

A champion for justice and reconciliation. @realDonaldTrump could learn smth from his example \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) January 14, 2017 Residents of Lewis' district in Atlanta, meanwhile, in response to a tweet from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , began to post pictures of their neighborhoods on Twitter -- many of which did not fit with Trump's characterization.\u00a0 @ajc I live in the #fifthdistrict and couldn't be prouder to cast my vote for @repjohnlewis ! pic.twitter.com/Vbu1H4u40H \u2014 Tim Truxell (@flannelenigma) January 14, 2017 Lewis, a leader in the civil rights movement of the 1960s who was beaten by state troopers during the \"Bloody Sunday\" march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama, says in an NBC's \"Meet the Press\" to air Sunday that he does not consider Trump a \"legitimate president,\" and blamed the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House. \"You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said. Trump, in followup tweet Saturday, said Lewis should spend more time helping his \"crime invested\" district, instead of \"falsely complaining about the election results.\" \"All talk, talk, talk -- no action or results. Sad.\" Trump concluded.\u00a0 Lewsi has said he will skip next week's inauguration of Trump at the Capitol, joining several other Democrats who have decided to boycott the historic event. \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,\" Lewis said. The Lewis-Trump fued escalted on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. U.S. Intelligence agencies have said Russia meddled in the election to help Trump win. After spending weeks challenging that assessment, Trump finally accepted that the Russians were behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. However, he also emphasized that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" Lewis explained his decision to stay away from the inauguration as \"you cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.\" He said it will be the first inauguration he has missed in three decades, a time that includes Democrats and Republicans taking the oath of office. Other Democratic lawmakers who have announced plans to skip the inauguration include Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Gutierrez of Illinois. They cite an array of reasons, but have one at least one thing in common. All represent heavily Democratic districts. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",
