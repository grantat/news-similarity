Wade, even with a single Trump appointment to the court, but in the long run, with the possibility of a second or third Trump appointment, there is a substantial threat to the core of Roe v. Wade,\" Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, told NBC News. Weddington and abortion rights activists have seen threats to Roe before \u2014 including the 1992 Supreme Court decision Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey. While the case affirmed the basic findings in Roe, it gave states increased liberty to begin regulating abortion from the moment of conception, Carol Sanger, a law professor at Columbia University and author of \"About Abortion: Terminating Pregnancy in the 21st Century,\" told NBC News. \"That just opened the door to all legislators who wanted to pour out legislation,\" Sanger said, citing state laws such as mandatory waiting periods, ultrasounds for women seeking abortion and laws regulating fetal remains. But in June, the Supreme Court struck down one of the nation's toughest restrictions on abortion, a Texas law passed in 2013 that would have caused more than 75 percent of the state's clinics to shut down. \"I think the importance of that case is that the current majority on the court, including Justice Kennedy, is quite suspicious of these laws and unlikely to be receptive to them,\" Tushnet said. Pro-choice advocates gather outside the Supreme Court after the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt decision where justices weighed a case that imposes heavy restrictions on abortion clinics in Texas in Washington, on June 27, 2016. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA, file While a complete reversal of the Roe decision is unlikely in the near future, Tushnet and Sanger said, states could become emboldened to enact additional restrictions on abortion rights in a more conservative political climate. \"Roe doesn't have to be overturned to take us back to the good old bad days,\" Sanger said. Sanger said one alarming trend to watch is states banning abortions after 20 weeks. Nineteen states ban abortions at about 20-weeks post-fertilization, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with laws in effect in 16 of those states. \"The 20-week ban is so pernicious and not just because it's violating Roe,\" Sanger said, adding that she believes these bans violate the decision because a fetus is not viable at 20 weeks. Weddington said if abortion restrictions continue to increase, many women could face having to travel hundreds of miles and to different states to get an abortion. Play ",

Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! Got it (Reuters) By Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan By Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan January 22 at 12:44 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @WaPoSean President Trump\u2019s executive order instructing federal agencies to grant relief to constituencies affected by the Affordable Care Act has begun to reverberate throughout the nation\u2019s health-care system, injecting further uncertainty into an already unsettled insurance landscape. The political signal of the order, which Trump signed just hours after being sworn into office, was clear: Even before the Republican-led Congress acts to repeal the 2010 law, the new administration will move swiftly to unwind as many elements as it can on its own \u2014 elements that have changed how 20 million Americans get health coverage and what benefits insurers must offer some of their customers. But the practical implications of Trump\u2019s action on Friday are harder to decipher. Its language instructs all federal agencies to \u201cwaive, defer, grant \u00adexemptions from or delay\u201d any part of the law that imposes a financial or regulatory burden on those affected by it. That would cover consumers, doctors, hospitals and other providers, as well as insurers and drug companies. The prospect of what could flow from pulling back or eliminating administrative rules \u2014 including no longer enforcing the individual mandate, which requires Americans to get coverage or pay an annual penalty, and ending health plans\u2019 \u201cessential benefits\u201d \u2014 could affect how many people sign up on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces before open enrollment ends Jan. 31 for 2017 coverage, as well as how many companies decide to participate next year. Robert Laszewski, president of the consulting firm Health Policy and Strategy Associates, called the executive order a \u201cbomb\u201d lobbed into the law\u2019s \u201calready shaky\u201d insurance market. Given the time it will take Republicans to fashion a replacement, he expects that federal and state insurance exchanges will continue to operate at least through 2018. \u201cInstead of sending a signal that there\u2019s going to be an orderly transition, they\u2019ve sent a signal that it\u2019s going to be a disorderly transition,\u201d said Laszewski, a longtime critic of the law , which is also known as Obamacare. \u201cHow does the Trump administration think this is not going to make the situation worse?\u201d [Trump signs executive order that could effectively gut Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate] Teresa Miller, Pennsylvania\u2019s insurance commissioner, said Saturday that several insurers on her state\u2019s exchange \u201cseriously considered leaving the market last year\u201d and that Trump\u2019s action could propel them to indeed abandon it in 2018. In fact, she added, some have raised the possibility of withdrawing from the ACA\u2019s exchanges during 2017, which would mean consumers could keep their plans but no longer receive federal subsidies to help them afford the coverage. \u201cThat would create a nightmare scenario,\u201d Miller said. As of this year, nearly a third of all counties nationwide have just one insurer in the federal marketplace, and almost two-thirds have two or fewer insurers. The White House did not return requests for comment over the weekend. On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders offered cautious praise for the president\u2019s executive order. Yet more broadly, the GOP remains in a state of uncertainty on health care, with unresolved questions about the path forward. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was briefed on the details of Trump\u2019s order only Thursday, according to a GOP aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks. Alexander said in a statement late Friday that Trump was \u201cright to make the urgent work of rescuing Americans trapped in a collapsing Obamacare system a top priority on his first day in office.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace,\u201d focused primarily on what Trump could do through executive action. \u201cPresident Obama implemented a lot of Obamacare himself, so President Trump will be able to undo a lot of it himself,\u201d McConnell said. Asked whether he knew what the new president\u2019s replacement plan is, he said Senate Republicans are working with the administration \u201cto have an orderly process.\u201d The GOP-led House and Senate have passed a budget measure that was designed to serve as a vehicle for repealing key parts of the law. But they have yet to rally around a consensus idea for when and what to do to replace it. They were placed under further pressure to act quickly after Trump vowed \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d in a recent interview with The Washington Post. A key Trump ally said Sunday that the president\u2019s decision to sign the order on his first day in office, coupled with his recent comments about moving swiftly on repealing and replacing the law, has applied pressure on GOP lawmakers to act faster than they might have initially planned. \u201cI think Trump has consistently moved that needle with the mindset of our conference,\u201d Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said. [ Pressure mounts on GOP for an Obamacare replacement ] Democratic leaders, however, are casting the executive order as evidence that Republicans are in a state of disarray on health care. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do. They can repeal, but they don\u2019t have a plan for replace,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said in an interview that aired Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s executive order just mirrored that.\u201d At least publicly, the insurance industry\u2019s reaction has been muted. America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow, whose group represents nearly 1,300 insurers, said in an email Saturday that it is \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d what the executive order will mean for the industry. \u201cThere is no question the individual health-care market has been challenged from the start,\u201d Grow said. \u201cThe president said he would take swift action to move our country to improve it, and he has.\u201d A key question following Trump\u2019s order is what actions Republican-led states might take to withdraw from key provisions of the law. Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s (R) office said Saturday that he was reviewing his options. Jackie Schutz, a Scott spokeswoman, said the governor \u201cappreciates\u201d that the new administration is \u201cswiftly taking action.\u201d But as to how and when Scott would seek to take advantage of it, \u201cwe\u2019re still looking into it to see what it specifically means to Florida,\u201d Schutz said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who met with Senate Finance Committee Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and nearly a dozen other GOP governors on Thursday to discuss the future of Medicaid, said afterward that there are \u201csome fundamental things that we can do that can settle people down so they are not worried they are going to lose their coverage but that at the same time bring significant changes to the Obamacare package.\u201d Kasich, who expanded Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act, said that one option he favors is paring Medicaid coverage to people with incomes up to 100 percent of the poverty level, rather than the current 138 percent, and then letting those above 100 percent go on the marketplace to get coverage. Asked whether he could guarantee that none of his constituents would lose health-care coverage, Kasich responded, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything.\u201d Even if the new administration is eager to grant waivers to states, it does not have the political appointees in place at the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments to do so. But timing is important. While the exact deadline varies depending on the state, insurers generally must decide by the spring whether to participate in Affordable Care Act marketplaces for the next year and, if so, propose the rates they would like to charge. Their decisions could be complicated if the president\u2019s order results in rule changes that affect the benefits those health plans must include \u2013 or alters rules in other ways that, in turn, prompt fewer healthy customers to seek coverage through the marketplaces. Chris Jennings, who served as a senior White House adviser on health care in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said that in the health-care arena, \u201cmore than any other domestic policy, details matter. Plans, they live off a comma, or an incentive, or a disincentive, or a penalty, or an enforcement mechanism.\u201d Ceci Connolly, president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, said her members are in a particularly difficult position because they are unlike large national companies that can \u201cpick and choose\u201d which markets they operate in under the federal exchange. \u201cLocal nonprofit plans are in their communities, so they can\u2019t look around for certain markets and pull out of ones that they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Connolly, who added that her group\u2019s \u201cbiggest concern\u201d is that some consumers might stop paying their premiums if they believe they will not be penalized for lacking coverage. That could lead to hospital and doctor visits that would not be reimbursed, which then would impose costs on providers and insurers more broadly. With fewer than 10 days to go in the current enrollment period, Mila Kofman, executive director of the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange Authority, said that \u201call of this discussion of whether or not people will have access to affordable quality health insurance is very unsettling.\u201d Some residents have asked Kofman whether she can assure them they will get the same health benefits if Congress and the administration overhaul the system in the coming months. \u201cI tell them, \u2018Sign up. We will certainly do everything we can to ensure that you\u2019ll have access to quality health insurance.\u2019 \u201d Yet Mona Mangat, a solo practitioner in allergy and immunology in St. Petersburg, Fla., is not sure what to say when patients ask her whether they will be able to afford the kind of prescriptions and services they have taken advantage of under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have an answer for them,\u201d Mangat said. \u201cI say, \u2018Oh my God, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. national ",

(Photo: Dan Powers, Appleton Post Crescent/USA TODAY Sports) ATLANTA \u2013 The most memorable sound in the final football game at the Georgia Dome was a chant, reverberating through every square inch of this old stadium. \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d chanted Falcons fans, from the first moment Matt Ryan jogged through the tunnel one last time, through the last seconds of the fourth quarter as the Atlanta Falcons quarterback helped make the last game here the most memorable. Ryan threw for four touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown in a 44-21 win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, sending the Falcons to Houston for Super Bowl LVI. It is their first trip to the Super Bowl since the 1998 season. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Ryan. This sort of offensive explosion from the Falcons offense wasn\u2019t exactly unexpected, not after Ryan and the Falcons dismantled the vaunted Seattle Seahawks defense last week in the divisional round and after averaging nearly 34 points per game in the regular season. \u201cWe played great today in all three phases,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe knew going against Green Bay and Aaron (Rodgers) that it\u2019s never over.\u201d What was a surprise was the way the Falcons defense made sure the game never turned into the anticipated shootout. The Falcons shut out the Packers in the first half Sunday, forced two turnovers and flustered Aaron Rodgers with well-timed blitzes. Even with the return of No.1 receiver Jordy Nelson, the hottest quarterback in the NFL was still no match for what looks like the NFL\u2019s complete team. JULIO JONES IS A BEAST. 73 yards all the way to the house! \uf631 #GBvsATL #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/Iau1EnDgVJ \u2014 NFL (@NFL) January 22, 2017 \u201cA good defense,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe hurt ourselves early\u2026hurt the momentum for us. Playing a team like that have to start better than that. We had zero points at halftime. Not going to win games like that.\u201d Much of that is a credit to Ryan, the favorite to win the NFL\u2019s MVP award which will be announced on the eve of the Super Bowl. Voting was completed weeks ago, but his performance in the NFC Championship Game only bolstered his case. Ryan\u2019s most emphatic throw might have come after his 14-yard touchdown run, as Ryan celebrated by drilling the ball off the Falcons\u2019 logo on the wall behind the end zone as he was swarmed by his teammates. Yes, this game clearly meant something for Ryan, who had been plagued by questions about his play in big games throughout his career, including four years ago, when the Falcons squandered a 17-point lead after Ryan through two second-half interceptions in a NFC Championship Game loss to the San Francisco 49ers. But what makes Ryan a real threat to lead the Falcons to their first Super Bowl title in two weeks is the cast of offensive players around him. Few offenses in recent memory have had such diversity \u2013 with a scary pair of running backs in Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, who combined for a modest 71 rushing yards against the Packers \u2013 and a deep stable of receivers. Julio Jones is certainly and deservedly the star, which he emphasized Sunday with 180 yards and two jaw-dropping touchdowns, but Ryan connected with seven other Falcons for at least one pass. The Falcons\u2019 offensive diversity should be a model for the Packers, whose eight-game winning streak is over after the team became too one-dimensional around Rodgers. The Packers rushed just 13 times \u2013 including four scrambles by Rodgers, who was the leading rusher with 46 yards. Rodgers threw three touchdowns, even while playing behind an offensive line that lost three players by the fourth quarter and had to use a defensive tackle at guard, but those scores were too late to make the game competitive.

It was so surreal,\" Wojcik said. Police investigate the scene on the 1500 block of West Huron Street in Chicago where three people were shot Sunday morning Jan. 22, 2017.\u00a0 (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Tony Briscoe and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Tucked into the third row of a minivan, talking on FaceTime with a friend, Angela Wojcik wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the conversation of her boyfriend and his acquaintances in the front of the vehicle as it sat parked in West Town on Sunday morning. That was until the percussion of gunfire began. \"The driver was bleeding from the mouth,\" said Wojcik, who lives in the suburbs and spent the previous night out at various clubs in the city. Police later identified the driver as a 26-year-old man who was shot in the lip. \"It was blood over his whole face. It was so surreal,\" Wojcik said. Her\u00a0boyfriend, 30, was hit twice in the right calf. The front passenger, who police said was a 25-year-old man shot in the left shoulder, appeared to be in the worst condition of the three, Wojcik said.\u00a0 \u201cNo one screamed,\u201d Wojcik said. \u201cBut I was FaceTiming with my friend Robert, and he was freaking out.\u201d All three were taken to\u00a0Stroger Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized, police said. It was the second triple shooting of the morning Sunday. The\u00a0other happened\u00a0around 6:30 a.m.\u00a0 Hours later there was\u00a0another shooting with multiple victims, this one leaving\u00a0four people wounded at 12:15 p.m. in the 1800 block of West 63rd Street in the Englewood neighborhood. In all, 10 people were wounded in multiple-victim shootings within less than six hours Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon. \"We've had quite a few multiple-victim incidents this weekend,\" said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. There were six triple shootings from Friday afternoon to early Sunday afternoon, in addition to the quadruple shooting.\u00a0 The most seriously injured in the Englewood shooting was a 26-year-old man who suffered a gunshot wound to the right eye and was taken by a family member to St. Bernard Hospital before being transferred to Stroger Hospital in critical condition, police said. The others wounded were: Another 26-year-old man, shot in the right buttocks and left foot; a\u00a056-year-old woman, shot multiple times in the left leg; and a 48-year-old woman shot in the right hip. All three were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where their conditions were stabilized. The four were in a convenience store when they heard gunshots and ran outside, where four armed men or boys shot\u00a0them, police said. The four attackers got into a white sedan and fled the scene. No one was in custody. Earlier in an attack that only injured one victim, a\u00a0man was shot while driving along the 1100 block of North Lockwood Avenue about 11 a.m., police said.\u00a0 He was traveling north on Lockwood in a 2014 Ford Escape when someone opened fire on his vehicle. He was shot in his left shoulder, arm and ear before crashing his vehicle in the same block, causing his SUV to overturn.\u00a0 He was taken to Stroger, where he was listed in stable condition, officials said. No one\u00a0has been arrested in connection with the shooting and authorities continue to investigate.\u00a0 The shootings come as part of a particularly violent weekend in Chicago, with 29 people shot, three fatally, in a 24-hour period from Saturday to Sunday. From Friday to Saturday, one person was killed and 14 were wounded in shootings across the city.\u00a0 ",

Around 6:30 a.m., there was another triple shooting, officials said. \u00a0 \"We've had quite a few multiple-victim incidents this weekend,\" said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. He said no details about the age, sex or injuries were available in the city's most recent multiple-victim incident.\u00a0 Police unspooled red crime scene tape to rope off a stretch of well-kept brownstones and modernized condos in the 1500 block of West Huron Street, after dozens of 911 calls came in reporting shots fired. The driver, a 26-year-old man, was shot in the lip; a 30-year-old man was hit twice in the right calf. The front passenger, who police said was a 25-year-old man, was shot in the left shoulder.\u00a0All three were taken to\u00a0Stroger Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized, police said. Investigators looked through a white minivan with two apparent bullet holes in the side door and the rear quarter-panel while neighbors hesitantly peeked out of their windows and doorways. Luis Rodriguez, 42, who lives a block away, looked out of his window after hearing gunfire. \"I heard four shots, bam-bam-bam-bam,\" he said. Rodriguez, who has lived in the neighborhood for five years, said the area has a lingering problem with gangs, which has come as a surprise to some of the people who moved into the new developments. \"The house on the corner over there has to repaint every year because they tag it 'SD'\" Rodriguez said, in reference to the Satan Disciples. \"These guys who just moved into these new condos have no idea what's going on,\" he added, as a pregnant woman on the first floor of a building inside the crime scene drew her shades. After experiencing the most deadly year in two decades, Chicagoans like Rodriguez, who is considering buying a bullet-proof vest for personal safety, are disheartened at the violent start of 2017. \"It's not even summer yet and it's only gonna get worse,\" he said. The triple shooting was the second in\u00a0less than three hours, officials said. Three people were shot about 6:30 a.m. Sunday in the 3500 block of South Rhodes Avenue in the Ida B. Wells/Darrow Homes neighborhood. A 22-year-old man was shot in the left leg and was taken by a friend to Mercy Hospital. He was later transferred to Stroger Hospital, where his condition was stabilized. A 24-year-old man was shot in the left leg, and his condition was stabilized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. A 23-year-old woman was shot in the leg, and her condition was stabilized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Estrada said\u00a0there have been a number of triple shootings recently, but it isn't easy to pinpoint exactly why. \"Usually it happens when there's a group all together,\" he said. \"It's one target, and they're firing indiscriminately.\" In East Garfield Park, a 23-year-old man was fatally shot Saturday while he was inside a parked car in the first block of North Sacramento Boulevard, police said. About 11:15 p.m., someone inside a car fired shots at him, wounding him in the left thigh. He was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital. Shortly before 4:55 p.m., a 21-year-old man was shot in the first block of West 104th Place in the Roseland neighborhood. Tremayne Henderson, who lived on the block where the shooting took place, was approached by someone who shot him in the chest. He was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ Medical Center, and he was later pronounced dead at 9:16 p.m., officials said.\u00a0 Earlier Saturday, a 24-year-old man was fatally shot in the Near West Side neighborhood about 1:45 p.m. in the 2600 block of West Monroe Street, police said. According to\u00a0preliminary reports, a 24-year-old man was sitting inside a vehicle when someone approached and shot him in the neck, police said. He was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The man was later identified as Jacob Norwood, of the 800 block of South Karlov Avenue. He was pronounced dead at 2:09 p.m.\u00a0after suffering multiple gunshot wounds, the Cook County medical examiner's office determined Sunday following an autopsy. Two teens were wounded in a shooting about 4:25 a.m. in the East Garfield Park neighborhood.\u00a0 A 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy were standing in the 700 block of North Hamlin Avenue when someone inside a black SUV opened fire, wounding the older teen in the abdomen and the 15-year-old boy in the left shoulder.\u00a0 The 17-year-old boy was in serious condition at Stroger Hospital, and the 15-year-old boy's condition was stabilized at the same hospital.\u00a0 Other shootings: In South Austin, a 27-year-old man was shot in the abdomen and left leg about 3:40 a.m. Sunday in the 500 block of South Central Avenue, police said. Friends took him to Stroger Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition. About 3:20 a.m., a 28-year-old man was shot multiple times in the back while he was sitting in a parked car in the 9600 block of South Peoria Street in the Longwood Manor neighborhood, police said. Someone inside a white sedan shot at the man. His condition was stabilized at Advocate Christ Medical Center.\u00a0 Just before 2:50 a.m., a 23-year-old man was shot in the back of the head while he was in a car in the 6500 block of West Irving Park Road in the Dunning neighborhood. The shooter was inside a black truck, police said. The victim was taken to Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where his condition was stabilized.\u00a0 About 12:20 a.m., a 29-year-old man was sitting in a parked car in the 6100 block of North Winchester Avenue in the West Rogers Park neighborhood when a man approached and shot him. He was shot in both legs and abdomen. His condition was stabilized at Presence St. Francis Hospital.\u00a0 In the East Garfield Park neighborhood, a 26-year-old man was wounded in a drive-by shooting about 10:45 p.m. Saturday, police said. He was standing in the 600 block of North St. Louis Avenue when someone inside a passing black SUV opened fire, wounding him in the right leg. He was taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai Hospital.\u00a0 A 27-year-old man was seriously wounded after he was shot in the abdomen. About 9:40 p.m., officers heard gunfire and found the man on the ground in the 3300 block of West Monroe Street in the Fifth City neighborhood on the West Side.

Trump didn\u2019t agree with some in the intelligence community\u2019s who concluded that Russia influenced the 2016 White House race to help him win. And he argued more recently that somebody within that community leaking an unofficial dossier with alleged damaging personal information about him was like living in \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d Priebus told Fox that \u201cone bad actor\u201d likely leaked the document so Trump wasn\u2019t angry at all of the country\u2019s intelligence officers. \u201cI\u2019m telling you; It was a love fest in there,\u201d Priebus said about Trump\u2019s visit at CIA headquarters that was attended by about 300 staffers. He also suggested that a reporter was at best careless in erroneously reporting that Trump has removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. \u201cIt could have had explosive ramifications. \u2026 It was shoot first, point later,\u201d he said about the inaccurate report, for which the reporter later apologized. Priebus also defended Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s comments Saturday about the news media underreporting the crowd size at Trump\u2019s swearing-in Friday. At a hastily called White House press conference, Spicer angrily accused the media of \u201cfalse reporting\u201d on the inauguration as part of what he called a \u201cshameful\u201d attempt to minimize enthusiasm for Trump. He then left without taking questions. Priebus said Sunday: \u201cThe point is not the crowd. The point is the media is trying to delegitimize the presidency.\" Advertisement ",

By Liz Sly By Liz Sly January 22 at 10:00 AM Follow @LizSly ASTANA, Kazakhstan \u2014 At a time of widespread global anxiety about President Trump\u2019s foreign policy goals, the Middle East stands almost alone in its optimism about his presidency. The United States\u2019 traditional Arab allies are hoping he reengages in the region after years of what they perceive as neglect by Barack Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. rivals are hoping he becomes an ally and aligns with their interests. But after eight years of steady disengagement by his predecessor, Trump may find his room for maneuver constrained by the expanded influence of Russia and Iran , analysts say. \u201cEven if Trump wants to have a more assertive policy, he will not be able to bring America back as the strongest regional player,\u201d predicted Ibrahim Hamidi, the chief diplomatic correspondent of the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat. \u201cThe Americans can\u2019t go back to being the only super\u00adpower anymore.\u201d That Trump does intend to pursue a more assertive Middle East policy has been evident from some of the more consistent of his often contradictory statements, including his inauguration pledge to eradicate what he called \u201cradical Islamic terrorism . . . from the face of the earth.\u201d Although the president and some of his foreign policy nominees appear to have opposing views on some issues \u2014 such as the importance of NATO and whether Russia can be trusted \u2014 they seem to agree on the need to do more to fight the Islamic State and to push back against Iran\u2019s widening influence, making the Middle East one of the few areas on which there appears to be some level of foreign policy consensus. [ As Obama leaves the world stage: Criticism, nostalgia \u2014 and concern over his successor ] It is also one of the areas where the Obama administration\u2019s policies have most noticeably eroded the once unchallenged U.S. role. Russia now holds sway in Syria, has forged a close relationship with Turkey that could threaten Ankara\u2019s ties with NATO and has been courting traditional U.S. allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Most recently, Russia has been exploring relationships in Libya, dispatching its aircraft carrier to the waters off Libya and inviting the erstwhile U.S. ally Khalifa Hifter on board for a video conference with the Russian defense minister this month. Trump\u2019s repeated promises to forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin could facilitate the kind of alliance in the Middle East against terrorists that the Obama administration sought but failed to achieve, said Vladimir Frolov, a columnist with the Moscow Times. But Russia would not want such an alliance to come at the expense of the role it has already carved out for itself in the region. \u201cThe U.S. has been exiting the Middle East under Obama for a while, and with Trump talking about an America First agenda, that creates even more opportunities for Russia to fill the vacuum. We may see a situation where the U.S. actually empowers Russia to do the dirty work in the Middle East,\u201d he said. The constraints are most immediately apparent in Syria, where Russia has taken the lead in promoting a peace initiative that includes Turkey and Iran as co-sponsors but offers no role for the United States. Russia and Turkey have coordinated the agenda and preparatory negotiations for the talks that will begin Monday in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, Astana, Western diplomats say. Turkish, Russian and Iranian officials, U.N. and European diplomats, Syrian rebels and representatives of the Syrian government arrived in Astana for the talks on Sunday. The Trump administration will not be sending a delegation, and instead the United States will be represented by its ambassador in Kazakhstan. Russia will welcome offers of help from Trump to bomb terrorists and perhaps provide funding for reconstruction, but it doesn\u2019t want the United States becoming involved in crafting the terms of a settlement, Frolov said. The Syrian regime is also unlikely to want the United States playing any significant role in the country, which has a long history of fraught relations with Washington, said Salem Zahran, a Beirut-based media entrepreneur who runs media outlets in Syria and has close ties to the Syrian regime. Trump\u2019s statements in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have come as a relief to the Syrian government, signaling an end to the Obama administration\u2019s mantra that Assad should eventually step aside, Zahran said. But the Syrian regime is hoping mostly that the United States stays away, by halting support for the rebels, lifting sanctions and ceasing the calls for Assad to be removed. \u201cTrump is a businessman and if Syria were a company, he would see it as a losing company. Why would anyone invest in a losing company?\u201d Zahran asked. \u201cSyria just wants Trump to be neutral,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that they have Russia, they don\u2019t need America.\u201d [ Iran nuclear deal may not survive the Trump administration ] Iran has more reason to fear the tough anti-Iranian rhetoric that has emanated both from Trump and his foreign policy nominees. But any attempt to push back against Iran would contradict the goals of allying more closely with Russia and Syria \u2014 which are, at least nominally, allied with Iran \u2014 and also run the risk of confrontation. \u201cWhy would Iran respond to anything other than military pressure?\u201d asked Tobias Schneider, a German analyst based in Washington. \u201cIran has won right now. It\u2019s represented everywhere; it\u2019s aligned with the winners everywhere.\u201d Iran has been instrumental in helping Assad survive, sending money and militias to fight on the front lines and securing in the process vast influence over the country. Last week, Tehran signed a series of contracts with Syrian government officials that included giving Iran control over Syria\u2019s largest phosphate mine and a license to operate a mobile telecommunications network. Since the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, Iran has also secured its place as the most influential power in Iraq, said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq who is now with Texas A&M University. Reviving the U.S. role there would not be impossible, he said, but \u201cit would be very, very difficult.\u201d The United States does have staunch allies. Israel is counting on Trump to fulfill his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, which has made Palestinians one of the only groups vociferously opposed to his presidency. The Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria are hoping his pledges to fight the Islamic State will translate into more military assistance for them. [ After a slow and bloody fight against ISIS, Iraqi forces pick up the pace in Mosul ] The United States also still holds important levers in the Middle East, notably its big military presence in the Persian Gulf and its economic might, neither of which Russia can match, said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia that blame Obama for the rising power of Iran are looking forward to an administration that might more closely mirror their priorities, he said. \u201cThe Gulf states need the United States as a counterbalance to Iran. You need to reestablish confidence that you are really going to back your allies,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that needs radical change, but it does need a steady, patient, consistent effort.\u201d But whether Trump is a leader who will provide patience and consistency is a concern for some in the region, Hamidi said. \u201cThe scary thing is that to pave a way for an American role in the upcoming years needs vision and imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this vision, you might find yourself in confrontation. Or, completely giving up and handing it all to Russia.\u201d ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Ashley Judd crashed a Women's March after-party Saturday night following her fiery reading of a poem at the protest in Washington earlier in the day. And she quickly hit back at those who found issue with the poem, written by\u00a019-year-old Nina Donovan . \"I got it from the president of the United States,\" she said of the provocative wording, specifically the use of the P word, famously uttered by President Trump in a 2005 video that caught him bragging about grabbing women by their genitalia. \"I'm just quoting him. And I am really more entitled to the word because I've actually got one.\" Ashley Judd onstage during the Women's March on Washington. \u00a0(Photo: Theo Wargo, Getty Images) Judd took the stage at the 9:30 Club during an official after-party, billed as \"Laugh. Dance ... then Get to Work!\" and hosted by Funny or Die and benefiting Planned Parenthood. She joined Ani DiFranco and Lizzy Caplan as unexpected but\u00a0welcomed guests by the crowd, on top of a full lineup that also featured rock band Sleater-Kinney and The National. The sold-out crowd, decked in pink Pussyhats ,\u00a0ate up the \"nasty women\" lines\u00a0which Judd recapped, including some blunt talk about women's periods.

Four people died in the storm. John Fitzhugh/Biloxi Sun Herald/TNS via Getty Images Overnight in southern Georgia, near the border with Florida, severe weather turned deadly. At least 11 people were killed and 23 more were injured as the area was racked with storms, according to local officials. Now, Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency Sunday morning for seven counties in the state. \"These storms have devastated communities and homes in South Central Georgia, and the state is making all resources available to the impacted areas,\" Deal said in a statement. Deal continued: \"I urge all Georgians to exercise caution and vigilance in order to remain safe and prevent further loss of life or injuries.\" In his opening remarks at a Sunday swearing-in ceremony for senior White House staff, President Trump said that he had spoken with Deal earlier in the day. He had expressed his \"sincere condolences for the lives taken,\" Trump said, adding that people in Georgia have \"suffered greatly\" from the storms. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency has also issued a warning that there is \"a HIGH RISK for severe weather\" for much of the state Sunday. Article continues after sponsorship The deaths overnight in southern Georgia occurred in Cook, Brooks and Berrien counties, according to Catherine Howden of the GEMA. National Weather Service Atlanta had issued a flash flood watch and a tornado watch in the region Saturday, but officials could not clarify further whether tornadoes were to blame for the loss of life overnight. This is not the first time the weather turned deadly in the Southeast this weekend. As WABE's Elly Yu reports, at least four people died when a tornado swept through southern Mississippi.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt would be a lot of fun to watch,\u201d he said of the lawsuit, \u201cbut I imagine it will be kicked out.\u201d Mr. Eisen said the legal team intended to use the lawsuit to try to get a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s federal tax returns, which are needed to properly assess what income or other payments or loans Mr. Trump has received from foreign governments. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is a liberal group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which until recently was controlled by David Brock, a Democratic Party operative and fervent supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Eisen now serves as chairman of the organization\u2019s board, and Mr. Painter is vice chairman. The lawsuit may run into trouble, other legal experts said, given that CREW, as the organization is known, must demonstrate that it would suffer direct and concrete injury to give it standing to sue. The group says it has suffered harm by having to divert resources from other work to monitor and respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s activities. For example, the group said, it has answered hundreds of questions from news organizations. In a 1982 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a civil rights organization had standing to sue because its use of black \u201ctesters\u201d to see whether landlords and home sellers were abiding by federal law had hurt its ability to conduct other activities. But in recent decades, and outside the context of civil rights violations, the court has often been skeptical of broad assertions of standing. Regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s fate, it is just the first hint of the legal assault that the Trump administration will face. Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said it was separately looking for plaintiffs to file a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause. It hopes to find a hotel or bed-and-breakfast that might compete against a Trump hotel as a party that might have standing to sue. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The A.C.L.U. filed an extensive Freedom of Information Act request on Thursday asking the Justice Department, the General Services Administration and the Office of Government Ethics for all legal opinions and memos they have prepared addressing potential financial or ethical conflicts that Mr. Trump might face. It could perhaps use those documents in litigation against the Trump administration. CREW separately filed a complaint with the General Services Administration on Friday over a provision that appears to prohibit the leasing of the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to an elected federal official. The building is the site of Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel. Perhaps more important, the legal groups said they may challenge executive actions Mr. Trump is expected to take on topics like international trade deals, illegal immigration and climate change. ",

Animated infographic shows how debris flows and deep-seated landslides happen Animated infographic shows how debris flows and deep-seated landslides happen Rong-Gong Lin II , Rosanna Xia and Raoul Ranoa Contact Reporters Through five years of severe drought, El Capitan Canyon above\u00a0the Pacific Ocean near\u00a0Goleta\u00a0endured bone-dry conditions that at times seemed like they would\u00a0never end. Then, on Friday, the skies opened up. Nearly 2\u00a0inches of rain dropped in a single\u00a0hour in the Santa Ynez Mountains.\u00a0 So a\u00a0creek that had once disappeared came roaring alive, full of mud, brush and broken trees pouring from the burned slopes of the \u00a0Sherpa fire in the summer.\u00a0 Five cabins were lifted off their foundations and swept down the creek. The\u00a0muddy torrent claimed 22 vehicles. One of the cabin\u2019s remains were found south of the 101 Freeway.\u00a0Nearly two dozen people had to be rescued,\u00a0including one trapped in a car, said Santa Barbara County fire Capt. Dave Zaniboni. The remains of five smashed vehicles floated all the way down to the beach.\u00a0 What happened in a matter of minutes at the campground is emblematic of the drought -to-deluge cycle\u00a0that has always been at the heart of California\u2019s climate. All it can take is an intense amount of rain in a short amount of time to create damaging flows of mud and\u00a0debris that can kill people and destroy buildings.\u00a0 The flows are part of nature. But the situation has become\u00a0more dangerous as humans came to inhabit these paths of destruction. \u201cThere\u2019s a competition between the growth of the mountains and the erosion from the rainstorms,\u201d\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Jason Kean said. \u201cThey\u2019re in this constant battle.\u201d Flood waters and a debris flow sweep away cabins and vehicles at El Capitan Canyon Resort & Campground in Santa Barbara County Friday. Mike Eliason / Santa Barbara County Fire Flood waters and a debris flow sweep away cabins and vehicles at El Capitan Canyon Resort & Campground in Santa Barbara County Friday. Flood waters and a debris flow sweep away cabins and vehicles at El Capitan Canyon Resort & Campground in Santa Barbara County Friday. (Mike Eliason / Santa Barbara County Fire) California\u2019s dramatic shift in the last few months \u2014\u00a0from extreme dryness to some of the strongest storms in a decade \u2014\u00a0has brought mudslides that have closed roads, damaged vehicles and homes and left residents on edge. On Friday night,\u00a0Highway 17 \u2014\u00a0the key route between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz \u2014\u00a0was closed for hours after sliding mud and a fallen tree blocked all southbound lanes, causing a commuter nightmare. One Sierra highway alone has endured nearly 20 major slides. And a\u00a0rare warm winter storm two weeks ago sent rains that deposited 10,000 cubic yards of decomposed granite that shut down all westbound lanes of Interstate 80 west of Lake Tahoe\u00a0for more than 12 hours.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s truly a battle,\u201d Caltrans spokeswoman Liza Whitmore said.\u00a0 The situation is expected to get worse in Southern California on Sunday, when a storm \u2014\u00a0which could be the most powerful to strike the region since 2010\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 moves in. Officials have warned of mudslides and mudflows. Why do\u00a0landslides happen during a storm? In a burned area , a wildfire can make the soils repellent to water, creating a floodlike flow on the ground that picks up rock and debris, Kean said.\u00a0 In an area that has not burned, soil can become saturated. Pressure builds up underground, and soil starts\u00a0moving\u00a0and begins picking up mud and debris as it starts flowing downhill. Water rushing down with only mud is called a mud flow. If the flow picks up rocks, branches and sometimes massive boulders, that\u2019s called a debris flow.\u00a0 This debris flow on Jan. 8, 2017 was caused by a warm winter storm that dumped rain on the Sierra, sending a flow of water and decomposed granite to wash over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit. California Highway Patrol This debris flow on Jan. 8, 2017 was caused by a warm winter storm that dumped rain on the Sierra, sending a flow of water and decomposed granite to wash over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit. This debris flow on Jan. 8, 2017 was caused by a warm winter storm that dumped rain on the Sierra, sending a flow of water and decomposed granite to wash over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit. (California Highway Patrol) Mud and debris flows are types of shallow landslides , generally defined as less than 15 feet deep.\u00a0 Another type of shallow landslide involves a saturated hillside that collapses but does not move very far, such as one that buries a roadway with dirt and rocks from a neighboring slope. They can happen up to an hour after a burst of intense rain.\u00a0\u201cThere were widespread shallow landslides as recently as 2005\u201d in Southern California, Kean said.\u00a0 What\u2019s the easiest type of landslide to predict? Landslides that strike in recently burned areas are the easiest to predict, as wildfires have burned away roots of trees and vegetation that had kept soils in place. Sometimes, authorities have accurately predicted when debris flows will occur, based on forecast rainfall rates, and have called for evacuations of homes before the rivers of mud and debris begin flowing. Can debris flow still catch people off guard? Yes. In 2010, the winter after the worst fire in L.A. County history, a debris flow \u2014 which one resident described like a \u201c Niagara Falls \u201d \u2014 flowed down La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\u2019s northernmost neighborhood when a 10-ton boulder clogged a critical basin, plugging up the drain like a giant stopper. More than 40 homes were damaged. It came as a surprise because the storm was supposed to be fast moving, but unexpectedly stalled and dumped rain at an alarming rate. The forecast that authorities had relied on in the days leading up to the three-day storm had called for a light to moderate rains. No evacuations had been ordered. A debris flow hit La Canada Flintridge in 2010. Mud and debris came rushing through an entire house on Manistee Drive. Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times A debris flow hit La Canada Flintridge in 2010. Mud and debris came rushing through an entire house on Manistee Drive. A debris flow hit La Canada Flintridge in 2010. Mud and debris came rushing through an entire house on Manistee Drive. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) How much rainfall is needed to trigger mud or debris flow? In Southern California\u2019s unburned areas, 10 inches of rainfall during the winter is needed to nearly saturate the ground. After that point, a burst of rain of just one-quarter of an inch an hour can trigger widespread shallow landslides, including debris flow, Kean said.\u00a0 Since July 1, downtown Los Angeles has received 11.33 inches of rain as of Friday, which is 178% of average at this point of the winter. Santa Barbara has received 12.03 inches, which is 149% of average.\u00a0 But for burned areas, mud and debris flows can strike with only intense rainfall, even if the ground is not saturated. What\u2019s the least predictable type of landslide? The kind that can strike on a dry day. In areas where the bedrock is very deep, rainwater can seep deep underground during multiple rainstorms. During a series of repeated heavy storms, water can eventually start to accumulate and build up pressure, Kean said. The pressure can destabilize an entire chunk of land, causing it to collapse downhill. The landslide can happen slowly, and show warning signs like cracking or subtle movements, allowing people time to escape. But they can also strike rapidly with no warning, even on a rainless day months after the end of winter. This is called a deep-seated landslide, involving landslides greater than 15 feet deep. Often, deep-seated landslides strike in areas with a history of such events. The USGS has warned that such\u00a0\u00a0landslides can become active many months after a very wet winter. A deep-seated landslide struck Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach in 2005. Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times A deep-seated landslide struck Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach in 2005. A deep-seated landslide struck Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach in 2005. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) What\u2019s an example of a deep-seated landslide? An example of where a deep-seated landslide has occurred is Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach. One occurred on a foggy morning in June 2005 after heavy rains fell between the previous December through February. No rainfall occurred during or just before the landslide. Seventeen homes were destroyed and 11 seriously damaged. There has been a history of devastating landslides in Bluebird Canyon. The neighborhood suffered a slide in October 1978 that destroyed more than 20 homes. The California Division of Mines and Geology said the heavy rains between December 1977 through April 1978 are believed to have played a role, along with a history of landslides and erosion at the site, and weakness in the rock. What about the coastal hamlet of La Conchita in Ventura County? Did landslides there\u00a0come as surprises? The first landslide, in March 1995, came as no surprise, Ventura County geologist Jim O\u2019Tousa said. The summer before, officials had observed ground cracks and other signs of a pending landslide. A sheriff\u2019s official was assigned to patrol the area, and town meetings were held to prepare the community for what was coming. Then about 24 inches of rain hit the region in January \u2014 way above the average of about 4 inches for that month. \u00a0The slide hit March 2. The slopes started sliding at a pace so slow that residents could outrun it. The patrol officer was still knocking on doors as the ground was moving and got everyone down the hill in time, O\u2019Tousa recalled. \u201cThe groundwater finally built up to a high enough level to destabilize the slope,\u201d O\u2019Tousa said. A deep-seated landslide buried 10 people, killing them, in 2005 in La Conchita. Stephen Osman / Los Angeles Times A deep-seated landslide buried 10 people, killing them, in 2005 in La Conchita. A deep-seated landslide buried 10 people, killing them, in 2005 in La Conchita. (Stephen Osman / Los Angeles Times) The second landslide in 2005 occurred at the end of an intense 15-day rainy period that saw heavy precipitation throughout Southern California. This slide came with no warning, and buried 10 people, killing them. The 2005 landslide was actually a \u201cremobilization of part of the 1995 slide,\u201d O\u2019Tousa said. The 1995 landslide had fractured and was sitting in the bottom of the canyon, he explained. Then in 2005, when enough water saturated the bottom of the canyon, the material came flushing out of the canyon \u2014 a speed of 20 mph \u2014 and flowed into the neighborhood where the fatalities occurred. What about cliffs that fall into the sea? Last winter, California saw cliffs erode into the sea in Pacifica, about a 15-mile drive south of San Francisco. There, apartment units have been ordered vacated because of the crumbling coastline. Pacifica has some of the weakest soils along the California coast composed of cliffs, USGS research civil engineer Brian Collins said. The cliffs are being attacked from both the bottom and on top from water. At its base, the ocean is eroding the cliffs. When heavy rains come from above, water seeps into the soils, and eventually exits when it reaches less permeable layers. The nature of this seepage weakens the bonds in the soil that keep the soil particles bonded together, \u201cso it collapses,\u201d Collins said. The coast in this region has been eroding for thousands of years. As sea levels have risen, the ocean has eroded the cliffs. And the San Andreas fault has been lifting the cliffs up, only for them to be taken down by the seas and the rain.\u00a0 Caption Huge crowds converge on Washington, D.C., for Women's March on Washington Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Caption Huge crowds converge on Washington, D.C., for Women's March on Washington Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Caption Recap: Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C.

    "text": "Trump's Cabinet picks face questions from both parties; McConnell 'confident' Published               January 22, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Senate is expected on Monday to hold its confirmation vote on President Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director, Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo. But the chamber\u2019s Republican and Democratic leaders this weekend offered sharply different perspectives about the future of the president\u2019s 20-plus Cabinet nominees. Top Senate Democrats on Friday postponed Pompeo\u2019s vote saying they wouldn\u2019t rush through the conformation process for Trump and fellow Republicans who control Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that several of Trump\u2019s remaining nominees will be subject to \u201ca thorough debate.\u201d The New York Democrat said he was \u201cdubious\u201d about eight or nine of Trump's picks -- citing potential conflicts of interests and policy stands. The Senate has so far confirmed just two Trump nominees. Gens. James Mattis, as defense secretary, and John Kelly, as Homeland Security secretary on Friday, when Trump was sworn-in as president. However, Senate Democrats have little chance of blocking a confirmation unless some chamber Republicans defect. Senate Republicans have a 52-to-48 majority and need only a simple majority of 51 to confirm a nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed confidence Sunday about having enough votes to get all of Trump\u2019s nominees confirmed. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll be able to confirm the president\u2019s entire Cabinet,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m optimistic.\u201d The prospects for former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson becoming secretary of state improved this weekend when two influential Republican senators expressed support, after having waivered over Tillerson\u2019s past professional ties to Russia. \"Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,\" Sens. John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, said in a joint statement. Tillerson also faces a vote Monday, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. McCain, Graham and fellow GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida, have questioned whether Tillerson has too many conflicts of interests to champion U.S. policy abroad, especially in Russia. As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson spoke out against U.S. sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The penalties cost the energy giant hundreds of millions of dollars. The episode became even more of a concern after the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House race. McCain and Graham are not on the Foreign Relations committee, like Rubio. However all three will cast a final vote on the Tillerson nomination, if he gets enough votes Monday in the committee, which has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats. Graham told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that he was persuaded to back Tillerson after they met privately.\u00a0 According to Graham, Tillerson told him \"when America doesn't lead, other people will, and the vacuum is always filled by bad actors. He said that we have to have a foreign policy that engages the world. We need to lead from the front.\" McCain said on ABC's \"This Week\" that he talked to Tillerson about his views on Russia and his duty heading a major corporation. \u201cThis wasn't an easy call,\" McCain said. \"But I also believe that, when there's doubt, the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt.\" Rubio, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination last year, clashed with Tillerson at a hearing earlier this month. Rubio bristled at Tillerson's refusal to label Putin a \"war criminal\" or condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He also chided Tillerson over the need for \"moral clarity.\" Hours after Trump was sworn in on Friday, Rubio was tight-lipped, saying he would make his decision \"certainly before the vote\" Monday and that Tillerson's responses to written questions had addressed \"some of\" his concerns. Still, a \"no\" vote from Rubio would not doom Tillerson's confirmation, because the nomination could go directly to the Senate floor even without a positive committee recommendation. But it would be an embarrassing rebuke to Trump just as his presidency gets under way, with questions swirling about his ties to Russia.

British leader won't say Published               January 22, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print In this file photo dated Monday, Dec. 4, 1989, a Trident II missile launched by the U.S. Navy during a performance evaluation from the submerged submarine USS Tennessee in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Canaveral in Titusville, Fla., USA \u00a0(AP Photo/Phil Sandlin, FILE) LONDON \u2013 \u00a0The British government is being accused of concealing the failure of an unarmed ballistic\u00a0missile\u00a0launch ahead of a debate in Parliament over whether to refurbish the country's aging Trident nuclear launching system. Britain's prime minister refused to say Sunday whether she knew about an unarmed Trident\u00a0missile\u00a0that reportedly failed when it was test-fired off the coast of Florida last year. Theresa May told BBC she has total confidence in Britain's Trident nuclear launching system, but didn't confirm or deny a newspaper report about the alleged failure of a ballistic\u00a0missile\u00a0designed to carry nuclear warheads. The prime minister was asked about the\u00a0missile\u00a0test after the Sunday Times reported that an unarmed\u00a0missile\u00a0launched from a submarine off Florida's coast in June veered off course and may have headed toward the U.S. The newspaper said top government officials decided to keep the failure of a Trident II D5 ballistic\u00a0missile\u00a0out of the public eye because of an upcoming debate the next month in Parliament over whether to spend 40 billion pounds to refurbish the aging Trident, the cornerstone of Britain's nuclear deterrent system. \"I have absolute faith in our Trident\u00a0missiles,\" May said Sunday when asked if she had known about a possible\u00a0missile\u00a0failure when she spoke to Parliament in July. \"When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident, whether or not we should have Trident\u00a0missiles.\" The government triumphed in that debate, winning overwhelming support for the Trident overhaul in July, but some opposition figures in the British government now seek an inquiry into the reported\u00a0missile\u00a0failure and a possible cover-up. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon, who opposes having the Trident submarine fleet based in Scotland, said reports of a failure and cover-up are a \"hugely serious issue.\" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, also a Trident opponent, called it \"a pretty catastrophic error.\" The British government hasn't confirmed the newspaper's report of a misfire. A government statement posted on a Defense Ministry blog indicated there was a \"routine unarmed Trident\u00a0missile\u00a0test launch from HMS Vengeance\" in June. The Royal Navy launch was \"part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew,\" the statement said. The Vengeance submarine and its crew were \"successfully tested and certified,\" it said. The statement says the government does not provide further details on submarine operations for \"obvious\" national security reasons. The British government's website says Trident has provided Britain's security every day for the last 46 years. The system consists of Vanguard-class submarines which can carry up to 16 Trident ballistic\u00a0missiles\u00a0armed with nuclear warheads. Defense policy calls for one of the submarines to be on patrol at all times. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Adam Elmahrek and Joseph Serna Contact Reporters The latest and most powerful in a series of three winter storms slammed into California on Sunday, flooding roads, forcing evacuations in communities near burn areas and adding more snow in mountains from the Sierra Nevada\u00a0to the San Bernardinos.\u00a0 Numerous roads around Southern California were flooded by sustained bursts of intense rain. The 710 Freeway flooded near Pacific Coast Highway, and the 110 Freeway experienced high water near Torrance. Numerous surface streets were also blocked by standing water and fallen trees. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for a large swath of the region, including the South Bay, harbor area, Long Beach, Anaheim,\u00a0Santa Ana and the Inland Empire. Several people had been rescued from cars in flooded intersections, and thousands have lost power. Forecasters had been warning this storm could be the strongest in Southern California in seven years, and it appears to be delivering. While earlier storms produced periods of heavy showers, this storm has\u00a0delivered several hours of pounding rain, which has caused the street flooding.\u00a0 The heaviest rain was hitting Sunday afternoon and evening, with forecasters anticipating as much as an inch per hour during the storm\u2019s peak, said Stuart Seto, weather specialist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\u00a0Some areas will see up to 3 inches of rain by the end of the day, Seto said. Evacuation orders were issued for burn areas in Glendora, Duarte, Silverado Canyon in Orange County and parts of Santa Barbara County. The city of Glendora issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents adjacent to the burn area of the 2014 Colby fire . The order affects about 1,000 homes in an area bounded by the Little Dalton Wash, Sierra Madre Avenue and Yucca Ridge Road. Officials established an evacuation center at the Teen Center at 214 W. Dawson Ave. Also Sunday, the city of Duarte issued evacuation orders for residents living in the areas burned in last\u00a0year\u2019s Fish fire in the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa. An evacuation center was set up at the Duarte Community Center at 1600 Huntington Drive. The city of Santa Clarita issued evacuation notices Saturday evening for about 120 homes in the vicinity of last year\u2019s Sand fire. The affected area is bounded by\u00a0Placerita Canyon to the south, Sand Canyon to the west and Iron Canyon to\u00a0the north. Fast moving waters flooded\u00a0several roads leading to the Val Verde area Sunday afternoon, where residents are being urged to shelter in place. An evacuation center was set up at Canyon High School, 19300 Nadal St. Animals may be taken to the Castaic Animal Shelter at 31044 Charlie Canyon Road. Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday National Weather Service Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday (National Weather Service) Residents are urged to visit the county\u2019s storm season website at www.lacounty.gov/LARain for additional information. Most of Southern California is under a flash flood watch. The city of Hermosa Beach closed its pier as a precaution because of high surf and it will remain closed until further notice, said Sgt. Mick Gaglia\u00a0of the Hermosa Beach Police Department. Orange County officials were also bracing Sunday for possible flooding, particularly in Silverado Canyon, which is still recovering from a fire in 2014. Extra emergency crews have been brought in to help, including a bulldozer operator and two additional swift-water rescue teams. \u00a0 \u201cThe ground still remains pretty saturated and \u2026 it can be problematic,\u201d said Capt. Alan Wilkes, of the Orange County Fire Authority. \u201cWe just want to be ahead of [any problems].\u201d During the heaviest period of rain on Sunday, coastal areas are expected to see up to an inch of rain, the San Fernando Valley up to 1\u00bd inches, the San Gabriel Mountains up to 2\u00bc\u00a0inches, and downtown Los Angeles up to 1\u2153 inches.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s shaping up to be the strongest storm of the season,\u201d said Carol Smith, of the National Weather Service. A Southern California Edison official\u00a0said Sunday morning that about 5,500 customers in its service area have lost power as a result of the storm. The worst outages are in the San Bernardino Mountains, where 1,500\u00a0customers have lost power, said spokeswoman Susan Cox.\u00a0 Flooding forced road closures across the region. All lanes of northbound and southbound traffic along the\u00a0110 Freeway at 223rd Street has been halted due\u00a0to flooding.\u00a0A weather-related rockslide that occurred Friday has kept Malibu Canyon Road closed into Sunday afternoon, said Officer Elizabeth Kravig, spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.\u00a0 Thunderstorm conditions will ease slightly late Sunday into\u00a0Monday. But the rainfall is expected to continue until Tuesday and end sometime before noon. All told, the storm system is expected to generate 4 to 6 inches of rainfall over the next three days, with the most rainfall in the foothill and mountain areas. Clearer skies and temperatures in the mid to high 60s are expected to return beginning Friday.\u00a0 The storm is also expected to hit the Sierra Nevada\u00a0hard. The weather service warned of \u201ccrippling snow amounts on top of existing snow cover\u201d and urged\u00a0residents to stock up on food, water and firewood, and \u201cessentially prepare for being stranded at home for multiple days.\u201d Power outages are likely, and mature trees are expected to\u00a0fall. It\u2019s possible that residents could endure multiple-day power outages, failures of carports and decks, and avalanches. As of Sunday morning, there was flooding reported in some areas including Santa Cruz County. Snow\u00a0once again closed Interstate 80 in the Sierras, where a new avalanche warning was issued. For the second time in as many days, mudslides closed Highway 17, the main route between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz. The forecast is heightening concerns about mudslides and flooding across the state. Another powerful storm that hit California on Friday caused numerous road closures and mudslides in areas burned by recent fires, including a major incident near Santa Barbara\u00a0that destroyed cabins\u00a0and cars, and forced rescues. The storm is expected to peak on Sunday, with thunderstorms possible and continuing into Monday. ",

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gathered the press to deliver a five-minute statement Saturday in which he issued multiple falsehoods, declaring erroneously the number of people who used the D.C. metro on Friday, that there was a change in security measures this year and that \"this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\" Spicer said Saturday. However, crowd size experts told the New York Times they estimated Trump's audience at fewer than 200,000 people, and widely distributed side-by-side photographs showed the stark contrast between the comparatively sparse crowd for Trump's inauguration and the record-setting crowd for Obama's first. Asked on \"Meet the Press\" why Spicer used his first appearance before the press to dispute a minimal issue like the inauguration crowd size, and why he used falsehoods to do so, Conway pushed back. \"You're saying it's a falsehood and Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,\" she told NBC's Chuck Todd. She then went on to echo Spicer's claim on Saturday that it wasn't possible to count the crowd, despite Trump's team's accompanying insistence that it was the \"largest audience.\" \"I don't think you can prove those numbers one way or another. There's no way to quantify crowd numbers,\" Conway said. Conway also suggested that Todd's insistence on asking why Spicer delivered a demonstrably false statement could affect the White House's treatment of the media. \"If we're going to keep referring to the press secretary in those types of terms I think we're going to have to rethink our relationship here,\" she said.

At least 14 people died and around two dozen were injured in Georgia from tornadoes early Sunday morning, following four tornado-related deaths that occurred in Mississippi on Saturday morning. According to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, three people died in Dougherty County near Albany, seven in Cook County near Adel, and two people died in both Berrien and Brooks counties. Branden Camp/AP Photo Marilyn Bullard makes her way to her parents home that was damaged by a tornado, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Georgia. After storms ripped through the region overnight, more tornado watches were issued today for the Panhandle of Florida and southern Alabama, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency has issued a state of emergency for the seven south central Georgia counties impacted by the storm. \"The National Weather Service predicts a third wave of severe weather today, which may reach as far north as metro Atlanta. I urge all Georgians to exercise caution and vigilance in order to remain safe and prevent further loss of life or injuries,\" Gov. Nathan Deal said in a statement. Branden Camp/AP Photo Jenny Bullard carries a pair of boots from her home that was damaged by a tornado, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Georgia. President Trump expressed condolences to the people of Georgia affected by the tornadoes to the press today from the White House. \"I want to start off by telling you I just spoke with Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia, great state, great people,\" Trump said. \"Florida affected, Alabama affected by the tornadoes, and just expressed our sincere condolences for the lives taken.\" Trump added that the tornadoes \"were vicious and powerful and strong,\" and said that people suffered as a result of them. \"So we'll be helping out the state of Georgia,\" Trump added. Images on social media showed telephone poles cracked in half, and what looked like entire streets torn apart by the storms that have churned through the South this weekend.

In the area of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where at least four people died, a large tornado leveled homes and buildings, trapping residents in their homes, authorities said. Further north in Choctaw County, Mississippi, on Saturday at least four people were injured and at least 20 homes damaged from a possible tornado, according to the National Weather Service.

    "text": "Trump, Amid Combative Start, Pledges to Rise to Moment By jonathan lemire, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 22, 2017, 7:06 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press President Donald Trump speaks at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va., Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) 0 Shares Email After a combative start to his presidency, Donald Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was ready to begin governing a divided nation. Trump began rolling out his plans for diplomatic outreach, speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and announcing plans for early meetings with Netanyahu and other world leaders. He thanked top law enforcement officers for their service and support. And he swore-in a group of aides, telling them he believed they were ready to rise to a daunting task. \"But with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\" Trump said in a ceremony in the White House East Room. \"We will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\" Trump's reassurance came after a day marked by global protests against his presidency and his own complaints about media coverage of his inauguration, a combination of events that made for a contentious first full day in office on Saturday. But even as the White House tried to forge forward, the president's aides continued to defend the president and his press secretary, both of whom tore into journalists for accurately reporting that his swearing-in ceremony drew a smaller crowd than President Barack Obama did eight years ago. On Sunday, a top adviser said the Trump administration was supplying \"alternative facts.\" \"There's no way to really quantify crowds. We all know that. You can laugh at me all you want,\" Kellyanne Conway told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" She added: \"I think it's actually symbolic of the way we're treated by the press.\" Trump on Saturday declared he believed \"it looked like a million and a half people.\" But ridership on the Washington's Metro system didn't match that of recent inaugurations. As of 11 a.m. Friday, there were 193,000 trips taken, according to the transportation service's Twitter account. At the same hour eight years ago, there had been 513,000 trips. Four years later, there were 317,000 for Obama's second inauguration. Conway also declared that Trump will not release his tax returns now that he's taken office, breaking a promise he made during the campaign. As a candidate, he said he would release his returns after an IRS audit was completed. Every president since 1976 has released the information, but Conway said she does not believe Americans care whether Trump follows suit. \"He's not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care,\" Conway said on ABC's \"This Week.\" Trump's advisers have set Monday up as the president's first major day of action on his sweeping campaign promises, but as of Sunday night, it appeared as though his team was still making decisions on what moves to make. Some congressional Republicans had expected Trump to sign orders over the weekend, but those never materialized. Trump campaigned on a very specific 18-point plan for this first day in office. If he follows it, he could sign executive orders on immigration, trade and national security . Trump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama's executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as children. He's due to begin formally discussing his agenda Monday at a meeting with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders. Trump's early call to Netanyahu was aimed at signaling his support for Israel and a new start in a relationship that became increasingly fraught during the Obama administration. Trump described that conversation as \"very nice.\" White House officials said Trump \"affirmed his unprecedented commitment to Israel's security.\" The leaders agree to meet at the White House in early February. Trump announced that he's set up meetings with the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto. \"We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\" he said of his meeting with Mexico, along with immigration and security at the border. Trump has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it. The new president showed he was clinging to some of his pre-presidential habits. He responded to Saturday's protests on Twitter, offering a scattershot response. In one tweet, he sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defended demonstrators' rights a short time later. \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,\" Trump tweeted early Sunday morning. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone. \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\" the president tweeted, still using his personal account. The dueling tweets marked his administration's first response to the more than 1 million people who rallied at women's marches in Washington and cities across the world. Hundreds of protesters lined the street as Trump's motorcade drove past on Saturday afternoon, with many screaming and chanting. The Washington rally appeared to attract more people than attended Trump's inauguration on Friday, but there were no completely comparable numbers. Regional transportation officials tweeted on Sunday that 1,001,616 trips were taken on the rail system on Saturday. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel had said that on Friday, the day of Donald Trump's inauguration, just over 570,000 trips were taken on the rail system. Trump, whose 12th wedding anniversary was Sunday, also attended a reception for law enforcement officers and first responders who helped with his inauguration. He singled out the work of FBI Director James Comey, whom he offered a handshake and hug. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Julie Pace contributed reporting. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Lerer at http://twitter.com/@llerer 0 Shares ",

    "text": "View slideshow Updated at 6:10 p.m. ET As the Women's March on Washington has swelled in support, attracting attention and supporters in the lead-up to Saturday's demonstrations, its name has become something of a misnomer. Women's March Floods Washington, Sparking Rallies Worldwide Sister marches have been organized in all 50 states, several U.S. territories and countries around the world. They have tried to express solidarity with the aims of the original march: opposition to President Trump's agenda, and support of women's rights and human rights in general. Given the quirks of time zones, many of those marches kicked off before the event that inspired them. In Sydney, London, New Delhi, and other cities, demonstrators broke out their signs and pink hats before even their compatriots in D.C. could. Straight from NPR and member station reporters on the ground: Here's a glimpse of the marches Saturday \u2014 across the country, and around the world. Boston Tens of thousands participated in the Boston Women's March, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Marty Walsh (bottom right). Meredith Nierman/WGBH hide caption toggle caption Meredith Nierman/WGBH \"It is shoulder to shoulder\" in Boston Common, WBUR's Deborah Becker tells Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday. She describes the rally there as a \"sea of pink,\" referring to the pink knit caps that have become distinctive of the Women's March on Washington. The caps have come to be known as \"pussyhats,\" in reference to a tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women by grabbing their genitals. Deborah reports that the message of the Boston protesters is one of solidarity with the primary march in Washington. They bear signs not only protesting Trump, but supporting a range of issues \u2014 from climate science to women's access to abortion and birth control. Both Massachusetts senators, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, addressed the rally in Boston. \"I'm here to fight back!\" Warren told the crowd. \"We are in marches to say we are fighting back. That's who we are.\" Article continues after sponsorship Chicago Protesters make their way through Chicago during the city's women's march. John Gress/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption John Gress/Getty Images In what the Chicago Tribune is reporting to be the largest crowd outside of Washington , Chicagoans gathered at Grant Park on Saturday morning with plans for a rally, followed by a march. In the end, the march portion of the event was cancelled by the organizers when they determined there were too many people to march safely. \"Our march route is flooded. There is no safe way to march. We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhmer told the crowd, according to the Tribune. If participants were disappointed, they didn't show it. Organizer Liz Radford told the crowd, \"We called, and you came. We have flooded the march route. We have flooded Chicago.\" London Source: NPR Credit: Frank Langfitt Thousands marched through the British capital Saturday in what was billed as a women's march, but was ostensibly an anti-Trump rally. Marchers walked about 2 miles from the U.S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square to Trafalgar Square, within eyesight of Big Ben. The event ran for more than three hours and the size of the crowds easily dwarfed political rallies in the lead-up to last summer's Brexit vote here. As in other cities around the world, protesters carried signs criticizing America's 45th president. Many signs read \"We Shall Overcomb,\" referring to the U.S. president's signature hair-style. \"Trump Special Relationship? Just Say No,\" read others, referring to the historically close diplomatic ties between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Many in this cosmopolitan, multicultural city \u2014 which voted heavily against the U.K. leaving the European Union \u2014 were already upset by Trump's election in November. The president's \"America first\" inaugural speech only fueled alarm here. In Inaugural Address, Trump Decries 'Carnage' And Promises 'America First' A British software engineer named David said he watched the speech with officemates yesterday in stunned silence. \"It was a harrowing, chilling experience,\" David said, as he stood in front of London's National Gallery overlooking the rally in Trafalgar Square. \"The sense of nationalism and protectionism was there and there was quite a sinister undercurrent.\" David, who did not offer his last name, said he was disturbed by the insularity of the Trump's address, elements of which reminded him of the positions espoused by the political far-right here in the U.K. \"There is a movement in Britain called 'Britain first,' \" he said, \"which is a terrifying, horrible right-wing group.\" The march in London was among a number of anti-Trump rallies across Western Europe on Saturday, including cities such as Berlin, Paris, Belfast and Copenhagen. Los Angeles Participants hold signs as they wait for the start of the women's march in Los Angeles. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \"I've never seen so many people standing in one place in Los Angeles in my life, and that includes sold-out Dodger Stadium,\" NPR's Ina Jaffe tells Michel Martin on Weekend All Things Considered. As the demonstrators marched from one rally in Pershing Square to another rally outside City Hall, Ina says a single street could not contain all of them. Instead, marchers had to proceed down three parallel streets. Supporters there brought up LGBTQ rights, religious freedom and women's rights, Ina reports \u2014 including one marcher who held up a sign with a picture of Carrie Fisher, which read: \"A woman's place is in the resistance.\" New York City Thousands of participants converge on Dag Hammarskjold Plaza and Second Avenue during the women's march in New York City. NY Daily News via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption NY Daily News via Getty Images For a march fueled in part by dissatisfaction with President Trump, it seems only natural that the protesters finished their procession nearby Trump Tower on Saturday. WNYC reporter Sarah Hayley Barrett tweeted that marchers shut down whole stretches of Madison Avenue, as they spilled off the planned route and took alternate paths to Trump Tower. Shumita Basu, a producer with WNYC, noted that in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, where many of the protesters converged, the march was a \"sea of pink hats, signs.\" Raleigh, N.C. \"There's been a steady stream of marchers\" in the streets of downtown Raleigh, reports Jess Clark of member station WUNC. \"It spans the spectrum \u2014 protesters represent diverse issues, diverse backgrounds.\" She notes that she has seen men in baseball caps, women in hijabs and several people in those distinctive pink caps. \"The massive crowd has taken over the downtown area, shutting down several streets in the process,\" The Associated Press reports from Raleigh. The news service notes marches and rallies are taking place in cities across the state, including Charlotte and Asheville. Mexico City \u2014 Carrie Kahn (@ckahn) January 21, 2017 The march in Mexico City began at the U.S. Embassy and proceeded to the Angel of Independence monument. But, as NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, the march was so large, the crowd of demonstrators stretched from one landmark to the other. Carrie says the march comprised a mix of Americans and Mexicans, who appeared to be protesting Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto as much as President Trump. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has dismal approval ratings in his own country; a recent poll showed only 12 percent of Mexicans approve of the job he's doing. The chants \u2014 shouted in both Spanish and English \u2014 focused not only on the two leaders, but women's rights and gender equality, as well. Sioux Falls, S.D. \u2014 Kealey Bultena (@KealeySDPB) January 21, 2017 In Sioux Falls, the women's march has focused partly on American Indian rights, reports Kealey Bultena of South Dakota Public Broadcasting. Chants of \"Native lives matter\" rippled throughout the march. \"We want to protect Mother Earth, first of all, for the future generations and also we have our human rights as women,\" marcher Julia Brown Wolf told Kealey. Brown Wolf had traveled from the Crow Creek Indian Reservation for the demonstration. \"You know, we have to think in seven generations ahead.\" Kealey reports Brown Wolf marched with her granddaughters. \"She does not want them to face discrimination for being a woman or a Native American,\" Kealey says. Sydney Protesters demonstrate against President Trump in Sydney. Brook Mitchell/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brook Mitchell/Getty Images Demonstrators gathered in the city's Hyde Park carrying signs with slogans like \"Bridges not walls,\" and \"A woman's place is in the revolution.\" As protester Stef Vogt told The Sydney Morning Herald, \"We want to send a sign to the women in the U.S. that we're all in this together.\" But participants also say this isn't just about Trump. \"Women's rights are not about women,\" musician Amanda Palmer told a the marchers. \"They're about everyone. My son and husband are feminists.\" Buenos Aires, Argentina In Buenos Aires, American expats and locals held signs and wrote messages across their bodies as they gathered for a rally in support of the women's march. Local organizers echoed the guiding principle behind the march in Washington, D.C. \u2014 that \"Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights.\" New Delhi Indian women in New Delhi participate in a nationwide \"I Will Go Out\" march to raise questions about safe access for women and marginalized communities in public spaces across India. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images While some protests are principally marching to express solidarity with the demonstrators in the U.S., others are directly raising issues of misogyny on a more local level. In New Delhi, protesters carried signs reading \"I will go out,\" to protest sexual harassment in public spaces. Park City, Utah Crowds gather for the women's march on Main Street during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb hide caption toggle caption Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb Women's Marches Go Global: Postcards From Protests Around The World 1:25 Embed Embed <iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/510940708/511106148\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\"> The Sundance film festival is underway in the city, but women, men and children still stepped away to trudge down Main Street in the blustery snow. Many of the filmmakers and movie-lovers in Park City for the annual event came to protest Donald Trump's presidency and to defend women's rights. They chanted slogans such as \"Love Not Hate, Make America Great\" and \"We live in Trumpled Times.\" Then they rallied as the snow flurried around them, with comedian Chelsea Handler and actress Maria Bello among the speakers. Longtime activist Dolores Huerta, who's the subject of a documentary that premiered at the festival, led the crowd in chanting, \"Si se puede, Yes, we can.\" Jessica Williams, who stars in one of the feature films premiering at the festival, told the crowd that her ancestors fought for her to be where she is \u2014 to \"stand in the snow in front of a bunch of white people in Uggs.\" \"I grew up thinking (the) civil rights movement already happened,\" said Williams. \"This election is a wake up call. The silver lining is, we are here ... in literally 21 degrees supporting each other.\" And all the way from Baltimore, the Lethal Ladies of Bliss step team, featured in a new documentary premiering Saturday, roused the crowd with foot-stomping chants of resistance. Paradise Bay, Antarctica \u2014 linda zunas (@lindazunas) January 21, 2017 There were even \"marchers\" in Antarctica. Linda Zunas, a reseacher in a remote corner of the continent called Paradise Bay, told The Independent that she organized a group of 30 people with banners reading \"Penguins for peace\" and \"love from seven continents.\" ",

    "text": "White House Pushes \u2018Alternative Facts.\u2019 Here Are the Real Ones. By NICHOLAS FANDOS Continue reading the main story Photo Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, before speaking live on TV outside the White House on Sunday. Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press WASHINGTON \u2014 Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the White House had put forth \u201calternative facts\u201d to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. She made this assertion \u2014 which quickly went viral on social media \u2014 a day after Mr. Trump and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had accused the news media of reporting falsehoods about the inauguration and Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the intelligence agencies. In leveling this attack, the president and Mr. Spicer made a series of false statements. Here are the facts. In a speech at the C.I.A. on Saturday, Mr. Trump said the news media had constructed a feud between him and the intelligence community. \u201cThey sort of made it sound like I had a \u2018feud\u2019 with the intelligence community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is exactly the opposite, and they understand that, too.\u201d In fact, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intelligence agencies during his transition to office and has questioned their conclusion that Russia meddled in the election to aid his candidacy. He called their assessment \u201cridiculous\u201d and suggested that it had been politically motivated. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him, Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material. \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d he asked in a post on Twitter. Advertisement \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 11, 2017 Mr. Trump said of his inauguration crowd, \u201cIt looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.\u201d Aerial photographs clearly show that the crowd did not stretch to the Washington Monument. An analysis by The New York Times , comparing photographs from Friday to ones taken of Barack Obama \u2019s 2009 inauguration, showed that Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd was significantly smaller and less than the 1.5 million people he claimed. An expert hired by The Times found that Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd on the National Mall was about a third of the size of Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. Mr. Trump said that though he had been \u201chit by a couple of drops\u201d of rain as he began his address on Inauguration Day, the sky soon cleared. \u201cAnd the truth is, it stopped immediately, and then became sunny,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I walked off, and it poured after I left. It poured.\u201d The truth is that it began to rain lightly almost exactly as Mr. Trump began to speak and continued to do so throughout his remarks, which lasted about 18 minutes, and after he finished. Speaking later on Saturday in the White House briefing room, Mr. Spicer amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u201d he said. There is no evidence to support this claim. Not only was Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd far smaller than Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009, but he also drew fewer television viewers in the United States (30.6 million) than Mr. Obama did in 2009 (38 million) and Ronald Reagan did in 1981 (42 million), Nielsen reported. Figures for online viewership were not available. Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009. Mr. Spicer said that Washington\u2019s Metro system had greater ridership on Friday than it did for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration. \u201cWe know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama\u2019s last inaugural,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. Neither number is correct, according to the transit system, which reported 570,557 entries into the rail system on Friday, compared with 782,000 on Inauguration Day in 2013. Mr. Spicer said that \u201cthis was the first time in our nation\u2019s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\u201d In fact, similar coverings were used during the 2013 inauguration to protect the grass. The coverings did not hamper analyses of the crowd size. Mr. Spicer said that it was \u201cthe first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\u201d The Secret Service said security measures were largely unchanged this year. There were also few reports of long lines or delays. Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting. ",

The incident began when two suspects tried to rob a Kay Jewelers store at Rolling Oaks Mall, according to San Antonio police. One person tried to intervene and was shot and killed by one of the suspects, police said. Another person shot that suspect, and the second suspect fled through the mall, shooting several other people, police said. The suspect who was shot is in custody, but the other was still at large this evening, police said. Officials said besides the person who was shot trying to intervene in the attempted robbery, three others were also shot and taken to SAMC and were in unknown condition. Two others were also taken to the hospital: one woman with chest pains and another with labor pains, officials said. This is a developing story. Check back for more. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Crowds fill Pennsylvania Avenue during Saturday's Women's March on Washington. (Photo: Joe Lamberti/Courier-Post) In his inaugural address , President Trump bragged that he was leading \"a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\" Turns out he helped spawn two of them. On Friday, a legion of Americans cheered Trump as a refreshingly pugnacious leader elected with a promise to shake\u00a0the regular order in a country they say has gotten off on the wrong track. On Saturday, a multitude of Americans demonstrated against the new president for policies and rhetoric they see as misogynist\u00a0and dangerous. Elections are by definition divisive, of course, and Trump takes control of the White House at a time politics have\u00a0become increasingly polarized. But historians struggle to cite a precedent for a new president who is both beneficiary and target of such powerful and rising grass-roots movements. At stake are clashing visions of America on everything from the role of women and the impact of immigration to how the United States should engage with the world. \"It's hard for anyone to say when we're at a pivotal point, but I think these may be seismic shifts,\" Timothy Naftali, an historian at New York University and the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, said in an interview. \"We thought there was an era of new politics because of the role Trump played in the Republican Party, but the new politics may not just be of the right. We may be seeing a new politics in the center and the left.\" Read more: Change direction?\u00a0 Last year's surprising presidential primaries set the landscape for this year's political turmoil. Among Republicans, Trump tapped\u00a0rising discontent, especially\u00a0among whites, men and workers who had watched well-paying manufacturing jobs evaporate in the Rust Belt. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders did the same \u2014 especially among liberals, women and Millennials \u2014\u00a0with his strong bid for the Democratic nomination. Now both movements believe politics-as-usual has failed them, and neither owes their origins to the political establishment.\u00a0While those in both movements would agree the nation is headed in the wrong direction, though, they disagree on just what the right direction would be. In his address Friday, Trump said his lodestar would be \"America First,\" a phrase with resonant history suggesting a withdrawal from global engagement. One core campaign promise was to protect American workers by ending or renegotiating free-trade deals. Another was to build a wall along the Southern border to limit illegal immigrants he portrayed as rapists and murderers. He suggested he might propose a registry for Muslims. He wants the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision recognizing abortion rights. President Trump celebrates after his inaugural address on Jan. 20, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Pool, Getty Images) In contrast, the Women's Marches on Saturday limited official participation to groups that support abortion rights, and they accused Trump of trying to roll back hard-won equal rights for women. Marchers made a point of welcoming Muslims to their ranks and extolling\u00a0the value of immigrants, including the young people known as DREAMers who may be about to lose protection from deportation that former president Barack Obama had extended. Katie Page Sander \"boycotted\" watching Trump's Inauguration,\u00a0instead driving to Washington from her hometown of Ann Arbor., Mich., to march against him on Saturday. \"Trump is the quintessential bully and we teach our children how to stand up to bullies,\" she said, marching alongside her husband and three children. \"What I hope is this is a catalyst that people realize you can't be complacent any more.\" A day earlier, Gary Nystrom of Boone, Iowa, was elated as he stood on the National Mall to watch Trump sworn in, calling it a victory for the \"silent majority.\" \"It's a breath of fresh air,\" said Nystrom, a city councilman and member of the Iowa GOP state central committee. \"There's a new life ahead of us.\u00a0President Trump \u2014\u00a0I can say that now:\u00a0President\u00a0Trump \u2014 said today is a new day, and the people are going to dictate what goes on from this point forward. I truly believe that\u2019s why he got elected.\u201d Read more: Analysis: Trump\u2019s short, dark and defiant inaugural address A secret swearing-in Demonstrations in Washington are nothing new, even during Inaugural celebrations.\u00a0Tens of thousands of marchers protested the Vietnam War during President Nixon's second inaugural, in 1973. At Woodrow Wilson's first inaugural, in 1913, suffragettes demanding the right for women to vote staged their own parade and were roughed up by police. In 1877, the official swearing-in of Rutherford Hayes was held in secret for fear that\u00a0supporters of Samuel Tilden, who had won the popular vote in a disputed election, might try to disrupt it. (There was a public ceremony the next day.) But the size of the protests in Washington and across the country Saturday were unprecedented, dwarfing the number of Americans who had gathered to cheer Trump into office. Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee, on ABC's This Week called Saturday's turnout \"an urgent plea for us all to sit down together.\" The broad reach and rapid pace of new technology and social media have made the crowds bigger and the conversation coarser. \"It's not enough to disagree with somebody else,\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said with dismay. \"You have to hate them.\" President Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters on Jan. 21, 2017, in Langley, Va. \u00a0(Photo: Pool, Getty Images) Trump didn't comment on the protesters Saturday during an appearance at the CIA , but on Sunday morning he posted a mocking tweet : \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Two hours later, he took a different tone on Twitter: \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.\" Some political veterans worry about the task of governing in a nation where battle lines are hardening. Even inside the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer at his first briefing accused reporters of trying to delegitimize the new president , inaccurately asserting that news stories had misrepresented the size of the Inaugural crowds. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday's Meet the Press said Spicer was presenting \"alternative facts,\" sparking a derisive Twitter meme. \"We've never had as many people who don't trust the media, don't trust the politicians, don't trust economics, don't trust business,\" Republican political consultant Frank Luntz said on CBS' Face the Nation. \"I think we're going to remember this weekend for a long time to come as not the end, not the campaign being over, but this is the beginning of the most tempestuous ... awful conflict between left and right, between men and women, between young and old.\" He warned, \"I think we\u00a0are breaking apart.\" Contributing: Kathleen Gray of the Detroit Free Press, Jason Noble of The Des Moines Register.\u00a0 ",

Chuck Todd, of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d asked Conway early Sunday morning why Mr. Trump had Spicer utter a \u201cfalsehood\u201d the first time he formally faced reporters from the White House briefing room. \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d Todd questioned, referencing Spicer\u2019s incorrect assertion that the audience at Friday\u2019s inauguration was the largest to ever witness the ceremony both in person and around the globe. \u201cIt undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office on day one.\u201d Conway dismissed the question. \u201cDon\u2019t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s a falsehood and they\u2019re giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.\u201d \u201cAlternative facts?\u201d Todd shot back. \u201cLook, alternative facts are not facts, they\u2019re falsehoods.\u201d The television host followed up on the continuing argument over audience turnout, which Mr. Trump also harped on Saturday while visiting CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. \u201cWhat was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?\u201d Todd pressed. Conway quipped: \u201cYour job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president. That\u2019s not your job.\u201d The senior Trump defended Spicer further against Todd: \u201cChuck, I mean, if we\u2019re going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think that we\u2019re going to have to rethink our relationship here,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to gave a great open relationship with our press.\u201d Following the interview, social media exploded with a new trending topic: \u201c#AlternativeFacts.\u201d Twitter users criticized Conway\u2019s television appearance by coming up with their own \u201calternative facts.\u201d\u00a0 As a member of the @backstreetboys , I had a love child with @BettyMWhite . #AlternativeFacts \u2014 Lance Bass (@LanceBass) January 22, 2017 I'm about to devour this alt-salad. #alternativefacts pic.twitter.com/EZKdmDN1RP \u2014 Andrea Chalupa (@AndreaChalupa) January 22, 2017 Even a member of Congress got in on the social media action: BREAKING NEWS: @seanspicer at #WhiteHouse says Warriors beat Cavs in championship game last year. Period. #alternativefacts \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) January 22, 2017 And the Merriam-Webster dictionary company seemed to play on the trend Sunday, tweeting out its definition of the word \u201cfact.\u201d \uf4c8A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality. https://t.co/gCKRZZm23c \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 22, 2017 Spicer himself has previously promised not to tell falsehoods to the White House press corps as an administration official. During an appearance at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics earlier this month, Spicer told David Axelrod: \u201cI don\u2019t think any communicator worth their salt to go out and tell a lie...To go out and tell a lie is something that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d \u201cI may tell a reporter I can\u2019t comment on something\u2026 I\u2019m not able to discuss it. But I\u2019ve never lied,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI would argue that anybody who\u2019s an aspiring communicator adhere to that. If you lose the respect and trust of the press corps, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Cox, Getty Images ATLANTA -\u00a0Matt Ryan tumbled into the end zone, slammed the ball to the turf with a thunderous spike, and let out a scream that showed just how much he wanted this game.\u00a0 He wants the next one even more. With another MVP-worthy performance and plenty of help from Julio Jones, Matty Ice guided the Atlanta Falcons to a 44-21 rout of the Green Bay Packers for the NFC championship Sunday, a showing that erased any doubts about whether Ryan can win the big games. In his ninth season, he\u2019s finally headed to his first Super Bowl . Call him Super Matty. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy it because it\u2019s hard to get to this point. I know that from experience,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut our ultimate goal is still in front of us.\u201d The Falcons (13-5) will face Tom Brady and the Patriots on Feb. 5 in Houston , just the second Super Bowl appearance in Atlanta\u2019s 51-year history. Eighteen years ago, they lost to Denver in John Elway\u2019s final game.\u00a0 New England, heading to its ninth Super Bowl, blew out Pittsburgh 36-17. The Patriots opened as a 3-point favorite.\u00a0 Ryan threw for 392 yards and four touchdowns, but it was his 14-yard scoring run -- his first TD on the ground since 2012 -- that really set the tone. \u00a0\u00a0 Matt Ryan rose to the occasion. pic.twitter.com/NAsreef1z6 \u2014 NFLonCBS (@NFLonCBS) January 22, 2017 Jones was right in the middle of things, too. After barely practicing during the week because of a lingering toe injury, he finished off the Packers with a 73-yard catch-and-run on Atlanta\u2019s second snap of the second half, pushing the lead to 31-0 and essentially turning the rest of the Georgia Dome finale into one long celebration.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a beast,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to play with him as long as I have. He was impressive today. I know he wasn\u2019t feeling his best, but he\u2019s a warrior.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 JULIO JONES IS A BEAST. 73 yards all the way to the house! \uf631 #GBvsATL #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/Iau1EnDgVJ \u2014 NFL (@NFL) January 22, 2017 Jones finished with nine catches for 180 yards and two scores, which included a toe-dragging catch for a 5-yard touchdown with 3 seconds left in the first half, sending the Falcons to the locker room up 24-0.\u00a0 After the break: the play that showed every one of Jones\u2019 remarkable skills. He blazed down the middle of the field, shook off LaDarius Gunter\u2019s attempt to grab him on a cut toward the sideline, hauled in the pass from Ryan, broke Gunter\u2019s diving attempt at tackle, and defiantly knocked away Damarious Randall\u2019s with a brutal stiff-arm.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t practice that much throughout the week,\u201d Jones said, \u201cbut today I came out and gave it all I had.\u201d\u00a0 Ryan sparked more delirious chants of \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d as he carved up an injury-plagued Packers secondary that had no way of stopping a team that averaged nearly 34 points a game during the regular season and romped to a 36-20 victory against Seattle\u2019s Legion of Boom last week.\u00a0 The Packers, riding an eight-game winning streak and coming off a thrilling upset of the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys , got a taste of what they\u2019d be in for on Atlanta\u2019s very first possession. Driving 80 yards in 13 plays, the Falcons converted three third downs, the last when Ryan scrambled away from pressure and flipped a shovel pass to Mohamed Sanu for a 2-yard score.\u00a0 Aaron Rodgers pushed the Packers quickly into Atlanta territory with a 27-yard pass to Jordy Nelson, who missed the previous game with a rib injury. But Mason Crosby, who hit two field goals longer that 50 yards in the closing minutes against the Cowboys, pushed a 41-yard attempt right of the upright to snap a playoff-record streak of 23 straight field goals.\u00a0 The Falcons drove the other way, settling for Matt Bryant\u2019s 28-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead. Then, with Green Bay poised to make a game of it, Atlanta\u2019s much-maligned defense - one of the lowest ranked in the NFL -- came through a momentum --swinging play. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski was breaking tackles and rumbling toward the end zone when Jalen Collins stripped the ball from behind and fell on it just across the goal line for a touchback.\u00a0 \u201cTheir offense is hot right now,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cPlaying a team like that, you\u2019ve got to start faster. We had no points in the first half. You\u2019re not going to win many games like that.\u201d\u00a0 After the fumble, Ryan hooked up with Jones three times for 56 yards and finished it off from the 14 with some surprisingly nimble running skills, faking out one defender with a pump fake before sprawling into the end zone.\u00a0 \u201cI just saw a lane open up,\u201d said Ryan, who had a 1-4 record in the playoffs over his first eight seasons. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest run I\u2019ve had in a while. It came at a good time.\u201d\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget the defense Atlanta\u2019s defense, an afterthought compared to the other side of the line, kept the Packers out of the end zone until the game was essentially locked up.\u00a0 Rodgers finished 27 of 45 for 287 yards and three TDs, but he also threw an interception, was sacked twice and faced a relentless Falcons rush.\u00a0 The Falcons finished with a 493-367 edge in total yards.\u00a0 Dome finale What a send-off for the Georgia Dome, the Falcons\u2019 home since 1992, which will be torn down and replaced next season by $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\u00a0 With the home team comfortably ahead, the raucous crowd of more than 71,000 partied through the second half, bouncing along to rap music that turned the stadium with the big top-like roof into the world\u2019s largest dance club.\u00a0 The intensity of the celebration was understandable, given the Falcons\u2019 largely forgettable history and the heartache doled out by all of Atlanta\u2019s pro sports teams. The Braves, way back in 1995, are still the city\u2019s only team to capture a big league championship.\u00a0 Now, the Falcons are one win away from adding another title to that barren trophy case.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

By THE NEW YORK TIMES on Publish Date January 22, 2017. Photo by Left, Lucas Jackson, Right, Stelios Varias/Reuters. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community, Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community, a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago. He also called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth,\u201d and he said that up to 1.5 million people had attended his inauguration, a claim that photographs disproved. Later, at the White House, he dispatched Sean Spicer, the press secretary, to the briefing room in the West Wing, where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country, warning that the new administration would hold them to account. Continue reading the main story The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump , a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in. It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency, usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader. OPEN Graphic Instead, the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive, signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation\u2019s highest office. Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community, with an appearance at the C.I.A.\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va. While he was lavish in his praise, the president focused in his 15-minute speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation\u2019s spy agencies, and meandered to other topics, including the crowd size at his inauguration, his level of political support, his mental age and his intellectual heft.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cI just want to let you know, I am so behind you,\u201d Mr. Trump told more than 300 employees assembled in the lobby for his remarks. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia meddled in the United States election on his behalf. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Trump, he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on Twitter , \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 11, 2017 On Saturday, he said journalists were responsible for any suggestion that he was not fully supportive of intelligence agencies\u2019 work.

Mr. Spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed \u201cto minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d although he provided no proof of either assertion. Photographs of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 and of Mr. Trump\u2019s plainly showed that the crowd on Friday was significantly smaller , but Mr. Spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the Mall. Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009. \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. He also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on Friday that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, calling the mistake \u2014 which was corrected quickly \u2014 \u201cegregious.\u201d And he incorrectly claimed that ridership on Washington\u2019s subway system was higher than on Inauguration Day in 2013. In reality, there were 782,000 riders that year, compared with 571,000 riders this year, according to figures from the Washington-area transit authority. Mr. Spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the National Mall this year, preventing \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d from viewing the ceremony. But the Secret Service said the measures were largely unchanged this year, and there were few reports of long lines or delays. Video White House Press Secretary Slams Media At his first news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, accused news outlets of intentionally manipulating photographs \u201cto minimize the enormous support\u201d that President Trump had received at his inauguration. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb Commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made Mr. Trump increasingly angry on Friday, according to several people familiar with his thinking. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on \u201cdishonest media\u201d coverage \u2014 mostly referring to a Twitter post from a New York Times reporter showing side-by-side frames of Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd and Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. But most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president. However, in his remarks at the C.I.A., he wandered off topic several times, at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39 (he is 70); reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying, \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person\u201d; and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy. Photo The photograph of President Trump\u2019s inauguration that was displayed during Mr. Spicer\u2019s briefing. Mr. Trump said that when he looked out from his podium, \u201cit looked like a million, a million and a half people.\u201d Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cProbably everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same wavelength, folks.\u201d But most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media. And Mr. Spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the White House briefing room. But his appearance, according to the people familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking, went too far, in the president\u2019s opinion. Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the C.I.A. touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials. Nick Shapiro, who served as chief of staff to John O. Brennan, who resigned Friday as the C.I.A. director, said Mr. Brennan \u201cis deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump \u2019s despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of C.I.A.\u2019s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. \u201cBrennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,\u201d Mr. Shapiro added. \u201cI was heartened that the president gave a speech at C.I.A.,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency. \u201cIt would have been even better if more of it had been about C.I.A.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he had had high hopes for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community, but that Mr. Trump\u2019s meandering speech had dashed them. \u201cWhile standing in front of the stars representing C.I.A. personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country \u2014 hallowed ground \u2014 Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cHe will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world.\u201d Mr. Trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d He did not mention his apparent willingness to believe Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is widely detested at the C.I.A., over his own intelligence agencies. He also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president. The agency sees the president as its main audience, and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the White House. Since the election, hopes at the C.I.A. that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what Mr. Trump and his loyalists have planned. But the nomination of Mike Pompeo, a former Army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community, to lead the C.I.A. has been received positively at the agency. \u201cHe has left the strong impression that he doesn\u2019t trust the intelligence community and that he doesn\u2019t have tremendous regard for their work,\u201d Mark M.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) during the Jan. 11 Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan By Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan January 22 at 7:12 PM Follow @karoun Follow @WaPoSean Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey O. Graham said Sunday that they will back the nomination of Rex Tillerson, clearing the way for the oil executive to become secretary of state and leaving just one drama unresolved: What will Marco Rubio do? The Republican senator from Florida made clear during Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing earlier this month that he had significant reservations, chastising the ExxonMobil chief executive for refusing to call Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Aleppo a war crime and declining to condemn Saudi Arabia and China as human rights violators. \u201cIn order to have moral clarity, we need clarity. We can\u2019t achieve moral clarity with rhetorical ambiguity,\u201d Rubio told Tillerson. \u201cWe need a secretary of state who will fight for these principles.\u201d Since then, Rubio has come under significant pressure from Republican party leaders to back Tillerson and avoid a split within the GOP on one of President Trump\u2019s most high-profile picks, according to those close to him. Rubio held an unannounced meeting with Tillerson last week, according to two people with knowledge of the get-together, although it was unclear whether Tillerson was able to alleviate Rubio\u2019s concerns. Now-Vice President Pence and now-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus were also in the meeting, according to a Rubio adviser familiar with the gathering. It lasted 90 minutes and was a blunt conversation not just about Tillerson\u2019s answers at the hearing, but also about Rubio\u2019s overall concerns about Russia and other matters, said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private talk. (Reuters) The White House did not respond Sunday to a request for comment on the meeting. The Tillerson decision is a potentially pivotal one for the former presidential candidate, who during the campaign challenged President Trump on foreign-policy differences that have since been reflected in concerns Republicans have voiced about Tillerson. Many in the party are leery of Trump\u2019s friendly approach to Russia and its leader, Vladi\u00admir Putin, with whom Tillerson frequently interacted as the head of ExxonMobil. Putin awarded Tillerson the Kremlin\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013, and Tillerson has criticized sanctions the United States imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. \u201cMarco exposed a tension between kind of where a lot of Republicans are on Russia,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, who served as an adviser to Rubio during his 2016 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great opportunity to kind of lead this wing of the national security establishment that believes the long-standing orthodoxy on Russia.\u201d Politically, however, several people in Rubio\u2019s circle said they see no upside to defying Trump, especially now that Tillerson is on the path to being confirmed. Rubio is aware that the backlash from the new White House would be intense, according to those close to him. George Seay, a Dallas-based investment manager who was a major Rubio donor during his presidential run, said that many people close to him have been texting, calling and writing Rubio to urge him to support Tillerson \u201cin very blunt fashion.\u201d \u201cI think this is the wrong fight. I think it\u2019s the wrong position to make a stand,\u201d Seay said. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos did not respond to multiple inquiries Sunday about Rubio\u2019s thinking on Tillerson or his meetings. Seeming uncertainty is a familiar position for Rubio. During the 2013 debate over immigration reform, Rubio initially joined with Democrats to push for a comprehensive bill before backing away from the effort when conservative ire reached a boiling point. The fallout would follow him into his presidential campaign, where he took heat from the right for being part of the effort and criticism from the left for backing away from it. During his presidential campaign, Rubio had a pattern of articulating two positions on some politically sensitive topics: his personal view, and what he considered to be politically doable. This mirrored how he campaigned against Trump, as well. Early on, Rubio avoided attacking Trump, even when he clearly disagreed with him. When the primaries heated up, Rubio switched his strategy and launched a forceful \u2014 at times awkward \u2014 attack, calling Trump a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d After Trump won the nomination, Rubio switched again and supported his party\u2019s nominee. On Sunday morning, McCain (Ariz.) and Graham (S.C.) \u2014 Tillerson\u2019s two other most vocal GOP critics \u2014 released a statement announcing they would support him for secretary of state when the full Senate votes on it. Citing additional conversations with Tillerson, the pair expressed \u201cconfidence\u201d that Tillerson \u201ccan be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,\u201d despite continued \u201cconcerns about his past dealings with the Russian government.\u201d Of all the Republican senators, only Rubio, McCain and Graham\u2019s support for Tillerson has ever been seriously in doubt. Of the three, Rubio\u2019s complaints have been the most broad, centering on his fear that as secretary of state, Tillerson might not be a strong-enough defender of human rights. Rubio warned Tillerson that being too soft \u201cleads to people to conclude . . . America cares about democracy and freedom as long as it isn\u2019t being violated for something else.\u201d McCain and Graham\u2019s support all but guarantees that Tillerson will easily win the simple majority he needs to be confirmed as secretary of state by the full Senate. But if Rubio votes against Tillerson\u2019s nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 where Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote \u2014 it could throw a wrench into plans to move Tillerson\u2019s nomination to the floor smoothly. \u201cI recognize the partisan split on the committee and what it would all mean,\u201d Rubio told reporters after Tillerson\u2019s hearing, asserting that he was \u201cprepared to do what\u2019s right.\u201d If Rubio opposes Tillerson, GOP leaders are prepared to use a variety of procedural options to get his nomination to the floor. \u201cI expect him to come out of the committee on Monday,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said following Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday, although he admitted \u201cthe votes are still in flux.\u201d If committee members do not vote to report Tillerson\u2019s nomination to the floor with a favorable recommendation, they can vote to send it to the floor with caveats, such as an unfavorable recommendation, or with no recommendation at all. If those efforts fail, a senator can file a discharge motion to circumvent the committee\u2019s review authority entirely and send Tillerson\u2019s nomination straight to the floor. Top committee Democrat Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said Friday that while he believes \u201cour committee\u2019s recommendation\u2019s extremely important,\u201d he does \u201crecognize the fact that confirmations are by the Senate, not by committee.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Jan 22 2017, 2:25 pm ET Donald Trump Will Not Release Tax Returns, White House Adviser Says by Alexandra Jaffe advertisement Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, said Sunday that the president would not be releasing his tax returns, reversing months of repeated campaign-trail promises to do so after an audit is completed. Conway's comments came in response to a Whitehouse.gov petition with more than 200,000 signatures calling on Trump to release his tax returns. Any petition on the site that receives 100,000 signatures in 30 days receives a response from the White House; this petition reached twice that in two days. \"The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns,\" Conway said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" Related: Donald Trump's Taxes: What We Know and What We Don't Trump broke with decades of precedent during the campaign by becoming the first major party nominee since the 1970s to refuse to release his tax returns. He repeatedly cited an ongoing IRS audit in refusing to do so but said he would eventually release them when the audit was completed. But Trump and his allies have argued that his tax returns are irrelevant, a statement Conway made again on Sunday. \"We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care,\" she said. \"They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. And you know full well that President Trump and his family are complying with all the ethical rules, everything they need to do to step away from his businesses and be a full-time president.\" Both of Conway's statements are false \u2014 multiple polls showed a majority of Americans believe Trump should release his tax returns, including an ABC News/Washington Post survey out last week that found three-fourths of Americans believe he should release them . And a ProPublica investigation out Friday revealed that despite Trump's pledge to transfer control of his businesses to his children as part of an ethics agreement as president, he hasn't filed any of the necessary documents to do so in Florida, Delaware and New York.
