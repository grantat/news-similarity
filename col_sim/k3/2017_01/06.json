Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also took a swipe at the president-elect for \"disparaging\" the intelligence community. Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia had stepped up its cyber espionage operations, but stopped short of declaring the Russian election hacking an \"act of war,\" saying that would be \"a very heavy policy call\" more appropriate for others to make. The high-stakes Senate Armed Services Committee's hearing came after president-elect Donald Trump continued to cast doubt Wednesday on intelligence findings that Russia hacked Democratic National Committee emails. It also comes on a day in which lawmakers were being briefed on the breadth and depth of Russian interference in the American election and on the eve of Trump's own in-depth briefing on the matter. NBC News confirms President Obama has received and was orally briefed on the report on Thursday. Clapper, who will leave his post in the coming weeks, told the committee that lawmakers would be briefed next week and a redacted report was scheduled to be released afterwards. He took a parting shot at Trump as he reasserted intelligence findings about Russian election hacking. DNI chief James Clapper, center, talks with NSA chief Adm. Michael Rogers, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Jan. 5, 2017. Evan Vucci / AP \"I think there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement,\" Clapper responded after being asked by Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill \"Who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community?\" Trump has questioned the intelligence community's findings, most recently on Wednesday as he quoted Assange, who continues to deny Russia was the source of Democratic emails published by WikiLeaks. \"Julian Assange said \"a 14-year old could have hacked Podesta' \u2014 why was DNC so careless?\" Trump said on Twitter. \"Also said Russians did not give him the info!\" However, Clapper said Russia had \"clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture by increasing cyber espionage operations, leaking data stolen from these operations, and targeting political infrastructures systems.\" Play ",

The video, which has since been taken down, appears to show the torture and taunting of a white special needs man. USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama attends the Armed Forces Full Honor Review Farewell Ceremony at Joint Base Myers-Henderson Hall in Arlington, Virginia, Wednesday. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) 221 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 72 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama said Thursday that racial tensions haven't gotten worse in his time as president \u2014 they've just become more apparent because of the power of cell phone videos and social media. Case in point: the\u00a0\u00a0live-streamed Facebook video showing four African-American youths in Chicago tying up, beating and torturing\u00a0a white special needs student. Obama called the attack a \"despicable sort\" of\u00a0hate crime. But he also\u00a0 told Chicago's WBBM \u00a0that racial incidents get more attention now \"in part because we see visuals of racial tensions, violence and so forth because of smart phones and the Internet.\" Obama gave a round of interviews with Chicago television stations as he prepares to deliver his farewell address in his hometown next Tuesday. But the interviews were dominated by racial issues and urban violence. \u201cWhat we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\" he said. In a separate interview with WLS, he recalled the racially polarizing Chicago \"Council Wars\" of the 1980s. \"Some of your viewers are too young to remember this stuff. I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better.\" Obama said the violence plaguing Chicago was heartbreaking, but also a \"strange exception\" to the national trends. And he said he want's be be \"part of the solution.\" \"What I intend to do is to build off of some of the work that has been in done in other cities to intervene in violence, provide better support for youth that are at risk,\" he said. \"And my presidential center and me personally, this is something where we want to join those who are intent on doing something about this. I want to be a part of the solution.\" Obama is building his presidential library in Chicago's Jackson Park neighborhood. \"These are communities I know and love, and there's so many good people there,\" he told WLS. \"And there are people I know who have been personally affected by levels of violence.\" The interviews were part of Obama's \"Live from the White House\" strategy, which has brought 155 local television and radio reporters to the White House for one-on-one interviews, according to a USA TODAY tally.\u00a0At times, he brought so many reporters to the White House that\u00a0 he needed cue cards \u00a0to keep their names and cities straight. Those appearances,\u00a0mostly during his first term, allowed him to bypass the national media and target his message to local communities on topics like Obamacare, the minimum wage and trade. But until Thursday, Obama had done only one interview with a Chicago station during his presidency. The interviews focused on Chicago issues but also covered some other topics: \u25ba On the tensions between President-elect Donald Trump and the intelligence community: \"My experience over the last eight years and the experience of most presidents is we cant make good decisions unless we have good intelligence,\" he told WMAQ . \"And it's important that the president is getting the very best non-politicized intelligence possible, because national security is at stake.\" But he also said he's also optimistic that \"some of those current tensions will be reduced\" once Trump starts getting his briefings from his own hand-picked intelligence officials. \u25ba On a commutation for former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, convicted of trying to sell Obama's former senate seat: \"We have steps that go from the Justice Department and the White House counsel's office, and then I study these cases on an individual basis,\" he told WMAQ.. \u00a0\"On some of these high profile cases, we'll see what gets to my desk.\" 221 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 72 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hXVemP NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

By Kelsey Snell and David Weigel January 5 at 6:35 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Follow daveweigel Some of the most conservative members of Congress say they are ready to vote for a budget that would \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 balloon the deficit to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, all for the sake of eventually repealing the Affordable Care Act. In a dramatic reversal, many members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus said Thursday they are prepared later this month to support a budget measure that would explode the deficit and increase the public debt to more than $29.1 trillion by 2026, figures contained in the budget resolution itself. As they left a meeting with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Thursday, some of the conservatives said that spending targets contained in the budget for fiscal year 2017 are symbolic. The real goal of the budget legislation, they argued, is to establish an opportunity to finally make good on GOP promises to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. \u201cI just came to understand all the different ideas about where we go next,\u201d said Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus that typically opposes massive spending increases. Schweikert now says he will probably vote for the budget resolution. The growing conservative consensus comes nearly one year after the approximately 40-member group announced it would rather torpedo the entire budget process than vote for a fiscal blueprint that increased spending without balancing the budget. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) [ House conservatives are having a family conversation on the budget ] But fiscal discipline now seems to be taking a back seat to the drive to repeal Obamacare. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a replacement on Obamacare pretty quick,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin (R-Tex.). \u201cWould I like to see [the budget] balance? Certainly. Absolutely. I\u2019ve got 13 grandchildren, and I don\u2019t want to see them buried under $30 trillion of debt.\u201d The Freedom Caucus has not taken an official position on the budget \u2014 80 percent of them need to agree to do so \u2014 but many members said the dramatic spending created in the 2017 budget measure were only technicalities. They contend that voters understand some sacrifices need to be made to gut the health-care law. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters that the group will decide Monday on an official position on the budget. \u201cThe real question is: Does it change the top line number on what we\u2019re spending?\u201d Meadows said. \u201cDoes it increase spending \u2014 or does it become a vehicle that maintains our current spending levels and allows us to repeal\u201d the Affordable Care Act? Others Republicans, including Paul, still question whether it is ever acceptable to support deficit increases, no matter how symbolic. Paul described Thursday\u2019s meeting, which attracted 23 Freedom Caucus members and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), as a first step. File photo: A small group of demonstrators stand outside of of a hotel before former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint speaks at a \"Defund Obamacare Tour\" rally in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Nathan Chute /Reuters) \u201cI wanted to make sure that conservatives in the House knew that, together, we can have impact and influence on what the budget will be,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI heard one person say that, well, we\u2019ll vote for this now, but we won\u2019t in four months. My point is that the Republican leadership will come back and say, \u2018You already voted for it once; why not vote for it a second time?\u2019 \u201d Many in the conservative clique emerged ambivalent about Paul\u2019s argument. \u201cI\u2019m not staking out a position on the budget just yet,\u201d Babin said after the meeting. Mainstream Republicans are urging their typically implacable conservative colleagues to turn a blind eye to the spending numbers for now. Republican leaders are using a complicated quirk of the budget process to repeal Obamacare without the threat of a blockade by Senate Democrats. Budget legislation is considered under special rules in the Senate that allow a simple majority of 50 senators rather than the normal 60 needed for almost everything else. There are 52 Republicans in the Senate this year, and there is virtually no hope that any Democrat would agree to dismantle Obama\u2019s health-care law. The budget introduced this week in the Senate includes instructions for committees to begin repealing the ACA. GOP leaders want Republicans to focus on language requiring members of four committees to produce bills seven days after Trump\u2019s inauguration that each would save $1 billion over a decade by slashing ACA elements. Not all conservatives are convinced. Paul is joined by deficit hawks like Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) who worry their voters won\u2019t countenance even a seemingly meaningless vote to increase the deficit. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do a symbolic budget resolution, why not put in a good number?\u201d Brat asked Thursday. \u201cPeople are very cynical, and I need a message so I can go back home with a straight face.\u201d The collective shrug from other conservatives is the latest evidence that Paul\u2019s protest would be a familiar, lonely one. His floor speech attacking the budget measure for making no attempts at deficit reduction \u2014 it projects a $9 trillion increase in the debt by 2026 \u2014 was preempted by statements from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), pledging to vote for the resolution anyway. That position has made Paul one of very few Republicans still talking about the debt as a national crisis worth building legislation around. During his presidential campaign, which ended after the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Paul made a number of attempts to draw attention to the national debt and to promote his annual plans to balance the budget with steep spending cuts. Months later, most of the Freedom Caucus \u2014 17 members \u2014 voted against the GOP\u2019s 2016 budget on debt-reduction grounds. The new budget resolution makes even fewer concessions on debt reduction. For Republicans who frequently described the debt as a threat to their children\u2019s futures, it\u2019s a difficult sell. \u201cWe want to keep in mind the overall picture, both the deficit and how tired people are Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Randy Weber (R-Tex.). \u201cI do think there\u2019s a danger of the Republicans actually owning this.\u201d ",

The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. William Lee Contact Reporter A mentally disabled man attacked and racially taunted on a Facebook Live video was able to leave a West Side apartment after a neighbor complained about the noise and distracted his attackers, authorities said Thursday. Two of them followed the neighbor downstairs and the 18-year-old victim took the opportunity to leave the building in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street, ending a five-hour ordeal, police said at a news conference. Officers found the man wandering the streets in the Homan Square neighborhood around 5:15 p.m., police said. \"I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on,\" said Officer Michael Donnelly. \"He was bloodied, he was battered. \"He was very discombobulated,\" he added. \"He was injured. He was confused.\" Hate crime charges filed in Facebook Live attack Chicago police speak to press\u00a0about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people involved in the attack. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police speak to press\u00a0about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people involved in the attack. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) See more videos According to the video, the man's wrists had been bound and his mouth taped shut as two men cut his shirt with knives, then took turns punching him and stomping his head. One of the men cut the victim\u2019s scalp with a knife. As the man crouched against a wall, someone shouted, \u201cF\u2011\u2011\u2011 Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cF\u2011\u2011\u2011 white people.\u201d Four people were arrested after the downstairs neighbor called police because two of the suspects had kicked in her door, angry that she threatened to call 911, according to Area North Cmdr. Kevin Duffin. \"They booted her door and they actually grabbed something on their way out,\" he said. Jordan Hill, 18, of\u00a0 Carpentersville, Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago, Brittany Covington, 18, of Chicago and her sister, Tanishia Covington, 24,\u00a0 of Chicago were all charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Hill was also charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, and both Cooper and Brittany Covington were charged with residential burglary. Hill knew the victim from a school they attended in Aurora and was\u00a0 with the victim when police found him. Police did not explain what Hill was doing there. All four suspects have given statements admitting to their roles in the attack, police said. They are due in bond court Friday. Asked about the video that helped in the arrests, Duffin said, \"I can\u2019t understand why anybody puts anything on Facebook.\" Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man.

The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos The victim's family had dropped him off at a McDonald's in Streamwood on Saturday to meet Hill, with plans to spend the night at his place. \u00a0 Hill stole a van before picking up the victim and passed it off as his own, police said. The pair drove to Chicago's West Side, visiting with friends for two days. The victim slept in the van before arriving at the apartment on Lexington where the Covington sisters lived on Tuesday. Hours into the visit, the victim and Hill were engaged in a \"play fight\" when it got out of hand, police said. The sisters got angry and tied him up, police said. \"That's when the attack begins,\" Duffin said. They beat, stomped and cut the victim and made him drink water from the toilet, he said. The victim was tied up for four or five hours until he escaped. After police found him on the street, they discovered that he had been reported missing on Sunday. He was taken to a hospital and reunited with his family. Superintendent Eddie Johnson said there \"was never a question\" whether the case would be investigated as a hate crime, but police wanted to check all the facts of the case first. He said the racial comments of the attackers and the disabilities of the victim both played a role in the decision. ",

They said he and Hill had gone to school together in Aurora, although they didn't see each other frequently. Instead, investigators claimed the group kidnapped the man, keeping him tied up for hours or more with his mouth taped shut in an apartment on the city's west side. The video showed him cowering in a corner while someone yelled \"F--- white people!\" and \"F--- Donald Trump!\" At one point, the man was held at knifepoint and told to curse the president-elect. The video also showed the man being kicked and hit repeatedly, while his scalp was cut. The group apparently forced him to drink water from a toilet. The worst of the attack had started out as a \"play fight\" that ultimately escalated, police said. They told reporters the man slept in the van during the ordeal. The man finally escaped on Monday after a neighbor on a lower floor of the apartment building complained about the noise and threatened to call the cops, police said. They told reporters the suspects barged into the neighbor's apartment, giving the man an opportunity to get out. The four also face burglary charges in connection to the break-in. A police officer finally encountered\u00a0the disoriented man walking down a street on Monday wearing only an inside-out tank top, jean shorts and sandals, despite the frigid weather. The officer said it was clear the man had been bloodied and battered. Police became aware on Tuesday of the heinous video footage,\u00a0 FOX32 \u00a0reported. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest wouldn't say if he thought the incident was a hate crime, but did discuss the callous nature of the crime. \"They do demonstrate a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans,\" Earnest said. \"I have not spoken to the president but I'm confident he would be angered by the images depicted.\" The suspects could be heard saying they wanted the video to go viral. They now face a bevy of charges. Hill was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, robbery, residential burglary; Cooper was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary; Brittany Covington was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary; Tanishia Covington was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Hill is from Carpentersville and the others are Chicago residents. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement Trending in U.S. 1 ",

USA TODAY Sports Dallas Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory (94) on the field before the game against the Detroit Lions at AT&T; Stadium. (Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports) The Dallas Cowboys will be without one of their promising young pass rushers this postseason. The NFL announced that defensive end Randy Gregory has been suspended without pay for \u201cat least one year\u201d for another violation of the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. Gregory had filed an appeal, which was heard earlier this week, according to multiple reports. For Gregory to return to the Cowboys, he will need to apply for reinstatement to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The top-seeded Dallas Cowboys are on a first-round bye in the playoffs\u00a0and will face the lowest NFC seed of the victorious teams from this weekend\u2019s wild-card round. The ban does not come as a surprise, as team owner Jerry Jones said he was aware that Gregory may not be available for the postseason. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate,\u201d Jones said Dec. 26. \u201cI\u2019m just saying as excited as I am about Gregory, I want to temper it a little bit.\u201d NFL MVP tracker: Falcons' Matt Ryan decisive winner on final ballot Gregory triggered another failed test in November, the second positive result while he served a previous suspension. Gregory sat a total of 14 games this year in two consecutive suspensions. \u201cThat's outta my ballpark,\u201d Gregory said after his Week 16 season debut in a 42-21 victory against the Detroit Lions. \u201cThere is nothing I can do about it. That type of stuff, I let Jerry, and everyone else, and people like my agent handle it. As we go, we'll find out how everything\u2019s going to turn out. As far as I know, I'm going to go out and play every week and do what I can do to help the team.\u201d In the final two games of the season, Gregory recorded nine tackles and one sack.

They locked up home field, and Oakland's loss essentially put Chiefs, Steelers in other half of AFC bracket.\u00a0 Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports 2. Cowboys (2): Week 17 unfolded (almost) perfectly for them. Tony Romo knocked off some rust -- and maybe boosted trade value -- and no key players were injured.\u00a0 Bill Streicher, USA TODAY Sports 3. Falcons (3): Appropriately, Dirty Birds flying under radar. But league's highest-scoring team is loaded, and few QBs have ever had better seasons than Matt Ryan.\u00a0 Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports 4. Steelers (4): Injury-free at last, Le'Veon Bell will finally get to make his mark in postseason. His 157 yards per scrimmage ranks third-best in NFL history.\u00a0 Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports 5. Packers (6): Can they run table for another four weeks? Their fortunes are heavily reliant on QB Aaron Rodgers, but no better player to hitch the wagon to.\u00a0 Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports 6. Chiefs (5): Is anyone better at reaping bye's benefits than Andy Reid? K.C. could be legit Super Bowl threat, especially as stars like Justin Houston recharge.\u00a0 Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports 7. Seahawks (7): For first time since QB Russell Wilson's emergence in 2012, this doesn't feel like a team that has horsepower to make a deep run into January.\u00a0 Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports 8. Giants (8): Their 2007 and 2011 clubs parlayed playoff wins at Lambeau Field into Super Bowl glory. It feels like this edition capable of similar heroics.\u00a0 Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports 9. Dolphins (10): They're probably a year away from making serious playoff noise, but Adam Gase might finally be the guy who can consistently challenge the Pats.\u00a0 Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports 10. Lions (9): Motown must be encouraged by team's moxie and outlook, even if its margin for error is too narrow to make a first Super Bowl trip viable this year.\u00a0 Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports 11. Raiders (11): If they want to check off their next \"first\" since 2002, i.e. a playoff win, couldn't ask for better wild-card opponent than reeling Texans.\u00a0 Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports 12. Buccaneers (12): Second-half surge fell win short of playoffs. But Jameis Winston made history as first QB to throw for 4,000 yards in his first two seasons.\u00a0 Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports 13. Titans (16): They finished tied atop AFC South and are arguably already division's most-rounded team. Armed with top-five pick, they're poised for 2017 leap.\u00a0 Andrew Nelles, USA TODAY Sports 14. Broncos (17): Championship-caliber defense should carry over into 2017, but Gary Kubiak's departure only further muddles if offense capable of doing its share.\u00a0 Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports 15. Redskins (14): Even assuming QB Kirk Cousins is back next season (and beyond), offense could have decidedly altered look in 2017, which could be good thing.\u00a0 Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports 16. Vikings (25): Some interesting decisions lie ahead -- specifically futures of Adrian Peterson and Sam Bradford -- for team that fell well short of its ceiling.\u00a0 Bruce Kluckhohn, USA TODAY Sports 17. Texans (15): Nothing is certain except death and taxes ... and Bill O'Brien going 9-7. Latter could change with return of J.J. Watt and a QB breakthrough.\u00a0 Jim Brown, USA TODAY Sports 18. Colts (19): The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Clearly a course correction needed here.\u00a0 Thomas  J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports 19. Saints (18): The definition of insanity, etc. But why is it so hard for Sean Payton to get defensive help this team needs to complement Drew Brees and Co.\u00a0 Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports 20. Panthers (20): Will the real Cam Newton please stand up? He followed his best season with his worst, making it obvious Carolina's fortunes are tied to him.\u00a0 Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports 21. Ravens (13): It definitely feels like a team that ran out of gas down the stretch needs an infusion of youth in some key areas on both sides of the ball.\u00a0 Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports 22. Cardinals (22): Glass half-full -- both offense and defense ranked in top 10. Glass half-empty -- underachieving team may soon have major issues at QB, WR.\u00a0 Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports 23. Bengals (23): After reboot season, the question is whether this team is maintaining right kind of continuity in its perpetual effort to get over title hump.\u00a0 Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports 24. Eagles (24): Not a surprise that Doug Pederson is building a team that feels like Kansas City East. But Carson Wentz definitely needs a more reliable weapon.\u00a0 Bill Streicher, USA TODAY Sports 25. Chargers (26): Welp. If they relocate north, Los Angelenos will quickly find Bolts are more worthy of price of admission than their prospective co-tenants.\u00a0 Orlando Jorge Ramirez, USA TODAY Sports 26. Jaguars (27): The flaws are evident, right down to QB Blake Bortles' mechanics. But this still has look of team that could ignite instantly with right coach.\u00a0 Thomas  J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports 27. Bears (28): Alshon Jeffery has guaranteed Chicago will win Super Bowl LII next year. Truly a shame he'll likely be elsewhere and won't share in the glory.\u00a0 Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports 28. Rams (29): We're guessing the fine people of St. Louis got a kick out of watching this dumpster fire, even if they could smell stench from 1,500 miles away.\u00a0 Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports 29. Bills (21): The wheels really came off in a hurry. Rex Ryan fired. Finger pointing after his departure. Wretched on-field play. Tyrod Taylor's demise. Yikes.\u00a0 Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports 30. Jets (30): So after the great pains franchise took to shield rookie QB Christian Hackenberg, it's worth wondering what lessons this team really taught him.\u00a0 Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports 31. 49ers (31): Franchise is picture of dysfunction as it prepares to start over. Again. But high draft picks and major cap space could portend quick revival.\u00a0 Neville E. Guard, USA TODAY Sports 32. Browns (32): Brain trust admits, \"We haven\u2019t established \u2018the guy' \" at QB. They didn't establish \"the guy\" at LT, either, perhaps still only solid position.\u00a0 Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports Like this topic? You may also like these photo galleries: Replay ",

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police speak to press\u00a0about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people involved in the attack. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Jaweed Kaleem Contact Reporter It was a gruesome incident by any measure. A group of Chicago teens bound and attacked a mentally disabled teen\u00a0and broadcast the violence on Facebook for the public to see. But then six words the black attackers said as they assaulted their white victim changed the nature of things, sending what would\u00a0normally be a local crime investigation in one of the country\u2019s most violence-plagued cities\u00a0into the national fray over a\u00a0combustible\u00a0mix of race, social media and the presidential election. \u00a0\u201cF\u2014 Donald Trump \u201d and \u201cF\u2014 white people.\u201d Police charged four\u00a0teens on Thursday with kidnapping, battery and unlawful restraint after investigating the Facebook Live video that showed them\u00a0attacking and taunting the mentally disabled 18-year-old, punching him while yelling obscenities against the boy\u2019s race and Trump. The 30-minute video, put up on Tuesday and later removed, has spread widely online. It\u00a0shows the victim\u00a0sitting in a corner with his wrists bound and mouth taped shut as his attackers laugh at him. At\u00a0one point they attempt\u00a0to cut off a patch of his hair as his scalp bleeds. The victim was treated at a hospital for unspecified injuries and was reported to be home with his family. Police say they think the\u00a0victim, whose parents had earlier reported him as missing, was attacked because of his disability, not because of his race. Yet the references to white people\u00a0and the president-elect have set off a storm of animosity and finger-pointing. (Jason Meisner, William Lee and Steve Schmadeke) White nationalists have spread the clip online via Twitter, using the hashtag #BLMkidnapping to blame\u00a0the Black Lives Matter movement for the crime, although there is\u00a0no evidence of a connection. Conservative commentators have taken up the hashtag and complained that crimes against white Americans receive\u00a0less attention from\u00a0police and the news media than crimes against members of\u00a0other races. Civil rights groups that have tracked hate incidents since the election that have invoked the president-elect\u2019s name have publicly weighed in, while Trump supporters have pointed to the attack as evidence of what they say are growing threats of violence\u00a0against them.\u00a0 \u201cThis comes at a heated time, when different political sides are trying to gain currency, which misses the point. Whether it\u2019s [the Ku Klux] Klan and violence from them or violence like in this case, the actual facts of the situation can get lost,\u201d said Brian Levin, a professor at Cal State San Bernardino who tracks hate crimes. \u201cAnytime something is captured on video, especially if it involves social media, it can become volatile\u00a0and people become concerned just with what circulates in their social media world.\u201d In an interview with a Chicago television station, President Obama called the attack \u201cdespicable,\u201d but said he didn\u2019t believe there had been an increase in racial animosity in the country \u2014 just a greater awareness of it because of cellphones and the Internet. \u201cWhat we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\u201d Obama told WBBM-TV Channel 2. Civil rights groups, accustomed to monitoring crimes against racial and religious minorities as well as against\u00a0immigrants and LGBT individuals,\u00a0said the attack and attention to it took them by surprise. \u201cThe crime is shocking. I\u2019m glad the authorities have moved so quickly,\u201d said Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen. Among the nearly 1,000 hate-related incidents the Montgomery, Ala.-based organization has tracked since the presidential election \u2014\u00a0many of which invoked Trump\u2019s name and targeted Muslims, blacks, Hispanics or immigrants\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Cohen said the organization also found 26 reports of incidents targeted against Trump supporters. I would say the level of hate in our country \u2014 and certainly after the election \u2014 has gone up over the last decade. We\u2019re becoming more polarized. \u2014 Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center It\u2019s unclear whether the Chicago victim, whose name has not been released, had shown\u00a0support for Trump.\u00a0 It\u2019s also unclear what broader views the attackers have\u00a0against white people or how they might have expressed them before the attack. Police reported that at least one of the suspects, 18-year-old Jordan Hill , attended school with the victim. Officials said the two met on Saturday at a McDonald\u2019s outside the city for a sleepover at Hill\u2019s. Instead, officials said, they\u00a0traveled to visit friends on the city\u2019s\u00a0West Side in a van\u00a0Hill had stolen and passed off as his own. On Tuesday, they ended\u00a0up at the\u00a0apartment where two of the other suspects\u00a0lived and where the attack occurred after what police described as a \u201cplay fight\u201d that got out of hand. The victim later escaped, and police found him wandering the streets. \u201cI took the anti-Trump rhetoric as a synonym\u00a0for anti-white rhetoric,\u201d said Cohen, who said he \u201cwould not rule out race\u201d \u2014\u00a0as opposed to only disability \u2014\u00a0as a factor in the attack. Cohen added that attacks against people over their disabilities\u00a0are typically low \u2014\u00a0just 1.2% of hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest FBI statistics. Richard Spencer, a white supremacist who runs a group called the National Policy Institute and has received widespread media coverage for his vocal support of Trump, attempted to use the\u00a0Chicago incident to show his view that whites are being attacked by Black Lives Matter activists.\u00a0 \u201cThis isn't even the first instance of terrorism against whites by anti-Trump #blacklivesmatter supporters in Chicago,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday. \u201cRemember the #blmkidnapping every time some journalist lies about my white advocacy organization and calls it a hate group,\u201d he tweeted the same day. Anti-white hate crimes are among the least common of attacks tracked by the FBI. Slightly more than 59.2%\u00a0of hate crimes in the country in 2015\u00a0had a\u00a0racial motivation.\u00a0Of those\u00a04,216 racially motivated hate crimes, more than half were against blacks, while\u00a018.7% of victims were targeted due to anti-white bias. \u201cThe FBI only tracks reported crimes that have been investigated, so it\u2019s hard to say with any broad certainty whether hate crimes against whites have gone up or down. But I would say the level of hate in our country \u2014\u00a0and certainly after the election\u2014\u00a0has gone up over the last decade. We\u2019re becoming more polarized and social media allows us to amplify it,\u201d Cohen said. Black activists such as those in the Chicago Black Lives Matter chapter have also used social media to fight back against accusations that crimes this week were related to their efforts. \u201cWe've stated time and time again, that we're against all types of harm and violence perpetrated and we've never condoned it. So this is absolutely perplexing and twisted that people are associating this atrocity with this organization and movement,\u201d the group said Wednesday in a Facebook post. \u201cIf you really cared about the victim then you'd be advocating for their care and treatment for trauma. That's what we want. We want centers for healing and mental health care,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, some people are more concerned with attacking us and they don't see how demented that is.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Rancher Sandy Johnson in San Juan County, Utah. \u00a0(Photo courtesy of Gail Johnson) With the exception of his time spent serving in the Army during the Vietnam War, Sandy Johnson has spent most of his 67 years running cattle in southeastern Utah\u2019s starkly beautiful San Juan County. Like many of his fellow ranchers, Johnson has leased land from the federal government for decades to graze his cattle on open range. But President Obama\u2019s recent establishment of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada has caused Johnson and his neighbors to worry that the land his family\u2019s cattle has grazed on for generations may soon be off limits and that the landscape he has spent his entire life working may be inexorably changed. \u201cI think this land should have stayed open to everyone and not be regulated by the federal government,\u201d Johnson told FoxNews.com. Obama\u2019s designation late last month of Bears Ears and Gold Butte as national monuments \u2013 along with his recent ban on oil drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans \u2013 have earned the outgoing president the praise of both environmental groups and Native American groups as he secures his environmental legacy. Western state lawmakers, ranchers and those in the oil and gas industry, on the other hand, have widely panned Obama\u2019s monument proclamations \u2013 claiming that the president\u2019s so-called \u201cmidnight monuments\u201d do not represent the interests of the people in those states and will in time do more harm than good to the environment. Expand / Contract A woman holds protest signs after U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell arrived on July 14, 2016, for a meeting with San Juan County Commissioners in Monticello, Utah, one of the sites that have become a key flashpoint over use of public land in the U.S. West. (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) \u201cThe midnight monument is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes,\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in a statement. \u201cIt does not have the support of the governor, a single member of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, nor any local elected officials or state legislators who represent the area.\u201d Chaffetz joined fellow Utah Rep. Rob Bishop in seeking a consensus on preservation and development between environmentalists, oil and gas companies, local officials and ranchers. The result was the Public Lands Initiative \u2013 which the Obama administration helped craft \u2013 but the bill failed to pass the House and was never introduced in the Senate. The failure of the PLI spurred the Obama administration to move quickly to draw up a Bears Ears National Monument designation \u2013 shrinking it from its originally 1.9 million acres to 1.35 million \u2013 and using the 1909 Antiquities Act to bring it to life. The move angered many Utahns still annoyed at President Bill Clinton\u2019s move in 1996 to name the 1.8 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. While economic growth spurred on by tourism has cooled some tempers, Clinton\u2019s and now Obama\u2019s moves still don\u2019t sit well with many in the Beehive State. \u201cI would like to see it all reversed and for Congress to get rid of the Antiquities Act,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTourists are going to pour in and destroy the land and other people won\u2019t be able to use it.\u201d Experts on public land law, however, argue that -- at least when it comes to the Bears Ears\u2019 designation -- very little will change in regards to grazing or the ranchers\u2019 livelihoods. Obama\u2019s proclamation last month made clear that the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service will continue to administer grazing permits and leases to \u201censure ongoing consistency with the care and management\u201d of both the flora and fauna in the monument and the protection of any Native American artifacts. As for hunting and fishing -- both popular pastimes in the newly named national monument -- Utah will retain jurisdiction over its fish and wildlife management. The only change is that ATVS and other off-road vehicles will be required to stay on certain designated trails and roads. \u201cIn the history of the West, ranchers have acquired a sense that they are effectively the owners of the land,\u201d Charles Wilkinson, a law professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told FoxNews.com. \u201cAny encroachment on the land is going to change this sense of control and there is already a longstanding, violent distaste for government intervention.\u201d This distaste was widely highlighted during the Bundy standoff of 2014, when the now-jailed, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and an armed group faced-off against federal and state law enforcement officials over a 20-year legal dispute in which the\u00a0BLM obtained court orders directing Bundy to pay more than $1 million in withheld grazing fees\u00a0on lands that would soon make up the 300,000-acre Gold Butte National Monument. Expand / Contract Rancher Cliven Bundy, flanked by armed supporters, speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada, on April 18, 2014. Bundy\u2019s battle has been going on since 1993, but it wasn\u2019t until 1998 that Nevada\u2019s Clark County bought out the grazing rights to the land in Gold Butte and retired it that Bundy\u2019s cattle became illegal trespassers on the land. The language of Obama\u2019s proclamation said that there will be no new grazing permits or leases on the land issued within the monument. \"We, the\u00a0Bundy\u00a0family, would like to say to President Obama that we are saddened, but not surprised, by the decision to make our ranch and home a national monument,\" the Bundy family said in a statement issued last week. \"The problems we have had with federal land management have never been about cows, tortoises or fees,\" the statement said. \"It has always been about the constitutional limits on the federal government's authority.\" While the Bundy family put a contentious face of ranchers in their discussions over public lands, both ranchers like Johnson and experts studying the issue say that these ranchers have been far from a destructive force against the environment. Overgrazing in certain sections of the Southwest has led to damaging of western watersheds and soil erosion, but many ranchers have seen that it is in their best interest to make sure that land has time to heal. \u201cThey deserve a lot of credit,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cRanchers are more concerned and do more for the environment than many others.\u201d He added: \u201cThey have been there forever and they want to continue to be there forever.\u201d Expand / Contract President Obama granted monument status to the rock formations in Gold Butte, shown in this 2012 photo, leading to the protection of the scenic and ecologically fragile area near where rancher Cliven Bundy led an armed standoff with government agents in 2014. (\u00c2\u00a9 Las Vegas Review-Journal 2012) The hope for many of these ranchers \u2013 and the fear of environmental activists and Native American groups \u2013 is that when Donald Trump takes office later this month with a Republican-controlled Congress, he will move to reverse Obama\u2019s decisions on the monuments. The issue is, however, that while the Antiquities Act gave a president powered to declare land that is of \u201chistoric or scientific interest\u201d a national monument, it is silent on any powers to abolish them. \u201cIt\u2019s really unclear what powers the president has to abolish these monuments,\u201d James Morton Turner, an associate professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, told FoxNews.com. Trump himself has been ambiguous on his stance toward public lands \u2013 favoring energy development on them while also showing reticence to hand these lands over to the states \u2013 and he rarely brought up Obama\u2019s national monuments while on the campaign trail. The real power over the fate of the national monuments lays in the hands of Congress , which can create, abolish, change the size of and even hand over to individual states control of the monuments. New York\u2019s Father Millett Cross National Monument and Arizona\u2019s Papago Saguaro National Monument are part of the latter group. To abolish the monuments \u2013 or the Antiquities Act altogether - Republicans in Congress would need to pass legislation in both houses. That would require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster and in recent years the Senate has tended to avoid any legislation until they get 60 votes. \u201cChange will not come easily,\u201d Turner said.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Close Massachusetts State Police SOMERVILLE, Mass. \u2014 Police say they have captured a fugitive who escaped from a Rhode Island correctional facility on New Year\u2019s Eve, reports CBS Boston. James Morales, 35, who was on the run since he escaped Wyatt Correctional Facility, was captured in the Boston suburb of Somerville Thursday afternoon, Massachusetts State Police said. State Police said earlier Thursday that Morales was \u201cprobably\u201d the same person who robbed a Bank of America in Cambridge\u2019s Central Square Thursday morning. The suspect in an attempted robbery of a Cambridge, Mass. bank \u00a0seen in surveillance video Jan. 5, 2016 -- police believe the suspect may be James Morales Close FBI via CBS Boston The Bank of America in Central Square was robbed at 7:27 a.m., Cambridge Police said. They said a note was passed, but the suspect did not get away with any money. The robbery suspect was described as a black man about 5\u201910\u201d with a mustache, who was wearing a black jacket, gray sweatshirt, black knit cap, and black sneakers, matching Morales\u2019 description. Hours after the attempted robbery, police searched several locations in Cambridge near the Alewife MBTA stop Thursday afternoon after a possible sighting of Morales, according to the station. The search reportedly utilized K-9 units, and included marshy areas near the T stop. Morales escaped from Wyatt Correctional Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island around 7 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve, though he wasn\u2019t discovered missing until around 10:30 p.m. Two correctional officers have been placed on paid leave pending an investigation into the incident, the facility\u2019s warden, Daniel Martin, said. Warden Martin said Morales climbed onto the top of a basketball hoop in the facility\u2019s recreation yard, used a tool to cut through fencing, climbed onto the prison\u2019s roof, and went through several layers of razor wire to get to a place where he could climb down the side of the building. Police say he then followed nearby train tracks to Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they said he stole a car from a store parking lot and ditched it in Framingham. The car police said Morales stole was reportedly found in Framingham with blood, trash, and clothing inside, and with the Rhode Island plates replaced with Massachusetts ones taken from an apartment complex along Route 9. CBS Boston reports that on Saturday night, Framingham resident Vanessa Lugo said Morales showed up at her back door on New Year\u2019s Eve, hours after he broke free from prison. She didn\u2019t know who he was and didn\u2019t answer the door, later learning he was likely looking for the woman who lives upstairs. Before being imprisoned at the Rhode Island facility, Morales was facing charges that he raped an 8-year-old girl in Cambridge. While out on bail on that charge, the FBI says, he\u00a0 stole 10 assault rifles and six handguns from a Worcester armory in 2015 . \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Jenna Portnoy and Lisa Rein January 5 at 9:59 AM Follow @jennaportnoy Follow @Reinlwapo House Republicans this week reinstated an arcane procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reach deep into the budget and slash the pay of an individual federal worker \u2014 down to $1 \u2014 a move that threatens to upend the 130-year-old civil service. The Holman Rule, named after an Indiana congressman who devised it in 1876, empowers any member of Congress to propose amending an appropriations bill to single out a government employee or cut a specific program. The use of the rule would not be simple; a majority of the House and the Senate would still have to approve any such amendment. At the same time, opponents and supporters agree that the work of 2.1\u00a0million civil servants, designed to be insulated from politics, is now vulnerable to the whims of elected officials. The revival of the Holman Rule was the brainchild of Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), who is intent on increasing the powers of individual members of Congress to reassign workers as policy demands. He favors a strategic application, likening it to a bullet from a sniper rifle rather than a shotgun. It\u2019s unlikely \u2014 but not impossible \u2014 that members will \u201cgo crazy\u201d and cut huge swaths of the workforce, he said. (C-Span) \u201cI can\u2019t tell you it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday in his office. \u201cThe power is there. But isn\u2019t that appropriate? Who runs this country, the people of the United States or the people on the people\u2019s payroll?\u201d Democrats and federal employee unions say the provision, which one called the \u201cArmageddon Rule,\u201d could prove alarming to the federal workforce because it comes in combination with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Washington bureaucracy, his call for a freeze on government hiring and his nomination of Cabinet secretaries who in some cases seem to be at odds with the mission of the agencies they would lead. \u201cThis is part of a very chilling theme that federal workers are seeing right now,\u201d said Maureen Gilman, legislative director for the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal employees. The rule is particularly troubling to Virginia and Maryland lawmakers and the District\u2019s nonvoting delegate, who represent large numbers of federal workers in the capital region. The Holman provision passed Tuesday as part of a larger rules package but was overshadowed by the Republicans\u2019 effort to weaken the House ethics office on the first day of the new Congress. [ A day of chaos at the Capitol as House Republicans back down on ethics changes ] Republican leaders say the rule increases accountability in government and played down concerns \u2014 some within their own party \u2014 that it will usher in broad changes to the appropriations process. As a concession to Republicans who oppose the rule, leaders designed it to expire in one year unless lawmakers vote to keep it in place. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that voters elected Trump with the hope of fundamentally changing the way government works and that the Holman Rule gives Congress a chance to do just that. \u201cThis is a big rule change inside there that allows people to get at places they hadn\u2019t before,\u201d he told reporters this week. Asked which agencies would be targeted, he said that \u201call agencies should be held accountable and tested in a manner, and this is an avenue to allow them to do it.\u201d The rule was the first thing House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) railed against in a floor speech Tuesday. \u201cRepublicans have consistently made our hard-working federal employees scapegoats, in my opinion, for lack of performance of the federal government itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this rule change will allow them to make shortsighted and ideologically driven changes to our civil service.\u201d The rule changes the process of passing spending bills by allowing any rank-and-file House member to propose an amendment that would cut a specific federal program or the jobs of specific federal employees, by slashing their salaries or eliminating their positions altogether. Before the change, an agency\u2019s budget could be cut broadly, but a specific program, employee or groups of employees could not be targeted because of civil service protections. Republicans and Trump advisers have been quietly drawing up plans since the election to erode some of the job protections and benefits that federal workers have received for a generation, starting with a hiring freeze Trump has pledged to put in place in his first 100 days in office. [ Trump has a plan for government workers. They\u2019re not going to like it. ] Those plans include an end to automatic raises, a green light to fire poor performers, less generous pensions and a ban on union business on the government\u2019s dime. Conservatives were thwarted from making these changes under President Obama, but with unified Republican rule in Washington and Trump pledging to shrink big government and shake up a system he has characterized as awash in \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse,\u201d they are more emboldened than ever. Federal unions and their advocates in Congress \u2014 and even the Republican behind the rule \u2014 scrambled Wednesday to understand how the Holman rule would work. \u201cNow any backbencher can make an amendment to hear his voice heard on a particular program or group of employees,\u201d said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it\u2019s used, if it\u2019s used.\u201d In light of recent inquiries by the Trump transition team about a list of Energy Department scientists who have worked on climate change, advocates for federal workers say they worry that bureaucrats could be targeted for political reasons. Jeffrey Neal, former personnel chief at the Department of Homeland Security and now a senior vice president at ICF International, said the rule \u201ccreates a lot of opportunity for mischief.\u201d Lawmakers could, in theory, even vote to roll back the 2.1\u00a0percent pay raise Obama gave federal employees starting Jan. 1, Neal said. Early in its history, the rule was used to eliminate patronage jobs, particularly customs agents, in the late 19th century before the federal workforce shifted to a nonpolitical civil service. The rule was dropped in 1983, when then-Speaker Thomas \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) objected to spending cuts proposed by Republicans and conservative Democrats. Griffith, known as the unofficial parliamentarian in the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, sought to revive it out of frustration with an $80\u00a0million federal program that pays for the care of wild horses on federal land in the West. He considers the program wasteful. Although Griffith has few federal workers in his poor and rural district in southwest Virginia, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) noted that many of Griffith\u2019s constituents rely on federal programs. \u201cIt\u2019s a back-door way of furthering your desire to dismantle that part of the federal operation,\u201d he said. Connolly and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who each represent thousands of government employees in their Northern Virginia districts, said the rule heralds a new era of granular governing, giving the party in power the ability to mess with federal agencies at a microscopic level. Several House Republicans tried to block revival of the Holman Rule in a closed-door meeting Monday evening. Rep. Barbara Comstock, the only Republican member of Congress from Northern Virginia, voted for an amendment sponsored by Reps. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and Rob Bishop (R-Utah) to strip the rule from the package. The rule \u201cdiminishes the roles of the authorizing committees in the House, and will make it more difficult to pass appropriations bills in the new Congress,\u201d Comstock\u2019s spokesman, Jeff Marschner, said in a statement. However, when the rules package, including the Holman measure, came to the floor Tuesday, she voted for it, as did all but three Republicans. All the Democrats voted no.

Officials who run the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, among others, have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus, and to exert influence with presidents and members of Congress. In 2009, for example, Leon E. Panetta, President Obama\u2019s incoming C.I.A. director, clashed with Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence at the time, after Mr. Blair sought to select the top American spies for overseas postings. Mr. Panetta sent a dispatch to the agency\u2019s employees telling them to ignore Mr. Blair\u2019s message \u2014 an assertion that the C.I.A. was in charge. The rivalries have weakened the national intelligence office and led some critics in the government to question its effectiveness. The year that Mr. Obama took office, an internal report criticized the office of national intelligence for adding to \u2014 not removing \u2014 bureaucratic bloat and doing little to end the tensions among the various spy agencies. In 2010, James R. Clapper Jr., the current director of national intelligence, insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings that he would not be a \u201chood ornament,\u201d saying that despite the inherent limitations on his job, he would try to bring an end to turf battles among the nation\u2019s spy agencies. Six years later, the job appears to have limited appeal to some intelligence professionals, several of whom were not eager to serve in the position for fear that they would not be empowered. Mr. Coats had been an early and strong contender for secretary of defense in the first term of President George W. Bush, until Mr. Bush\u2019s vice president, Dick Cheney, successfully pressed for Donald H. Rumsfeld.

McKinney School of Law. He began a career in life insurance in Fort Wayne, Ind., before joining the office of then-Representative Dan Quayle as a district representative.

Republicans wrapped a provision targeting Planned Parenthood funding into their reconciliation bill to dismantle Obamacare last year, but President Obama, of course, quickly vetoed that measure. In response to Ryan\u2019s threat Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Democrats would again fight against the GOP plan. \u201cWe are not going back. We will stand our ground. We will fight that decision by the speaker to defund Planned Parenthood. And you know what? The American people are with us. We just have to get out the word,\u201d she said. Republicans led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood in a massive government spending bill in 2015, prompting the possible threat of a shutdown. They later backed off and wrapped it into a reconciliation bill, which they are again using this year to repeal Obamacare. Through the reconciliation process, the Senate can fast-track a budget measure and pass it with a simple majority rather than a supermajority. The measure introduced this week tasks several different committees with drafting the legislation, which they must complete by Jan. 27. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The election\u2019s over \u2013 but Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails are still coming to light.\u00a0And they help illustrate why the FBI declared she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with the information flowing across her secret server.\u00a0 A new batch of messages released by the State Department on Tuesday shows the former secretary of state and her team routinely shared her upcoming schedules, talking points and sensitive items \u2013 such as her iPad password \u2013 via the homebrewed system. Other newly revealed emails, which were posted as the result of litigation, show Clinton\u2019s top advisers griping about her during her time as secretary of State; an Asian ruler who later implemented Sharia law saying he considered former President Bill Clinton part of his \u201cfamily\u201d; and Clinton talking about Justin Cooper, one of the key figures who administered to her private server.\u00a0 ASSANGE: RUSSIAN GOV'T NOT SOURCE OF WIKILEAKS EMAILS Many of the 371 emails posted on the State Department website had been partially released previously, and are separate from the hacked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta posted by WikiLeaks before the election. Almost all the messages were partly or heavily redacted. Among the items redacted -- yet still sent over email -- was Clinton's iPad password.\u00a0 In an Aug. 20, 2012 conversation, Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin, told her boss she had the iPad password reset. The device had previously given Clinton problems, though Abedin wrote that it\u2019s \u201call good now.\u201d At the top of the message, Abedin typed out the entirety of the new password, which was redacted on the State Department release. Clinton responded later with even more information, noting that \u201cI finally realized I had to add the [redacted] to the password!!!!\u201d During the July speech in which FBI Director James Comey termed Clinton\u2019s server practices \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal, he also said \u201chostile actors\u201d could have hacked her communications. In at least one instance, Clinton aide Cooper logged hacking attempts on the server.\u00a0 Still, Clinton and her advisers continued sending information that could be dangerous in the wrong hands, including detailed, advanced copies of her schedules and talking points for upcoming calls and meetings with foreign leaders and top U.S. officials. On Sept. 30, 2011 \u2013 the day American-born terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki was killed \u2013 Abedin emailed Clinton to say then-CIA Director David Petraeus wanted to talk on a secure connection. She added: \u201cAssume its about awlaki.\u201d Other emails released Tuesday shed light on Clinton\u2019s relationships. In advance of a September 2012 meeting with the Sultan of Brunei \u2013 who would later impose Sharia law on his country \u2013 Abedin emailed Clinton that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah hoped to have dinner with Clinton and her family. \u201cThey say sultan sees wjc as part of his family and thus is treating you in this \u2018informal\u2019 way,\u201d she wrote, using Bill Clinton\u2019s initials. On Dec. 24, 2011, Clinton emailed Chelsea Clinton, who was using a pseudonym revealed previously by WikiLeaks, asking \u201cWho will provide tech support after Justin leaves,\u201d ostensibly citing Cooper, who originally helped set up Clinton\u2019s server and was typically called for any tech issues Clinton was experiencing. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this later \u2013 he\u2019s actually supported by someone else too as a fyi,\u201d Chelsea replied cryptically. \u201cI think there are a couple options.\u201d In an email chain from April 4, 2012 that Clinton was eventually excluded from, Abedin complained about Clinton\u2019s obsession with an archiving project. \u201cThis records thing is the bain of my existence with her\u2026.\u201d she wrote. Philippe Reines, another top Clinton aide, responded with the frustration he experienced explaining to Clinton that she had received the incorrect copy of a document. \u201cI emailed her that. I told her in the elevator up from videos. I told her that in the pre-brief. I told her that in the elevator up to 8. I made clear it wasn\u2019t that Jake [Sullivan]\u2019s timeline was \u2018inadequate\u2019 \u2013 just that the wrong version made its way to her,\u201d Reines wrote. \u201cBut [I] think it played into whatever anxiety she has that you\u2019re experiencing about the topic of archiving.\u201d Advertisement ",

Radio host Glenn Beck speaks during a Tea Party rally on Sept. 9, 2015, on\u00a0the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington against the Iran deal. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A depraved attack on a mentally disabled white teen broadcast live on Facebook allegedly by four black Chicago-area residents became a national rallying cry Thursday for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame \u2014 without evidence \u2014 for the attack on the Black Lives Matters movement. Shown repeatedly on cable TV and shared tens of thousands of times online, the grotesque video of the 18-year-old being cut with a knife in the scalp and forced to drink toilet water led familiar right wing talking heads including Glenn Beck , Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and others to call for increased charges and to find fault with what they characterized as excessively permissive policing. (William Lee) Beck urged his 1.1 million Twitter followers to \"Stand up with me and demand justice in Chicago for the beating of a disabled trump supporter by BLM ,\" also accusing the media of \"blindly encouraging\" similar crimes. Clarke, appearing on Sean Hannity's Fox News show Wednesday, cited the case as evidence that \"Rahm Emanuel has allowed Black Lives Matter and the ACLU to run the Chicago Police Department.\" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News, \"If this had been done to an African American by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there'd be no question but that it's a hate crime.\" Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos And after Chicago Police, who are under a federal investigation of their policies and practices following their shooting of black teen Laquan McDonald, later Thursday charged four defendants with a hate crime, conservative author Mike Cernovich took a victory lap, telling his 185,000 followers that their activism had led to the charges. \"Sorry you are a loser with no impact,\" Cernovich tweeted at an opponent who dared suggest that the case would have been charged as a hate crime without the conservative outcry. The attacker's shouts of \"F\u2011\u2011\u2011 Donald Trump \" and \"F\u2011\u2011\u2011 white people\" on the filmed attack convinced many on the right that the attack was motivated by the Black Lives Matter movement, though Chicago Police spokesman Frank Giancamilli said Thursday they had found \"no indication that it's linked to any specific group,\" and another police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said investigators believe the man was targeted because he had special needs, not because he was white. Black Lives Matter Chicago tweeted Thursday that \"BLM doesn't condone violence and we are abhorred by this travesty. We hope he's well & receiving care.\" In another tweet, it added, \"In the mainstream imagination of today, anything horrible done by Black people will be associated with BLM.

    "text": "<p>A great blue heron pictured on Chesapeake Bay.</p> Close Verne Lehmberg RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Water clarity in the Chesapeake Bay is the best it\u2019s been in decades, and native rockfish, oyster and blue crab populations are rebounding as the overall health of the nation\u2019s largest estuary improves, a report released Thursday found. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation\u2019s biennial State of the Bay report gave the estuary a C-minus grade, an improvement from a D-plus two years ago and the highest score issued since the inception of the report in 1998. Still, the report notes that the bay - an economic driver that supports fishing, farming, shipping and tourism - remains \u201ca system dangerously out of balance, a system in crisis,\u201d and says progress has been uneven across the region. The Chesapeake Bay watershed spans 64,000 square miles in parts of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Nature: Chesapeake Bay \u201cThe bay is getting better,\u201d foundation President William Baker said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cThis is good news, but the recovery is fragile. There\u2019s a long way left to go.\u201d Scientists from the foundation compile data for 13 indicators in three categories: pollution, habitat and fisheries. They assign each indicator a score from one to 100, and those results taken together resulted in this year\u2019s overall grade of 34. The group says a perfect score is not attainable because of population growth and development, but a 70 would present an A grade and a \u201csaved bay.\u201d Nine of the 13 indicators showed improvement from the last report, and each of the three categories improved overall. On water clarity, the report issued an overall grade of a D-minus. Still, that represented a two-point improvement from the previous report, and the foundation called it \u201cthe clearest water in decades.\u201d The indicator that showed the most improvement was the blue crab population, which the report said has increased dramatically since 2014, from 297 million to 553 million. The report noted that although this year\u2019s population was lower than the 2012 peak of 779 million, it reflects a \u201cmore resilient population\u201d because juvenile, male, and female spawning stock counts all increased. An employee of the Hollywood Oyster company sorts and counts fresh oysters at the company farm in the waters of Chesapeake bay near Hollywood, Maryland. Close MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images The report also found that the rockfish, or striped bass, population appeared to have stabilized after a 10-year decline, and oyster harvests exceeded one million bushels in 2015 for the first time in 30 years. \u201cNative oysters are making a comeback after a near commercial extinction,\u201d Baker said. The only indicator that showed a decline from the previous report was the prevalence of forested buffers, strips of trees that protect the water from soil erosion and pollutants. \u201cThe lack of progress is alarming,\u201d the report said. The foundation said that while Maryland and Virginia are largely on track to achieve the 2017 midterm goals of a joint state and federal agreement designed to reduce pollution in the bay, Pennsylvania is lagging. Those three states comprise about 85 percent of the watershed, Baker said. \u201cPennsylvania is significantly behind, largely due to its failure to meet the goals it set for reducing pollution from agriculture,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. Dr. Carl Hershner, director of the Center for Coastal Resources Management and a professor of marine science at William & Mary, said he thinks the report is confirmation that the investment of public money in efforts to improve the bay is paying off. Baker emphasized that any reduction in those efforts could quickly lead to a reversal of all the progress that\u2019s been made. \u201cWe have to keep this up. These big systems can turn on a dime,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump sat for a deposition on Thursday in a civil lawsuit related to his hotel in the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed to NPR via email. Even as Trump prepares to assume the presidency, he continues to have entanglements related to his wide-ranging business dealings. Jared Kushner And The Anti-Nepotism Statute That Might Keep Him From The White House A source close to the case confirms the videotaped deposition took place at Trump Tower in New York and lasted 90 minutes. The $10 million civil lawsuit, for breach of contract, was filed by Trump's lawyers in August 2015 against celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' restaurant group, Think Food Group. Andr\u00e9s pulled out of a plan to open an upscale restaurant at the hotel after then-candidate Trump disparaged Mexican immigrants. Think Food Group also countersued for $8 million. In countersuing, the restaurant group argued that Trump's comments were hurting business: \"The perception that Mr. Trump's statements were anti-Hispanic made it very difficult to recruit appropriate staff for a Hispanic restaurant, to attract the requisite number of Hispanic food patrons for a profitable enterprise, and to raise capital for what was now an extraordinarily risky Spanish restaurant.\" Trump's lawyers had tried to avoid the deposition, arguing the president-elect was \"extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance.\" But last week the judge in the case ordered Trump to sit for the deposition before the end of this week. While the civil case has dragged on for months, as recently as Thursday morning Andr\u00e9s tweeted an offer to Trump for a way to settle the dispute. Again  Mr. Peotus @realDonaldTrump if you are awake, let's resolve this in a friendly way. We donate $ to a charity, \uf91d\uf600..? Is a great deal! \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) January 5, 2017 A number of lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain outstanding and are unlikely to be resolved before he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. That could mean having a president in office who is subject to ongoing litigation, a potential major distraction for the leader of the free world. There is a pretrial hearing scheduled for May 17 in a case against another celebrity chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, who pulled out of a restaurant project in the Old Post Office as well. Article continues after sponsorship Ethics Expert: Trump's Efforts To Address Conflicts Are 'Baby Steps' Andr\u00e9s endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton during the campaign and called on Trump to apologize to Mexicans and every \"person he has insulted.\" Zakarian told the Village Voice in November that he nixed the project \"because my buddy Donald, he f***** up. He opened his f****** mouth.\" NPR's Peter Overby wrote in more detail about both cases late last year. Despite Trump's boasts that he does not settle lawsuits, he has settled several, including a high-profile fraud case against Trump University for $25 million. There's also a question as to whether Trump can hold the lease on the Old Post Office building once he becomes president. He doesn't own the building but is leasing it from the federal government. The agreement contains a clause that could prove problematic for Trump: \"No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\" ",

Alex Brandon/AP President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly selected former Indiana Sen. Dan Coats to be director of national intelligence, according to several media outlets. NPR has not confirmed the pick. In choosing Coats, he is getting a veteran Washington establishment figure \u2014 a senator, former lobbyist and ambassador to Germany \u2014 with a rare distinction: being banned from Russia. Coats' views on Russia after its annexation of Crimea, and his calls for stronger sanctions as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, landed him and other senators on Russia's banned list. It's a major difference with the president-elect, who has praised Putin and cast doubt on U.S. intelligence conclusions that emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials were hacked at the direction of the Russian government.

(He did not seek re-election in November.) In between Senate stints, Coats served as U.S. ambassador to Germany during the George W. Bush administration and worked as a lobbyist. He was also asked by Bush to help his unsuccessful attempt to win Senate confirmation of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. Article continues after sponsorship Coats has been an outspoken critic of the Russian leader. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats wrote President Obama after Russia annexed Crimea in 2013, urging Obama to impose sanctions against a Russian weapons exporter. The senators argued the sanctions \"would send a powerful message to Putin,\" whose foreign policy, they went on, has become \"increasingly belligerent.\" Coats also sponsored an amendment to a Ukrainian aid bill in the Senate that would prohibit the U.S. government from doing any business with the exporter, a company called Rosoboronexport. Such actions, Coats said, \"would require our foreign partners to make a choice between America and Putin.\" In 2014, Coats also called on organizers of soccer's World Cup to move the tournament, scheduled for Russia in 2018, somewhere else. All of which won Coats the honor of being banned from Russia, along with five other lawmakers, including Armed Services Chairman and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, and three Obama administration staff members.

    "text": "Read the story Angelenos may remember the 2005 storm because it was the first time it rained on the Rose Parade in 51 years. But Tolby, who lives in Lake Tahoe, remembers the storm differently. \u201cIt was pretty wild. I was here in 2005 and it was definitely the hardest rain I\u2019d ever seen. It didn\u2019t stop for 24 hours,\u201d he said. This weekend\u2019s storm could bring 36 straight hours of heavy rain from Mammoth Mountain to Susanville, Tolby said. In the mountains, the rain could pile onto the snow and trigger early snow melts, feeding extra water into watersheds already swollen from a week of rain. \u201cA combination of intense rain on saturated soils will lead to excessive runoff,\u201d the National Weather Service said in its weekend forecast. The Carson, Truckee and Susan rivers are all expected to become overwhelmed and the nearby communities may become increasingly isolated if the deluge triggers mud flows and rock slides. In Mono County, authorities offered sandbags to residents in preparation for the rain. In Yosemite National Park, authorities are cautioning visitors to check with the park before heading in \u2014\u00a0the weekend storm could close Yosemite if the Merced River floods, they said. Colfax, known as the turnaround town, is ready. \"It's something we prepare for \u2014 it goes with the snow, hand in hand,\" said Wes Heathcock, community services director for the tiny Placer County town that has perhaps one of the most used Interstate 80 on/off ramps in Northern California when it is a snow day. When snow conditions become too treacherous, the California Highway Patrol typically closes\u00a0Interstate 80 at Colfax, as it did Wednesday during a snowstorm that also brought a car-semi collision. Perched at an elevation of 2,400 feet, the official tagline of Colfax is \"above the fog, below the snow.\" The options for stranded travelers are slim in the Old West railroad town, whose most famous mention is a passing reference in Jules Verne's \u201cAround the World in 80 Days.\u201d Even Phileas Fogg did not stop. There is a Starbucks and a single motel. \"They're welcome to spend some tax money in Colfax, but generally you'll see they'll trickle back down, try to locate hotels a little closer to the [Sacramento]\u00a0Valley,\" Heathcock said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Colfax\u00a0gears up for the die-hards, travelers who believe the solution to snow-blocked passes is to find another route to the same location. \"We all have this wonderful tool called GPS now,\" Heathcock said. From Colfax, California Highway 174 makes a long northerly loop to the narrow, hairpin turns of Highway 20, eventually depositing drivers into the thick. They hit Interstate 80 at Yuba Pass, just before Donner Summit. During Wednesday's storm, the city's public works crew joined the sheriff and California\u00a0Highway Patrol to stand along that road and ward\u00a0off drivers seeking the bypass. Wednesday's storm dropped up to 2\u00a0feet of snow in less than 24 hours in the Tahoe basin, at times coming down at more than 2\u00a0inches an hour. The Sierra Avalanche Center reported a slight improvement in backcountry conditions. The risk of avalanche was lowered to \"considerable\" even as the threat increased of historically large avalanches caused by slabs of snowpack as thick as 8\u00a0feet above a weak layer of ice laid down by a mid-December rain. Near Lake Tahoe on Thursday. two skiers were caught in an avalanche that closed a local highway. But they were not injured, officials said. Sierra residents are preparing for a third onslaught over the weekend, bringing up to 12 inches of rain below 8,500 feet, and more snow above that. A fourth storm system is forecast to roll across Northern California two days after that. After the weekend storm, another rain-making system is expected to hit Northern California on Tuesday. The storm moving through Southern California was significantly smaller than the one in the north. But it still caused problems. Rain-slicked roads were clogged with commuters after a big rig jackknifed on the eastbound 60 Freeway in East Los Angeles, forcing authorities to shut down five lanes. In Burbank, several lanes were blocked after a semi-truck jackknifed across north and southbound lanes of the 5 Freeway.\u00a0 By midmorning, firefighters\u00a0rescued a man who was stranded on\u00a0an island of branches\u00a0and brush\u00a0in the rain-swollen Los Angeles River near Fletcher Drive in Silver Lake, said  Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the\u00a0 Los Angeles Fire Department . Though the rain subsided Thursday afternoon, the problems kept coming. Crews were forced to temporarily close the northbound 710 Freeway north of the 5 Freeway to replace concrete slabs damaged by the weather, the California HIghway Patrol said. For all the problems the storms may cause, it will bring more good news for California\u2019s six-year drought. Officials have said steady rain in Northern California the last few months has filled reservoirs and increased the once-anemic snowpack. They emphasize the storms won\u2019t end the drought . But if the rains keep up for spring, they could make a major dent.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

Jan. 5, 2017. National Intelligence Director James Clapper and Cyber Command Chief Admiral Mike Rogers were among the intelligence community officials called to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on cyber threats facing the United States. Jan. 5, 2017. Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Senate Republicans broke with the GOP\u2019s incoming president in a nationally televised congressional hearing Thursday, criticizing Donald Trump \u2019s skepticism that hackers backed by Russian intelligence agencies had interfered with the 2016 presidential race. Only one of 14 Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, offered a modest defense of Trump, and he did so by suggesting the president-elect\u2019s promises to boost military spending and production of oil and gas will serve to block Russian ambitions. \u201cThere is some contrary evidence, despite what the media speculates, that perhaps Donald Trump is not the best candidate for Russia,\u201d Cotton said. But as three American spymasters testified that only top leaders in the Kremlin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , could have authorized complex cyberattacks against a U.S. presidential election, there was little pushback from Republican lawmakers who are highly suspicious of Russian intentions and deeply perplexed by Trump\u2019s repeated praise for Putin. \u201cRussia clearly tried to meddle in our political system, no two ways about it,\u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the incoming president. \u201cEvery American should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s attacks on our nation,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), who led the first congressional hearing on the hacking since the November election. \u201cThere is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference.\u201d Only Russia's top officials could have authorized campaign data thefts, U.S. intelligence chiefs testify Jan. 5, 2017, 12:19 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration: U.S. intelligence chiefs blame Russian meddling in presidential... (Noah Bierman) Thanks to a series of mocking tweets and taunts, Trump\u2019s relations with the intelligence community has been tense for weeks. After the hearing ended, he signaled plans to give the 17 U.S. spy agencies new leadership. Aides said Trump would name Dan Coats , a former member of the Senate from Indiana, a onetime U.S. ambassador to Germany and a paid lobbyist, as director of national intelligence, the highest post in U.S. spying. If confirmed by the Senate, Coats would face a daunting task as the link between Trump and the intelligence community. He may also need to reconcile his own hawkish views on Russia, and Putin, with Trump\u2019s far friendlier posture toward the Kremlin. Sen. Coats was banned, along with McCain and several other members of Congress and White House officials, from entering Russia in 2014 after the Obama administration slapped economic sanctions on Russia for its annexation of the Crimea region in Ukraine. Coats, who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, would succeed James R. Clapper , a career intelligence officer. Clapper previously had announced plans to resign when President Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. Clapper took careful note of Trump\u2019s caustic tweets on Thursday, suggesting some were unwarranted. \u201cI think there is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism, which policymakers \u2014 to include policymaker No. 1 \u2014 should always have for intelligence, but I think there's a difference between skepticism and disparagement,\u201d Clapper said. It remains to be seen whether Trump will moderate his doubts or his criticism after he gets a personal briefing Friday on the Russian hacks from a bevy of U.S. intelligence chiefs, including Clapper, CIA Director John O. Brennan \u00a0and James B. Comey, head of the FBI. They are scheduled to brief Trump in New York about evidence they say confirms the Kremlin approved the hacking and leaking of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign manager, among other targets, last year. They will be armed with a newly-completed classified report that Clapper said would include details of Russia\u2019s motivations \u2014 including whether the operation was partly intended to help elect Trump, as U.S. officials have said privately. Obama ordered the inter-agency review after Trump repeatedly rejected statements by U.S. intelligence officials about Russia\u2019s role. Aides said Obama was briefed on the findings Thursday. The full report will be given to Congress on Monday. Parts will be declassified and released to the public after that, according to the White House. Intelligence officials will \u201cscrub this report and make as much public as they possibly can,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Thursday. He called the report \u201can unvarnished assessment.\u201d Though Clinton and her aides have said the leaked emails damaged her White House bid, Clapper said he had \u201cno way of gauging\u201d whether the Russian hacks influenced \u201cthe choice the electorate made.\u201d The operation did not involve changing vote tallies, he said. \u201cWhether or not it was an act of war is a very heavy policy call,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the intelligence community should weigh in on that. I do think it should carry great gravity.\" Asked about his level of confidence that the theft and disclosure of Democratic Party emails was directed by the Russian government and not done by a teenage hacker pecking away in a basement, as Trump has suggested, Clapper responded, \u201cIt\u2019s very high.\u201d Donald Trump is going to accept the notion that Russia hacked Democratic email accounts in an attempt to help his campaign \u2014 and that remains a big if \u2014 it will be partly because Republicans in Congress press him to so. That was clear at Thursday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee... If Donald Trump is going to accept the notion that Russia hacked Democratic email accounts in an attempt to help his campaign \u2014 and that remains a big if \u2014 it will be partly because Republicans in Congress press him to so. That was clear at Thursday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee... (Michael McGough) Once in office, Trump is likely to face intense pressure from Republicans to punish Russia. He also will face demands to do a better job than Obama did at deterring foreign cyberattacks on U.S. targets. Clapper told the panel Thursday that since the election, Russia has continued to use computer hacks, leaks of pilfered material and fake news stories to erode faith in democratic processes and to try to weaken the U.S. government by portraying it as corrupt and dysfunctional. Clapper was joined by Adm. Michael S. Rogers, who heads the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, and Marcel J. Lettre, undersecretary of Defense for intelligence. They provided few new details about the evidence, but were unequivocal in their judgments. \u201cWe assess that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets,\u201d the trio said in a statement. Russia poses \u201ca major threat to U.S. government, military, diplomatic, commercial and critical infrastructure and key resource networks because of its highly advanced offensive cyber program and sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures,\u201d they said.

A federal report said Thursday natural gas production is on track to make the U.S. a net exporter of energy by about 2030. Ralph Wilson/AP hide caption toggle caption Ralph Wilson/AP Workers move equipment at a natural gas well site near Burlington, Pa., in 2010. A federal report said Thursday natural gas production is on track to make the U.S. a net exporter of energy by about 2030. Ralph Wilson/AP The U.S. could become a net exporter of energy in coming years, according to the federal government's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. This continues a trend the Energy Information Administration has highlighted before in its annual report. The EIA projects the country will continue to import oil through 2050, though at much lower levels than in the past. The main thing that will make the U.S. a net exporter of energy is natural gas. Domestic natural gas production has risen by nearly 30 percent over the past decade, primarily because controversial technologies such as hydraulic fracturing have opened up new fields to drilling. Now companies are proposing and building natural gas export facilities around the country with the production boom expected to continue. The EIA is quick to warn that there is a lot of uncertainty in projections like this. That's why each year the agency considers a variety of factors and then develops multiple scenarios. It looks at things like production, demand, prices and technological advancements. Most of the agency's seven scenarios show the country becoming a net exporter by 2030. One scenario, in which crude oil prices rise sharply, projects the country would become a net energy exporter within just a few years. That's unlikely to happen, though. The agency believes Brent crude oil prices this year will average around $51.66 a barrel \u2014 about half of what a barrel sold for in 2014. Article continues after sponsorship As part of its annual report the EIA also has projections for energy-related carbon emissions. EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski says emission levels will depend a lot on what happens with the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan , which is tied up in the courts now . Considering President-elect Donald Trump's stated desire to boost the coal industry, he could choose to stop defending the plan . \"We see the highest emissions without the Clean Power Plan because we'll continue to use more coal, and coal has more carbon dioxide than the other fossil fuels,\" says Sieminski. The report shows Americans are using energy more efficiently, and the agency projects that will continue. Despite a growing population and a growing economy, consumption is expected to be relatively flat through 2050. The EIA believes gasoline will remain the dominant fuel for transportation in the U.S. for decades. Still, the number of electric vehicles is expected to increase from 1 percent of the cars on the road today to 6 percent in 2040. That may not seem fast enough growth if you're an electric-car advocate, but consider that there are about 250 million cars in the U.S. now. Sieminski says, \"There's a lot of gasoline and diesel-powered cars on the road that are not going to be retired immediately.\" The fact that natural gas is replacing coal for electricity generation has been widely reported. The EIA data show more power comes from gas than coal now. And the agency projects that renewable forms of electricity, such as wind and solar, could overtake coal by 2030. ",

Watch the full story in the two-hour special, \"Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers,\" TONIGHT at 9 p.m. on ABC. Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47, at their Beverly Hills mansion on Aug. 20, 1989. At the time of the murders, Lyle was 21 years old, and Erik was 18 years old. Courtesy Brian Andersen Jose and Kitty Menendez are seen here in this undated family photo. At their first trial, defense lawyer Leslie Abramson argued that Lyle and Erik shot their parents in self-defense because they feared their parents would kill them if they went public about the years of alleged molestation they suffered from their father. Their first trial ended in a mistrial on Jan. 13, 1994, because jurors were deadlocked and unable to come up with a verdict. The brothers were found guilty of first-degree murder in 1996 after a second trial and sentenced to two consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole. SLIDESHOW: Menendez Brothers: Their Childhood, the Murder, the Trial Vander Molen spent summers living with the Menendez family and testified at the brothers\u2019 first trial that Lyle confided in her about the alleged sexual abuse in the summer of 1976. At the time, Lyle was just 8 years old and Vander Molen was 17. ABC News Diane Vander Molen is the cousin of Lyle and Erik Menendez, brothers who were convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents. \u201cOne night, I was in my room changing the sheets in my bed, and Lyle came in,\u201d Vander Molen told ABC News. \u201cHe became very serious about asking me if he could sleep in the other bed next to mine and saying that he was afraid to sleep in his own bed because his father and him had been touching each other down there, indicating that it was his genital area.\u201d Afterward, Vander Molen said she told Kitty Menendez what Lyle said. \u201cBy her demeanor, I could tell that she was not believing any of this,\u201d Vander Molen said. \u201cAnd [she] went downstairs, and Lyle had already gotten into the bed next to mine, and she went ahead and yanked him by the arm and took him back upstairs and I never heard anything else about that.\u201d Brian Andersen Jose Menendez pictured with his sons, Erik, left, and Lyle. Vander Molen says she believed young Lyle\u2019s story because she saw that his fear was real. \u201cHe was scared to sleep in his own bed because he was afraid that his father was going to come in and molest him that night,\u201d said Vander Molen. Vander Molen said she assumed Kitty had put an end to the abuse because Lyle never spoke of it to her again. \u201cIn hindsight, I wish that I would have been stronger about what Lyle was telling me so I could have done something to help them,\u201d she said. Lyle and Erik testified at trial to their claims of their father\u2019s sexual abuse. ",

By Philip Rucker January 5 at 7:24 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Former CIA director R. James Woolsey Jr., a veteran of four presidential administrations and one of the nation\u2019s leading intelligence experts, resigned Thursday from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team because of growing tensions over Trump\u2019s vision for intelligence agencies. Woolsey\u2019s resignation as a Trump senior adviser comes amid frustrations over the incoming administration\u2019s national security plans and Trump\u2019s public comments undermining the intelligence community. \u201cEffective immediately, Ambassador Woolsey is no longer a Senior Advisor to President-Elect Trump or the Transition. He wishes the President-Elect and his Administration great success in their time in office,\u201d Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said in a statement. Woolsey said on CNN Thursday night that he did not want to \u201cfly under false colors\u201d any longer. \u201cI\u2019ve been an adviser and felt that I was making a contribution\u2026.. But I\u2019m not really functioning as an adviser anymore. When I\u2019m on the [television] screen, everybody announces that I\u2019m a former CIA director and that I\u2019m a Trump adviser and I\u2019m really not anymore.\u201d People close to Woolsey said that he had been excluded in recent weeks from discussions on intelligence matters with Trump and retired Lt. Gen.\u00a0Michael Flynn, the incoming White House national security adviser. They said that Woolsey had grown increasingly uncomfortable lending his name and credibility to the transition team without being consulted. Woolsey was taken aback by this week\u2019s reports that Trump is considering revamping the country\u2019s intelligence framework, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk\u00a0candidly. \u201cJim is very uncomfortable being considered an adviser in an area where one might consider him an expert when he is not involved in the discussions,\u201d one person close to Woolsey said. \u201cTo be called \u2018senior adviser\u2019 and your opinion is not sought is something he cannot handle.\u201d Trump transition officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Woolsey\u2019s resignation. Woolsey has been a key player in the national security firmament since the late 1970s, when he served as undersecretary of the Navy in the Jimmy Carter administration. He has held other roles under former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, culminating with the post as director of the CIA between 1993 and 1995. The person close to Woolsey described him as having chafed at Trump\u2019s loose style on Twitter. They described Woolsey as a \u201cvery principled\u201d diplomat who takes care to communicate the right message with just the right words. \u201cThis is a guy [for whom] commas, periods, etc., all have special meaning,\u201d this person said. Woolsey joined the Trump campaign last September, issuing a statement commending Trump\u2019s plans to grow and modernize the military. \u201cMr. Trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face,\u201d he said in the statement. powerpost ",

The suspects \u2014 identified as Jordan Hill, 18; Tesfaye Cooper, 18; Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24 \u2014 were charged Thursday ahead of an afternoon bond hearing. The charges also include aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi had tweeted Thursday morning that authorities were continuing to investigate the \"senseless attack. The attackers, who are black, were heard yelling anti-white epithets at various points throughout the 30-minute video. (Top, L-R): Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington (Bottom, L-R): Tanishia Covington, Tesfaye Cooper Chicago Police Department - AP The unidentified 18-year-old victim, described as having mental health challenges, went to school with Hill and had been willingly with him since Saturday, police said. They added that the two had been known to hang out, so the victim's family in suburban Chicago only first reported him missing late Monday. In a press conference on Thursday, the victim's family said that he is doing as well as he could be under the circumstances. But they were relieved he was home and offered thanks to local law enforcement. \"We appreciate all the support from everyone,\" the victim's brother-in-law David Boyd said on behalf of the family. \"This should never have happened,\" he added at the end of the press conference. Officials said Hill and the victim got into an argument that was allegedly made worse by the two women, who are sisters. In total, it is believed he was tied up for four or five hours on Tuesday. Police do not believe the event was premeditated. According to police, the suspects' focus on the victims mental capacity as well as his their statements about race is what led to the hate crime charges. Related: Four Held in Connection With Kidnapping After 'Facebook Live' Torture Video Airs The victim was traumatized by the violence, and eventually spoke with police after he was located wandering on a Chicago street Tuesday night disheveled and in distress. He had to be hospitalized, officials said. The video, which first aired Tuesday and was also uploaded to YouTube, shows the victim cowering in a corner as the group kicks and slaps him and cuts his hair until his scalp bleeds. The assailants can also be heard laughing, discussing drug use and yelling \"F--- Donald Trump!\" and \"F--- white people!\" Police confirmed the second video that showed the teen being forced to drink out of a toilet in a news conference. NBC News has not verified that second video. Play ",

    "text": "Jan 5 2017, 6:33 pm ET Planned Parenthood Will Lose Funding With Obamacare Repeal, Ryan Says by Leigh Ann Caldwell advertisement House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that a measure stripping funds from Planned Parenthood would be included in the bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans' decision to tie defunding the women's health organization to the Obamacare repeal effort could turn off moderate Republicans, complicating the fragile coalition that the party must maintain in order to undo the massive health care law. Play War over Obamacare escalates on Capitol Hill 6:09 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170106093227if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/848370755865\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> One such Republican, Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, has already voiced concern. While she said it's \"really premature\" to say if she'd vote against a repeal defunding Planned Parenthood, she did say she would fight to strip such a measure from the bill. \"There's a group of House Republicans led by (Rep.) Charlie Dent (R-PA) who are opposed to the defunding of Planned Parenthood in the bill, and I hope they'll be successful in separating the two issues or knocking it out all together,\" Collins told reporters Thursday. Collins voted against the last major effort to repeal the ACA, also referred to as Obamacare, in 2015 in part because Planned Parenthood defunding was included. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois took the same stance but he was defeated in his re-election bid last year. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, opposed previous efforts to strip money from the organization, as well, and could be a critical vote. But Collins might see more support from moderate Republicans this year because any repeal effort that passes is likely to be signed by incoming President Donald Trump. Repeal of Obamacare is only going to need the support of a simple majority of senators. With 52 Republican senators, only three need to defect. House Republicans, who enjoy a much larger majority, must also take Republican defections into consideration. There is already concern among conservative Republicans over the timeline for replacement and that not all tax increases that are part of the ACA, such as the tax on medical devices and the tax on high cost health insurance plans, will be repealed, also threatening Republican repeal efforts. Not funding $500 million per year for Planned Parenthood would give the GOP some much needed cash to pay for their healthcare replacement while also satisfying the socially conservative portion of their base. Related: Replacing Obamacare Will be Difficult, Repealing it Will be Just as Hard A group of Senate Democrats hastily convened a news conference to respond to the Ryan's pronouncement. \"This is outrageous,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. \"We are going to fight back every step of the way.\" The vast majority of Planned Parenthood's services revolve around women's health care, including cancer screening, maternity care and preventative care. The government provides approximately half of the national organization's money \u2014 a little more than $500 million dollars per year \u2014 but that money does not go to fund abortions, complying with federal law that outlaws the federal funding of abortion.
