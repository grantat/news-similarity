    "text": "WATCH Syria and Defeating ISIS: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Even though President Obama leaves office today with the leaders of ISIS and al-Qaeda still alive and operational, efforts underway by the U.S. military's Joint Special Operations Command and the CIA may give Trump an early opportunity to take out at least one of the terrorist leaders, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS, in Iraq . A senior national security official in the Obama administration told ABC News that President Obama often hesitated to authorize air strikes when there was a chance of significant \"collateral damage\" \u2013 or civilians being killed. The official said Trump may operate under a different standard. \u201cWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth,\u201d Trump said minutes after taking the oath of office on Friday. As ABC News has reported, al-Baghdadi has been assessed by senior military intelligence analysts for the past few months of being hunkered down in Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, occupied by ISIS since June 2014 and the scene of his only appearance ever on video, delivering a sermon that summer from a mosque's pulpit against the West and proclaiming himself caliph, the leader of all Muslims. Even with Iraqi government special forces units retaking eastern Mosul since the fall in a slow campaign backed by the United States, al-Baghdadi is believed not to have fled to the de facto ISIS capital of Raqqa in Syria, counterterrorism officials told ABC News this week. Killing the No. 1 \"high-value target\" on the U.S. kill list has been a top priority for Obama but accomplishing that in a densely-populated city of an estimated 1 million or more civilians was a challenge that seems to have eluded the outgoing president. Trump may be less hesitant than Obama to launch a strike in Mosul if intelligence operatives pinpoint al-Baghdadi's lair, in the view of many hopeful counterterrorism officials, who say they are eager to exterminate a terrorist who oversaw the butchering of tens of thousands including American and western hostages beheaded on video. Still, a currently serving career intelligence official suggested Trump may be constrained by long-held legal restrictions on armed conflict, which limit foreseeable civilian deaths. \"Lawyers are lawyers,\" the official said. Seamus Hughes, a former National Counter-Terrorism Center official and adviser to former Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Ct.), agreed but said the Obama National Security Council inside the White House had an complex process for approving strikes against terrorist commanders despite its record of eliminating many top leaders. \"Trump is probably more likely to make decisions quicker when it comes to military actions, whereas the Obama NSC has been much more deliberative,\" said Hughes, now the deputy director of the Program on Extremism. In a number of major special operations aimed at killing top leaders of terrorist groups or raids to free American hostages of terrorists, some career officials have said Obama's team waited too long and missed opportunities. The White House has consistently denied such charges. Al-Qaeda remains a threat to the U.S. as well, and its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri , who succeeded Osama Bin Laden after Obama sent Navy SEALs and Army Nightstalker special operations aviators to kill him inside Pakistan in 2011, has long been suspected by the CIA of living not in a remote mountain hideout but in a populated urban area. His move to an urban area may have occurred after a 2006 drone strike in Bajaur, Pakistan narrowly missed killing al-Zawahiri, as ABC News reported exclusively at the time. Top intelligence officials have said privately that al-Zawahiri is believed to have received help from current or retired Pakistani military intelligence officers. Al-Zawahiri has issued dozens of video and audio speeches since then, including as recently as this week. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Vowing to \u201cget the job done,\u201d President Trump took office Friday outlining a drastically different agenda than that of his predecessor and installing key members of his national security team \u2013 as he began the work of turning his bold, and often brash, campaign promises into action.\u00a0 He took the first steps Friday evening, signing an executive order directing agencies to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. The White House also said Chief of Staff Reince Priebus would be directing agencies to enforce an \u201cimmediate regulatory freeze.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,\u201d Trump declared in his inaugural address earlier on the West Front of the Capitol, issuing a fiery condemnation of business as usual in Washington.\u00a0 The president presided over the traditional inaugural fanfare, taking part in the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue before an evening of balls and other festivities. But on the sidelines, his team already was making its mark, part of what Trump called a \u201cnew vision.\u201d\u00a0 The official White House website swiftly switched as Trump took the oath of office, reflecting a new agenda for the new administration. At the top of the \u201cissues\u201d section was Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First Energy Plan,\u201d which included a commitment to nix Obama-era policies to curb global warming and regulate U.S. waterways. Team Trump deemed them \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d that hurt the economy. \u201cLifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,\u201d the website now states. The site posted additional plans for the military, foreign policy, the economy and more. The jobs plan committed to \u201cpro-growth tax reform\u201d including a reduction in the corporate tax rate. In terms of official actions, Trump\u2019s first day consisted mostly of routine transfer-of-power measures. He signed nomination papers for his Cabinet picks \u2013 but also his first bill, legislation allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense secretary. The Senate later confirmed Mattis to lead the Pentagon, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats angered GOP colleagues by resisting efforts to consider more Cabinet nominees on the first day. But bigger and more visceral battles were playing out on the streets of Washington Friday, as anti-Trump protesters swarmed parts of the District in demonstrations that turned violent at times. Amid dozens of arrests, protesters smashed the windows of businesses, forced the temporary shutdown of security checkpoints and clashed with police \u2013 who used pepper spray and tear gas to try to control the crowds. But thousands of Trump supporters also came out, watching the 45th president\u2019s inaugural address from the National Mall and later the parade, at times drowning out the protesters with cheers. The address itself was heavy on populist themes, and stitched together by an appeal for a \u201cnew national pride,\u201d as Trump described patriotism as a salve for the country\u2019s divisions. \u201cWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while \u201cthe people did not share\u201d in Washington\u2019s wealth.\u00a0 In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals \u2013 he described \u201crusted out factories scattered like tombstones\u201d across the land \u2013 and the crime in America\u2019s cities. \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down. \u201cFrom this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. \u2026 We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\u201d\u00a0 Telling the American people this is \u201cyour moment\u201d and \u201cyour day,\u201d Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d\u00a0 As Barack and Michelle Obama departed the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a \u201crobust\u201d start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.

President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their spouses wave to the helicopter carrying former President Obama and the first family. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times) Michael A. Memoli Contact Reporter Freshly sworn in to office, President Trump set about Friday trying to deliver the change he promised as he took the helm of the vast executive branch bureaucracy and began steering\u00a0it toward a new conservative-dominated government. Away from the pomp and circumstance of Inauguration Day that celebrated\u00a0the handover\u00a0of power to Trump from former President Obama ,\u00a0the nuts-and-bolts implementation began largely behind the scenes. In a ceremonial office of the Capitol shortly after he took the oath, Trump signed papers nominating candidates for Cabinet secretary posts,\u00a0paving the way for their confirmations. The Republican-led Senate voted hours later to approve retired Gen. James N. Mattis as secretary of Defense and John F. Kelly , another retired Marine general, as head of Homeland Security. And Friday night in the Oval Office, Trump signed a largely symbolic executive order directing agencies to take steps to \u201cease the burden\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, as Republicans work to repeal and replace it. \u201cThe time for empty talk is over,\u201d Trump declared in his inaugural address. \u201cNow arrives the hour of action.\u201d Early clues about Trump\u2019s top priorities came on the updated White House website , including a commitment to reverse Obama\u2019s climate plans, pursue tax reform, enhance law enforcement and the military, and withdraw from a major Pacific Rim trade pact that had been an Obama administration priority. Trump\u2019s most significant plans will require cooperation from Congress. But Obama\u2019s own aggressive use of presidential authority\u00a0also provides a path Trump can use to quickly reverse course on his predecessor\u2019s actions on immigration, foreign policy and other issues. An hour after Trump assumed the presidency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development indefinitely suspended a pending rate cut for mortgage insurance required for government-backed home loans.\u00a0 The move\u00a0reverses a policy announced in the waning days of the Obama administration that would have trimmed payments for borrowers by hundreds of dollars a year. Similar directives were being made at other agencies, an advisor said,\u00a0though not all were expected to be\u00a0announced. Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s nominee for Housing secretary, singled out the policy for scrutiny during his confirmation hearing last week amid GOP concerns about whether taxpayers would be responsible for the loans if they started to go sour. Like many other candidates in the lengthy presidential campaign, Trump\u00a0had identified dozens of actions he intended to take on his first day in office. As Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, aides increasingly focused on which would ultimately make the list. But a fluke of the calendar meant that the most significant changes would wait at least another few days.\u00a0With the inauguration\u00a0falling at the end of the work week\u00a0and additional celebratory events planned over the weekend, aides said Friday that the most significant actions \u2014 probably on healthcare and foreign policy \u2014\u00a0would wait until Monday. Officials have devised a \u201cday-one, day-100 and a day-200 action plan,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told reporters this week.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the rocky nature of the transition meant Trump was forced to ask dozens of Obama administration appointees to stay on until he could fill their jobs. And the business of government did not pause for the transfer of power. The Pentagon announced Friday that\u00a0U.S. drones and warplanes launched airstrikes the day before on an Al Qaeda training camp in northwestern Syria, killing more than 100 militants.\u00a0Though the U.S. bombs Islamic State fighters daily in\u00a0Syria, it does not hit Al Qaeda strongholds nearly as often. The exceptions are known Al Qaeda leaders, who\u00a0are targeted with drone strikes. The strike was\u00a0authorized by the outgoing Obama administration;\u00a0Trump\u00a0may pull back U.S. support for rebels struggling against President Bashar Assad 's government. Republican congressional leaders signaled their readiness to work with the new president, even if his style was one that at times discomfited some in the party. ",

Vernon Square and Pentagon Metro stations are also closed. Sources: Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies JAN. 18, 2017 By Sarah Almukhtar The Political Atmosphere As Mr. Trump takes office on Friday, he is less popular than any new president in modern American history, according to a series of surveys published in recent days. The numbers suggest that rather than unifying a divided electorate, his transition to power has continued the polarization from the campaign. Polls released on Tuesday by CNN and ORC and by The Washington Post and ABC News found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of the job Mr. Trump has been doing during the transition.

More than 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives said they would not attend the ceremony \u2014 many of them citing Mr. Trump\u2019s recent criticism of Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The Security A well-armed security bubble has encircled much of downtown Washington, as almost 30,000 local, state and federal officials work to ensure that the transfer of power goes off without a hitch. The authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, and other road closings around the region followed. Only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter. No civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter, where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot. To assure security, many items , including backpacks and posters, are prohibited on the Capitol grounds, along the parade route and at the inaugural balls. The National Park Service decided on Thursday to allow small umbrellas onto the National Mall and parade route because of rain in the forecast. The Swearing-In The official swearing-in ceremony began on Friday on the West Front of the Capitol overlooking the Mall. Most of the nation\u2019s dignitaries were on hand, including Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

And six religious leaders chosen by Mr. Trump offered blessings. As Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath of office, Mr. Trump rested his hand on two Bibles : his childhood Bible and the Lincoln Bible, which Mr. Obama also used. Advertisement \u201cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d He then delivered his inaugural address. The Parade After they officially review the armed services Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence will lead a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. A tradition since Thomas Jefferson\u2019s inauguration in 1801, the parade is one of the inauguration\u2019s highlights and typically draws large crowds and TV viewers around the country. More than 8,000 people will march behind the president and vice president, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, including representatives of each branch of the American armed services, as well as high school, college and police bands that have volunteered to perform . This year\u2019s parade is expected to be considerably shorter \u2014 about 90 minutes \u2014 than those celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s recent predecessors. It will also pass a certain conspicuous building that bears the name of the 45th president. The Inaugural Balls Come nightfall, many of the inaugural revelers will dress in their best evening wear to attend balls across the capital \u2014 including some to galvanize resistance to Mr. Trump. All in all, the night should be tamer than eight years ago, when the Obamas attended 10 official inaugural balls and supporters held scores of others. Mr. Trump will attend just three official balls himself. Two of those, \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cFreedom,\u201d will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and are available to supporters who donated to his inauguration or purchased tickets. The third, the \u201cSalute to Our Armed Services Ball,\u201d will be at the National Building Museum for active duty and reserve military members, wounded veterans, emergency medical workers and Medal of Honor recipients. Mr. Trump will deliver remarks at all three balls and, as is customary, he will oblige the attendees with a ceremonial first dance with his wife, Melania. The Protests Protesters are not unusual at an inauguration, but Mr. Trump\u2019s is expected to attract many more than usual . Law enforcement officials said they were expecting 99 groups to carry out demonstrations of all sorts over the inaugural period, including 63 on Friday. The largest event by far will be the Women\u2019s March on Washington , which is on Saturday and is expected to attract several hundred thousand people. Beginning with a rally at 10 a.m. at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the Capitol, the march is intended to raise awareness about a variety of social issues . Here\u2019s what you need to know . Other protests will be scattered throughout the city. Two of the largest are Inaugurate the Resistance and #DisruptJ20 .

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 21, 2017 1:53 AM EST WASHINGTON -- Protesters registered their rage against the new president Friday in a chaotic confrontation with police who used pepper spray and stun grenades in a melee just blocks from Donald Trump \u2019s inaugural parade route. Scores were arrested for trashing property and attacking officers. Officers arrested 217 protesters,\u00a0 CBS affiliate WUSA report s . Six police officers were hurt during the protests, including three who were hit in the head with flying objects. All of them have minor injuries. \u00a0 Violent protests break out after Trump sworn in The bulk of the criminal acts happened at 10:30 a.m. when 400 to 500 people on 13th Street destroyed property, Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said. The protesters were armed with crowbars and threw objects at people and businesses, destroying storefronts and damaging vehicles. Police used pepper spray to diffuse the situation. \u00a0 There were protests in other cities, including Portland, where protesters and police clashed and police used flashbangs and tear gas, CBS affiliate KOIN reports .\u00a0 The planned protest began peacefully Friday afternoon, but the tone of the event changed when police said protesters began throwing \u201crocks, bottles, flares and unknown liquids\u201d at officers who blocked them from walking onto local bridges. \u00a0 In New Orleans, 15 people were arrested and two officers were injured as a band of protesters going through the French Quarter and Central Business District spray-painted graffiti, damaged police vehicles and smashed out windows as businesses, NOPD Chief Michael Harrison said Friday night, CBS affiliate WWL reports .\u00a0 A video on social media shows District of Columbia police pepper-spraying a group of protesters - including an elderly woman and a man on crutches, as well as those trying to help them to move out of the way.\u00a0 A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department declined to immediately provide comment. It was unclear what happened just before the video began.\u00a0 The video shows a woman screaming \u201cmy child\u201d as she runs with her crying son in her arms. Others are hunched over or coughing as plumes of pink spray waft over hundreds of people in the street. Toward the end of the video, protesters appear to be breaking up cement blocks and some people are seen throwing objects toward police.\u00a0 Several spirited demonstrations unfolded peacefully at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through to the inaugural ceremony. Signs read, \u201cResist Trump Climate Justice Now,\u201d \u2018\u2019Let Freedom Ring,\u201d \u2018\u2019Free Palestine.\u201d Many American citizens gather in protest of the presidential inaguration But about a mile from the National Mall, police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, a Bank of America, a Wells Fargo and a McDonald\u2019s as they denounced capitalism and Mr. Trump. Police in riot gear used pepper spray from large canisters and eventually cordoned off protesters at 12th and L streets in northwest Washington. The confrontation began an hour before Mr. Trump took the oath of office and escalated several hours later as the crowd of protesters swelled to more than 1,000, some wearing gas masks and with arms chained together inside PVC pipe. One said the demonstrators were \u201cbringing in the cavalry.\u201d When some crossed police lines, taunting, \u201cPut the pigs in the ground,\u201d police charged with batons and pepper spray, as well as stun grenades, which are used to shock and disperse crowds. Loud booms echoed through the streets about six blocks from where Mr. Trump would hold his inaugural parade.

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images Some protesters picked up bricks and concrete from the sidewalk and hurled them at police lines. Some rolled large, metal trash cans at police. At 13th and K streets, police moved in on a crowd after a limo was set on fire, CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports. The fire department responded to the blaze and put it out. Pegues didn\u2019t see anyone injured at the scene. After the police moved in, some in the crowd removed bricks from the ground and threw them at officers, Pegues reports.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images According to a police spokesman, around 95 people had been arrested by 2 p.m., CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. The charges include rioting and vandalism. Two officers were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Milton reports. Police said in a statement that the group damaged vehicles, destroyed property and set small fires while armed with crowbars and hammers. Peter Newsham, the interim police chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said the group caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d along a number of blocks. Donald Trump delivers his inaugural address as President of the United States Before Inauguration Day, the DisruptJ20 coalition, named after the date of the inauguration, had promised that people participating in its actions in Washington would attempt to shut down the celebrations, risking arrest when necessary. Earlier in the day, as guests were going in to the ceremony, lines for ticket-holders entering two gates stretched for blocks at one point as protesters clogged entrances. Trump supporter Brett Ecker said the protesters were frustrating but weren\u2019t going to put a damper on his day. \u201cThey\u2019re just here to stir up trouble,\u201d said the 36-year-old public school teacher. \u201cIt upsets me a little bit that people choose to do this, but yet again, it\u2019s one of the things I love about this country.\u201d View Gallery Activists race after being hit by a stun grenade while protesting against President Trump on the sidelines of the inauguration in Washington Jan. 20, 2017.

Eleanor Goldfield, who helped organize the Disrupt J20 protest, said protesters wanted to show Mr. Trump and his \u201cmisguided, misinformed or just plain dangerous\u201d supporters that they won\u2019t be silent. Black Lives Matter and feminist groups also made their voices heard. Most Trump supporters walking to the inauguration past Union Station ignored protesters outside the train station, but not Doug Rahm, who engaged in a lengthy and sometimes profane yelling match with them. \u201cGet a job,\u201d said Rahm, a Bikers for Trump member from Philadelphia. \u201cStop crying, snowflakes, Trump won.\u201d Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States Outside the International Spy Museum, protesters in Russian hats ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of President Vladimir Putin, marching with signs calling Mr. Trump \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet\u201d and \u201cKremlin employee of the month.\u201d Demonstrations in Washington were not the only ones Friday. In San Francisco, thousands of demonstrators formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted \u201cLove Trumps hate.\u201d In the city\u2019s financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Mr. Trump. In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Mr. Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement. In New York, Democratic Councilman Jumaane Williams and other protesters were arrested outside Trump Tower in Manhattan after sitting on Fifth Avenue. Other demonstrators chanted loudly but the event remained peaceful. And in Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Mr. Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud.

Reuters/Adrees Latif In Washington, the \u201cFestival of Resistance\u201d march ran about 1.5 miles to McPherson Square, a park about three blocks from the White House, where a rally featured the filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. \u201cWe have to perform an intervention,\u201d Moore said, according to CBS affiliate WUSA-TV . \u201cIt helps us that he has such a thin skin. He can\u2019t stand the fact that people don\u2019t like him. He wants to be loved.\u201d Friday\u2019s protests weren\u2019t the first of the inauguration. On Thursday night, protesters and Trump supporters clashed outside a pro-Trump event in Washington. Police used chemical spray on some protesters in an effort to control the unruly crowd. The demonstrations won\u2019t end when Mr. Trump takes up residence in the White House. A massive Women\u2019s March on Washington is planned for Saturday. Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia\u2019s homeland security director, has said 1,800 buses have registered to park in the city Saturday, which could mean nearly 100,000 people coming in just by bus. 91 Photos Inauguration of Donald Trump \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Celeste Greig of Northridge, left, and Nancy Eisenhart of Woodland Hills were among jubilant Californians who attended the inauguration of President Trump in Washington. (Seema Mehta / Los Angeles Times) Seema Mehta Contact Reporter Shannon, a 48-year-old accountant from Encino, didn\u2019t tell her co-workers she was traveling all the way across the country to get a great view of President Donald Trump \u2019s swearing-in. She told them she was going skiing.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list,\u201d\u00a0said Shannon, who didn\u2019t want The Times to use her last name, lest she be outed. Standing amid\u00a0throngs of like-minded people celebrating a Republican win, Shannon marveled at her freedom to be herself. \u201cI can wear a Trump sweatshirt without getting hoots and hollers. In L.A., you can\u2019t even put a bumper sticker on your car \u2014 it would be keyed in a second.\u201d For California Republicans , Trump\u2019s improbable election was a rare taste of victory. The GOP has not won\u00a0a statewide election\u00a0in more than a decade. The party failed to field a viable candidate for the Senate in 2016, the first time a seat in the upper house had been vacant in nearly a quarter century. Voter registration for the party that gave birth to Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon appears to be at a historic low. \u201cVictories like this are few and far between and very sweet for us, much more so than someone from Texas who is used to winning all the time,\u201d said Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican National Committee member from San Francisco who attended the swearing-in ceremony\u00a0with her husband and parents. The ceremony was chilly and rainy, but that didn\u2019t dampen the rally-like\u00a0mood\u00a0among\u00a0the GOP faithful ready to have their moment. \u201cThe last time I was able to celebrate an inauguration was when [former California Gov. Arnold] Schwarzenegger was inaugurated. That was many years ago, and now, it\u2019s correct, we are certainly not used to winning victories at this level.\u201d The number of Californians who ventured to the nation\u2019s capital for the festivities is unknown. Unlike the heyday under President Reagan \u2014 when the official California ball was the most coveted ticket in town and\u00a0attended by Hollywood royalty \u2014\u00a0there is no longer a central gathering spot. But this week, there were several events aimed at the state\u2019s visitors. More than 140 Californians bought seated tickets for\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s All American Ball, the official ball of the Virginia GOP. The state\u2019s well-heeled donors dined Thursday at the Lincoln Club of Northern California\u2019s soiree at the exclusive Cosmos Club on Embassy Row. Earlier Thursday, more than 600 Californians and expats living in Washington attended a lunch at the Ritz-Carlton featuring the state\u2019s wines, produce and entertainers organized by the nonpartisan California State Society. Members of Congress held receptions and dinners throughout the week.\u00a0Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher \u2019s formal ball at the Library of Congress was expected to be a popular post-inauguration fete on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s better. It\u2019s nice to be amongst all friends,\u201d said Cynthia Bryant of Elk Grove, the state GOP\u2019s executive director, comparing the nation\u2019s capital with her home state. \u201cEveryone in D.C. right now is a Trump supporter. I find it exciting because there\u2019s a lot of people getting along, celebrating the victory. It seems like such a happy time.\u201d Given the distance between California and Washington, it has\u00a0also been an incredibly expensive time. Tickets to balls cost a couple hundred dollars, airfare cost\u00a0several hundred more and basic hotels started in the high three-figures per night. Many Californians stayed in the capital for a few days to enjoy the sights\u00a0in addition to the inaugural festivities, which usually require\u00a0renting or buying ball gowns and tuxedos. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Celeste Greig, a longtime GOP activist from Northridge who shared a basic hotel room with two others for $700 a night near the White House. This was the fifth Republican inauguration the 69-year-old has attended. \u201cThis is my Christmas gift from me to me, my Mother\u2019s Day gift from me to me and my birthday gift from me to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s history, it\u2019s being part of history, and the fact that he was not supposed to be our nominee, the fact he was not supposed to win the November election, the fact that he is so hated by some people and loved by others\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it\u2019s history,\u201d she said. Trump was not Greig\u2019s first choice; she preferred former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. She also liked Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But once Trump became the nominee, Greig and her friend, Nancy Eisenhart of Woodland Hills, went all out volunteering for him. They\u00a0traveled twice to Nevada on their own dime to try to sway voters in that battleground state. \u201cThat\u2019s when we saw America join us, and it was beautiful,\u201d\u00a0said Eisenhart, tearing up on the chilly grounds of the nation\u2019s capital waiting for Trump\u2019s swearing-in as she recalled the diverse group that supported Trump in Nevada, including minorities, the disabled and the elderly. Trump ultimately lost the state to Clinton by 2.4 percentage points. Still, the retirees were not alone in bragging about the amount of energy volunteers in California expended on Trump\u2019s behalf. Though both sides knew Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would overwhelmingly win California\u2019s election, Trump got nearly 4.5 million votes in the state, along with many volunteers who called or traveled\u00a0to more competitive states on his behalf. \u201cIn Sacramento, our call center made more phone calls than the Trump Tower. Not everyone realized that about California, what California did for the Trump campaign,\u201d said West Walker, a middle school teacher from Stockton, as he watched a Trump celebration concert featuring Lee Greenwood, Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down on Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see common people with a common passion who are more about the United States as opposed to dividing the country,\u201d Walker said, recalling that California Republicans were beaten during a Trump rally in San Jose before the state\u2019s primary. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the ones attacking other people. We\u2019ve been victimized; we\u2019ve been literally beaten up when we go to a rally to hear a Trump speech. People [in California] are afraid to come out and speak. So it\u2019s nice to see people with a common passion.\u201d Caption Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Caption Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Caption Trump supporters react on Inauguration Day Trump supporters react on Inauguration Day Trump supporters react on Inauguration Day Caption President Donald Trump's inaugural speech Donald Trump gave his first address as president of the United States at his inauguration Jan. 20, 2017.

    "text": "Gen. James Mattis, Gen. John Kelly confirmed for Trump Cabinet spots Published               January 20, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 As President Trump\u2019s limousine drove the Washington, D.C. parade route on Friday, the Senate was busy at work stocking Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2013 though not fully. Gen. James Mattis was confirmed as Secretary of Defense and Gen. John Kelly was confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security\u00a0in a pair of Friday evening votes. Mattis was approved by a vote of 98-1. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was the lone vote against. Kelly was approved 88-11. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., did not vote on either Kelly or Mattis. Sessions has been nominated to be Attorney General. Trump signed the commissions for Mattis and Kelly later Friday. Vice President Mike Pence swore in both Generals. TRUMP OUTLINES NEW VISION FOR AMERICA Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also tried to\u00a0begin debate on Rep. Mike Pompeo\u2019s nomination as CIA Director following the Mattis and Kelly votes, but Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., objected. Instead, the Senate was set to begin the Pompeo debate on Monday. \u201cI am pleased by the confirmation votes of Generals Mattis and Kelly,\" Trump said in a statement. \"These uniquely qualified leaders will immediately begin the important work of rebuilding our military, defending our nation and securing our borders. I am proud to have these two American heroes join my administration. \"I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay.\u201d Noting the Senate approved seven of former President Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees on the first day of his administration in 2009, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chastised Democrats for refusing to consider confirmation of more of Trump\u2019s nominees. McCain said the only difference between 2009 and 2017 is that now \u201cwe\u2019ve got a world on fire,\u201d citing Syrian refugees and Russia\u2019s aggressive actions. \u201cWe need a new Director of the CIA more than ever,\u201d McCain said. Wyden, however, countered that the Senate would not be Trump\u2019s \u201crubber stamp.\u201d Trump earlier Friday signed into law a waiver allowing Mattis to serve as Defense Secretary. The bill passed by Congress last week granted Mattis a one-time exception from federal law barring former U.S. service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis, 66, retired from the Marine Corps in 2013 after a 41-year career in uniform. FORRESTER: 4 LESSONS MATTIS TAUGHT ME During that same signing ceremony, Trump joked with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about Pompeo\u2019s confirmation. \"Mike Pompeo. Great. They tell me he's going to be approved momentarily, but you never know with this place,\" Trump said. Schumer retorted: \"Depends how you define momentarily \u2014 soon.\" There was little debate about the confirmation of Kelly, who is widely respected by Democrats and Republicans alike. As the former head of the military's Southern Command, based in South Florida, he routinely worked with the Department of Homeland Security to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling. Kelly joined the Marine Corps in 1970 and served three tours in Iraq. He was also the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in November 2010 in Afghanistan. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Davis and Tara Bahrampour January 20 at 7:25 PM Follow JohnWoodrowCox Follow @petejamison Follow @byaaroncdavis Follow @TaraBahrampour Then President-Elect Donald J. Trump speaks in Baton Rouge, La., on Friday, Dec. 09, 2016. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The nation\u2019s stark divide was on full display in Washington Friday as Donald J. Trump became America\u2019s 45th\u00a0president amid joyous roars of support and eruptions of chaos throughout the city, including the removal of a half-dozen protesters who tried to disrupt the swearing-in ceremony. Less than two miles from where Trump and former president Obama joined hundreds of other elected officials at the west front of the U.S. Capitol, anarchists armed with crowbars and hammers marched through the city\u2019s streets, toppling over news boxes, smashing bus-stop glass, vandalizing businesses, spray-painting buildings and, in one case, bashing in the windows of a black limousine. The acts of violence prompted helmeted police to chase the protesters with batons, hose them with pepper spray and apparently toss flash\u00a0bangs into their ranks. Three D.C. police officers were injured as the\u00a0sound of explosions and sirens filled the air \u2013 marking the first intense confrontations in a day that began with protesters shutting down at least a few security checkpoints. The clashes intensified during the afternoon as protesters hurled objects \u2014 including concrete bricks \u2014 at police in black riot gear, who fired back with more flash bangs and pepper spray. As helicopters swirled overhead and about two dozen booms echoed through downtown buildings, dozens of demonstrators fled, coughing uncontrollably and pouring milk in their eyes to wash out the stinging liquid. Traffic throughout the area was left gridlocked. An hour later, the abused limousine was set ablaze, spreading dark smoke throughout the area before firefighters extinguished the flames. The sound of more booms and sirens soon followed. In total, more than 200 people were arrested throughout the day, and the confrontations continued as darkness fell. Richard Spencer, a self-described white nationalist and leader of the \u201c alt-right \u201d movement, was punched in the face by one of the demonstrators after denying that he was a Nazi.

Someone hurled a bottle at the police line. Someone else\u00a0set another garbage can on fire, while another burned a Trump flag on the flames as the crowd shouted, \u201cTrump is a garbage fire.\u201d A half-dozen Trump supporters in \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats charged at protesters shouting \u201cUSA, USA,\u201d then left after a brief verbal confrontation. A limousine surrounded by protesters burns in downtown Washington. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large) worried that the violent demonstrations would unfairly reinforce the image of the nation\u2019s capital as a liberal bastion hostile to Trump and his supporters. \u201cProtesting is, in my opinion, your civil right. But I don\u2019t want you coming in to my town and destroying my property,\u201d\u00a0Bonds said, suggesting that out-of-towners were at fault. \u201cGo home and do it.\u201d Protesters smashed windows of businesses in downtown Washington west of 13th and K streets, just a mile from the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Reuters) Trump\u2019s inauguration\u00a0capped a campaign that galvanized millions of Americans who were eager to embrace a Washington outsider willing to say, or tweet, whatever is on his mind. The 70-year-old real estate mogul \u2014 who has never before held elected office \u2014 was jubilant Friday morning. And legions of his supporters were on hand to embrace their new president. [ Live coverage of Trump\u2019s inauguration ] As his parade began around 3:45,\u00a0thousands of people standing along the route \u2014 some who had woken up before dawn to get there \u2014\u00a0endured an intermittent chilly rain to cheer for and wave banners at the New York real estate mogul. \u201cThe president\u2019s coming,\u201d parade-goers near the start said to each other as they peered down Pennsylvania Avenue. They readied their cell phone cameras, fidgeting and arching their necks as the bass of brass instruments and drums came closer and closer. Just before reaching his newly opened $212 million Trump International Hotel, the president and First Lady Melania Trump exited their armored limousine to wave toward the crowd. But by the time Trump reached the front of his hotel \u2014 where protesters had gathered across the street \u2014 he\u2019d returned to the limo. Beneath the gloomy lighting of a winter afternoon, few could tell which vehicle the president was in. \u201cWas that him?\u201d asked a man from Tennessee at the western edge of the hotel, near 12th Street. Hardly anyone applauded as Trump passed, and an announcement came minutes later that the president had reached Freedom Plaza. \u201cWorst parade ever,\u201d said another man in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. \u201cI waited three hours for that?\u201d Up the street, 37-year-old Kelly Dolin had come from Waynesboro, Va., with his family to watch his\u00a017-year-old son, who attends Fishburne Military School, march in the parade. Dolin was surprised at the subdued mood of the crowds he had seen. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I expected,\u201d said Dolin, who voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019d hear more cheering.\u201d Earlier in the day, at least, Trump\u2019s many supporters didn\u2019t lack in enthusiasm. Kathy Davis and a friend sat in yellow ponchos in a light rain west of the Capitol, awaiting a moment they\u2019d long anticipated.\u00a0Both evangelical Christians, they\u2019d driven down together from upstate New York on Thursday. \u201cWe have just known that Donald Trump was supposed to be president, \u201d said the 59-year-old. \u201cWhen we saw the miracle happen on Election Day, I can\u2019t tell you the feelings that rose up.\u201d One 68-year-old grandmother so adored Trump that she and her family drove 19 hours from Missouri to D.C. to watch him become commander in chief.\u00a0Security had confiscated Marian Curry\u2019s pepper spray and taser but let her keep a small folding chair because of her arthritic knees. Curry insisted she\u2019s neither a Republican nor a Democrat, but something about Trump drew her in. \u201cHe woke me up,\u201d she said. Donna Lutz, a 71-year-old teacher from Florida, said she\u2019d lost friends over her support for him. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I have not been able to have an opinion,\u201d said Lutz, dressed in a bright red coat, fuzzy red earmuffs and a button with Trump\u2019s face. \u201cI was very passionate, so now I get to see that my passions were shared.\u201d [ \u2018I do solemnly swear\u2026\u2019: The 35 most momentous words Donald Trump will say at his inauguration ] Her feelings certainly weren\u2019t shared by everyone. Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric has angered and offended millions of Americans, making him the most unpopular incoming president \u00a0in at least four decades. Friday, Trump supporters and detractors came face to face on the National Mall, around the White House and throughout downtown D.C. Protesters attempt to disrupt Donald Trump\u2019s swearing-in ceremony. In one case, 10-year-old Josh Wheeler\u2019s anti-abortion sign was thrown to the ground, driving him to tears. Wheeler\u2019s father, Todd, said a protester had pushed the boy and called him names, though another anti-Trump activist helped comfort Josh afterward. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the police for letting them do that,\u201d said Wheeler, whose family came to Washington for the inauguration from Indianapolis. Josh Wheeler, 10, cries after his anti-abortion sign was tossed to the ground by a protester. At John Marshall Park\u2019s checkpoint, Black Lives Matter protesters \u2014 chanting \u201cShut it down\u201d \u2014 did just that. Five men chained themselves together, preventing anyone from passing and forcing police officers to redirect attendees to other entrances. \u201cIt feels great that we closed the checkpoint,\u201d said 28-year-old Aaron Goggans, one of the organizers. \u201cBut we know this is just the beginning.\u201d At the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and 20th Street, a very different sort of demonstration was being held as the earthy scent of burning pot wafted, and reggae pumped from a sound system. A cry went up from the crowd of marijuana enthusiasts waiting for their free joints. They were reacting to a herd of motorcycles roaring past, one bike flying a Trump campaign flag. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Bikers for Trump? \u201d said the DJ. \u201cCome for some free weed?\u201d Across the street stood five D.C. police officers, hands in their pockets. Protesters handing out pot at #trump420 pic.twitter.com/kG1adRAHLA \u2014 Sadie Dingfelder (@SadieDing) January 20, 2017 As the newly inaugurated Trump signed paperwork on Capitol Hill, hundreds of protesters meandered up Massachusetts Avenue from Union Station, occasionally blocking both sides of the thoroughfare. The march had taken on a carnival feel, with stilt walkers, large puppets, a\u00a0brass band and\u00a0a giant inflatable elephant adorned with the word \u201cracism.\u201d \u201cImmigrants are welcome here!\u201d people chanted. \u201cNo hate! No fear!\u201d Trump supporters leaving the inauguration taunted the peaceful protesters, waving their ubiquitous red hats. Earlier, at 10th and E streets, protesters had blocked the entrance to a checkpoint. A group of women tied themselves together with purple yarn and sat on the ground to prevent people from passing through. \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho! Donald Trump has to go!\u201d shouted the group of about 100 mostly young protesters. \u201cEnd white supremacy!\u201d Armed with signs, brass instruments and life-size wooden crosses, the assembly danced, blew whistles and sang along with a small marching band. The protest continued until a large group of inauguration goers \u2014 many dressed in suits and dress clothes \u2014 tried to push through the human barricade. People fell to the ground and swore until police officers helped create a lane for the attendees to pass through. Trump supporters and protesters clash. Throughout the city, other anti-Trump protests popped up. At 14th and I streets NW, about 100 anti Trump marchers chanted, \u2018Whose streets? Our streets!\u201d One man carried a bundle of American flags over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to continue shouting into the echo chamber of social media,\u201d said Clara Mystif, 31, a writer from Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re here to actually put our bodies on the line in support of our friends who are going to be targeted by this regime.\u201d Protesters traveled from across the nation and descended upon Washington for Donald Trump's inauguration. Some demonstrators tied themselves created human barricades, blocking entrances to inauguration. (Dalton Bennett,Bastien Inzaurralde,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Law enforcement was prepared to contend with more than 60 demonstration groups that planned to gather in the District, including DisruptJ20 , which drew thousands of participants. The activists\u2019 website promised \u201ca series of massive direct actions that will shut down the Inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations.\u201d They set out to challenge a security plan \u00a0that took months of planning and millions of dollars to execute. Among the obstacles\u00a0facing agitators: Checkpoints, roadblocks, truck-barricaded streets, hundreds of Jersey barriers, miles of \u00a0fencing and 28,000 security officials\u00a0deployed across\u00a0100 square blocks in the heart of Washington. On Friday, counter-demonstrators also arrived\u00a0to support their new president \u2014 most notably, Bikers for Trump , a group that\u00a0served as a vigilante security force at the\u00a0Republican National Convention and expected 5,000 members in Washington. The region\u2019s normally packed Washington-bound Metro trains were mostly empty early Friday. In a yellow line car headed south, two groups of four wearing Trump gear \u2014\u00a0beanies saying \u201cTrump America\u2019s 45th president\u201d and American flag scarves \u2014 sat ebulliently at the end. One bearded man in a North Face vest and sweatpants, clearly new to Metro, propped his feet on a divider and later asked if he could smoke his cigarette. He hopped off his seat to record a selfie video with his friends. \u201cIt\u2019s the best day in America,\u201d he beamed. The man swiveled the camera to show the rest of the crowd. \u201cWashington sucks,\u201d he bellowed, before turning the recording off. \u201cI said \u2018Grab them by the p\u2014y,\u2019 17 times yesterday,\u201d he joked later, referring to Trump\u2019s vulgar comments on the set of Access Hollywood in 2005. He casually repeated the phrase several times, until his female companion shushed him. \u201cToday\u2019s a huge day,\u201d he said as the train approached their stop. \u201cYuuuuge!\u201d his friend responded. Meanwhile, just before 9:30 a.m., the outgoing president left the Oval Office for the final time . As Obama did, reporters asked, \u201cFeeling nostalgic?\u201d Obama responded, \u201cOf course.\u201d Another reporter shouted, \u201cAny words for the American people?\u201d The 44th president of the United States\u00a0answered, \u201cThank you.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s reputation as a showman, the celebration in honor of the former \u201cApprentice\u201d star\u00a0was smaller than the one in 2009 for the nation\u2019s first African American leader. Trump\u2019s 3 p.m. parade is expected to last just 90 minutes . Obama\u2019s took more than four hours. Trump is expected to appear at three official balls. Obama attended 10 . Just 450 bus permits \u00a0had been sought for Friday. About seven times that many \u2013 more than 3,000 \u2013 registered eight years ago. Though Trump suggested \u201crecord numbers\u201d of people would attend\u00a0Friday\u2019s festivities, at least one\u00a0 longstanding ball had to cancel due to a lack of interest, and others have struggled to sell tickets. Compared to past celebrations, far fewer notable celebrities and musicians are attending or performing, and a number of the city\u2019s great halls haven\u2019t been rented. Trump\u2019s hotel\u00a0has frequently been targeted by protesters in recent months. An extra layer of high metal fencing appeared outside its front doors this week, and staff have carefully monitored everyone coming and going. Washington\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s arrival may be due in part to the adversarial relationship he\u2019s long had with the fiercely liberal capital, a place he described as a \u201cswamp\u201d that needs draining. Just 4 percent of D.C.\u2019s residents voted for the new occupant of the city\u2019s most hallowed quarters: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

    "text": "People have descended on Washington to witness, celebrate and protest for 150 years. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ve estimated the size of the crowds. The New York Times Good morning folks, it\u2019s great to be here with you. Alan Rappeport Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, have just arrived. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 9:51 AM ET I\u2019m duplicating Twitter here, but Melania Trump is channeling Jackie Kennedy with her powder-blue dress and fitted suit jacket over it. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 9:53 AM ET Good morning on a remarkable day. This is the first time since George Washington took the oath at Federal Hall in New York in April 1789 that a president without political or military experience will assume ultimate power. So, in a way, an unprecedented day. Maggie Haberman Jon, this was also a strikingly acrimonious campaign. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 9:53 AM ET The  greeting between the Trumps and the Obamas was slightly awkward in terms of the body language. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 9:53 AM ET Trump has, for five years, questioned the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s presidency by falsely insisting he may not have been born in the United States. Maggie Haberman It\u2019s remarkable watching the two of them with their arms around each other. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 9:55 AM ET This won\u2019t be the first time Donald Trump has spoken on the West Front of the Capitol, though obviously not in such a setting.   Back in September 2015, he joined a rally there with Sarah Palin and others against the Iran nuclear deal. It was seen at the time as a sign of the seriousness of his political intentions. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 9:57 AM ET On the birther and body language point, Maggie, I\u2019ve heard for a year and a half that Mrs. Obama was even more worried about Trump than the president was \u2013 a concern driven by how Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories fomented paranoia and hatred toward her husband. So it\u2019s a miracle that it wasn\u2019t even more awkward out there \u2013 and a tribute to the Obamas\u2019 grace. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 9:59 AM ET Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon, two of Trump\u2019s top aides, just arrived at the Capitol. Maggie Haberman Bannon wearing a suit, no less. Alan Rappeport Conway is looking very patriotic, wearing a red, white and blue dress. Alan Rappeport And Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has just arrived. Alan Rappeport We\u2019re about an hour and a half away from the swearing-in ceremony. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:02 AM ET One person who will have a starring role today probably won\u2019t be too well known to most Americans. Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, will serve as master of ceremonies. He is the chairman of the inauguration committee by virtue of being chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. He survived a tough re-election last year against a strong Democratic challenger.  Told me yesterday he wasn\u2019t worried about a thing. Morrigan McCarthy 10:03 AM ET Photo A crowd gathered on the National Mall for the inauguration. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:05 AM ET And Senator Blunt is a big history buff; he and I once had a long conversation about Andrew Jackson, so I bet this is fun for him. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:05 AM ET Mr.  Blunt\u2019s role is also why you will be hearing from the Missouri State University Chorale later! Power has its privileges. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:06 AM ET Ah, politics. When Senator Chuck Schumer did the job, we had a lot of New York bands. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:09 AM ET Chuck Schumer is on the program as well. He will deliver remarks and introduce Justice Clarence Thomas to swear in Mike Pence. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:09 AM ET One thing I would say about Trump\u2019s speech \u2013 which a senior adviser told me is expected to be anchored in the Jacksonian tradition \u2013 it won\u2019t necessarily tell us about the type of president he will be. For that I would look to what has come before. But it will tell us about how he views his place in the canon of U.S. history. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:10 AM ET Former Speaker John Boehner on hand.  He has a relationship with Donald Trump. And they both love golf. Alan Rappeport Newt and Callista Gingrich are also making their way. A reunion of former House speakers. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:14 AM ET Boehner was an original member of the leadership with Newt Gingrich after the 1994 Republican takeover.  Boehner was knocked out in 1998, as was Gingrich, but was able to bounce back. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:15 AM ET Maggie, on the Jackson point: I think this is all coming from Steve Bannon. You know the new president vastly better than I do, but I talked history with him in May 2016 and Jackson never came up. The only role model Trump cited then was Ronald Reagan, and that was only in passing. What strikes me most about today is that the new president truly sees himself as singular figure. Maggie Haberman Newt and Callista are talking to Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:16 AM ET As our readers may recall, Adelson essentially kept Gingrich\u2019s campaign for president alive in 2012. And Gingrich was Adelon\u2019s preferred secretary of state. Maggie Haberman Jon, there is no question this is coming from Bannon. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:16 AM ET For all of the understandable criticism of Bannon, he is also the only person around Trump besides Pence with a deep sense of U.S. history and the presidency. Maggie Haberman Trump sees himself as singular, and for many reasons. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:17 AM ET But Trump has also really liked the comparisons that some of his aides - mostly Bannon and Kellyanne Conway - have made of his rise to Jackson\u2019s rise. Maggie Haberman Bob Dole is arriving now. Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent 10:18 AM ET Good morning all. Among the dignitaries arriving now are members of the clergy. Trump has more clergy praying for him in this inauguration than any previous president. Trump has six, outdoing Nixon, who had five. Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent 10:19 AM ET This has already been a divisive morning, faith-wise. The featured preacher at the service Trump attended today at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, was the Rev. Robert Jeffress. He\u2019s a Southern Baptist from Dallas who has condemned Mormons, Muslims and gays in very vitriolic language, and said that Obama has paved the way for the Antichrist. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:19 AM ET Bill Frist and Trent Lott, two former Republican Senate leaders, also on hand.  Frist, from Tennessee, was Senate leader the last time Republicans controlled the entire government in 2006. Alan Rappeport Hillary Clinton just emerged from a black Lincoln with Bill at the Capitol. Alan Rappeport Clearly a difficult day for them. Maggie Haberman It is really surreal watching Hillary Clinton walk in. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:20 AM ET And it will be significant to watch how Trump deals with her presence, which I suspect may make him uncomfortable. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:20 AM ET It just has to be so difficult for her to be going through this.  Hard to imagine. But she also is aware that is part of her role. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:20 AM ET All former presidents and first ladies are invited to inaugurations and there were some questions about whether they would attend. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:21 AM ET Knowing Trump, he will make some reference to how hard she fought and what a competitor she is. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:21 AM ET I can\u2019t imagine how painful this is for her, Carl. But you\u2019re right that she knows this is what\u2019s expected and not doing it would send a signal she might regret. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:22 AM ET It appears that the rain is holding off for now. Trump joked last night that rain wouldn\u2019t be so bad because it would prove his hair is real. Morrigan McCarthy The crowd on the National Mall. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:22 AM ET While Representative John Lewis made headlines for saying he does not consider Trump a legitimate president, he was elected legitimately, and Clinton herself has said that. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:24 AM ET Mrs. Clinton definitely wants to show she can rise above it.  The presidential loser often has to share the inaugural stage.  Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Al Gore \u2026. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:25 AM ET On Jackson again: The moment is clearly Jacksonian, in that Jackson was the first president of his kind\u2013the first one who was neither a Virginia planter nor an Adams from Massachusetts. But Jackson had been a judge, a senator, a general, and had run for president before. He had a temper and could be erratic, but he knew how to control himself and leveraged those skills in negotiations. To me the key question for the new president is whether he will be able to do the same. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:25 AM ET Yes, Jon, Trump\u2019s lack of grounding in government or public service is completely outside the norm. Maggie Haberman And I don\u2019t know what it will translate into. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:28 AM ET On the Cheneys, remember this is a small dynastic moment for them: Liz is now a Wyoming member of Congress, nearly half a century since her dad came to Washington and 40 years since he became the youngest White House chief of staff, at age 34. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:28 AM ET I agree that this is a moment for the Cheneys.  You will remember that Liz first wanted to run for Senate, but ran into a buzzsaw of opposition and support for the incumbent, Mike Enzi.  Now in the House, her ascension to the Senate will have to wait. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:29 AM ET Jon, I wrote a piece that ran on Election Day about how hard it is to lose a political race, almost like a death. At the time, I thought I was writing a piece about how Trump, who\u2019d never lost a race, would handle this. Maggie Haberman Presidential Historian 10:29 AM ET After losing to Bill Clinton in 1996, Senator Dole walked over to George McGovern, who had lost to Nixon in 1972. \u201cGeorge, when does it stop hurting?\u201d McGovern\u2019s reply: \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:30 AM ET Just saw Nikki Haley. To those who criticize her lack of global experience, I commend a small story from the life of Bush 41. After Bush lost to Lloyd Bentsen in the 1970 Senate race, Nixon nominated Bush for the United Nations. \u201cGeorge, what the [expletive deleted] do you know about foreign policy?\u201d one of his oldest friends, the Democratic congressman Lud Ashley, asked him. \u201cAsk me in two weeks,\u201d Bush replied. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:30 AM ET House members are arriving at the Capitol.  Republicans are jubilant, while Democrats are bracing for a difficult two years but hope they can bounce back in 2018.  Midterms are when there is typically a backlash to the party in power. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:30 AM ET Trump and Obama should be departing the White House shortly to make their way to the Capitol together. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:34 AM ET The crowd is starting to fill in across the National Mall. Officials are expecting around 900,000 people coming to Washington for the main event. That\u2019s about half as many as the 2009 inauguration. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:34 AM ET In 1981, on \u201cthe ride\u201d from the White House to the Capitol, Jimmy Carter, who was exhausted from last-minute negotiations on the hostages in Iran, had little to say to Reagan. Reagan, who hated silence, started telling Hollywood stories. When Carter got out of the limo at the Capitol, he asked Gerald Rafshoon, his communications director: \u201cWho the hell is Jack Warner? He keeps talking about Jack Warner.\u201d Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:36 AM ET A bunch of familiar faces are showing up on the C-Span feed, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; a former Trump campaign adviser, Rick Gates; and the House GOP leadership. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:36 AM ET The makeup of the crowd looks to be more reflective of Trump\u2019s supporters, more white and less diverse than the last two inaugurations. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:36 AM ET Crowd counts are always problematic and the National Park Service doesn\u2019t want to make one. But from my own experience at these - this is my 7th - I think they will be hard pressed to hit 900,000. Maggie Haberman ",

MSF hide caption toggle caption MSF The aftermath of a bombing by the Nigerian military at an internally displaced person camps in Rann, Nigeria. MSF Doctors Without Borders says that the death toll has risen to \"about 90\" from a Nigerian military airstrike Tuesday on a displaced persons camps in the country's restive Borno state. Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari has said that the bombing happened during an operation targeting Boko Haram militants and was accidental. The aid group, also known by its French acronym MSF, initially counted 52 dead from the bombing. Now, it says the death toll may actually be significantly higher than its most recent count of 90, based on reports from residents and community leaders. \"The majority of the victims were women and children,\" it added.

Nigerian Military Strike Kills Dozens In Displaced Persons Camp The Rann camp houses some 25,000 people who have fled from their homes, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, amid a major ongoing military offensive against Boko Haram. Humanitarian organizations have evacuated some 100 injured people from the camp to Maiduguri city for further treatment, according to the ICRC. An ICRC surgeon said in a statement that some 68 patients were expected to be operated on by tomorrow. \"People had sought safety in what they thought was a protected site\u2014instead they were bombed by those who were meant to safeguard them,\" Jochum added. Since the military airstrike, the camp has seen more violence \u2013 this time from the militants. According to the Associated Press, \"More than 100 Boko Haram fighters launched the attack Thursday evening, and soldiers battled for hours trying to repel them.\" The extent of the damage is not yet clear.

    "text": "By Rebecca Shabad CBS News January 20, 2017, 1:13 PM In inauguration speech, Trump vows to give power back to the people Email After taking the oath of office , President Donald J. Trump promised to take the power from the Washington elite and return it to the people, and he stressed that his priority will be to put the U.S. ahead of other nations. Live coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Speaking from the the West Front of the Capitol, Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address that Americans were not merely transferring power from one administration to another and one party to another. \u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d the newly sworn-in president said with thousands watching in person on the National Mall and potentially millions watching on television. In his 17-minute inaugural speech , which he had said he wrote himself, Mr. Trump said that Jan. 20, 2017 \u201cwill be remembered as the day that the people became the rulers of his nation again.\u201d \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\u201d he said. The highlights from the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Among those seated behind him were President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden as well as former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, also attended the inauguration and was seated on the platform. President George H.W. Bush was unable to attend because he\u2019s being treated for pneumonia at a hospital in Houston. Mr. Trump highlighted issues that he said need to be solved such as violence in the nation\u2019s \u201cinner cities,\u201d an education system that\u2019s flush with cash, and crime, gangs and drugs that have taken too many lives. \u201cThe American carnage stops right here, and stops right now,\u201d he said. He denounced previous U.S. policies that he said have subsidized militaries of other countries, allowing for the depletion of the U.S. military, policies that have defended other nations\u2019 borders before America\u2019s and measures that have resulted in spending trillions of dollars overseas before spending money on rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure that Mr. Trump said has \u201cfallen into disrepair and decay.\u201d \u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America First. America first,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\u201d Mr. Trump promised that, \u201cAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before\u201d and that the U.S. would follow \u201ctwo simple rules: buy American and hire American.\u201d The new president vowed to not impose America\u2019s way of life on other nations and to fight \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d \u201cYou will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether, we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again again and yes, together, we will make America great again.\u201d Mr. Obama and the rest of his family will depart Washington, D.C. Friday for a vacation in Palm Springs, California. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Jan. 20) AP As President Trump made his way down Pennsylvania\u00a0Ave. for the traditional\u00a0inaugural parade, there were a notable number of empty seats in the grandstands along the route. In particular, the stand next to the president's viewing stand was noticeably vacant. The Presidential Inaugural Committee was to distribute tickets for those sections. \u00a0The non-ticketed standing areas along the route were less sparse.\u00a0Whether the ticket holders didn't show or the tickets were not given out, the empty seats made for bad optics, particularly on the television broadcast, and people on Twitter took notice. The bleachers right next to Pres. Trump's White House viewing stand for the Inauguration Parade are virtually empty. pic.twitter.com/kNNkfRu3Wo \u2014 Micah Grimes (@MicahGrimes) January 20, 2017 Vice President Mike Pence just passed ... #InaugurationDay2017 pic.twitter.com/ICgrhMZ5Kq \u2014 Deborah Berry (@dberrygannett) January 20, 2017 #Trump organizers were on the metro this morning handing our prime parade viewing seats. They clearly messed up, cuz the stands are empty. \u2014 Howard Fineman (@howardfineman) January 20, 2017 This whole Trump Inaugural Parade has felt and had the energy of a funeral. And the empty stands/small crowds reinforce the hollowness. \u2014 jeff perera (@jeffperera) January 20, 2017 Every shot I see on TV of this parade is of empty stands. Don't let #Trump or anyone else lie about the turnout. #Inauguration \u2014 Just me (@reluctantzealot) January 20, 2017 There were more people in #PresidentTrump 's parade than in the stands \uf629 \u2014 Stephanie Officer (@OfficerStephNY) January 20, 2017 Those embarrassingly empty stands along the parade route? That's what a 42% approval rating looks like. #SoMuchWinning \u2014 Bob Cesca (@bobcesca_go) January 20, 2017 I cannot believe (or maybe I can) how absolutely EMPTY the stands are for the #inauguration parade. That is amazing. \u2014 Daniel P. Horan, OFM (@DanHoranOFM) January 20, 2017 I find it interesting that there are so many empty stands at the parade. Completely empty. Seems very low energy. #TrumpInauguration \u2014 Brittany Pounders (@LibertyBritt) January 20, 2017 At least one person said the reason for the stands was that the parade was behind schedule.

Three-thousand members of local, state and federal law enforcement \u2014 backed by 5,000 National Guard members and police officers from as far away as New Jersey \u2014 patrolled the streets as the evening's festivities got under way and the legions of protesters still seething over the Manhattan mogul's unexpected victory threatened more disruptions.

Witnesses reported the demonstrators \u2014 some of them self-described \"anarchists\" dressed in black and wearing masks \u2014 were taunting police officers to try to get a rise out of them.

One man was accidentally knocked over by protesters, a law enforcement officer told NBC News. He was bleeding from the back of his head as paramedics helped him onto a stretcher. Friday's violence came after a night of chaotic clashes between police and anti-Trump protesters. And it wasn't just limited to downtown D.C. Interstate 695, which runs through the capital, ground to a standstill on Friday afternoon when protesters holding signs and waving flags stopped traffic. To keep protesters out, several security checkpoints were set up around Capitol Hill to screen ceremony ticket holders and keep demonstrators out. Quickly, these became flashpoints of fury where Trump supporters and opponents came face. Play ",

Got it (The Washington Post) By David A. Fahrenthold , Robert Costa and John Wagner By David A. Fahrenthold , Robert Costa and John Wagner January 20 at 5:03 PM Follow @Fahrenthold Follow @costareports Follow @WPJohnWagner Donald John Trump was sworn in Friday as the 45th president of the United States, after which he delivered a dark but ambitious speech promising to throw out entrenched Washington elites, end \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in cities and restore jobs lost to shuttered factories. \u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d Trump said. He spoke on a day that featured less ceremony than usual, and crowds that seemed to be smaller than the ones that attended President Barack Obama\u2019s inaugurations in 2009 and 2013. Trump\u2019s parade rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue, passing crowds that often stood just two people deep. Elsewhere in downtown Washington, columns of peaceful protesters marched with anti-Trump signs, and small groups of black-clad anarchists clashed with police and set fire to trash cans and a limousine. In his speech, Trump seemed to promise not just the obvious transition from Obama\u2019s Democratic administration to full Republican control of Washington \u2014 but to a new style of politics, in which Trump will seek to be a new kind of independent power center. Trump, 70, was administered the oath by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., using two Bibles \u2014 one from President Lincoln\u2019s inauguration, and another that Trump\u2019s mother gave him in 1955. His wife Melania Trump stood at his side. 1 of 96 The scene in Washington on Inauguration Day View Photos Trump supporters and protesters gather in the capital as a new presidency begins.

Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Then, as rain began to fall, Trump gave an inaugural address that \u2014 while short in duration \u2014 made a major break with presidential precedent. Most presidents use this moment to acknowledge the opponent they defeated, to praise America\u2019s promise and to call upon both parties to work together. Trump, by contrast, used his speech to make a wide-ranging condemnation of America\u2019s current state \u2014 talking about \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d caused by urban crime, and saying that \u201cwealth, strength and confidence has dissipated\u201d because of jobs lost overseas. Trump charged that both major political parties have lost their way, serving the needs of an elite rather than the needs of the public. In grandiose language, Trump sought to cast this day as a kind of restart for American politics, with everything before \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 cast aside. \u201cThe United States of America is your country,\u201d he said. With now former president Obama and three previous presidents watching from behind him, Trump seemed to condemn them as unfaithful to the popular will, saying that his inauguration signaled that \u201cthe people\u201d would rule the country again. \u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPoliticians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.\u201d [ \u2018I do solemnly swear\u2026\u2019: The 35 most momentous words Donald Trump will say at his inauguration ] (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) It was a speech that closely matched the tone of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which he cast as a populist insurgency against GOP orthodoxies. But it was not as close a match with the way Trump has acted since the election \u2014 a time when he has chosen some of his Cabinet picks and top staffers from Washington and Wall Street\u2019s existing elites. His choices have included the head of ExxonMobil, three retired generals, several top members of Goldman Sachs and several sitting GOP legislators. \u201cWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree . . . From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first. America first!\u201d Trump said. This two-word slogan, used heavily in Trump\u2019s campaign, became infamous in U.S. history as the slogan of isolationist forces opposed to American entry in World War II. Trump has used it as an economic message. \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American factories,\u201d Trump said. [ A fierce will to win pushed Donald Trump to the top ] Trump\u2019s speech clocked in at less than 17 minutes, making it unusually short among recent inaugural addresses. It concluded with the signature promise of his stunningly successful presidential campaign, to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d During the morning\u2019s events, there were large crowds of protesters opposing Trump with signs and slogans \u2014 and some groups of black-clad anarchists who roamed District streets smashing windows of businesses and cars. Outside The Washington Post\u2019s headquarters on K Street NW, a group of a few dozen anarchists hurled bricks and rocks at police, who responded with loud \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and streams of pepper spray. D.C. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said officers have arrested more than 90 people in connection with protests that turned violent on Friday and caused \u201csignificant damage to a number of blocks in our city.\u201d He said a \u201ca very small percentage\u201d of the thousands who came to demonstrate against the inauguration resorted to violence. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it had to happen. I\u2019m extremely pleased how the [police] responded to this and took the folks responsible for this into custody.\u201d Elsewhere in the city, news reports showed columns of peaceful protesters marching. After the speech, before a traditional lunch at the Capitol, Trump signed three measures. One was a bill providing a waiver for James Mattis \u2014 a retired Marine general \u2014 to become secretary of defense, despite a law that prohibits that position going to recently retired military personnel. Trump also signed formal nominations, sending his Cabinet picks to the Senate. At that ceremony, Trump appeared a slightly different politician than the flame-throwing populist he had been on the inaugural stage. He was in the middle of Washington\u2019s elite, and enjoying their company. Trump joked with Congress\u2019s two top Democrats, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) about the prospects that his choices would be confirmed. At one point, Trump seemed unsure of whom he was nominating for what office. \u201cAh, Betsy,\u201d Trump said, looking at one sheet he was to sign. \u201cEducation, right?\u201d He looked to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), seemingly for confirmation. \u201cYes,\u201d McCarthy said. It was, indeed, the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Trump\u2019s secretary of education. Trump also signed a proclamation declaring a national day of patriotism, new White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a tweet. In recent years, other presidents have declared Sept. 11 of each year \u201cPatriot Day,\u201d in commemoration of the 2001 terrorist attacks. It was not immediately clear whether Trump\u2019s proclamation was a repeat of that tradition, or a new tradition on a different day. As he entered the lunch, Trump appeared to shake the hand of his Democratic opponent, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, whom he made no mention of in his inaugural address. \u201cHow are you? Thank you for coming. Thank you,\u201d Trump said. Later, at the same luncheon, Trump asked both Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, to stand and be applauded. As the lunch ended, the Clinton\u2019s headed toward the exit, walking alongside the statues. Hillary Clinton, when asked by The Post what she thought of the speech, paused, smiled and lightly tapped a reporter\u2019s arm. \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d she said. And then she disappeared around the entrance, out and away as Trump continued to greet lawmakers. Trump\u2019s swearing-in now gives Republicans control of both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006. The new president has promised to undo some of the most significant pieces of Obama\u2019s legacy \u2014 including his signature health-care law. But Trump also enters office with a significant amount of uncertainty, since he has repeatedly contradicted other Republicans \u2014 and himself \u2014 on major questions about how immigration, taxes, health care and other issues will be handled in the new administration. On the Internet, there were other signs of the seismic shift in power. The White House Web page \u2014 which that morning had touted Obama\u2019s initiatives to slow climate change \u2014 now touted a promise from Trump to eliminate \u201charmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s website also promised to be more pro-police than the Obama administration, under which the Justice Department investigated misdeeds in local departments. There was also, seemingly, a nod to Trump\u2019s open attitude toward Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 whose intelligence agencies reportedly sought to intervene in the 2016 election to boost Trump\u2019s chances. \u201cThe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies,\u201d the White House website said. [ Trump keeps Obama appointee tasked with helping run the war against ISIS ] After the speech, new White House counselor Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 the former head of the right-wing website Breitbart News \u2014 said in an interview that Trump\u2019s speech had echoes of another long-ago American populist. \u201cIt was an unvarnished declaration of the basic principles of his populist and kind of nationalist movement. It was given, I think, in a very powerful way. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cBut you could see it was very Jacksonian. It\u2019s got a deep, deep root of patriotism there.\u201d Unspoken, however, was that Trump\u2019s speech seemed to pull the GOP away from the policy positions that had mattered deeply until Trump came onto the scene. The party of free trade had been declared the party of economic nationalism. A party of Russia hawks had been rebranded as a party open to friendship with \u201cold enemies.\u201d \u201cHe keeps telling us, \u2018This is who I really am.\u2019 And people say, \u2018Yeah, but who are you really?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Well, this is who I really am,\u2019\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a longtime fixture in the Washington political and pundit establishment who has become and enthusiastic backer of Trump\u2019s attack on it. \u201cHe\u2019s so different from what you guys are used to covering.\u201d Gingrich was asked: How will Trump, who lost the popular vote, work with Washington\u2019s existing power structure? \u201cHe runs over it. I don\u2019t think he gets cooperation,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThe only way he\u2019s going to get those goals is to go to the American people over and over. I suspect that he\u2019ll end up by spring having to go back out and have huge rallies and try to [bring] grass-roots pressure to bear.\u201d Signs of the transfer of power were on display throughout the day. Before 9:30 a.m., TV footage showed Obama leaving the Oval Office for the last time, before he and the first lady held a pre-inauguration tea with the Trumps. Obama smiled as he walked down an exterior hallway, in view of cameras. \u201cAny last words for the American people?\u201d a member of the press called out. \u201cThank you,\u201d Obama said. Soon after, the Trumps arrived at the White House, greeting the Obamas and presenting them with a gift \u2014 a box wrapped in the distinctive light blue of high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co. The meeting at the White House between Trump and Obama marked an Inauguration Day tradition, but one made more unusual this time by the two men\u2019s history. Trump, a real estate businessman and reality-TV star, began his rise in conservative politics by essentially calling Obama a liar and an illegitimate president: Trump insisted for years that Obama was born in Kenya. Obama was actually born in Hawaii, as Trump conceded late in the 2016 campaign. Obama, in turn, had mocked Trump at a televised White House Correspondent\u2019s Association dinner in 2011. Now, they met at the White House door, one going in and one going out. On the White House steps, the bitter history between Trump and Obama went unmentioned. Obama asked Trump, \u201cHow was church?\u201d and they turned to go inside. The two men and their wives took a motorcade to the U.S. Capitol, through empty streets. Around them, there were sporadic clashes between police and protesters around Washington. In several instances, news video showed black-clad protesters \u2014 some carrying symbols of \u201canarchist\u201d groups \u2014 smashing shop windows and overturning newspaper boxes. [ Two worlds collide: Trump backers and foes trade barbs in Washington ] Before meeting with the Obamas, the Trumps attended a service at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church near the White House, continuing an Inauguration Day tradition. One of the preachers was Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist minister who is pastor of a Dallas megachurch, and who has made inflammatory condemnations of both Mormonism and Islam in the past. Jeffress, who grew close to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, said on Twitter that his sermon would be entitled, \u201cWhen God Chooses a Leader.\u201d Trump left the service about 9:30 a.m. He mouthed \u201cThank you\u201d to supporters as he climbed into an SUV. Trump takes office as the least-popular new president in 40 years, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Forty percent of Americans view Trump favorably, which is 21 points lower than the rating with which Obama will leave office. But Trump won the election and this is his day to command. \u201cIt all begins today!,\u201d Trump tweeted early Friday morning. \u201cI will see you at 11:00 A.M. for the swearing-in.

    "text": "Twitter YouTube A British police watchdog is investigating an incident last Saturday in Bristol in which an officer fired a stun gun at a black man who has served as a community-relations adviser for local law enforcement. Judah Adunbi, 63, was incapacitated after a confrontation with two officers who apparently mistook him for someone wanted by police. In fact, Adunbi has volunteered as a member of an independent advisory group for Avon and Somerset police, a panel established to improve relations between police and the local communities of color. A neighbor recorded the incident on video, shown above. \"Avon & Somerset police officers used the Taser on a 63-year-old man in Colston Road, Easton at around 9.10am,\" the Independent Police Complaints Commission said in a statement released Friday . \"A complaint from a member of the public who witnessed the aftermath of the incident was voluntarily referred to the IPCC by the force on 19 January.\" We've begun an independent investigation into the actions of @ASPolice after a man was tasered in Bristol https://t.co/mbcy865A6H \u2014 IPCC (@IPCCNews) January 20, 2017 In the neighbor's video, two officers are seen stopping Adunbi outside his home as he was walking his dog. They refer to a wanted man they are looking for, and ask him for his name. Adunbi refuses to give his name several times as he attempts to enter his front gate. Article continues after sponsorship Like everyone in the U.K., Adunbi has the right to withhold his name when stopped by officers, according to Avon and Somerset Police guidelines . After a break in the footage, the video shows one of the officers apparently pulling Adunbi out of the gate by the arm. Immediately after that scuffle, one of the officers uses her Taser on Adunbi. Once on his back, Adunbi appears to toss his wallet to the ground beside them, telling the officers to look at his ID as they handcuff him. \"You are under arrest for assault,\" one of the officers tells him. The charges were later dropped, the BBC reports . \"The way I fell, on the back of my head, I was just paralyzed,\" Adunbi later told the British broadcast network ITV . \"I thought that was it. I thought they were taking my life.\" He says his fear stemmed partly from a similar confrontation with police. In 2009, \"he won a wrongful arrest case against Avon and Somerset Police and was awarded compensation,\" according to the BBC. Since then, Adunbi has been a volunteer with the Bristol IAG, one of several groups that serve \"a vital role in helping us build trust, confidence and better relationships, especially with our diverse communities,\" according to the Avon and Somerset police . \"It's a little distasteful in my mouth,\" Adunbi told The Guardian . \"To know that one of the founder members of the independent advisory group, which was created some years ago in order to improve the relationship between the Afro-Caribbean community and the constabulary, and to be treated like this, it's difficult.\" Chief Superintendent Jon Reilly, Bristol area commander for the Avon and Somerset police, says the force voluntarily referred the complaint about Saturday's incident to the watchdog IPCC. He said he would like to answer further questions but could not, given the ongoing investigation. According to ITV, he added: \"I want to reassure the community the whole incident was captured on body-worn camera. Both officers were wearing it. \"And we're determined to understand what happened. That's why we've referred it, voluntarily, to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for them to assess whether an independent review is necessary. \"We work really hard to work positively with all communities and I can see no reason why that should change.\" The IPCC has asked members of the Bristol community to come forward if they have any further information. The group said it has not yet spoken to the two officers involved. ",

White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus would send a memo to all agencies ordering a hold on all regulations. Spicer declined to give further details on the ObamaCare order. Trump was joined in the Oval Office by Vice President Mike Pence, Priebus and other top advisers as he signed the executive order on President Obama's signature health law, which he opposed throughout his campaign. Asked about his first day as president, Trump described it, \"It was busy but good -- a beautiful day.\" Trump also signed the commissions for his first two Cabinet appointments. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly were easily confirmed by the Senate earlier in the day. Both men were formally sworn in by Pence. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Trump is sworn in as president, a divisive, singular figure promising to lift up 'the forgotten' President Donald Trump's inaugural speech Donald Trump gave his first address as president of the United States at his inauguration Jan. 20, 2017. Donald Trump gave his first address as president of the United States at his inauguration Jan. 20, 2017. Noah Bierman Contact Reporter Donald John Trump swore the oath of office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, painting a bleak version of a country marked by \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones\" as he pledged to deliver prosperity to forgotten Americans. Trump, one of the most polarizing figures to assume the office, delivered a brief, unusually combative inaugural address matching the nationalist and populist themes he sounded on the campaign trail. The Republican, whose inauguration was met with protests in Washington and around the country,\u00a0blamed an establishment from both parties for enriching itself at the expense of an ignored underclass. \u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another,\" he told thousands of red-cap-waving supporters\u00a0scattered across the National Mall. \"But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d Trump, who won the presidency by smashing nearly every convention in politics, narrowed his eyes and gave a thumbs up to the crowd amid a light drizzle as he celebrated one of the most solemn and sober rituals in American democracy, a peaceful transfer of power that culminated with him ascending to an office that few thought was within his grasp. His 16-minute speech \u2014 the shortest since President Carter's inaugural in 1977 \u2014 lacked specific policy. In its place was a sense of anger at what he defined as a ruling class that has raided America for its own benefit. He talked of crime, gangs, drugs, poverty, jobs lost to foreign countries and a way of life destroyed by globalism. \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said in a blunt, staccato cadence\u00a0that marked a sharp departure from the soaring rhetoric of his predecessor, former President Obama . \u201cWe are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams and their success is our success.\u201d He promised to shift America\u2019s focus inward, placing the country\u2019s interests ahead of its global presence. Read the story \u201cWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth,\u201d Trump said. After his inauguration, Trump began the job of president, signing routine papers to nominate candidates for Cabinet secretary positions and a waiver that allows his pick to lead the Pentagon, retired Gen. James N. Mattis, to serve despite a rule that typically bars recently active officers from holding the post. Mattis and Gen. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, were\u00a0confirmed quickly by the Senate later Friday. Trump\u2019s spokesman promised more vigorous action in the coming days. Trump, in a red tie and black overcoat, made history on many levels as he was sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\u00a0At 70, he is the oldest president to begin a first term. The brash business mogul also became the only commander in chief to enter the White House with neither government nor military service. And while his predecessors included a screen actor and several war heroes, none became international celebrities in the era of reality television. The gut-check moments along Trump\u2019s journey \u2014 winning his first primary, the Republican nomination and the election itself \u2014 have not mellowed his disdain for tradition any more than Friday\u2019s inauguration. His refusal to conform to political norms helped him attract millions of voters who felt disconnected from coastal power centers and eager to see a leader unafraid of offending people. Trump\u2019s inaugural address seemed targeted to those supporters. \u201cJan.\u00a020, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.\u201d Though no crowd count was announced, the audience was visibly smaller than the 1.8 million people who gathered to witness the nation\u2019s first black president be sworn in eight years ago. Still,\u00a0many who came on Friday had driven 10 or 20 hours from Texas, Florida, the Rust Belt and elsewhere to see a man they believed offered a starkly different kind of politics than his predecessors. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \u2014 President Trump \u201cIt sounded like someone was speaking to us \u2013 finally,\u201d said Pam Lazarites, 61. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing about the establishment \u2013 the government, the politicians.\u201d She and her husband, Ted, drove to Washington from Dayton, Ohio, to attend the inauguration, wearing matching red Trump hoodies. They stood near the back of the crowd, close to the Washington Monument. Trump\u2019s unconventional qualities, and a promise to bring back jobs lost to outsourcing and automation, helped him compile a historic electoral upset in which he dispatched 16 primary opponents and trampled both the Bush and Clinton family political dynasties. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent who attended the inauguration with husband Bill, looked on stoically as she dutifully made her way through the Capitol to watch Trump take the job she had long hoped would be hers. The former rivals failed to shake hands as Trump walked to the stage to deliver his address, though Trump later greeted and thanked her during a congressional lunch at the Capitol after the swearing-in ceremony, prompting a standing ovation from politicians on both sides of the aisle. Some in the inaugural crowd Friday booed and chanted \u201cLock her up\u201d when Clinton\u2019s face showed on the jumbo screens, remnants of the campaign\u2019s ugly tenor overflowing\u00a0into an event that usually feels more celebratory and unifying. Trump shared a fuller embrace with the man he was replacing, Obama, and a kiss with outgoing First Lady Michelle Obama. It could have been an awkward changing of the guard. Yet Trump thanked Obama, whose legacy he campaigned against and whose American birthplace he once questioned, for his graciousness. And Obama, who had said Trump was unfit for the job during the campaign, smiled through much of the transfer of power. Michelle Obama was less visibly comfortable, looking sideways as Trump spoke. The new first lady, Melania Trump , offered a note of glamour beside her husband, wearing a powder-blue shift dress under a half-sleeved bolero-cut jacket pinned at the neck with matching long gloves, reminiscent of Jacqueline Kennedy. Even without new laws or major executive actions, the new thrust of the White House was made clear. Old Twitter handles were quickly replaced and old photos of the Obama era were stripped from the walls of the West Wing in recent days. Trump\u2019s top policy priorities were almost immediately affixed atop the White House website : a rollback of Obama\u2019s efforts to fight climate change; a promise to rebuild the military, defeat Islamic State and create 25 million new jobs; lower taxes for corporations and individuals; a moratorium on regulations; and a promise to end certain trade deals. Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by more than 2.8 million, and he has failed to build support from skeptics who see his presidency as divisive and even dangerous. During the transition period, a time other modern presidents have used to mend wounds from bitter elections, Trump sparred with enemies and inflamed old divisions. He held victory rallies in states that helped win him the election and continued to criticize Clinton in public appearances weeks after she faded into the woods of New York for long walks. Though his inaugural address tended to reinforce that division, he did embed a call for unity into his broader nationalist vision, promising that \u201cthrough our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\u201d He also said during the congressional lunch that the two major political parties are made up of good people. Yet Trump\u2019s more persistent appeals to a\u00a0lingering sense of grievance, combined with resentment from Democrats amid a period of polarization, has helped him secure an ignominious distinction. His approval rating is lower than that of any incoming president in decades, according to polls. \u201cHe\u2019s a bulldog. He calls people names. He has no kind of decency left in him,\u201d said Beritu Haile-Selassie, a Washington resident who stood by herself on a traffic circle, holding up a cardboard sign that read \u201cfake president.\u201d In addition to scattered protests throughout Washington on Inauguration Day, another wave of marchers were expected in the city Saturday to celebrate women\u2019s rights and register disapproval of Trump. Just 40% of Americans hold a favorable impression of Trump, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week. That\u2019s lower than the approval ratings for Presidents George W. Bush (62%), George H.W. Bush (65%), Obama (79%), Reagan (58%) and Carter (78%) before their inaugurations. Yet those ratings demonstrate another truth: Popularity at the beginning of a term does not always correlate with future popularity. Carter and George H.W. Bush lasted just one term. And Reagan, whose lower approval numbers came closest to Trump\u2019s, later\u00a0became one of the most beloved presidents in history.

The first We the People petition to hit the website calls for Trump to release his tax returns. He the first president in decades not to do so, and controversy has swirled around what the documents contain. The petition , which was created today by \"A.D.,\" has garnered about 3,000 signatures, far short of the 100,000 required by Feb. 19 for the White House to review. \"The unprecedented economic conflicts of this administration need to be visible to the American people, including any pertinent documentation which can reveal the foreign influences and financial interests which may put Donald Trump in conflict with the emoluments clause of the Constitution,\" the petition reads. A second petition, by \"H.B.,\" which garnered just a couple of hundred signatures, calls for Trump to \"divest or put in a blind trust all of the president's business and financial assets.\" Experts have told ABC News that Trump may be in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution if he does not adequately separate himself from his businesses. The emoluments clause seeks to prevent U.S. officials from profiting from foreign leaders. A lawyer for Trump, Sheri Dillon, said that Trump is not required by the Constitution to take action regarding his businesses but has signed an agreement to \"completely isolate [him] from the management of the company.\" His sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. will take over the Trump Organization along with a longtime company executive. Donald Trump Sr. refused to release his tax returns during the presidential campaign because he said he was under audit by the IRS. His team said he paid hundreds of millions of dollars in other taxes in response to a report that he may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years. 0 Shares ",

Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, for the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. (Saul Loeb / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The Republican-led Senate voted to confirm James Mattis to be President Donald Trump 's defense secretary and John Kelley to lead Homeland Security. Mattis is telling military personnel and their families that his actions are aimed at making sure \"our military is ready to fight today and in the future.\" Mattis said in a statement Friday evening that he recognizes that \"no nation is secure without friends\" and is pledging to \"work with the State Department to strengthen\" the nation's alliances. He says the Pentagon is \"devoted to gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense, thereby earning the trust of Congress and the American people.\" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who challenged the idea of a former military leader in a civilian job, voted \"no.\" Republicans pushed for fast approval to ensure the post wouldn't be empty even for a brief amount of time after Trump's swearing-in. Mattis will replace Ash Carter, who has been former President Barack Obama's defense secretary since February 2015. Congress had to pave the way for Mattis to serve. Lawmakers last week passed legislation that Trump signed granting Mattis an exception from the law barring former service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the job. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. John Kelly Cliff Owen / AP Retired Marine Corps Gen. John F. Kelly testifies during the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on his confirmation to be Secretary of Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John F. Kelly testifies during the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on his confirmation to be Secretary of Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017. (Cliff Owen / AP) The Senate also voted convincingly to put a tough-talking retired Marine general in charge of overseeing President Donald Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration. Senators confirmed Kelly's nomination to lead the Homeland Security Department, 88-11. Among Kelly's likely first assignments will be executing Trump's plans for the fate of a program that has protected more than 750,000 young immigrants from deportation. If Trump keeps his campaign promises, Kelly's agency will be responsible for strengthening the screening of immigrants permitted to enter the U.S. His department also will be charged with finding additional resources to locate and deport people living here illegally. Kelly says he's in favor of a wall at the Mexican border, but he says a physical barrier alone isn't enough to secure the 2,000-mile frontier. Associated Press ",

The importance of the position of CIA Director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated,\" Senators Ron Wyden of Orgeon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the Democrats are playing a dangerous game. \"It's critical for the president to have a full national security team today, day one,\" he said. \"Earlier today the director and deputy director of the CIA resigned. They left; they're gone. The director's job is open and unfilled. We need to confirm a new director today,\" McConnell added. Democrats point out that a new President Barack Obama asked Preisdent Bush's CIA director to stay on until his nominee, Leon Panetta, was confirmed. But Trump has made no such request and the CIA will be without a director at least until Monday. Trump will enter his first full day in the White House with fewer confirmed Cabinet secretaries than any incoming administration since George H.W. Bush's. Despite the pomp and circumstance and lawmakers' vocal celebration of a peaceful transition of power after one of the most divisive elections in modern history, the polarized electorate is representative of Washington. President Donald Trump and former president Barack Obama stand on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with First Lady Melania Trump and Michelle Obama on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Rob Carr / AFP - Getty Images At a bipartisan luncheon after the inauguration honoring Trump, former presidents, former presidential candidates, former leaders of Congress and current members of Congress mingled at a carefully orchestrated seating at tables of eight made up of both Republicans and Democrats. About 200 attendees dined on lobster in saffron sauce and Angus steak with dark chocolate and juniper jus. The mood from the balcony seemed jovial, but tough conversations were had. A person familiar with the conversation said that Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who sat at the head table with Trump, told Trump that his cabinet nominees are too extreme. Schumer pointed to Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a tea party Republican nominated to be director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Rep. Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton attended the luncheon with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Upon entering, the former secretary of State was surrounded by a gaggle of people, both Republican and Democrat, wanting to shake her hand, give her a hug and take her picture. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, Clinton's challenger in the primary, waited in the periphery until he made his way to her. She shook his hand briefly and turned to his wife where she held her gaze for a few moments longer. Clinton then quickly moved on. Trump gave brief remarks at the end of the lunch that were much more unifying than what he said in his inaugural address. In the luncheon, Trump acknowledged, and even praised, Clinton, allowing the attendees of dignitaries give her a standing ovation. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

    "text": "Live Coverage: Donald Trump's Presidential Inauguration \"For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,\" Trump said. \"Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. The establishment protected itself.\" In his 16-minute remarks, he criticized an educational system \"flush with cash\" that fails to fulfill its mission to students. He lamented factories left to rust while jobs flowed overseas. And he decried crime and gang violence, despite reports from the FBI and criminologists that the U.S. crime rate remains near historic lows. \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" Trump said, amid cheers from the crowd. Moments earlier, with his hand on Bibles once used by Abraham Lincoln and his own family, Trump pledged to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" completing an unlikely trajectory from real-estate mogul to the nation's 45th president. A crowd that stretched along the National Mall assembled under gray Washington skies to witness the ceremony. So did nearly every living former president, from Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush to Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, who was defeated by Trump last November after a costly and bitter campaign. President Trump walks down the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Friday.

Alex Wong/Getty Images Afterward, dozens of dignitaries walked through light rain into the Capitol for a three-course lunch program emceed by Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. The menu included Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, Angus beef with dark chocolate sauce and potato gratin, and chocolate souffle with cherry vanilla ice cream. Trump and his vice president, former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, presided over the parade, which stretched a little under 2 miles from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. School marching bands, the Boy Scouts, veterans groups and 8,000 members of the military participated.

In sporadic exchanges at security check points across downtown Washington, protesters shouted: \"No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!\" Others carried signs with such slogans as \"Fake 45.\" Donald Trump Has Plans To Hit The Ground Running. Here's What He Wants To Do But, so far, skirmishes appeared to be mostly free from violence. Not far from the White House, several hundred protesters clad in black ran through the streets, breaking windows and knocking over trash cans. Police fired pepper spray to subdue demonstrators. The Metropolitan Police Department reported at least 95 arrests, mostly on charges of rioting. Preparations for the event had been under way for months. Around 28,000 officers are on hand to provide security for the event, including Secret Service, FBI agents, the Coast Guard, police departments and nearly 8,000 National Guard troops. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said authorities had \"no specific, credible threat\" directed at the proceedings. Donald Trump's Been Saying The Same Thing For 30 Years Meanwhile, at the White House, household crews are furiously preparing the mansion for its new occupants. Earlier in the day, camera crews spotted President Obama making one last visit to the Oval Office, slipping a letter in the desk drawer for his successor. Staff members at the residence presented the Obamas with two flags: one that welcomed them to the White House eight years ago; another that flew over the building Friday morning, on their last day there. The Obama family headed to Palm Springs, California, Friday for a vacation.

Evan Vucci/AP The formal hand-off of power is now complete, as the Trump administration only begins to come into focus. Trump, who has had no experience in elective office, now controls a vast federal bureaucracy, including national security, international diplomacy, the economy, the environment and the justice system. He's painted his governing agenda in broad strokes, promising to \"Make America Great Again\" by bringing jobs back to the U.S. and deliver a tough message on the international stage. His remarks from the inaugural platform harked back to his campaign speeches: \"We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\" Trump went on to blast \"empty talk\" by politicians of the past. \"Now arrives the hour of action,\" he said. Flanked by his extended family, his vice president, and congressional leaders, Trump took his first actions: signing papers for his cabinet nominees and proclaiming a national day of patriotism. ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic For Mr. Trump, the ceremonies capped a remarkable rise to power that defied all expectations, and his ascension amounts to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, Mr. Trump has at times assailed leaders of both parties and positioned himself as the ultimate outsider, making clear that he will follow his own instincts in determining the nation\u2019s course. America has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out on tabloid front pages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Never before has the presidential oath been administered to someone who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump will become the oldest president ever sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He is one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business ties that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country\u2019s begin. He arrives in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf and, in the hours before his inauguration , fresh word of a federal investigation into the Russian ties of some of his advisers. The New York Times asked people who are attending Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration to tell us about why they\u2019re going. But Mr. Trump overcame the skeptics who did not take him seriously when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy League-educated mogul who lives in a tower with an 80-foot-long living room in the heart of the nation\u2019s largest city, he turned himself into the unlikely leader of a populist movement rooted away from the country\u2019s urban and suburban coasts. His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth telling to many Americans disenchanted with politically correct Washington elites in both parties. But his constant quarrels and impulsive Twitter storms have alienated many others, leaving him with the lowest support in polls of any president entering office in modern times. He takes over on Friday without much of a team in place. Although he has named nominees for every cabinet post, the Senate confirmation process has slowed and few sub-cabinet officials have been announced. Mr. Trump has asked more than 50 officials from Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, particularly in security agencies, to stay temporarily to ensure the continuity of government. For the nation\u2019s 58th inauguration , Mr. Trump opted largely to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a Slovenian-born former supermodel, started the day at a service at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church across Lafayette Square from the White House, then made the short trip to the executive mansion for coffee with Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle. From there, the two presidents shared a limousine for the short motorcade to the Capitol.

(Photo: Porter Binks, USA TODAY) Presidents typically avoid facts and figures when delivering inaugural addresses, serving up a blend of broad platitudes and generalities to lay out a vision. President Donald Trump was no different in that regard. But in his inaugural address , Trump portrayed the United States as a nation in decline, using rhetoric that did not always match reality: \u2022\u00a0Trump portrayed the U.S. as crime-ridden and promised to stop the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d But the U.S. violent crime rate in 2015 was less than half what it was at its peak in 1991. \u2022\u00a0Trump promised to \u201cbring back our jobs.\u201d Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline for decades, but Trump inherits an overall economy that has gained jobs for a record 75 straight months and has an unemployment rate well below the historical norm. \u2022\u00a0He said he would \u201cget our people off of welfare and back to work.\u201d But the welfare rolls have declined under President Obama, and they have dropped precipitously since President Clinton signed legislation in 1996 instituting work requirements and time limits. \u2022 Trump promised to \u201cbring back our borders,\u201d blaming past politicians for \u201crefusing to defend our\u201d border. But the U.S. Border Patrol budget has tripled since 2001, and the number of border patrol agents has doubled. Southwest border apprehensions have dropped 75% from the peak in fiscal 2000. Crime \u2018Carnage\u2019 As he did so often on the campaign trail, Trump again painted a picture of a crime-ridden nation. While Americans want \u201csafe neighborhoods for their families,\u201d Trump said, \u201cfor too many of our citizens, a different reality exists,\u201d one in which \u201cthe crime and the gangs and the drugs \u2026 have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\u201d \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said. Although he spoke in general terms this time, Trump has often framed the issue by citing rising violent crime and murder rates \u2014 which focuses on a one-year uptick but ignores the long-term trend. FBI data show the number of overall violent crimes in the U.S. increased by 3.9% from 2014 to 2015, and murder and nonnegligent manslaughter went up by 10.8%. While authorities are concerned about the one-year violent crime increase, as USA TODAY\u00a0reported , the 2015 figure is still lower than in 2011, and 16.5% below the level nine years earlier. As we have noted , the long-term trend nationwide is a decline, not only in murder rates, but for violent crime in general. The violent crime rate has been on a decline since it peaked at 758.2 in 1991. It was less than half that, 372.6 in 2015. (The FBI describes its data as \u201cestimated,\u201d and it comes from the voluntary reports of local law enforcement agencies.) The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate nationwide, at 4.9 in 2015, is less than half the peak of 10.2 in 1980. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly referenced a spike in murders in cities like Chicago. And indeed, several U.S. cities have seen an alarming spike. A New York Times story in May 2016 cited \u201cnotable increases in murders in about two dozen cities in the first three months of the year compared to last year and a 9 percent increase nationwide.\u201d Criminology and statistics experts told us they can\u2019t discern a trend from such a small snapshot in time. An analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice released on Sept. 19, concluded: \u201cOverall crime rates in 2016 are projected to be nearly the same as last year, with crime remaining at an all-time low.\u201d The analysis found that murder increased by 14% \u201cwith just three cities \u2014 Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. \u2014 responsible for half that increase. All told, 2015\u2019s murder rate was still near historic lows.\u201d The analysis said that \u201cthe average person in a large urban area is safer walking on the street today than he or she would have been at almost any time in the past 30 years.\u201d \u2018Bring Back Our Jobs\u2019 Trump blamed \u201cother countries\u201d for \u201cdestroying our jobs,\u201d and he promised that he would \u201cbring back our jobs.\u201d He did not name the countries or how the jobs were destroyed. But Trump regularly blamed Mexico and China during the campaign, citing the North American Free Trade Agreement and China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, and China entered the WTO Dec. 11, 2001. It is true that U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 website provides data on manufacturing jobs dating to 1939. As of December, there were not quite 12.3 million manufacturing jobs \u2014 which is nearly 7.3 million jobs, or about 37%, fewer than the peak of more than 19.5 million jobs in June 1979. However, not all the job losses can be attributed to trade deals, and some of those job losses were offset by job gains elsewhere in the U.S. economy. For example, a 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service called NAFTA\u2019s impact \u201crelatively modest.\u201d CRS said, \u201cIn reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d One factor in the job losses is automation, which improved U.S. productivity but reduced jobs. A Jan. 18 CRS report, \u201c U.S. Manufacturing in International Perspective ,\u201d noted that \u201cU.S. manufacturers\u2019 large investments in automation \u2026 have eliminated many routine assembly jobs; only two in five workers in U.S. manufacturing establishments are now directly engaged in production.\u201d Overall, Trump inherits a job market that has steadily improved since hitting a post-recession low in 2010. As we wrote in \u201c What President Trump Inherits ,\u201d the U.S. economy has gained jobs for 75 straight months (the longest streak on record), and the unemployment rate is 4.7% (far below the historical norm since 1948). There were also more than 5.5 million job openings as of the last business day in November \u2014 double the number when Barack Obama took over as president in January 2009. BLS has been keeping track of job openings only since December 2000, but since that time the record high was in April 2016, when job openings topped 5.8 million. Poverty and Welfare Trump spoke of \u201cmothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities,\u201d and he promised, \u201cWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\u201d On poverty, as we pointed out in \u201c What President Trump Inherits ,\u201d there were 43.1 million Americans with incomes below the poverty line in 2015. That\u2019s 3.1 million more living in poverty than in 2008, the year before Obama took office. The 13.5% poverty rate, which experienced its biggest one-year drop since 1968 last year, was still three-tenths of a percentage point above where it was in 2008. Poverty figures for 2016 won\u2019t be available until September. Despite a rise in the number and rate of those living in poverty under Obama, the number on welfare declined, reflecting a long-term trend since then-President Bill Clinton signed welfare overhaul legislation in 1996. That legislation, which created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF, to replace the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, imposed time limits for cash assistance and work or work-related requirements for recipients to continue to receive welfare. The average monthly number of individuals and families on TANF since fiscal year 1997 has declined by 75% and 69%, respectively. And the AFDC program provided cash assistance to even greater numbers in the years prior. The average monthly number of individuals receiving assistance in fiscal 1970 was 7.9 million . The figure for 2016 was 2.8 million . Under Obama, the welfare rolls have declined as well. The average monthly number of individuals and families on TANF declined 27% and 26%, respectively, from fiscal year 2008 to 2016 . The number of people receiving food stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , has been declining in recent years but is still up overall under Obama\u2019s tenure. As of October 2016, the most recent month on record, 43.2 million people were receiving SNAP benefits. That\u2019s up 35% from January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, but down 9.6% from the record level in December 2012. \u2018Bring Back Our Borders\u2019 During the campaign, Trump made immigration a central issue, and it was a topic he returned to in his inaugural address. The newly installed president blamed past politicians for \u201crefusing to defend our\u201d borders, promising to \u201cbring back our borders.\u201d But the facts tell a different story. Beginning with President George W. Bush and continuing under President Barack Obama, the U.S. Border Patrol budget went up 218%, from nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $3.6 billion in FY2016. Under Bush, the total number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled \u2014 increasing from 9,821 in fiscal year 2001 (which was the last budget signed by President Clinton) to 20,119 in fiscal year 2009, under funding levels signed by Bush. Under Obama, the number of agents peaked at 21,444, but declined to 19,828 by fiscal 2016. Even so, the number of border patrol agents have doubled since 2001. While spending has gone up, apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border have gone down. In fact, the number of people apprehended while trying to enter the U.S. illegally from Mexico is one-quarter of what it was at its peak over a decade ago. There were 408,870 apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal year 2016, which was 75% below the peak number of 1,643,679 apprehended in FY2000. Read more: ",

    "text": "WATCH President Trump to Americans: 'You Will Never Be Ignored Again' 0 Shares Email A divided nation on edge greeted a new president on Friday. And President Donald J. Trump delivered a message unlike any the nation had heard from its leader. The nation is broken, he said - drifting, decaying, addled by crimes and drugs \u2014 and Trump presented himself as the figure who will \u201cfight for you.\u201d FULL TEXT: President Donald Trump's Inauguration Speech \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d the new president declared. \u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first. America first.\u201d Yet the America he\u2019s putting first is not united and not particularly optimistic. His portrait of America was similar to the one he embraced as a candidate, with little adjustment for the fact that he is now president. Carlos Barria/Reuters President Donald Trump speaks at inauguration ceremonies swearing him in as the 45th president of the United States on the West front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 20, 2017. Trump\u2019s short speech offered essentially no acknowledgment of the millions who opposed his campaign. It was an appeal and a pledge to his base \u2014 to the millions of Americans for whom this is a moment of great hope and not those greeting this era with trepidation. He addressed \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d directly: \u201cYou will never be ignored again.\u201d In vowing to be their voice, Trump outlined a vision for unity that starts with a nation lining up behind its new president. He hinted at an agenda that will scramble party lines \u2014 on trade, on infrastructure \u2014 while emphasizing aspects that are likely to harden his opposition. JUSTIN LANE/EPA President-elect Donald J. Trump delivers his Inaugural address after taking the oath of office as the 45th President of the United States in Washington, D.C., Jan. 2017. Trump\u2019s vision is a rebuke not just to President Obama but also to presidents who came before him. His suggestion that \u201cyou, the people\u201d will now come back into great power is provocative and could test his own Republican Party \u2019s loyalty to him. The president\u2019s prescription comes down to the same word he famously plasters on his airplanes and his buildings. As if on cue, the pageantry of Inauguration Day, with its familiar and beautiful American rituals, obscured the nation\u2019s divisions only for as long as it took protesters to seize the streets. Trump\u2019s hope is that success will be its own uniting force \u2014 a new creed built around a new president, at an anxious time for the nation. \u201cA new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions,\u201d Trump said. 0 Shares ",

By Theresa Vargas , Taylor Hartz and Peter Hermann By Theresa Vargas , Taylor Hartz and Peter Hermann January 20 at 7:20 PM Follow @TheresaVargas1 Follow @phscoop (Dalton Bennett,Bastien Inzaurralde,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Protesters made themselves heard in the nation\u2019s capital Friday, leaving a trail of damage along some city blocks, disrupting security checkpoints at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, and clashing with police as Trump supporters tried to celebrate. As people poured into the city to watch Trump sworn in as the 45th president, they encountered protesters across the area throughout the day. Many of the demonstrations were nonviolent, with people holding signs that spoke to their causes and concerns. One protest even took on a carnival atmosphere, with puppets, stilt walkers and a giant inflatable elephant wearing a sign that read \u201cracism.\u201d But other groups tried to disrupt the day\u2019s events by burning flags, throwing bricks and rioting en masse, leading to injuries and 217 arrests by Friday evening. Six people intent on interrupting the presidential swearing-in ceremony made it into the closest section of seats to Trump. They wore shirts that spelled out \u201cR-E-S-I-S-T\u201d and got up and started shouting \u201cWe the people!\u201d as Trump took the oath of office at noon. As authorities removed them from the area, they raised their fists and shouted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d One woman yelled, \u201cWe\u2019re for an America for all of us.\u201d Some in the crowd responded with taunts: \u201cNa, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, good bye.\u201d [ See the Post\u2019s Live Blog on Inauguration Day news ] After the swearing in, protesters arrived at the Franklin Square area and clashed with police. The protesters were throwing rocks, bricks and chunks of concrete and taking newspaper boxes and barriers and putting them on the streets. Meanwhile police appeared to be using a flurry of flash-bang grenades and chemical spray to hold the protesters back, pushing them block-by-block west along K Street, from 12th Street toward 14th Street. During the afternoon clash, the protesters started a fire in the middle of the street using garbage bins and newspaper boxes, and some climbed trees and light poles. About 100 officers in riot gear, carrying shields, stood in a line blocking off K Street. \u201cIt\u2019s a little jarring when you\u2019re in a peaceful march with drumming and chanting and the next thing you know flash bangs are going off around you,\u201d said Daniel Hultquist, a protester from Rhode Island. \u201cPeople that throw rocks and bricks are undermining the cause.\u201d When one police SUV tried to drive through the crowd, several protesters dressed in all black tried to block it; when the SUV sped up, pushing the protesters aside, one picked up a rock, threw it, and smashed the vehicle\u2019s rear window. At about 4:15 p.m., as the inaugural parade took place blocks away, protesters set a car on fire along K Street, sending plumes of dark smoke through downtown. 1 of 34 Photos of the anti-Trump protests on Inauguration Day View Photos Demonstrators descend on the nation\u2019s capital.

Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump supporters and protesters clashed throughout the day at several locations, and it sometimes turned violent. Three officers were injured during an earlier protest along the K Street corridor, including an officer who was struck by an object that had been thrown, said Doug Buchanan, a spokesman for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services. A fourth officer was struck by a thrown object on K Street in the late afternoon and was taken to a hospital. During the morning protest, a large group of black-clad protesters \u2014 self-described as anti-capitalist and antifascist \u2014 made their way south on 13th Street near K Street, throwing newspaper boxes and garbage cans into the street and trying to set them on fire, leaving them smoldering. They also threw fireworks and broke glass at bus stops, businesses and on the windows of a limousine. Police cleaned up behind them as they marched, and authorities used chemical spray in an attempt to disrupt the vandalism. They ultimately herded the group away from the inauguration parade route with a large number of police vehicles and officers in riot gear, and they used concussion grenades \u2014 which make a loud noise \u2014 to break up the crowd. D.C. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said officers arrested 217 people in connection with protests that turned violent and caused \u201csignificant damage to a number of blocks in our city.\u201d He said the department is investigating whether officers handling the protests deployed either flash-bang or percussion grenades \u2014 used to disorient people in crowds \u2014 and he said that protesters had their own. Numerous Washington Post reporters saw officers use such grenades. Newsham said a \u201ca very small percentage\u201d of the thousands who came to demonstrate the inauguration resorted to violence. Police said those arrested were charged with rioting. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it had to happen,\u201d Newsham said, praising how officers responded. \u201cWe knew this was going to be a long day . . . Anyone who thinks they can come here and break the law, we will take them into custody.\u201d A man is pepper sprayed at the corner of 12th and I St. N.W. in Washington D.C. on Jan. 20, 2017, as police responded to a vandalizing group of protesters. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) Protesters chant, \u201cNot my president!\u201d at the entrance to a security checkpoint before the inauguration ceremony. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) At least one bystander, a middle-aged man, was injured when the grenades went off; he was hit in the head, which was cut and bleeding. Another man, Robert Hrifko, 62, who rode his Harley Davidson motorcycle up from St. Augustine, Fla., to join the Bikers for Trump group, approached several firemen and asked: \u201cDo you think I need stitches?\u201d A welt on his cheekbone dribbled blood. He said a man hit him with rock after he tackled a protester who was attempting to throw an aluminum chair at a police officer. \u201cBam \u2014 just waylaid me,\u201d he said. The firemen offered him a Band-Aid and said he would be all right. \u201cGood, I ain\u2019t got insurance anymore, because I can\u2019t afford Obamacare.\u201d Mayor Muriel E. Bowser tweeted that she respects the rights of protesters but \u201cwill not condone crime and vandalism which are the antithesis of what we hope to accomplish today.\u201d She also wrote: \u201cTo those of you visiting Washington, D.C. we welcome you but we cannot allow you to destroy our neighborhoods.\u201d Protesters jammed city streets and also aimed to jam checkpoints to the inauguration, at times successfully. \u201cShut it down!\u201d protesters shouted at the checkpoint at John Marshall Park early Friday morning. There, five black men stood at the front of the crowd, chained together, blocking the path. Hailing from different parts of the country, the men were protesting on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. As they stood together, they shouted that by demonstrating, \u201call we have to lose is our chains.\u201d Police began redirecting people to other entrances at about 8:30 a.m. As protesters there shouted, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d a Trump supporter countered. He pointed to the other side of the fence and said, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like, but I can\u2019t get to it because of you!\u201d Michael Henning came from Dalton, Ohio, to see the events on the Mall and expressed frustration with how police handled the situation. \u201cWe drove 20 hours, and now we can\u2019t get in,\u201d Henning said. \u201cEveryone should have just brought guns and had it out, I\u2019d be happy if they just dropped a bomb on them.\u201d Protesters march down K Street on Inauguration Day. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) One protester was arrested after sprinting up 13th Street and taunting a small group of officers chasing him. As he passed a D.C. fire station, cheers could be heard behind the glass of the garage doors: \u201cGet him! Get him!\u201d When a young man in a hoodie \u2014 apparently an undercover police officer \u2014 bolted from the side and brought the protester down on the sidewalk with a flying tackle, a cheer arose from inside the station. \u201cI\u2019m not resisting, I\u2019m not resisting,\u201d the protester said from beneath a pile of three officers. \u201cHow are you all doing today?\u201d he said, just before being helped to his feet, his hand in restraints. It is unclear how many protesters descended on the nation\u2019s capital for the inauguration, but law enforcement officials were bracing for more than 60 demonstration groups, both in support of and against Trump. About two dozen groups have received permits for specific gathering spaces for Friday and Saturday, when the Women\u2019s March will take over the streets. According to their permit requests, some of those groups Friday were anticipating as few as 20 participants; others were planning for tens of thousands. (Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post) In the days leading up to the inauguration, protests started with one group shutting down K Street in downtown Washington and gay rights advocates holding a dance party near the temporary home of Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Chevy Chase, complete with biodegradable glitter and the hashtags #WeAreQueer #WeAreHere #WeWillDance. Thursday night, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the National Press Club in downtown Washington, where the \u201cDeploraBall\u201d was being held. They shouted obscenities and insults such as \u201cracist\u201d and Nazi\u201d at those attending the celebratory ball on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration, and at one point someone threw an object that hit a counter protester in the head. Officers directed chemical spray at the crowd multiple times after protesters began throwing trash at Trump supporters who were leaving the building. Many protesters participated in nonviolent demonstrations Friday. One man brought three llamas named Shay, Tragically Cute, and Thaddeus from a farm in Lancaster, Pa. Other groups protested silently, letting their signs speak for them. \u201cI just wanted my voice to be heard,\u201d said Sharae Cloak, who stood quietly with two friends. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in America, in the world. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those people who complains and sits at home.\u201d But at least one organization had vowed to try to shut down the city. Organized under activist collective Disrupt J20, that group arranged to have different organizations gather at each of the dozen checkpoints that inauguration ticket holders had to pass through to view the ceremony. Each aimed to speak to a different cause, organized under names that include: Future is Feminist, Movement for Black Lives, Standing Rock for Native Lives, Economic Justice and Communities under Attack. At one checkpoint, a group of LBGT protesters held a banner that read: \u201cOut of the Closet. Into the Streets\u201d and danced along to Abba and Madonna. They blew whistles and horns and filled the wet pavement with blue and purple glitter. \u201cWe are here as a celebration of all the rights we have achieved as a movement and to stand up for ourselves,\u201d said Mike Mcvicker-Weaver, 40, an HIV health care worker from Baltimore. At a checkpoint near 10th and E streets, a group of women early in the morning tied themselves together with purple yarn and sat down, blocking people from passing. \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho! Donald Trump has to go!\u201d the group of about 100 mostly young protesters said. \u201cEnd white supremacy!\u201d Clashes broke out at the location throughout the morning, and the line appeared at a standstill less than an hour before Trump was expected to take the oath of office. Police corral a group of protesters at the intersection of L and 15th Streets N.W. on Inauguration Day. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Disrupt J20 describes its plans online as \u201ca series of massive direct actions that will shut down the Inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations \u2014 the Inaugural parade, the Inaugural balls, you name it. We\u2019re also planning to paralyze the city itself, using blockades and marches to stop traffic and even public transit.\u201d Not all of the demonstrations on Friday were anti-Trump. Among those groups that requested permits for space were two organizations that support him: Bikers for Trump and Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump. The latter shared Dupont Circle with a group that did not request a permit but set up there early Friday \u2014 DCMJ, which was formerly known as the D.C. Cannabis Campaign and was behind the successful effort to legalize marijuana in the District in 2015. The group, which started rolling joints this month, plans to hand out 4,200 before marching to the Mall. Once there, those who get through the security checkpoints \u2014 a problem because it is illegal to possess marijuana on federal land, which includes the Mall \u2014 plan to light up four minutes and 20 seconds into Trump\u2019s speech. A 40-year-old pot grower named Josh stood near Dupont Circle Friday morning, controlling the line, which stretched up Massachusetts Avenue. He said he had donated a half-pound of his own weed for the giveaway. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you don\u2019t do any illegal here,\u201d Josh told the crowd. \u201cIf you want to do something illegal, take it down the block.\u201d Nikolas Schiller, co-founder of DCMJ, said the demonstration is not a protest of Trump but a signal of wanting to work with him on fully legalizing cannabis in all 50 states and the District. \u201cThis is about demonstrating to Trump that he has the power to change the law and do what Obama was not able to do,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cWe believe cannabis legalization will create jobs, it will increase tax revenue, and it will also help fix the broken criminal justice\u201d system. As for the bikers they will be sharing space with Friday, he said, \u201cWe hope some come on over and get a free joint.\u201d Another organization, the ANSWER Coalition, planned to host a large gathering at the U.S. Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue. Ben Becker of ANSWER said that more than 45,000 people indicated through social media an interest in joining the group\u2019s protest near the U.S. Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue. The group, which stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, had a 28-foot stage and large sound system set up there and plans to showcase speakers and performers throughout the morning and afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re considering it the counterinauguration,\u201d Becker, 33, said. \u201cThe main message is that there is going to be a grass-roots movement of resistance to the Trump agenda from Day One of his presidency.\u201d The group had thousands of signs ready to hand out. Among them: \u201cSay no to racism,\u201d \u201cStop the Trump Agenda\u201d and \u201cInaugurate the Resistance.\u201d Becker said his hope for the day, regardless of how many people show up, is that they leave feeling confident in their ability to stand up, fight back and organize. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-day event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it Day One of a larger resistance movement.\u201d Tara Bahrampour, Michael Alison Chandler, Steve Hendrix, Arelis R.

Tribune news services Contact Reporter Pledging emphatically to empower America's \"forgotten men and women,\" Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States Friday, taking command of a riven nation facing an unpredictable era under his assertive but untested leadership. Under cloudy, threatening skies at the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, Trump painted a bleak picture of the America he now leads, declaring as he had throughout the election campaign that it is beset by crime, poverty and a lack of bold action. The billionaire businessman and reality television star \u2014 the first president to have never held political office or high military rank \u2014 promised to stir a \"new national pride\" and protect America from the \"ravages\" of countries he says have stolen U.S. jobs. \"This American carnage stops right here,\" Trump declared. In a warning to the world, he said, \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America first.\" The crowd that spread out before him on the National Mall was notably smaller than at past inaugurals, reflecting both the divisiveness of last year's campaign and the unpopularity of the incoming president compared to modern predecessors. Caption Sights and sounds from the inauguration of President Trump Supporters watch the inauguration of President Donald Trump while protesters rally Jan. 20, 2017, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Caption President Trump's Inauguration Speech President Donald Trump delivers his inauguration speech after being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. (Jan. 20, 2017)\u00a0 President Donald Trump delivers his inauguration speech after being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. (Jan. 20, 2017)\u00a0 Demonstrations unfolded at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through. After the swearing-in, more protesters registered their rage in the streets of Washington. Police in riot gear deployed pepper spray and made numerous arrests after protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses, denouncing capitalism and the new president. At least one vehicle was set afire. Short and pointed, Trump's 16-minute address in the heart of Washington was a blistering rebuke of many who listened from privileged seats only feet away. Surrounded by men and women who have long filled the government's corridors of power, the new president said that for too long, \"a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\" His predecessor, President Barack Obama, sat stoically as Trump pledged to push the country in a dramatically different direction.

Assistant Deputy Fire Commissioner John McNicholas speaks to the media following an emergency call. (WGN-TV / Chicago Tribune) Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Six Chicago police officers have been given suspensions for giving favorable treatment to a high-ranking Chicago Fire Department official who was allegedly driving drunk when he crashed his city-issued vehicle off North Lake Shore Drive last April, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. The officers, including three supervisors, were suspended by police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for \"improper processing and reporting procedures\" for mishandling the crash involving then-Deputy Fire Commissioner John McNicholas, the source said. Word of the suspensions come about a week after the U.S. Justice Department issued a scathing report that criticized Chicago police for, among other things, of failing to hold officers accountable for wrongdoing. The suspensions for the six officers ranged from five to 20 days without pay, but four of the officers are appealing their suspensions. The crash took place a little before 1 a.m. on April 20 on LaSalle Street just west of Lake Shore Drive while McNicholas was off-duty. McNicholas had a blood-alcohol content of 0.154 percent -- nearly twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent, according to city records obtained by the Tribune under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. But internal investigators with the Fire Department didn't conduct the Breathalyzer test until 4:32 a.m., more than three hours after the crash, the records show. Initially, police only issued a traffic ticket to McNicholas for failing to reduce speed. But in June, he was ticketed for driving under the influence of alcohol after the Cook County state's attorney's office declined to charge McNicholas with a felony. ",
