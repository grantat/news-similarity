Guy Juneau\u00a0of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s\u00a0Security Services division.\u00a0 It could have been a New Year\u2019s Eve prank, Juneau said, or the work of \u201ca thrill seeker.\u201d\u00a0 The surveillance footage\u00a0showed a man dressed in\u00a0black, tactical-style gear.\u00a0One of the tarpaulins was decorated with a peace sign, and another with a heart. \u00a0 Because the sign was not damaged, the incident will be investigated as misdemeanor trespassing.\u00a0The police have no suspects. Some Angelenos joked that the alteration reflected California\u2019s recent vote to legalize recreational marijuana .\u00a0 The New Year\u2019s Day change is\u00a0far from the first time the Hollywood sign has been edited by artists and pranksters. The sign, erected\u00a0in 1923 as an advertisement for a housing development, originally read \u201cHollywoodland.\u201d A 1929 publicity photo for the Hollywoodland groundbreaking shows a plow, mules and surveyors. (Bruce Torrence Collection / Hollywood Sign Trust) Mother Nature became the sign\u2019s first editor, knocking out the H in a violent storm in 1949.\u00a0The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce restored the letter, but removed the \u201cland\u201d the same year. On New Year\u2019s Day of 1976, the sign\u00a0became\u00a0\u201cHOLLYWeeD\u201d for the first time \u2014 the work of Cal State Northridge student Daniel Finegood, who scaled Mount Lee with $50 worth of curtains. The modification was his project for an art class assignment on working with scale. He earned an A . The Hollywood sign's first iternation as \"Hollyweed\" was 41 years ago, on New Year's Day 1976, when an art student scaled the peak for a class project. (Los Angeles Times) The first iteration of \u201cHollyweed\u201d was also the first day that California classified possession of up to one ounce of\u00a0marijuana as a misdemeanor, rather than a felony. In 1983, the sign was draped with the words \u201cGo Navy\u201d before the annual Army-Navy game. Later that decade, Caltech students edited the sign to spell out the name of their school. (Axel Koester / Los Angeles Times) In\u00a01987, the sign became \u201c Holywood \u201d to mark a visit by Pope John Paul II . But the prank was undone before the pontiff arrived in Los Angeles.\u00a0 In the decade that followed, edits to the sign got political at least twice. The first time was\u00a0 in 1990 , when Finegood scaled the peak again and changed the sign to read\u00a0\u201cOil War,\u201d to protest the Persian Gulf War. Five days before the 1992 presidential elections, supporters of independent candidate Ross Perot draped sheets across the landmark to spell out \u201c Perotwood .\u201d Tired of the unsanctioned changes, city officials eventually enhanced security with a fence, alarms and a surveillance system that captured Saturday\u2019s prankster. Most recently, in 2010,\u00a0the Trust for Public Land modified the sign to read \u201c Save The Peak .\u201d (As the banners went up, Angelenos\u00a0snapped photos that read\u00a0\u201cSallywood\u201d and \u201cSave the Pood.\u201d) That edit publicized a fundraising effort to purchase Cahuenga Peak, the 138-acre parcel just to the west of the sign, following reports that the land\u2019s owners had been planning to build luxury housing there.\u00a0 A helicopter flies over the iconic 450-foot-long Hollywood sign after activists covered it with banners during an effort to prevent the building of houses on the nearby Cahuenga Peak. (David McNew / Getty Images) UPDATES: 11:15 a.m.:\u00a0This story has been updated throughout, including more details on Saturday\u2019s modification and other times the sign has been \u201cedited\u201d by artists and pranksters. 9:05 a.m.: This article has been updated with more tweets.

    "text": "In God's Name Crisis in Chicago Bill Whitaker reports on Chicago's surge in murders and discovers an alarming situation that may be contributing to the rise in violence 2017 Jan 01 Facebook Comments The following script is from \u201cCrisis in Chicago,\u201d which aired on Jan. 1, 2017. Bill Whitaker is the correspondent. Andrew Bast, Guy Campanile and Michael Radutzky, producers. The number of casualties in Chicago since last New Year\u2019s Day has surged to a level more in line with a war zone than one of America\u2019s great cities. More than 700 people were murdered. Over 4,000 shot. That\u2019s more than Los Angeles and New York combined.\u00a0 Gangs, guns and drugs have caused chaos in Chicago for years. But something new caught our attention. There\u2019s been a drop in the kind of police work that law enforcement says is critical to preventing crime. Usually stops and arrests go up when violence is rising. So we went to Chicago to look for an explanation. What we found was a police department on its heels as the city suffered its worst bloodshed in 18 years. People march to protest gun violence in Chicago, Illinois. CBS News In the six days we were in Chicago, 55 people were shot, 16 were killed. We were struck by just how routine it all felt. The dead and wounded were removed with grim efficiency -- right down to the HAZMAT crews that cleaned away the blood. Murder seemed almost normal. Michael Pfleger: And now we are the poster boy of violence in America. Michael Pfleger is pastor of St. Sabina Church on Chicago\u2019s South Side. His congregation started summer weekends by praying for a low body count. Father Michael Pfleger CBS News Michael Pfleger: I had three families-- three different families call in one day asking to do the funeral of their child that was killed in the last week. I\u2019ve never had that in 41 years here. Three families in one day. Fifty-nine gangs are at war over territory and drugs on Chicago\u2019s West and South Sides. But the makeshift memorials we saw, also mark places where people were killed in gang initiations or over petty insults. This gang member was taunting a rival on his phone live on the Internet when he was shot. Watch and you\u2019ll see the gunman. Bill Whitaker: What\u2019s it like here on a typical Saturday night these days? Michael Pfleger: I\u2019ve never seen there to be a combination of anger, distrust, and a feeling like communities have been abandoned. [Chicago protest: Peace in the streets.] Michael Pfleger: Shame on us that our children are afraid to go out of their house of being shot and killed. When is the tipping point, do we all say, enough? But we were astonished by data we obtained from inside the police department. It revealed that as killings rose, police activity fell. In August of 2015, cops stopped and questioned 49,257 people. A year later those stops dropped to 8,859, down 80 percent. At the same time arrests were off by a third, from just over 10,000 to 6,900. Bill Whitaker: You talk to cops every day. Brian Warner: We do. Bill Whitaker: What\u2019s the morale? Brian Warner: Lowest it\u2019s ever been. Brian Warner is a former Chicago cop. He was shot in 2011. Now Warner counsels officers suffering from extreme stress. He explained what a dozen beat cops told us off-camera: they had stepped back. Brian Warner: You have a 911 call, you go to your 911 call. But if you\u2019re one-- aggressive patrol when you\u2019re out looking for people breaking the law. That\u2019s not happening as much as it was. Bill Whitaker: You say they\u2019re not being as proactive? Brian Warner: No. They\u2019re not. And how could you ask them to be? And why would you expect them to be? Bill Whitaker: Because it\u2019s their job. They signed on to do that. Brian Warner: It\u2019s my job to go to work and listen to your 911 calls and respond. That\u2019s the basic ability of my job. So if you want me to do the basics that\u2019s what I am doing now. Garry McCarthy: The police activity is horrific. Honestly. And there, and there\u2019s not an excuse that could be made in my book. Garry McCarthy, Chicago\u2019s former police superintendent CBS News We showed the stop and arrest data that we got to Garry McCarthy. He was superintendent of the Chicago Police Department until just a year ago. Garry McCarthy: When you have activity falling off the way it is and crime skyrocketing, that\u2019s a huge problem. Bill Whitaker: Some people, looking at the Chicago Police Department have said it\u2019s in crisis. Garry McCarthy: Crisis is a good word. When people are dying, yes, there\u2019s crisis. No two ways about it. This crisis inside the police department began in 2014 with the shooting of Laquan McDonald. He was 17 years old. Police reported McDonald was breaking into vehicles and ignored their commands when they said he lunged at one of them with a knife. But dashboard video appears to show McDonald was moving away when he was shot 16 times by a white officer. Bill Whitaker: When did you first see the video? Garry McCarthy: I saw the video, I believe it was the day after. Bill Whitaker: What did you think? Garry McCarthy: I said that there\u2019s a problem. And the officer\u2019s going to be accountable for explaining his actions. Garry McCarthy immediately gave the case to the independent city agency that reviews shootings. \u00a0But City Hall refused to make the video public, even after it paid McDonald\u2019s family a $5 million settlement. When a judge finally ordered the video released a year later, it sparked outrage. Protesters accused the city of a cover-up to protect Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s reelection. The mayor denied it, but promised sweeping changes. His first move was to fire Garry McCarthy. Bill Whitaker: Do you think you were made a scapegoat? Garry McCarthy: I don\u2019t think it helped the situation, and I think it\u2019s a contributory factor to where are today in Chicago. And if you want to call it scapegoat, that\u2019s fine. The cop who killed Laquan McDonald is awaiting trial for murder and the U.S. Justice department is investigating the Chicago PD. We wanted to talk to Mayor Emanuel, but he declined. Within six weeks of the shooting scandal, investigative stops fell by nearly 35,000. That\u2019s when the violence began to surge. Bill Whitaker: How can a police officer who has taken a vow to protect and serve defend stepping back from taking proactive action. How can you not-- Garry McCarthy: Officers are under attack. That\u2019s how they feel, right. That\u2019s how they feel in this environment, and they\u2019re not going to put themselves and their families in jeopardy. Frustration among cops deepened with a new order to be more selective about who they stopped, and write a two-page detailed report for every one. It was the result of a threat by the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the department for racial profiling. Bill Whitaker: It doesn\u2019t seem that filling out a two page report is that onerous. Garry McCarthy: Oh, sure it is. Bill Whitaker: It is? Garry McCarthy: It could take you up to 45 minutes and one of the things in policing that we\u2019ve been trying to do is knock back the amount of time that officers spend doing paperwork and get them out doing more proactive things to prevent crime. There are reasons for the scrutiny. Since 2004, the city has paid out more than a half-billion dollars in settlements for police misconduct. A task force appointed by the mayor found evidence of racial bias, and reported that nearly 90 percent of police shootings involved minorities. Richard Wooten: The Chicago Police is not racist, but I do know and do believe that there are racist police officers in the Chicago Police Department. Richard Wooten broke ranks and talked to the mayor\u2019s task force about what he saw during his 23 years as a Chicago cop. Richard Wooten: They put me in this car with this guy, and my first couple of stops, I saw this guy stop a black guy. You know, several black guys on the street and they literally almost got strip searched right in the middle of the street. And I\u2019m looking like \u201cWow.\u201d Is this the way things are supposed to be done? Bill Whitaker: You were called a traitor for speaking out? Richard Wooten: Oh yes. At my retirement party when I got up to speak, a group of white boys in the back, they booed me, called me traitor, snitch. Bill Whitaker: Was the booing the extent of it? Richard Wooten: No. I went into the restroom, and I was confronted by a couple of the guys in the restroom about, you know, my position and how could I do that after 20-some years of service? But then as I\u2019m looking into the urinal I see my picture that they\u2019ve torn out of the program is in each urinal. Bill Whitaker: They put your picture in the urinals? Richard Wooten: My picture in the urinals. But I wasn\u2019t angry Bill. Bill Whitaker: You weren\u2019t angry? Richard Wooten: I was not angry. Because that just told me how dysfunctional we have of officers we have on the police department. The turmoil was not lost on gang members who record their attempts to lure officers into a confrontation. [Say \u201chi\u201d! No questions, gentlemen.] This video was posted online by someone claiming to be connected to the Simon City Royals street gang. The impact was evident during this October arrest. Officer Veronica Murillo says it was the fear of becoming the next viral video that kept her from pulling her gun as she struggled with this suspect. He knocked her down and bashed her head into the pavement. She suffered neurological damage that has endangered her career. Garry McCarthy: The noncompliance of the law is becoming legitimized. And the police are on their heels. They\u2019re on their heels for a number of reasons. Bill Whitaker: How dangerous is that? Garry McCarthy: We see the results, don\u2019t we? We\u2019re reaching a state of lawlessness. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Dozens of innocent people have paid the price. Flora White: I pray every night and every day that that no hurt, harm, or danger will come to my children. Flora White\u2019s son, Jonathan Mills Flora White\u2019s prayers went unanswered. She showed us the parking lot where her 26-year-old son, Jonathan, was murdered in July. He played basketball in college and in Europe. Flora White: He wasn\u2019t out here selling drugs. He wasn\u2019t out here gang banging. He wasn\u2019t doing any of that. Bill Whitaker: And yet he ended up dead. Flora White: Exactly. Jonathan was on his way to practice when he stopped to talk to friends. Investigators say he was shot by a gang member who was angry they were on his turf. Bill Whitaker: By our count there have been about a dozen shootings just this August just in the area surrounding the spot where Jonathan was killed. Flora White: Uh-huh. Bill Whitaker: Yet at the same time, stops by police in the neighborhood have dropped by almost 80 percent. What do you think about that? Flora White: What do I think about that? I think it\u2019s a joke of accountability in politics. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson, right, and 60 Minutes\u2019 Bill Whitaker \u00a0at a crime scene in Chicago, Illinois. CBS News We went looking for accountability from Chicago\u2019s new police superintendent, Eddie Johnson. He worked his way up over a 28-year career. Eddie Johnson: If I found someone that was intentionally not doing his job, then I would discipline him. This is a tough job. It\u2019s a dangerous job. But it\u2019s also a noble job. Johnson insisted the main reasons for the drop in police activity were stricter standards for stops and the forms triggered by the ACLU. But he admitted his cops have become more careful. Eddie Johnson: They are cautious about doing their jobs. Bill Whitaker: You are calling it caution. They\u2019re telling us it\u2019s backing down. Eddie Johnson: You know I still go out in the field and I talk to officers too. And they take offense to people referring to them as backing down or not doing their job. Bill Whitaker: The one number that I think is not in dispute is the homicide rate has gone-- not just the rate, the-- Eddie Johnson: Skyrocketed. Bill Whitaker: --number of homicides have skyrocketed. So the number of stops and arrests are going down dramatically. And the number of people being shot and killed are going up dramatically. There\u2019s got to be a correlation. Eddie Johnson: Well, you know, there may be some, you know? But again I-- I\u2019d have to go back to it\u2019s not what the police officers are not doing. It\u2019s more about what these-- what the criminal if-- offenders are doing. Bill Whitaker: But don\u2019t the police pay a role? Eddie Johnson: Yeah we play a role in terms of mitigating it. Bill Whitaker: But it\u2019s not being mitigated. Eddie Johnson: Nah, I wouldn\u2019t say that. What we can\u2019t measure is the crime that we stop. Johnson is hiring and promoting a thousand cops in an attempt to get a handle on the violence. But it\u2019ll take a year under his plan to get reinforcements to where Flora White lost her son Jonathan. Flora White: What good is it gonna do? Bill Whitaker: You don\u2019t think more police on the street will make a difference? Flora White: I\u2019m gonna hire more people to do a job that\u2019s not being done? What sense do that make? \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Recent Segments ",

He died Saturday in California at the age of 84. Red Mclendon/AP William Christopher, an actor best known for his role as Father Mulcahy on the sitcom M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 84. Christopher's agent, Robert Malcolm, told The Associated Press he died early Saturday morning at home in Pasadena, Calif., after a battle with lung cancer. Christopher also had recurring roles on shows like Gomer Pyle: USMC and Hogan's Heroes. But it was his performance as Mulcahy that would come to be his signature role. M*A*S*H, which was based on a hit 1970 movie of the same name, debuted in 1972 and ran for 11 seasons \u2014 all of which featured Christopher. As the U.S. Army chaplain at a mobile surgical hospital, Christopher's Father Mulcahy was the moral compass of the show. After M*A*S*H, Christopher had a number of cameos on popular shows, like The Love Boat and Good Times. Christopher and his wife, Barbara, adopted two sons, one of whom had autism. They co-authored a book together called Mixed Blessings about the joys and struggles of parenting an autistic child. Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "Manhunt Underway After Shooting Attack at Istanbul Nightclub Kills 39 By Michael Edison Hayden Jan 1, 2017, 4:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Dozens Killed in Attack on Istanbul Nightclub 0 Shares Email A manhunt is underway in Turkey after a gunman went on a rampage in a crowded Istanbul nightclub during New Year's Eve celebrations early Sunday morning, killed at least 39 people and injured at least 69 more, according to Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The popular Reina club had attracted a diverse crowd of between 400 and 500 patrons from foreign countries as well as Turkey to ring in the new year before the attack by an apparently lone shooter at around 1:15 a.m, authorities said. Turkish police said one gunman perpetrated the violence. Later, they released on social media photos of men whom they said were the Istanbul nightclub \"attackers,\" images which they said were of the men going through a passport check-in as they entered Turkey. The gunman armed with what authorities described as a long-barreled weapon killed a policeman and a civilian outside of the club before \"[raining] bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people\" inside the club, according to Visip Sahin, the governor of Istanbul. The Associated Press Ambulances rushing away from the scene of an attack in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Private NTV television said more than one assailant may have been involved in the attack. Twenty-four of the 39 killed were foreign nationals, according to Turkey's state-run news agency. Authorities said the foreign victims hailed from Belgium, France, India, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. Sources told ABC News that one American was among the nearly 70 people injured. The U.S. is not aware of any Americans dying in the attack, the U.S. State Department said early Sunday. Of the 69 people who were injured, four were hospitalized in serious condition, according to Soylu, who described the attack as \"inhuman.\" \"This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery,\" Soylu said. At a press conference Sunday, Soylu said the assailant arrived wearing a jacket and pants, and is believed to have left wearing different clothing. The Associated Press People leave as medics and security officials work at the scene after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement Sunday, \"I vehemently condemn the terror attack ... Turkey continues its combat against terror and is absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary in the region to ensure its citizens' safety and peace.\" The Associated Press Medics and security officials work at the scene after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. The U.S. issued a statement offering assistance to Turkish authorities. \"The president was briefed by his National Security Team on the attack in Istanbul,\" President Obama's principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said in a statement. \"The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted.\" The Associated Press Medics carry a wounded person at the scene after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Mark Toner, America's State Department 's deputy spokesman said in a statement, \"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey ... We will remain in close touch with Turkish authorities throughout the investigation ... We stand in solidarity with our NATO Ally Turkey in combating the ongoing threat of terrorism .\" Russian President Vladimir Putin , whose complex relationship with Turkey was further complicated in December after a Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead today by a lone gunman fired at him at a photo exhibition in Ankara, Turkey's capital in a widely-seen, on-camera attack, sent Erdogan a telegram of condolences, according to the Kremlin, writing, \"It is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations. However, terrorists don't share moral values. Our common duty is to combat terrorists' aggression,\" Putin said. The Associated Press Young people leave from the scene of an attack in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Turkey has suffered numerous terrorist attacks in recent years, including bombings. Among the incidents in the country were a suicide attack at a wedding this August and coordinated shootings and bombings of Istanbul's major international airport in June, attacks that killed scores of civilians.

Getty Images/Westend61 hide caption toggle caption Getty Images/Westend61 A new Illinois state law aims to take advantage of the close relationships people often have with beauty professionals, and train stylists to recognize signs of abuse. Getty Images/Westend61 In an effort to take advantage of the intimate relationships between stylists and their clients, a new law in Illinois will require salon professionals to receive training in domestic abuse-prevention as part of their licensing process. The law, which goes into effect Sunday, aims to educate beauty professionals to recognize signs of abuse. But stylists won't be required to report violence, and are protected from any liability. The legislation was introduced by state Rep. Fran Hurley, who told the Chicago Tribune , \"There's an openness, a freeness, a relationship that last years or decades between the client and the cosmetologist. They're in a position to see something that may or may not be right.\" Joan Rowan is a hair stylist who owns two salons \u2014 one on the South Side of Chicago, and the other in Oak Lawn, Ill. She says that for many years now she's been providing training for her own staff about what to do if they think someone is in trouble. Rowan says that clients do sometimes talk to her about what is going on in their lives. \"And sometimes they tell you so much they never come back again, because they're afraid, or they're embarrassed, they don't know what to do.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"I've had women, you know, when you're washing their hair, they have bumps on their head, you know, they 'ran into a door again,' \" Rowan says. \"I've been a hairdresser for 41 years. One in three women have violence in their lives. So yes, I have talked to women.\" The training that the stylists will receive is an hourlong \"awareness and education\" program called Listen. Support. Connect. It was designed by Chicago Says No More , a coalition of domestic violence advocacy groups, in partnership with Cosmetologists Chicago. Kristie Paskvan, the founder of Chicago Says No More, says she knows that an hourlong training isn't going to make anyone an expert. \"We're not asking the salon professionals to intervene. We're just asking them to have the tools in case the clients ask for information,\" she says. \"There's something like 88,000 salon professionals that will be trained in the next two years,\" Paskvan says. \"That's 88,000 more individuals that will be able to have conversations with family and friends and clients, and that raises awareness about domestic violence and sexual assault.\" ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare , that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved \u2014 the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. \u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. \u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201d The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats \u2014 including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, President-elect Trump\u2019s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he\u2019s sworn in,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating middle-class families and the economy.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many business-related, that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. \u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201d In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster . But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him \u2014 want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party\u2019s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. \u201cThis is no time for hubris,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou have to perform.\u201d ",

USA TODAY Sports Gary Kubiak led the Broncos to a Super Bowl 50 win following the 2015 season. (Photo: Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports) Denver Broncos coach Gary Kubiak told his team Sunday he is retiring from coaching. Multiple reports early in the day indicated Kubiak would resign due to his family's concern about his health. He didn't admit it following the Broncos\u2019 24-6 win over the Oakland Raiders, but one of Kubiak\u2019s players confirmed it. \"He said he was stepping down,\" said tight end Virgil Green. \"I was shocked.\" Several other Broncos said there were tears in the locker room when Kubiak informed them of his decision, according to Mike Klis of KUSA-TV in Denver. Von Miller was asked if he was surprised by the decision. \"As a player, you kind of notice some days,\" he said. \"This was a hard season for Kube. This was a tough season with the losses and the injuries and everything. You could just kind of see it wear down on him, and his health is the most important for us. So, I think the decision was a great decision for him, and I'm going to continue to support him no matter what.\" Kubiak, 55, said of his future: \"I'll address that tomorrow. It's about the football team right now, not me.\" However he did say he was feeling emotions on the sideline as the game wound down. \"I've struggled this year,\" Kubiak admitted. He missed Denver's Oct. 13 game at San Diego after suffering from a complex migraine condition. While coaching the Houston Texans, Kubiak collapsed while walking off the field at halftime of a game Nov. 3, 2013. He essentially suffered a mini-stroke. He does seem to feel like he's leaving the Broncos in good shape even though the team's run of AFC West titles is officially over. \"I'm very encouraged with the future of this football team,\" said Kubiak. Kubiak, who spent nine years as John Elway's backup quarterback in Denver as a player, spent 23 years in various coaching positions. He finishes with an 87-77 record in combined head coaching stints with the Broncos and Texans. He led Denver to a Super Bowl 50 win last season. *** Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis PHOTOS: Week 17 NFL action Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "John Fox after Bears' season-ending loss: 'I've never worried about job security' Photos of John Fox, the Bears'\u00a015th head coach. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Bears completed a dismal 3-13 season with a 38-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The team finished the year with a four-game losing streak, the longest skid in the John Fox era. Now, with their third-straight last-place finish in the books, the Bears will begin their heavy lifting, evaluating what changes are needed and just how high up the chain they may go. After Sunday\u2019s loss, Fox addressed reporters. Here are a few quick highlights from that press conference. On losing the final two games by a combined score of 79-31 \u2026 We were minus-10 (in the turnover department). When you give the ball away that many times, the math usually doesn\u2019t work very good. So really in the last three games of the year, we were five, five and four (turnovers) even against Green Bay. And we had a chance to win against Green Bay. Kept it close. But these last two became problematic. On whether he has asked for or received assurance that he would be the Bears coach in 2017 \u2026 You know I really haven\u2019t. I think at the end of the day, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time. I\u2019ve never worried about job security. And I\u2019m not going to start now. On whether he at least had a sense that he\u2019d be back for next season \u2026 The one thing I\u2019ve learned about this league is a lot of different things can happen. But I\u2019m not going to get into all that now. I\u2019m trying to get over this loss.\u00a0 Rich Campbell John Fox made the long, lonely loser's walk from midfield to the visiting locker room Sunday after his team went out with barely a whimper. He disappeared into the tunnel, headed toward questions about his future and the direction of the team. The Bears ' final impotent performance of this awful... John Fox made the long, lonely loser's walk from midfield to the visiting locker room Sunday after his team went out with barely a whimper. He disappeared into the tunnel, headed toward questions about his future and the direction of the team. The Bears ' final impotent performance of this awful... (Rich Campbell) On what he feels has been established this season and in the past two seasons combined \u2026 I think we\u2019ve made a lot of roster changes. And some of them this year were not by design due to injury. I think it\u2019s given us a chance to find out about guys like a Cam Meredith, a Jordan Howard. We\u2019ve got a lot of young guys on our roster that were probably further down the depth chart to begin with. I think we\u2019ve built depth, which we did not have. And you saw that even very early in the preseason, when you line up against playoff teams. That\u2019s a very good indicator. \u2026 So I thought as we probably need to improve the front line (talent-wise) as well as our depth. But that\u2019s something we\u2019ve gotten better at. I feel better about that at this time this year than I did at this time last year. Now we\u2019ll see where it goes. On evaluating the coaching staff going forward \u2026 You evaluate everything. Our whole season. I think from the injuries to turnovers and the lack of (on defense). You just evaluate the whole season. And that includes everybody involved. On whether he has final say on coaching staff decisions \u2026 I\u2019ve never really gotten into all that final say stuff. I think when you have people who look at things logically, you usually come to the same conclusion. Vikings 38, Bears 10: What's next for the Bears after a discouraging season? Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. See more videos On his working relationship with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio \u2026 I think it\u2019s good. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for anybody. I know (losing) isn\u2019t easy for (media). I know it\u2019s not easy for us or our fans. But when you\u2019re going through 3-13, it\u2019s never easy. Regardless of what coach or personalities or whatever you\u2019re referring to, I wouldn\u2019t want to single out one guy. It\u2019s a very competitive game. On whether he has questioned his dedication to this job after a season like this and whether he wants to be back \u2026 When you start something, you want to finish it. I think compared to situations I was in (elsewhere) and chose to leave, this is a job I wanted. I think a lot of this organization. I think a lot of this city. I think a lot of the tradition of this team. I\u2019ve worked in a couple of different organizations that are similar as far as they\u2019ve been around for a long time. But it\u2019s definitely a job I want to finish. dwiederer@chicagotribune.com ",

Turkish anti-riot police officers patrol near the Reina night club, one of Istanbul's most exclusive party spots, early on Sunday after at least one gunmen went on a shooting rampage during New Year's Eve celebrations. (Yasin Akgul / AFP/Getty Images) Associated Press A manhunt is on in Turkey for an assailant who unleashed a salvo of bullets in front of and inside a crowded Istanbul nightclub during New Year's celebrations Sunday, killing at least 39 people before fleeing. Foreigners were among the fatalities, including an 18-year-old Israeli woman, three Indian citizens, a 26-year-old man from Lebanon and a Belgian national, according to the countries' respective foreign ministries and a relative. Close to 70 others were injured in what authorities described as a terrorist attack. Three of the wounded were in critical condition, Turkey's prime minister said. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vehemently condemned \u201cthe terror attack in Istanbul's Ortakoy neighborhood in the first hours of 2017\u201d and offered condolences for those who lost their lives, including \u201cforeign guests.\u201d The attacker, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the popular Reina club at about\u00a01:15 a.m. before entering and firing on people partying inside, Gov. Vasip Sahin said. \u201cUnfortunately, [he]\u00a0rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,\u201d Sahin told reporters. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, and authorities did not name any suspects. The bloodiest attacks that Turkey endured in 2016 were the work of\u00a0 Islamic State or Kurdish militants. Turkey is a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. The country is also facing renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast\u00a0and across the border in Syria and Iraq. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said no\u00a0suspect has been identified and that the gunman remains at large. Soylu, describing the attack as a \u201cmassacre, a truly inhumane savagery,\u201d said three or four of the Turkish victims may have been employees at the nightclub. \u201cOur security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing, he will be caught in a short period of time,\u201d Soylu said. Private NTV news channel said the assailant entered the upscale nightclub, on the shores of the Bosporus, on the European side of the city, dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. Security camera footage obtained by the Associated Press from Haberturk newspaper, shows the male assailant dressed in black and carrying a backpack as he shoots down a police officer outside the Reina nightclub. Footage taken by a different camera shows him inside the venue wearing different clothes and a Santa Claus hat. However, Turkey's prime minister denied that the gunman wore a Santa Claus outfit. \u201cThere is no truth to this. He is an armed terrorist as we know it,\u201d Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters. Yildirim said the attacker left a gun inside the venue and escaped by \u201ctaking advantage of the chaos\u201d that ensued. Some customers reportedly jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack. Mehmet Dag, 22, was passing by the club and saw the suspect shoot at a police officer and a bystander. He said the suspect then targeted security guards, gunning them down and entering the club. \u201cOnce he went in, we don't know what happened. There were gun sounds, and after two minutes the sound of an explosion,\u201d Dag said. Turkish media said the victims include a 22-year-old police officer and a 47-year-old travel agent, both of whom were shot outside the club. The nightclub area remained sealed off Sunday afternoon. Heavily armed police blocked the snowy street in front of the nightclub where the entrance was covered with blue plastic sheeting below a Turkish flag. Police patrolled the Asian side of the Bosporus on the other side of the club. Crime scene investigators were seen inside the club searching through piles of mingled chairs, tables and pieces of clothing left behind during the panic among the guests. And there were emotional scenes in front of a city morgue where those shot dead were brought for identification. Some relatives cried out and fell to the ground as they apparently learned the fate of their loved ones. Citizens of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon and Libya were among those hurt in the attack, according to Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, Turkey's minister of family and social policies. The U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul on Sunday warned American citizens to keep their movements in the city \u201cto an absolute minimum.\u201d A statement reminded U.S. citizens that extremists \u201care continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks in areas where U.S. citizens and expatriates reside or frequent.\u201d The United States also denied reports in Turkish new outlets and on social media that its security agencies knew in advance that the nightclub in Istanbul was at risk of a terror attack. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said in a statement issued Sunday that \u201ccontrary to rumors circulating in social media, the U.S. Government had no information about threats to specific entertainment venues, including the Reina Club.\u201d Major attacks carried out by Islamic State\u00a0or Kurdish militants killed more than 180 people in Istanbul and Ankara alone in 2016. On Dec. 10, a double bomb attack outside a soccer stadium near the Reina nightclub killed 45 people and wounded some 150 others. The attack was claimed by Turkey-based Kurdish militant group, the Kurdish Freedom Falcons. \u201cTurkey continues its combat against terror and is absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary in the region to ensure its citizens safety and peace,\u201d President Erdogan said in a written statement Sunday. Prime Minister Yildirim vowed to keep fighting terrorist organizations, but noted,\u00a0\u201cThe terror that happens here today may happen in another country in the world tomorrow.\u201d The nightclub attack drew quick condemnation from the West and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his Turkish counterpart a telegram of condolence, saying \u201cit is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations.\u201d \u201cHowever, terrorists don't share moral values. Our common duty is to combat terrorists' aggression,\u201d Putin said. The White House condemned what it called a \u201chorrific terrorist attack\u201d and offered U.S. help to Turkey. An estimated 600 people were celebrating inside the club that is often frequented by famous locals, including singers, actors and sports stars. Several shocked revelers were seen fleeing the scene after the attack, and the music fell silent. The prime minister's office issued a media blackout on the events and asked media to refrain from broadcasting and publishing anything that may cause \u201cfear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\u201d Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some disguised as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

    "text": "By Mike DeBonis January 1 at 7:29 PM Follow @mikedebonis President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether critical computer networks can ever be protected from intruders, alarming cybersecurity experts who say his comments could upend more than a decade of national cybersecurity policy and put both government and private data at risk. Asked late Saturday about Russian hacking allegations and his cybersecurity plans, Trump told reporters that \u201cno computer is safe\u201d and that, for intelligence officials, \u201chacking is a very hard thing to prove.\u201d \u201cYou want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier,\u201d he said as he entered a New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. [ Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election ] \u201cI think that computers have complicated lives very greatly,\u201d Trump said earlier last week. He tweets prolifically but says he rarely uses any other communications technology more advanced than the telephone. \u201cThe whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I\u2019m not sure you have the kind of security that you need.\u201d Since President George W. Bush moved to develop a comprehensive national cybersecurity policy after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government has made a top priority of preserving the integrity of the public- and private-sector computer networks that enable modern commerce and society. Trump delivered a campaign address in October that deemed cybersecurity \u201ca major priority for both the government and the private sector\u201d and said that cyberattacks from both state and non-state actors \u201cconstitute one of our most critical national security concerns.\u201d But the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s determination that Russia engaged in a state-sponsored hacking effort aimed at electing Trump has prompted the president-elect to openly question the reliability of that assessment while simultaneously taking aim at the broader notion of cybersecurity. [ FBI in agreement with CIA that Russia aimed to help Trump win White House ] Experts said Sunday that Trump\u2019s comments and his handling of the Russian hacking allegations could embolden foreign hackers and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s ability to respond to them. Michael Sulmeyer, a former Defense Department policy adviser who directs the cybersecurity project for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, referred to one of Trump\u2019s earliest efforts \u2014 during a presidential debate in September \u2014 to cast doubt on allegations of Russian interference on his behalf. \u201cThis is not some issue about a 400-pound hacker in a bedroom who might be mischievous,\u201d Sulmeyer said. \u201cThese are real threats to our country, and the concerning part for me is to see how this issue has become politicized and made partisan.\u201d Although some Republicans have pushed for a sharper response to the Russian hacking \u2014 notably Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) \u2014 many others have joined Trump in playing down the intense coverage and debate. \u201cRussia spying on the U.S. is not news,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a top Trump ally. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do. A lot is being made about something that\u2019s already known. To all the people acting shocked, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re shocked there is gambling going on in a casino.\u201d Transition spokesman Sean Spicer, slated to become White House communications director upon Trump\u2019s inauguration, said Sunday that intelligence officials will brief Trump this week on the election-related hacking. He suggested on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the retaliatory sanctions President Obama imposed against Russia last week \u2014 which included the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence agents \u2014 may not have been justified. \u201cThe question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken?\u201d Spicer said. \u201cMaybe it was, maybe it wasn\u2019t, but you have to think about that.\u201d Spicer compared the Obama administration\u2019s sharp response to the recent Russian hacking with its reaction to last year\u2019s revelation that hackers linked to the Chinese government stole the personal data of millions of federal employees. \u201cNot one thing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there is a question about whether there\u2019s a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response.\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, drew a sharp distinction between the two cases and called on Trump \u201cto stop denigrating the intelligence community.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t just steal data; they weaponized it,\u201d he said of Russia, also on the ABC program. \u201cThey dumped it during an election with the specific intent of influencing the outcomes of that election and sowing discord in the United States. That is not something China has ever done.\u201d Ari Schwartz, who served as the top cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council in 2015, said in an interview that Spicer misjudged the Obama administration\u2019s response to the employee data hack. Private talks with the Chinese government, he said, resulted in a demonstrable decline in state-sponsored hacking. \u201cWe came up with ways of dealing with them and working with them,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cIt proves that the sanctions work. Even the threat of the sanctions have changed Chinese behavior.\u201d Trump\u2019s recent comments, Schwartz said, point to a possible recalibration of cybersecurity policy \u2014 one that could shift the careful balance of innovation and security embraced by both Bush and Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to the world of couriers and letter-writing; we\u2019re going to continue to do things online,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are ways to do it where you can manage risk, and that\u2019s really what the goal should be here \u2014 to get to the point where we can have the efficiencies and the benefits and still be secure.\u201d What remains unclear is to what degree Trump\u2019s views on cybersecurity will remain filtered through the prism of the Russian hacking affair. In his October campaign speech, he pledged to undertake a comprehensive review of national cybersecurity systems, create law enforcement task forces to combat cybercriminals and strengthen the military\u2019s Cyber Command. In a sign that he plans to follow through on those plans, last week he chose Thomas P. Bossert, a Bush administration official who played a central role in cybersecurity planning, as his top White House assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. On the Russian hacking, Trump said Saturday that he knows \u201cthings that other people don\u2019t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to his upcoming intelligence briefings. As long as Trump openly doubts the intelligence community\u2019s ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks, he could find it difficult to identify, fend off and retaliate against cyberattackers. He has publicly compared the intelligence community\u2019s Russian hacking assessment to its erroneous determination that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction \u2014 a comparison Spicer repeated Sunday. Said Sulmeyer: \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to make a full-fledged apology or correction about Russian hacking, okay, but at some point, they\u2019re going to have to come out and explain their understanding of the threat and what they want to do about it. If we see that soon, I think that\u2019s a good sign. If that slips, I think that will be an indicator that they are not prioritizing it and they are leaving the American people at greater risk.\u201d Robert Costa and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Time Relatives and friends mourn at the coffin during the funeral of Ayhan Arik, one of the 39 victims of the gun attack on the Reina, a popular night club in Istanbul on Jan. 1, 2017. (Photo: Sedat Suna, epa) Authorities in Turkey searched Sunday\u00a0for a gunman who opened fire at a packed Istanbul nightclub during New Year's celebrations, killing at least 39 people, most of them foreigners, and injuring 69. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned \u201cthe terror attack in Istanbul\u2019s Ortakoy neighborhood in the first hours of 2017\u201d and offered condolences for those who died, including \u201cforeign guests.\u201d Nearly two-thirds of those killed \u2014\u00a024 victims \u2014\u00a0were from other countries, Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency reported. Many were from the Middle East, including Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, although countries from India to Belgium reported their citizens among the casualties, the Associated Press reported. No word yet on any American victims. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the\u00a0suspect has not been identified and remains at large. He described\u00a0the attack as a \u201cmassacre, a truly inhumane savagery.\u201d \u201cOur security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing, he will be caught in a short period of time,\u201d Soylu said. Turkey nightclub massacre: What we know now More than 500 people were inside the Reina club when the attack began about 1:15 a.m. local time. A\u00a0closed-circuit television recording of the attack showed the assailant wearing\u00a0a Santa Claus hat part of the time, according to the AP, which obtained the recording from the\u00a0Haberturk newspaper. The video\u00a0shows the attacker dressed in black and carrying a backpack as he shoots a police officer outside the club. Earlier news reports said the gunman wore a\u00a0Santa Claus outfit, but Prime Minister Binali Yildirim disputed that Sunday. \u201cHe is an armed terrorist as we know it.\u201d The attacker left a gun inside the club and escaped by \u201ctaking advantage of the chaos\u201d that ensued, Yildrim said. Turkish special force police officers and ambulances are on the nightclub attack scene, Sunday. \u00a0(Photo: Yasin Akgul, AFP/Getty Images) No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which Turkish authorities said was carried out by a lone assailant. This is the fourth major attack in Turkey in the past month, including the Dec. 19 assassination of the Russian\u00a0ambassador to Turkey during a photo exhibition in Ankara. Erdogan said his\u00a0country is \"extremely determined to do whatever it takes\" after recent terror attacks to secure the region. Turkey is a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. The\u00a0bloodiest attacks that Turkey endured in 2016 were the work of the Islamic State or Kurdish militants.

By David Weigel December 31 at 5:33 PM Follow daveweigel The Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington. (Paul Holston/AP) In 2004, the last time that Democrats comprehensively lost a national election, an argument broke out about how the party should reform. John F. Kerry had been just one state \u2014 Ohio \u2014 away from victory. Democrats had lost Senate seats in red states,\u00a0but held their own in the House and in state legislatures. (Republicans netted three seats, but would have lost a net of two seats but for mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas.) Hillary Clinton loomed as the favorite for the party's 2008 presidential nomination, but it was clear to many pundits that the party needed someone else. No, not Barack Obama. Clearly, the party needed a moderate nominee from red America. There were plenty of takers. Then-Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), who had never lost an election, visited early primary states and warned that \u201cmany Americans wonder if [Democrats are] willing to use force to defend the country even under the most compelling of circumstances.\u201d Then-Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) shamed Democrats for not campaigning harder for Southern voters \u2014 at a DNC meeting, where the right people were watching. In a cover story for the New York Times magazine, then-Gov. Mark Warner (D-Va.) suggested he could win moderate Republicans, his implication being that Clinton could not. Clinton, indeed, did not win the 2008 nomination. Sixteen years of speculation about her inevitable presidency ended on Nov. 8. But the hand-wringing of 2005 is just as instructive as the Republicans' hand-wringing of 2013. In recent history, the most confident analysts of our political parties have argued that victory will come through moderation. They have been completely wrong. Barack Obama became the first Democrat since FDR to win two popular vote majorities; Donald Trump became the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win most of the Midwest. In both cases, the winning party did not so much moderate its stances as run against the failure of the incumbent party. That failure was obvious in 2008 \u2014 arguably, as early as mid-2006 \u2014 in George W. Bush's low approval ratings and the collapsing economy. It was tougher for Democrats to see in 2016, as Obama's approval numbers were high and the metrics usually used to gauge the health of the economy, like employment, stock markets, and GDP, were moving the right way. The culture was moving the right way, too. In 2004, Republicans blindsided and embarrassed Democrats on social issues, leading to a panic over how the party had lost religious voters who agreed with them on economics, especially Hispanic and black voters. This year, the Republican nominee badly lost the popular vote, and while he overperformed with nonwhites compared to Obama's opponents, he underperformed the rest of the GOP's nominees going back to 1972. His 46 percent of the vote was the lowest for any winning Republican nominee since the three-way election of 1968. Unlike in 2004, Democrats do not look at the electorate and see a majority of personal rejection. Gay voters don't see a president-elect who wanted to change the Constitution to prevent them from getting married; they see one who ceded the issue and literally waved a rainbow flag . For that reason, the last seven weeks have seen Democrats cement their move to the left. The only debate over the future of the party is happening in the race to run the Democratic National Committee. As we reported this month, that's reopened some divisions over the 2016 primary, but it's actually seen the party consolidate around left-wing positions. [ Echoes of 2016 fight shape race to run the Democratic National Committee ] Outgoing Labor Secretary Tom Perez, whose biggest impediment in the race is being seen as the establishment opponent of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), has not even tried to defend the Obama administration over the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In a tweet today, already being mocked in pro-Ellison circles, Perez brands himself as a Mother Jones-approved \u201cprogressive who gets things done.\u201d It's not enough to be progressive\u2014We need a progressive who gets things done. pic.twitter.com/iVb0pZz0e3 \u2014 Tom Perez (@TomPerez) December 31, 2016 The DNC race is also notable as the first that includes absolutely no straight white men. (Ray Buckley, the one white male candidate so far, is gay.) In 2005, Democrats looked for another Bill Clinton; in 2013, Republicans surmised that their defeat required a literal autopsy, and probably a candidate who could appeal to the \u201crising electorate\u201d of nonwhites. None of that turned out to be necessary. Yet both the 2008 and 2016 elections went to candidates with economic policies that appealed to working class, mostly rural, white voters. In 2008, Democrats discovered that these most of these voters did not actually care if the candidate selling those policies was a black man. From 2004 to 2008, the party's share of the white vote in Wisconsin rose from 47 percent to 54 percent; in Pennsylvania it rose from 45 percent to 48 percent. In 2012, Trump won those states by flipping the white vote, grabbing 56 percent of it in Wisconsin and 53 percent of it in Pennsylvania. The unusually large vote for third-party candidates meant that Hillary Clinton's share of that vote was even lower than Kerry's \u2014 more comparable, actually, to the vote for Walter Mondale in 1984. But the 1984 election did not change the makeup of the major political parties. Millions of voters pulled the lever for Ronald Reagan, then voted Democratic for every lower office, from Senate down to alderman. In 2016, the Democrats lost their last state legislature in what we generally call the South, after a wipeout in Kentucky's House of Representatives. Early in the 2016 cycle, plenty of Democrats worried about this and thought they saw a way to prevent it: by nominating Clinton for president. In early 2015, writing then for Bloomberg, I talked to Democrats from Kentucky and West Virginia, all of whom thought that the losses of the Obama years could be reversed when Obama himself left the political scene. Clinton, said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), \"would be the best hope in the state of West Virginia to return [to Democratic] on a national level.\u201d Clinton went on to win just 26 percent of the vote there, the worst performance for a Democrat in West Virginia's 152 years of electoral college membership. (Yes, even George McClellan ran better against Abraham Lincoln.) The state had fallen off the Democrats' presidential map a decade earlier, and Clinton embraced environmental policies with the knowledge that they'd cost votes, and the calculation that they would win votes elsewhere. And coal country didn't cost Clinton the presidency; had she won Florida and Wisconsin, she'd be writing her inaugural address. Still, the party's expectations about Clinton demonstrated just how bad parties are at analyzing what they need to fix to win. Next year, while it is not what they boast about, Democrats are expecting mistakes by Trump \u2014 the most unpopular incoming president in decades \u2014 to create opportunities for them. Their debate about winning a new majority is not about a savior from red America, or even a change in policy. It is about better organizing, and how to win back voters who were Democrats until the party was branded as neoliberal and pro-trade . There has really never been an election aftermath like this. And there has never been a moment when one party consisted almost entirely of conservative and moderate white voters and one consisted of nonwhites and progressive whites. There will be more certitude about what the parties stand for, and less dreaming for a Democratic savior. politics ",

By Erin Cunningham and Kareem Fahim January 1 at 4:05 PM Follow @erinmcunningham Follow @kfahim ISTANBUL \u2014 Leanne Nasser was a bright-eyed Arab-Israeli teenager, in Istanbul with friends for the New Year, despite her father\u2019s concerns about safety. Fatih Cakmak, who survived a bomb attack only weeks ago, was hired to work security for a popular nightclub. Both were among those who died early Sunday when a gunman, brandishing an assault rifle, stormed Istanbul\u2019s famed Reina Club on the banks of the Bosphorus, gunning down unsuspecting New Year\u2019s revelers in a rampage that was one of the city\u2019s worst mass killings in recent memory. The assailant remained at large Sunday night, and unidentified except for blurred glimpses of him in security camera footage that showed gunshots sparking off the pavement and victims crumpling to the ground. Thirty-nine people were killed, many of them foreigners, in the latest in a string of assaults that have roiled Turkey as it battles insurgents at home and across the border in war-torn Syria. At least 70 people were wounded. Among the victims of Sunday\u2019s attack, in Istanbul's Ortakoy district, were an Iraqi student, a Turkish policeman and two Lebanese fitness trainers. Authorities were working Sunday to identify the dead, and citizens of at least eight countries, including Turkey, were killed in the assault. \u201cPlease answer my comment, and tell me you have not died,\u201d one Facebook user, Sheery Rudan, posted on the profile photo of 22-year-old Mustafa Jalal, an Iraqi student from Kirkuk. The school where he studied, Kemburgaz University, announced his death on Twitter. (Haberturk Gazetesi Yildirim) Hassan Alaa, who was close to Jalal, struggled with the news of his boyhood friend\u2019s death. Jalal, who was an only child, was active, outgoing, and loved cars and swimming, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. We would have breakfast together every day,\u201d Alaa said, when reached in the Iraqi city of Erbil. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s gone. Before he left for the club, he wished me a happy birthday and we were joking around.\u201d The assault, which targeted a posh, sprawling venue popular with Istanbul\u2019s elite, recalled similar attacks on a concert hall in Paris in 2015 and nightclub in Orlando in 2016. And like the previous attacks \u2013 with their disproportianate tally of young victims, all of whom had been enjoying a night out \u2013 the carnage on the Bosphorous left Istanbul reeling from a similar sense of shock and grief. In Paris and Orlando, one or more gunmen used assault rifles to target largely cosmopolitan and international crowds. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks. The jihadist group has carried out attacks in Turkey in recent years, but there was no claim of responsibility for the massacre early Sunday. It began just after 1 a.m., when the assailant shot dead a 22-year-old police officer, Burak Yildiz, and a chaffeur for a tourism company, Ayhan Arik, on the street outside the club, according to Turkish media reports. The sound of gunshots sent panicked patrons scrambling for cover at the waterside as the gunman came inside, witnesses said. One patron, professional soccer player Sefa Boydas, described on Twitter the chaos at the club. In a series of posts that were later deleted, Boydas said he did not see who was shooting, but he noted that police arrived on the scene quickly. He carried his girlfriend, who was wearing high heels, he said, out of the club to safety. \u201cAt first we thought some men were fighting with each other,\u201d a Lebanese woman who gave her name as Hadeel told the Reuters news agency. She was in the club with her husband and a friend. \u201cWe heard the guy screaming Allahu Akbar,\u201d she said, which is Arabic for \u201cGod is great.\u201d \u201cWe heard his footsteps crushing the broken glass,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got out through the kitchen, there was blood everywhere and bodies.\u201d Others did not survive the assault. Mustafa Sezgin Seymen, 32, was at Reina Saturday night with his fiancee, Sezen Arseven. She was wounded; Seymen, a native of the Black Sea city of Trabzon, was killed. \u201cI\u2019m returning without you from the place we went together,\u201d Arseven wrote of Seymen in a public Facebook post on Sunday. \u201cI have lost my spouse, my life partner, my most beloved,\u201d she wrote. Officials on Sunday called the nightclub attack a \u201cmassacre\u201d and an act of terrorism. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack was meant to \u201ctrigger chaos.\u201d We \u201cwill never give passage to these dirty games,\u201d Erdogan said in a statement posted on the presidential website. Sunday\u2019s incident was the fourth major attack in Turkey in less than a month, including the high-profile assassination of the Russian ambassador by a Turkish policeman, and a brazen car bomb assault against riot police at a soccer stadium in Istanbul. That attack, which killed 44 policemen, was claimed by separatist Kurdish militants, who have waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. The attacks have posed a severe challenge to President Erdogan\u2019s government, which has appeared to lurch from crisis to crisis since the authorities put down an attempted coup in July. The state\u2019s resources have been stretched thinas it tries to respond to the cascading calamaties. After the coup, the government launched a withering crackdown on its perceived enemies, arresting thousands of people. At the same time, the government has deepened its involvment in the Syrian war while escalating its confrontation with Kurdish groups. Cakmak, the security guard, was working at the stadium when the car bomb detonated on Dec. 11, Turkish media reported. \u201cThey killed my brother. He died for nothing,\u201d Erhan Cakmak said outside the central morgue in Istanbul Sunday, in a video circulated by the private Dogan news agency. Fatih Cakmak's Facebook profile photo shows him with renowned French soccer player and Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane. In Istanbul Sunday, relatives and friends of one of the Lebanese victims, Haykal Moussalem, a 35-year-old fitness trainer, arrived at the morgue, saying they had not been able to locate him. Lebanon\u2019s consul general in Istanbul later confirmed that Moussalem had been killed, along with at least two other young Lebanese citizens, Elias Wardini and Rita Chami, according to a statement on the site of the country\u2019s national news agency. Pictures on social media showed Moussalem, newly married, on a trip to Italy with his wife, and supervising training sessions in a gym. Another picture that circulated showed Wardini, and Chami, smiling in the sleet on an Istanbul street. In Israel, the father of Leanne Nasser , speaking to local media , said he implored his 19-year-old daughter not to travel to Istanbul because of recent attacks. Israel's foreign ministry said one of her friends, 18-year-old Ruaa Mansour, was injured in the attack. Late Sunday, the French foreign ministry said a Franco-Tunisian woman and her Tunisian husband had been killed in the attack. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its nationals were also confirmed dead. According to Turkey's state-run news agency, Anadolu, nearly two-thirds of the victims were foreigners. The State Department Sunday warned U.S. citizens in Istanbul to limit movements \u201cto an absolute minimum\u201d while the search for the assailant continues. \u201cHe was one of the kindest people I knew. He would never hold a grudge,\u201d Alaa said of Jalal, the Iraqi student. \u201cHe loved his life [in Istanbul],\u201d he said. \u201cHe enjoyed everything in it and wanted to stay for good.\u201d Fahim reported from Cairo.

The two real estate titans have already collaborated on the Trump International Golf Club, where luxury villas have racked up almost $2 billion in sales. Amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest, Trump has promised he won't be making any new business deals while in office. But Sajwani said his ties to the Trumps extend beyond the president-elect \u2014 to daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr. \"All his three children are very much involved, and I think under their leadership we will have no issue in expanding and growing and maintaining our business relation,\" Sajwani said. \"They are very much involved with the details,\" Sajwani said. \"They're very protective of their brand.\" Donald and Ivanka Trump with Dubai developer Hussein Sajwani. Masala.com \"My wife and Ivanka are very good friends,\" he added. \"They send emails. She's been here to my house. We've been in New York having lunch and dinners with them regularly. And, you know, you enjoy working with somebody \u2014 it's not only cold business relation.\" Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. have all represented the brand to wealthy foreigners \u2014 who often have links to powerful politicians \u2014 from Canada and Turkey to South America and Central Asia. Ivanka has posted on social media about business meetings in at least 13 countries since 2010. Sajwani recalled that Ivanka was pregnant when she was working on the project and \"quite involved until almost a few days before delivery.\" He happened to be in New York three days after she gave birth, and he marveled that Ivanka got on the phone to talk business with him and was back in the office a couple of days after that. He said he met then-candidate Trump before the election for the opening of his Washington hotel. Over dinner, he said, it became clear that if Trump won, he would need to hand over the reins of the business to the younger generation. Sajwani was back in the United States after the election and met with Ivanka, who is now exploring a possible move to Washington to be closer to the White House. Play ",

She said he might have been saved by bodies that acted as shields against further shots. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The gunman\u2019s identity and motives remain unclear, but one witness said he had heard the man shout \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic. Even with so much uncertain, the attack on Reina, which is perhaps Istanbul\u2019s most famous nightclub, seemed to symbolize one of Turkish society\u2019s deepest divides, between the secular and the pious \u2014 a fissure that has grown deeper under Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist who has expanded religious schooling and sought to restrict alcohol sales. Some on social media were quick to point out the rhetoric against New Year\u2019s celebrations that had come from Islamist corners of Turkey. A recent Friday sermon prepared by the government\u2019s religious authority said that New Year\u2019s revelry belonged to \u201cother cultures and other worlds.\u201d Another passage of the sermon read, \u201cWe shall not forget that it is never suitable for a believer to forget himself and his aim of creation after a year passes from the stock of life, to exhibit illicit manners and behaviors that don\u2019t comply with our values.\u201d In the aftermath of the attack, Prof. Howard Eissenstat, an expert on Turkey at St. Lawrence University, wrote on Twitter : \u201cDisturbing + not very difficult line to draw between official Turkish anti New Years campaign + tonight\u2019s violence. Rhetoric has consequences.\u201d Video Seeking the Istanbul Nightclub Gunman On Sunday, Turkish officials revealed latest information about the attacker who shot scores of people at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Eve and remains on the loose, and said police were doing everything to find him. embed Emre Eytan Can, 34, an investment banker from Istanbul, said he was a regular at Reina, although he was not there on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cI guess it is a target because it\u2019s full of high-class Turks and foreigners,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a place where people let their hair down and drink, which is not in line with Islam.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Turkey\u2019s troubles had already led to a sharp decline in Western tourists, but visitors from the Middle East, perhaps because they are accustomed to terrorist threats at home, have kept coming. News of the attack quickly reverberated around the region, with citizens of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia among the victims , along with people from Belgium, France and India. By Sunday afternoon, the by-now familiar rituals of grief that follow terrorist attacks were in full swing, with consulate officials and grieving families converging at an Istanbul morgue, where local officials had set up tea stands outside in the bitter cold. A Lebanese woman, Stephanie Deek, was there with her husband to identify a friend from Lebanon, Haykal, a newlywed who had been celebrating the holiday in Istanbul with his wife. The wife was safe, but Haykal, who had jumped into the Bosporus to escape the killer, was dead. \u201cI am so sad,\u201d Ms. Deek said. \u201cI cannot describe how I feel.

    "text": "N. Korea's Leader Hints of Long-Range Missile Test By eric talmadge, associated press TOKYO \u0097 Jan 1, 2017, 4:05 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press South Koreans watch a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's speech, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. North Korea's development of banned long-range missiles is in \"final stages,\" the country's leader Kim was quoted as saying in his New Year's message. The letters read \"New Year for Reunification.\" (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) 0 Shares Email North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hinted Sunday that Pyongyang may ring in the new year with another bang \u2014 the test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. In his annual New Year's address, Kim said that after testing what the North claims was its first hydrogen bomb last year, preparations for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile have \"reached the final stage\" Kim did not explicitly say an ICBM test, which if successful would be a big step forward for the North, was imminent. But he has a birthday coming up on Jan. 8, and last year Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6. Kim threatened in the address to boost his country's military capabilities further unless the U.S. ends war games with rival South Korea. But he also said efforts must be made to defuse the possibility of another Korean war and stressed the importance of building the economy under a five-year plan announced in May. \"The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented as an invincible fortress,\" Kim said, according to an outline of the speech carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. \"We should resolutely smash the enemies' despicable and vicious moves to dampen the pure and ardent desire of the people for the party and estrange the people from it.\" The address was shown on television mixing video with Kim speaking and stretches of audio only, as still photos were broadcast. It was less than 30 minutes long. South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns\" Kim's threat to proceed with a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile and strengthen North Korea's nuclear-strike capabilities. It said that the international community will not tolerate North Korean efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that the North will only face tougher sanctions and pressure if it continues to go down that path. Under Kim, who rose to power following his father's death in 2011, North Korea has seen steady progress in its nuclear and missile programs, including two nuclear tests in 2016. It recently claimed a series of technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States. U.N. resolutions call for an end to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. Kim appears uninterested in complying. The year ahead could be a tumultuous one in north Asia, with Donald Trump set to become the new U.S. president on Jan. 20, and South Korea's politics in disarray over a scandal that brought the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye . Kim indicated there will be no change in the North's nuclear policy unless Washington makes a big, conciliatory first move, which, even with the advent of Trump, would seem unlikely. Trump has somewhat offhandedly suggested he would be willing to meet with Kim \u2014 but not in North Korea \u2014 and has at the same time indicated that he wants China to exert significantly more control over Pyongyang to get it to abandon its nuclear program. Demands from Pyongyang for the U.S. to stop its joint military exercises with the South and enter into negotiations to sign a peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War have fallen on deaf ears in Washington for years amid an atmosphere of distrust and deepening hostility. Kim is in his early 30s and is now in his fifth year as the North's leader. His New Year addresses, and a marathon speech at the May ruling party congress, are a contrast with his enigmatic father, Kim Jong Il, who rarely spoke in public. But he has yet to meet a foreign head of state or travel outside of North Korea since assuming power, and remains one the world's most mysterious national leaders. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "In control of Washington, GOP-run Congress sees mandate -- starting with end to ObamaCare Published               January 01, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The 115th Congress begins Tuesday with a full slate of business, though nothing will be more politically important or pressing for Republicans than repealing ObamaCare.\u00a0 With Donald Trump set to officially become president on Jan. 20, Republican leaders in the House and Senate will begin repeal efforts shortly after Congress\u2019 59 new members -- seven senators and 52 House members -- are sworn in and the formalities are concluded. The GOP, which now controls both Capitol Hill and the White House, has made dismantling the 2010 health care law a priority almost since it was signed by President Obama. Lawmakers will also look at a tax overhaul, reversing Obama-era environmental regulations and other conservative priorities. However, such efforts will have to share center stage with the Senate confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks in the days and months that follow the president-elect\u2019s swearing-in. It should be easier for Republicans to move nominations after Democrats changed the Senate's filibuster rules in 2013. Still, Democrats have pledged to fight many of the nominations, highlighting what they call the hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s populist message and his wealthy, corporate-favoring nominees for several posts. Perhaps the biggest wild card in the new Congress\u2019s early weeks will be what to do about Russia\u2019s involvement in several cyberattacks during this year\u2019s presidential race -- in which Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump has been skeptical about Russia\u2019s involvement, while top GOP Sens. including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Arizona\u2019s John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have called for hearings on the issue and proposed sanctions beyond what President Obama imposed last week. McCain told Fox News on Wednesday that he also wants to permanently station U.S. soldiers in the Baltic Sea countries bordering Russia and increase aid to neighboring Ukraine against Russian aggression -- to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin knows \u201cthis kind of interference will be responded to.\" How GOP leaders and Trump negotiate the issue will likely depend on the outcome of the president-elect\u2019s meeting this week with U.S. intelligence officials. \u00a0 Republicans will face other obstacles from Democrats, beyond the Cabinet conformations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have already made efforts to stop proposed changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid and to ObamaCare. Those efforts include a planned national \u201cDay of Action\u201d on January 15. \u201cBring it on,\u201d Schumer said in November, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to make repealing ObamaCare a first order of business. And Obama is scheduled to visit congressional Democrats on Wednesday to discuss ways to save his signature legislation. Republicans likely won\u2019t be able to replace ObamaCare in its entirety for several years, considering they would need an alternative program for the roughly 22 million Americans who would lose their current health insurance. In addition, Trump and both parties have expressed interest in a large transportation bill to create jobs and to fix the country\u2019s aging infrastructure. But a clear plan has yet to emerge, with the estimated, billion-dollar price tag a likely sticking point among fiscal conservatives on the Hill. The new Senate will have 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two Independents who caucus with the Democrats. The House will have 241 Republicans and 194 Democrats. The Senate plans to begin repealing ObamaCare on Tuesday with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield them from Democratic filibuster legislation annulling much of that statute. Lawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Provisions that are most likely to go are the law's mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, as well as its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. Republicans will then begin the more complicated task of building a new system. The GOP will have to craft new programs for the nation's $3 trillion health care system and make sure insurance markets don't collapse while the transition is under way. McConnell, Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also want a massive tax overhaul, with the goal of simplifying a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants as well as corporations that can easily shift profits and jobs overseas. It would be the first major tax overhaul in 30 years. Trump has also advocated a tax overhaul, but with fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. Waiting in the wings will be confirmation hearings to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died 11 months ago. McConnell blocked consideration of Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, saying the next president should make the pick. The strategy paid off, and the Republican Senate will consider whomever Trump nominates. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Embed Embed Transcript That means hard times for places like Wyoming's mineral-rich Powder River Basin. In 2016 alone, three coal companies there declared bankruptcy , laying off hundreds of miners at once. Still, the community of Gillette, Wyo. \u2014 self-proclaimed as the Energy Capital of the Nation \u2014 is breathing a sigh of relief lately. Production has ticked back up past where it was at this time last year, and some mines are even hiring workers back. \"I do believe that my friends and co-workers are safe for now,\" says coal miner Stacey Moeller. She believes that \"for one more year, we're going to be coal miners.\" And Trump's win has buoyed her hopes, as well as those of investors. The day after the election, coal stock prices leaped and many in coal communities celebrated. Article continues after sponsorship In Ohio Coal Country, Job Prospects Lie With Neither Coal Nor Trump's Promises For Moeller, a single mom and lifelong Democrat, the decision was complicated. \"I did vote for Donald Trump,\" Moeller says. \"It's really hard to even say that because I so dislike his rhetoric. But I voted for him on one singular issue, and that was coal.\" She's not alone. Dave Hathaway of Pennsylvania will be watching Trump, as well. Since the coal mine he worked in closed a year ago, he spent much of 2016 looking for work. The search gained urgency when his son Deacon was born in August. On Election Day, Hathaway made a choice he hopes will help his long-term job prospects. \"I voted for Trump \u2014 I mean, a coal miner would be stupid not to,\" Hathaway says. Advanced Black Lung Cases Surge In Appalachia He says he's had a hard time finding a job to replace the $80,000 he made working in the coal mines under Greene County, Pa., a few miles from the West Virginia border. Hathaway recently found a job at a nearby mine. While he thinks Trump's election means he'll have a better shot at keeping his new job, he didn't like a lot of things Trump said during the campaign. \"He is a whacko; he's never going to stop being a whacko,\" Hathaway says. \"But I mean, the things he did say \u2014 the good stuff \u2014 was good for the coal mining community. But we'll see what happens.\" That message clearly resonated in Greene County, where over the last four years a third of the coal mining jobs \u2014 like Dave Hathaway's \u2014 disappeared. Trump won the county by 40 points, eight years after Barack Obama basically tied John McCain there. Tom Crooks, vice president at R.G. Johnson, a construction firm that builds mine shafts, witnessed the decline of the coal industry firsthand. \"Two years ago this week we had 145 employees,\" Crooks says. \"Right now, we have 22.\" Pennsylvania Coal Miners Hope Trump Will Help Industry Coal Miners Hope Trump Will Help Struggling Industry ",

Fleming proposes at toast following the tapping of the first Dublin Stout Keg at Brazenhead in Dublin, Ohio. A flight-tracking service shows that a plane piloted by the Ohio executive with five other people onboard quickly lost altitude after taking off from Cleveland's lakeshore airport. The parents of Superior Beverage Company executive John T. Fleming confirmed he was piloting the Columbus-bound plane when it vanished late Thursday, Dec. 29, 2016, over Lake Erie. (ThisWeek Newspapers/The Columbus Dispatch via AP) 0 Shares Email Debris washed ashore near an airport where a small plane carrying six people took off shortly before it vanished over Lake Erie near Cleveland, the city said Sunday. Authorities received multiple reports of debris washing ashore east of Burke Lakefront Airport, where a plane carrying a family of four and their two neighbors departed late Thursday. Police also continued to investigate the contents of a bag found earlier Sunday near a private harbor in Bratenahl, a small lakeside community near Cleveland. The debris had not yet been verified as coming from the missing plane, authorities said. \"We want to remind everyone that this is an active investigation,\" Police Chief Calvin Williams said. \"If you see something that could be debris from the plane, we are asking people to avoid touching it, and to call the Division of Police immediately.\" John T. Fleming, chief executive of a Columbus-based beverage distribution company, was piloting the plane. His wife, Sue, their two teenage sons, Jack and Andrew, and two neighbors were also aboard. The aircraft was headed to Ohio State University Airport, northwest of downtown Columbus. The plane suddenly lost altitude about 2 miles out during a scheduled return trip to Columbus, according to a flight-tracking service. Fleming's father has said the family and friends were attending a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. The Coast Guard began searching the air after being notified soon after the plane's disappearance. High waves and blustery conditions prevented smaller Coast Guard boats from the Cleveland area from deploying Thursday night. A 140-foot Coast Guard cutter joined a search that covered 128 square miles of the lake on Friday. Weather and water conditions didn't allow for recovery efforts to begin Saturday, but crews searched for the plane until darkness Sunday and planned to return Monday morning, weather permitting. The Cleveland Division of Fire, the U.S. Coast Guard and Underwater Marine Contractors launched boats, and dive teams are ready to search the lake once the plane is located. The mayor's office says four boats are equipped with sonar that can track underwater images and are searching a grid near the plane's last known location. A fifth boat is surveying the shoreline for debris that may have washed ashore. ",

SLOTNIK and JONATHAN WOLFE JAN. 1, 2017 \u2022 After taking nearly a century to build , the Second Avenue subway extension in Manhattan opened on Sunday \u2014 with excitement and complaints. \u2022 Three new stations opened at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets. \u2022 The route is an extension of the Q line , which now runs from the Upper East Side in Manhattan to Coney Island in Brooklyn. Continue reading the main story Photo The 96th Street station is one of three new stations on the Q line extension. The other two are at 72nd and 86th Streets. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times \u2018I\u2019m Not Driving the Train,\u2019 Cuomo Says Shortly before noon on Sunday, a flood of New Yorkers streamed into the new 96th Street station, swiping their MetroCards and boarding the first Second Avenue subway train leaving the station. As the train pulled out, subway riders clapped and cheered. Then Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s voice came over the loudspeaker, welcoming passengers to the historic ride. Advertisement Sitting on the train with his two sons, Ian Pinto, 50, who lives on the Upper East Side, said they planned to visit all of the stations on Sunday. \u201cIn our lifetime, this is such a great event,\u201d he said. Photo Train enthusiasts of all ages came out for the opening of the Second Avenue line. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times It\u2019s Been a Long Time Coming Joe Caronetti, 68, of the Norwood neighborhood in the Bronx, had been waiting for the train since 10:15 a.m. on Sunday. \u201cNot counting the 68 years prior,\u201d he added. Mr. Caronetti, a retired banker, said it was the sixth time he had been on hand for the opening of a new train, having also gone on inaugural rides in Los Angeles and New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019m just a train buff,\u201d he said, wearing an M.T.A. cap he had gotten on Friday. Another train enthusiast at the station, Marvin Loja Espinoza, 17, a senior at Aviation High School, was waiting to get on the first train leaving there. Originally from Ecuador, he discovered his love for trains when he moved to the United States in 2005. His hometown had no trains, he said. Struggling to make friends in a new place, he spent his lunches in the library studying train maps, he said. His knowledge of the subway lines is so extensive that his friends call him \u201cM.T.A. Savage.\u201d Ian Ma, 15, said that when he was a child, he would run his toy trains back and forth across the floor of the family\u2019s home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sunday, he couldn\u2019t stop grinning as he snapped photographs at the new station at 72nd Street. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a big train guy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for this train my whole life.\u201d Pete Cerwin, 51, has lived at 72nd Street and Second Avenue for 20 years. For him, it has been \u201ctwo decades of false starts, letdowns and construction.\u201d Mr. Cerwin, who works at a hedge fund, and his wife, Michele, 49, a management consultant, have seen favorite restaurants and shops open and close over the years, as the neighborhood struggled with the noise, dirt, detours and traffic that the Second Avenue subway extension brought to the rather unexciting section of the Upper East Side. So the two were relieved to see the escalators and the trains start rolling at the nearby station. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d live to see the day,\u201d Ms. Cerwin said. \u201cOur kids have no excuse to take a cab ever again.\u201d Photo Kitty Benton, center, is the great-granddaughter of William Benton Parsons, the chief engineer of the Interborough Rapid Transit, New York\u2019s first subway. Credit Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times A Link to New York\u2019s First Subway When she descended the escalators at 86th Street on Sunday afternoon, Kitty Benton, 81, dressed in a long dark coat and thickly framed glasses, blended in with hundreds of other subway riders who visited the station on its opening day. But Ms. Benton is subway royalty. In her black tote bag she carried a photo of her great-grandfather, William Benton Parsons, the chief engineer of the Interborough Rapid Transit, New York\u2019s first subway. Ms. Benton, who lives on the Upper East Side, beamed as she strolled through the new station. \u201cMy great-grandfather wanted the subway to be attractive,\u201d said Ms. Benton as she pointed out design elements, like the handrails on the stairs, and the mosaics by Chuck Close. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here.\u201d She surveyed the station with her daughters, Louisa Barclay Benton, 52, Emily Morgan, 54, and her grandsons, Gus Morgan, 14, and Nick Morgan, 12, and chatted about her great-grandfather and his exacting work ethic. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe would be very proud,\u201d she said. A New York Times article from Oct. 27, 1904, described Mr. Parsons as one who would weigh the opinions of those who worked for him, \u201cbut having made up his mind what to do and how it should be done, he is as inflexible as one of his own steel columns.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost teary eyed,\u201d she said, as other riders buzzed with excitement around her. \u201cMy great-grandfather\u2019s vision has been vindicated.\u201d Photo For subway conductors, it was another day at work. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times Preparing for an Opening... M.T.A. workers spent much of their time on Sunday shooing people away from the yellow line at the edge of the subway platform as trains approached and people clamored for a look or a photograph. \u201cI guess they just want a little piece of history,\u201d said Matthew Brace, 50, a platform controller who has worked for the M.T.A. for 28 years. He volunteered to work overtime on Sunday, the second time he had witnessed the opening of a new station. He was also at the opening of the Hudson Yards station on the Far West Side of Manhattan in 2015. Mr. Brace said he planned to retire in four years and seven months. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see another opening in that time,\u201d he said. A big part of the job on an opening day, Mr. Brace said, is managing expectations. \u201cYou have train buffs anxious to get a seat on the first train, to get trinkets from the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re worrying about that and asking those questions. But our main job is getting people on and off the trains safely.\u201d ...And Then the Complaints. It was only a matter of minutes before passengers began to complain on social media about the new Second Avenue line. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Emily Ngo, a politics reporter for Newsday, wrote on Twitter that her Q train was delayed at the 63rd Street station, the last stop before the new extension starts, because of signal trouble. She said riders were amused by the delay. (A train with mechanical problems at a station in Lower Manhattan had caused delays on the Q line in both directions.) I&#39;m on the 2nd Ave subway. It&#39;s stopped at Lex-63 station. Conductor says train is &quot;experiencing some signal problems.&quot; Riders laugh ... \u2014         Emily Ngo (@epngo) Jan. 1, 2017 Others vented that the recorded announcements about upcoming stations were not accurate. Demetrios Costoyiannis, 33, who lives on the Upper East Side, said that despite an erroneous station announcement, his train had reached the right destination. Despite the robot voice insisting otherwise, arrived at 96/2. #SecondAvenueSubway \u2014         Demetrios (@dcostoy) Jan. 1, 2017 The new stations were pristine on Sunday morning, but a rider noted that litter appeared quickly in a car. Ted Berg, 35, a sportswriter who lives on the Upper East Side near the 86th Street stop, wrote on Twitter that \u201cpeople have already strewn garbage about\u201d shortly after service to the new stations started at noon.

Agins/The New York Times A Broken Elevator Dampens Excitement Shortly after 2 p.m., an elevator at the 86th Street station stopped working, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. A small line of people in wheelchairs and baby carriages formed outside of the elevator above ground. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,\u201d said the younger Ms. Tallmer next to her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who was in a wheelchair. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s almost ready for us.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. They left after a few minutes. \u201cIt was a valiant effort,\u201d a stroller-pushing father said. Dave Officer, 39, a business developer who lives on the Upper East Side, had planned to see the subway with his wife and 6-month old daughter. \u201cAnother day,\u201d he said. Let\u2019s Talk About the Bathrooms The new bathrooms on the upper level of the 86th Street station were quickly put to use. Well, bathroom. The women\u2019s restroom was locked, and an M.T.A. employee had to find the key. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The reviews for the men\u2019s restroom, however, were largely positive. \u201cIt smells fresh and clean,\u201d said Jonathan Senker, 35, who had come from Philadelphia to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve and ride the subway. And \u201cthe soap and water work,\u201d said Helen Rodgers, 46, from Jamaica, Queens, who had to use the men\u2019s restroom. Not everyone would venture inside. \u201cBad things can happen behind closed doors,\u201d said David Usiak, 29, who lives on the Upper East Side. Inside the single toilet stall, a handwritten note taped to the wall read, \u201cToilet seat must be down for toilet to flush.\u201d A Jazz Musician and His Celebrity Status George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, can usually travel through the city with little fuss or fanfare. On Sunday afternoon, however, he was surrounded by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. There was good reason for Mr. Braith\u2019s newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic at the 72nd Street station. E. 125th St. The M.T.A. plans to extend the line to E. 125th St., but that proposed addition is many years away. E. 116th St. OCT. 24, 2016 By The New York Times \u201cWould you look at that guy,\u201d said Mr. Braith, 77, as dozens of onlookers snapped photos. \u201cPretty handsome fellow if you ask me.\u201d In his mosaic, Mr. Braith, clad in a slick red blazer, is carrying his signature \u201cBraithophone,\u201d an alto and soprano saxophone mended together. Unsheathing the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. \u201cAre you famous?\u201d a passer-by asked. \u201cIn the jazz world,\u201d Mr. Braith responded. The man shook his head and said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re immortalized as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Braith, of Staten Island, rarely rides the subway, but said he would be sure to visit the 72nd Street stop more often now. \u201cI think it\u2019s the greatest station in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got me on the wall!\u201d Modern Stations for the 21st Century. And No Rats Yet. Visitors arriving at the line\u2019s three new stations will find a very different \u2014 and far more pleasant \u2014 atmosphere than they do in most of the rest of the subway system. For one thing, because the stations are new, they are clean. Enjoy that while you can. There are shiny escalators and elevators. There are no crumbling tiles or unlit corners. And, perhaps best of all, there are no rats to be seen, though they are expected to appear once careless subway riders start dropping bagel crumbs on the floor. The stations are also built deeper underground than much of the existing system, evoking the feel of Washington\u2019s subway, with long (and sometimes disorienting) escalator banks. While many of the city\u2019s subway stations have vertical columns, these have an open, arched design that is column free. \u201cThis is not your grandfather\u2019s subway station,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at the New Year\u2019s Eve party. And, with works by celebrated artists mounted on the walls, the three stations could almost be art galleries . But at least one thing will be familiar: The trains will be subject to the regular delays and annoyances \u2014 like sick passengers and manspreaders \u2014 that already plague your commute.

For him, it was a tactile experience. \u201cI\u2019ve seen his work in museums,\u201d he said of the artist, \u201cbut this is different: You can get right in and touch it.\u201d Nearby, Adrianna Mu\u00f1et\u00f3n, 47, a law clerk from Briarwood, Queens, was doing just that. She ran her fingers over the beard of Mr. Close\u2019s self-portrait. \u201cIt is the most unbelievable experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at no cost.\u201d Several blocks south at the 72nd Street station, Sumana Harihareswara, a consultant from Astoria, Queens, was walking through the new station when she came across a mosaic that stopped her. There, in gleaming tiles on the wall before her, was a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was instantly overcome with emotion.

Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast, said she was struck by the diversity of the subjects depicted in the mosaics throughout the new stations, which also showcase a mural of a gay couple holding hands.

By EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS and DAPHNE RUSTOW on Publish Date January 1, 2017. Photo by Benjamin Norman for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed A New Year\u2019s Eve Subway Ride to Remember Shortly after 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, a group of elected leaders and transit officials climbed on board a train at the new 72nd Street station for a memorable trip uptown and into the history books. \u201cWelcome on the first ride of the Second Avenue subway to 86th Street,\u201d Thomas F. Prendergast, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said over the loudspeaker. Cheers erupted. The New Year\u2019s Eve soiree and inaugural ride was an exclusive event deep underground ending with a merry countdown to midnight. There was the chairman-led tour to new stations at 86th Street and 96th Street, music by a rollicking jazz band and an array of snacks and local beers. Subway officials and their guests, dressed in bow ties and sequined dresses, toasted the hard work it took to build the huge subway tunnel below Manhattan. Nearing midnight at the 72nd Street station, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who effectively controls the authority, took the stage, telling the crowd of hundreds that the opening proved that government could do big things. He and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, had briefly greeted each other earlier in the night, despite their frosty relationship, though the mayor did not speak at the event. Charlie Feliciano, the conductor on the inaugural ride, said he had volunteered to work on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cIt was a lifetime experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it!\u201d Photo Workers dismantling a section of the elevated subway line along Third Avenue in Manhattan in 1955. The Upper East Side has had to make do with only the overflowing Lexington Avenue line in the years since. Credit Sam Falk/The New York Times The Tortured History of the Second Avenue Subway It is a story that stretches over 96 years , but we will try to keep it brief. The idea for a subway line along Second Avenue was first proposed in the 1920s but faced a series of obstacles that delayed it : the Great Depression , the city\u2019s financial crisis in the 1970s and broken promises when money that might have gone toward the project was spent elsewhere instead. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The elevated train lines that served the Upper East Side were taken down in the 1940s and 1950s, leaving the neighborhood with only one subway route: the overflowing Lexington Avenue line that was a long walk away for many people. \u201cIn many ways, the Upper East Side has kind of suffered with density without the infrastructure,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association. \u201cThis is trying to right a historic mistake.\u201d Finally, in the 1990s, the plans were revived, though subway officials decided to start with a smaller segment of the line, from 63rd Street to 96th Street. Construction began in 2007, to the dismay of some businesses and residents who endured shaking, clanging and dust as the work proceeded. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority faced doubts about whether it would meet a deadline to open in December 2016. Under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s prodding, though, workers were able to complete the required testing so that the line could be opened for an inaugural ride on New Year\u2019s Eve and to the public on Sunday. Photo A new subway map including the extension of the Q line. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times What\u2019s Next for the Second Avenue Subway? Some longtime New Yorkers may look at a map of the new line and wonder: Is that it? The city once imagined the Second Avenue subway running nearly the length of Manhattan, and possibly even into the Bronx. But officials scaled back their ambitions, choosing to build in phases, with the first one serving the Upper East Side neighborhood known as Yorkville. Many in the area are excited about the opening, but are also concerned about the prospect of rising rents forcing out residents and businesses. The next phase calls for the transportation authority to extend the line uptown to 125th Street in East Harlem. But that leg of the project, which could cost up to $6 billion, is still in the early planning stages and may not open for another decade. And leaders in East Harlem have already had to fight to restore funding for the segment after it was removed from the authority\u2019s capital budget in 2015. Officials have said that they eventually want to extend the line south to Houston Street and then to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan for a total length of 8.5 miles. Given how long it took to build the first segment, it may be wise to tell your grandchildren not to hold their breath. While some have criticized the line as puny, Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders\u2019 advocacy group, said it was an important start. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of what could be a glorious line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has tremendous potential.\u201d Correction: January 1, 2017 An earlier version of a photo credit with the 1955 picture of the elevated subway line along Third Avenue misspelled the photographer\u2019s surname. It is Falk, not Flak. ",

The banner, featured the word \u201cDIVEST\u201d and a hashtag: #NoDAPL, an apparent protest of the Dakota Access pipeline. SMG, the group that manages the new stadium, released the following statement during halftime: \"Two individuals appear to have climbed over a guard rail to access the ridge truss. We immediately dispatched on-site Minneapolis police and fire departments to the scene and cleared the seating section below. We are working with all stadium partners, and our primary focus is on the safety of the fans and these two individuals. Officials are actively working to get them down safety. We will continue to update media on the situation.\" One of the protesters, wearing a Brett Favre Vikings jersey, waved to fans in the crowd as police and stadium security vacated seven rows of seats behind the east end zone directly below where the protesters\u00a0were dangling. Firemen were seen scurrying through the stadium\u2019s press box as authorities searched for solutions to remove the protesters. In a press release e-mailed to the Minneapolis Star Tribune during Sunday\u2019s game , the protesters\u00a0asserted they were urging U.S. Bank to divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline.

    "text": "Chicago records 762 homicides in 2016, up 57 percent from previous year Published               January 01, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The city of Chicago recorded 762 homicides in 2016 \u2014 an average of two murders per day,\u00a0the most killings in the city for two decades and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. The nation's third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents than it did in 2015, according to statistics released by the Chicago Police Department that underlined a story of bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The numbers released Sunday are staggering, even for those following the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings and monthly death tolls that hadn't been seen in years. The increase in 2016 homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2015, a 20 percent from the previous year. The bulk of the deaths and shooting incidents, which jumped from 2,426 in 2015 to 3,550 last year, occurred in only five neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides, all poor and predominantly black areas where gangs are most active. Police said the shootings in those areas generally wasn't random, with more than 80 percent of the victims having previously been identified by police as more susceptible because of their gang ties or past arrests. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was expected to discuss the newly released statistics Sunday afternoon. The city has scrambled to address the violence. Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced last year that 1,000 officers would be added to the police department. At the same time, police officials have been trying to figure out why homicides and shootings -- which began climbing the year before -- suddenly surged. Johnson has said several factors contributed to the increased violence. He noted 2016 was the first full year since the city was forced in November 2015 to release video of the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was black and shot 16 times by a white police officer. The video cost former Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy his job, sparked major protests around the city, and led to federal and state investigations of the department. It also left Johnson with the task of trying to restore public trust in what appeared to be a weakened police force, a perception that was only buttressed by a dramatic drop in the number of arrests in 2016. While the police department has cited several factors for the declining numbers, including a concerted effort not to make minor drug arrests and focus on gun violence, Johnson acknowledged in a recent interview with The Associated Press that officers have become more cautious -- in part out of fear of becoming the next \"viral video.\" That, he said, has \"emboldened\" criminals. \"Criminals watch TV, pay attention to the media,\" he said. \"They see an opportunity to commit nefarious activity.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo passes during a\u00a0practice on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016, in Foxborough, Mass. (Elise Amendola / AP) Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog The Bears are done embarrassing themselves this season \u2014 John Fox \u2019s \u201ctry hard\u201d clown act capped the embarrassment with a 38-10 loss Sunday in Minnesota \u2014 which means they now can become relevant. To become relevant beyond next season\u2019s opener, however, they will need a new quarterback. They also need a new coach. They always need a quarterback and coach at Halas Hall. Same goes for a Football Yoda and new ownership, but good luck getting this outfit to act professional and successful these days. Let\u2019s just talk about a new quarterback who isn\u2019t the disastrous Matt Barkley , the uninspiring Brian Hoyer or the hopeless Jay Cutler.\u00a0This year\u2019s best rumor available suggests they go after Patriots backup Jimmy Garoppolo, and it makes for a nice story: The Arlington Heights kid who played at Eastern Illinois coming back to Chicago. But let me ask you something: How many quarterbacks have left the Patriots and won a title? Or even played well? Most notably, the Patriots traded Matt Cassel to the Chiefs along with Mike Vrabel in 2009 for a second-round draft pick that became safety Patrick Chung , who helped the Patriots get to two Super Bowls and win one. The Bears completed a dismal 3-13 season with a 38-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The team finished the year with a four-game losing streak, the longest skid in the John Fox era. Now, with their third-straight last-place finish in the books, the Bears will begin their heavy... The Bears completed a dismal 3-13 season with a 38-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The team finished the year with a four-game losing streak, the longest skid in the John Fox era. Now, with their third-straight last-place finish in the books, the Bears will begin their heavy... (Dan Wiederer) Cassel, meanwhile, saw his completion percentage drop by almost five points, his interception percentage jump by almost a full point and his passer rating fall by almost 11 points in Kansas City. And remember, Cassel was a guy who started 15 games for the Patriots. He should\u2019ve been a known quantity. Garoppolo isn\u2019t. Isn\u2019t even close. Garoppolo has started just two NFL games, both this season, and, yeah, he completed more than 70 percent with four touchdowns and no interceptions, but then he got injured. So what do you really know? Other than he gets hurt like a Bears first-rounder, I mean. But listen, here\u2019s the big issue: Do you really want Bears wonks trying to make a deal with Bill Belichick? The Bears can\u2019t evaluate their own safety spots, and you want titular GM Ryan Pace and Dowell Loggains-supporting coach John Fox to deal with the smartest man in football? You know how the stock market has a circuit breaker to halt trading in order to prevent a disastrous crash? The NFL should have some kind of alarm that sounds automatically when someone at Halas Hall calls Foxborough. Look what happened last offseason. The Bears traded Pro Bowl tight end Martellus Bennett because Fox can\u2019t coach players with personalities. The Bears got a 2016 fourth-round pick in that deal, and instead of using it on quarterback Dak Prescott, the Bears chose a defensive back who can\u2019t stop committing penalties. ",

    "text": "(Garrett Therolf) On April 26, Arturo Miranda Martinez, the security guard at the county employment office, called 911 to report that Gabriel was bruised and burned all over his face and head. Deputy Robin Soukup screamed at Martinez that a burned child was not an emergency, the prosecutor wrote in his motion. At Gabriel\u2019s\u00a0home, Deputy Jonathon Livingston spoke to Aguirre, saw Gabriel and then wrote an entry in his computer log, according to court records. Gabriel had fallen off a bicycle, and there was no evidence of child abuse, the deputy wrote. Livingston\u2019s log entry made no mention of examining the child for physical injuries, O\u2019Quinn, the homicide detective, told the grand jury.\u00a0Like the other deputies who visited Gabriel\u2019s home, Livingston did not file a police report that would\u00a0have prompted further investigation. In his motion seeking the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s investigative records, the prosecutor\u00a0slammed the deputies\u2019 response. \u201cIt is unclear why a child being burned all over his body is not an emergency,\u201d Hatami\u00a0wrote. \u201cIt is unclear why a police report was not filed and if the security guard was interviewed by Deputy Livingston.\u201d New deputies are trained in the Sheriff\u2019s Academy to \u201cbe suspicious\u201d and to square the family\u2019s story with the injuries on the child, said Scott, the retired sheriff\u2019s sergeant. That training is carried over into the field, said Sgt. Marvin Jaramilla of the Special Victims Bureau. \u201cWe conduct a thorough investigation. We do not take the parent\u2019s statement at face value,\u201d Jaramilla said. The county blue ribbon commission saw room for improvement and recommended better training for law enforcement officers, including yearly refresher courses. ** A few days after the encounter with the security guard, Gabriel returned to school. In photos from a Mother\u2019s Day project that were shown to the grand jury, his skin was peeling off his forehead, and he had a black eye in the healing stages, along with a bruise-like mark on his neck. One eye was completely bloodshot, prompting his classmates to say he looked evil, his teacher testified. It is unclear whether the injuries were the same ones the security guard observed or whether the boy had suffered more abuse in the intervening days. It is unclear why a child being burned all over his body is not an emergency. \u2014 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Hatami Garcia called a social worker to report the latest signs, noting that Gabriel\u2019s story about falling off a dirt bike\u00a0did not seem believable, according to her grand jury testimony. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to go along with the injuries that he had and that he looked really bad,\u201d she recalled saying to the social worker. In May, Gabriel was absent from school for several days. Worried school officials assigned Jason Lee Lasley, a sheriff\u2019s deputy who worked at the school, to check on the boy and see if he was being abused. Lasley tried and failed to find the boy\u2019s house \u2014 he had the wrong address. He told the grand jury that when he spoke to Pearl Fernandez on the phone on May 16, she said the boy had moved to Texas to live with his grandmother. He tried to get a better address from Gabriel\u2019s school, then appears to have ended his investigation. He did not write a police report, he testified. On May 22, 2013, sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a call from Gabriel\u2019s mother and found that the boy was not breathing. Pearl claimed he had fallen while playing with his siblings and that the bruises on his body were self-inflicted. She said the missing skin on his neck came from vigorous scrubbing with a washcloth. The county medical examiner who performed Gabriel\u2019s autopsy said to the grand jury that\u00a0he had never seen so many skin injuries on a child. The boy\u2019s skull was fractured, his ribs were fractured and he had BB pellets in his chest and pelvic region. A burn above his groin penetrated all the way through the skin into the soft tissue. Back at Gabriel\u2019s school, his teacher was hoping he had really moved to Texas. In her gut, she knew it wasn\u2019t true, she told the grand jury. When the principal called her into a meeting with a district official she had never met, she thought maybe she was in trouble. As the principal opened his mouth to speak, his face turned white. She knew. \u201cIs it Gabriel?\u201d she asked. Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016. Hello, 2017 The end of 2016 will be a wet one \u00a0in L.A.

Heather (Shorty) Burkinshaw-Stanley said she was only trying to defend herself and her co-workers, The Newnan Times-Herald reported Sunday. \u201cI was in fear for my life, my co-workers\u2019 lives, and I did what I thought was right,\u201d she told the paper. Three men ate at Burkinshaw-Stanley\u2019s Waffle House early Thursday. Instead of paying for their meal, the men gave the cashier a note threatening to shoot everyone if their demand for money from the register wasn\u2019t met, the paper reported. Police said they left after another waitress gave them $200. Burkinshaw-Stanley said her gun was in her car. \u201cI safely fired a round in the air in an attempt to scare the robbers who were in the process of getting in their vehicle, not knowing if they were retrieving their weapon to return to the Waffle House,\u201d she said on GoFundMe . \u201cMy shot must have gotten their attention as they rapidly drove off.\u201d The paper reports that Burkinshaw-Stanley was told she was fired on Friday. She had worked at the Waffle House for two years. A Waffle House spokesman declined to discuss the matter, the paper reported. Burkinshaw-Stanley said she was seeking donations because she is raising three kids and her husband is disabled. Advertisement ",

The Sparks ended up winning the WNBA title.</p> Close Harry How, Getty Images ISTANBUL - A handful of WNBA players, including Essence Carson, Chelsea Gray and Jantel Lavender of the Los Angeles Sparks, were next door to the deadly shooting at a nightclub in Istanbul . Search for gunman in Istanbul nightclub attack It marks at least the second time WNBA players have been dangerously close to a terror attack this year in Turkey. In a statement, the WNBA said: \u201cThe  attack at Reina in Istanbul was tragic and we send our heartfelt  condolences and prayers to the victims and their families. The WNBA was  in contact with our players in the region  after the incident; we are thankful each one of them is safe and  accounted for.\u201d Sparks coach Brian Agler confirmed to The Associated Press that Carson had texted him that the three players were OK. An assailant believed to have been dressed in a Santa Claus hat opened fire at a nightclub during New Year\u2019s celebrations, killing at least 39 people and wounding close to 70 others \u00a0in what the province\u2019s governor described as a terror attack. Carson had tweeted earlier in the evening that she was \u201cstuck inside of the club because of \u2018terror\u2019 shooting in Istanbul. Praises to the most high.\u201d She later deleted the tweet and posted a status update indicating the group had survived unharmed. We're okay. Goodnight. \u2014 Essence T. Carson (@Pr3pE) January 1, 2017 About two dozen WNBA players are in Turkey during their offseason playing in a league there, a move many make to supplement their relatively meager earnings in America. Turkey is one of the most popular destinations for American players looking to make some more money for their basketball skills, along with Russia, China and Greece. Indiana Fever star Marissa Coleman is in her third offseason playing in Turkey. Last January, she left the area near the Blue Mosque in Istanbul moments before a suicide bombing that killed several tourists occurred there. \u201cA guy walked by yelling bomb! Bomb!\u201d Coleman recalled. \u201cWe thought he was toying with us, so we left, and then my phone started buzzing. First thing I saw was a CNN update that there was a bomb outside the Blue Mosque.\u201d Coleman said she\u2019s become more worried about her safety with more time in Turkey. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the progression of how things are escalating. We stick out like sore thumbs. You can\u2019t avoid certain things, and it does make you nervous,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019m very hyper aware, vigilant of my surroundings. You never know.\u201d 19 Photos Istanbul New Year's attack The WNBA just announced last week that it had partnered with LiveSafe, a safety communications platform, to provide a mobile security app to its 60-plus players competing overseas during the offseason. The app debuted this week and players are already signing up. \u201cThis was a proactive effort to protect our players and secure their personal safety,\u201d WNBA President Lisa Borders said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. The app will allow the players to communicate directly with the league and its security team. It also can send security advisories and notifications to players when they\u2019re overseas, similar to what one might get from the state department. \u00a0 It is unclear whether the LiveSafe app was used during the attack. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the Istanbul nightclub assault. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Security video from outside the nightclub surfaced on social media Sunday, showing the harrowing moments leading up to the New Year's terrorist attack, which killed 39 people and wounded more than 60 others \u2014 including an American, a U.S. State Department official told NBC News. The gunman remains at large, according to Turkish police. In the video, the nightclub's bouncer and a few patrons can been seen lingering near the front door as cars glide down the street. Then, suddenly, bullets begin hailing down, ricocheting off the street and a passing car.
