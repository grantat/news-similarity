    "text": "Email CHICAGO -- Federal jurors at the biggest gang trial in recent Chicago history on Wednesday convicted the core leadership of the Hobos, who prosecutors billed as an \u201call-star team\u201d of the type of ruthless gangs police blame for an alarming spike in homicides last year. Accused Hobos boss Gregory \u201cBowlegs\u201d Chester, alleged hitman Paris Poe and four others were found guilty of a racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors alleged the conspiracy included the murder of at least nine people, from gang rivals to government witnesses. Prosecutors said the Hobos cultivated a reputation for brutality, once even torturing robbery victims with a hot clothing iron, to extend their power on the city\u2019s South Side. This undated photo provided by the Violent Crimes Task Force, Chicago Division, shows Paris Poe.\u00a0 Violent Crimes Task Force, Chicago Division via AP After three months of testimony, 12 jurors deliberated for six days before reaching their verdicts. The most serious conviction was for racketeering conspiracy, a charge designed as a legal tool to go after all forms of organized crime. An additional nine counts included drug and gun charges. So feared are the Hobos that some witnesses were visibly nervous testifying with its alleged leaders looking on. One refused outright to speak against the gang, telling the judge, \u201cI choose not to testify for the sake of me and my family.\u201d The witness was held in contempt and given a 60-day sentence. Signifying the importance of the case, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon, was in court when the verdicts were read. The Hobos leaders showed little emotion as the verdicts were read. Poe rubbed his brow and looked across the courtroom gallery. Their alleged crimes included the fatal shooting of government witness Keith Daniels in 2013 in front of his screaming step-children to stop Daniels from testifying, and the robbery at gunpoint of then-NBA player Bobby Simmons\u2019 $200,000 diamond-and-gold chain outside a nightclub. The convictions followed a bloody year on the streets of Chicago . The nation\u2019s third largest city logged 762 homicides last year, the highest tally in 20 years and more than the combined total of the two largest - New York and Los Angeles. More than 50 people were shot and 11 killed over the long Christmas weekend alone as some gangs sought out and shot rivals gathering at holiday parties, police said. There are more than 150,000 street-gang members in Chicago , though many aren\u2019t active, according to the non-governmental Chicago Crime Commission. The Hobos trial was considered so significant because so many purported gang leaders were on trial simultaneously, and also because of how prosecutors portrayed the Hobos as uniquely brazen and vicious. U.S. attorneys in Chicago have said for years that dismantling gangs was a key to reducing violence. They used racketeering laws to convict other gang bosses, including Latin Kings leader Augustin Zambrano in 2011. Racketeering laws enable prosecutors go after individuals, not necessarily for specific crimes, but for their leadership of groups that displayed patterns of illicit activity over years. ",

    "text": "Twitter Amid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday. The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them. But there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data \u2014 the problem of scale. While there's a \"spike\" here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular \u2014 or unpopular \u2014 search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump. Here, for example, is the \"who is my representative\" search compared to searches for \"Obamacare\" in the U.S. over the past week. The spike nearly disappears here \u2014 as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, \"who is my representative\" registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare. Article continues after sponsorship But then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure. The Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure. The really striking comparisons come when you compare this \"spike\" to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie? What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV? OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that \"this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project.\" But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for \"who is my representative\" are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten. So searches for \"who is my representative\" spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time. None of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members. But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video. ",

Time A mesentery. (Photo: Time) An Irish surgeon's breakthrough overturned\u00a0more than a century of medical belief and may lead to improvements in digestive surgery and recovery. The mesentery, it turns out, is one connected organ, not a disjointed group of separate parts, a theory believed since the 19th Century. \u00a0The mesentery connects the intestine to the abdomen. J. Calvin Coffey, a professor at the University of Limerick, reclassified the mesentery after discovering it was contiguous. His findings were published in November in the medical journal\u00a0The Lancet Gastroenterology and\u00a0Hepatology. Although it has no identifiable function, clarifying the structure of the mesentery, the university said, makes way for better understanding of the organ.\u00a0The university said mesentery research may lead to less invasive surgeries, fewer complications, shorter patient recovery and lower costs. The findings suggest mesentery plays a central position in the body, which could lead to even more studies. \"Whether the mesentery should be viewed as part of the intestinal, vascular, endocrine, cardiovascular or immunological systems is so far unclear,\" the findings said, \"as it has important roles in all of them.\" Mesentery\u00a0research\u00a0goes back to the time of Leonardo DaVinci, who provided one of the earliest depictions of the mesentery, which was shown as contiguous. For centuries, the now-organ was\u00a0depicted that way until the findings of Treves in 1885. His description of the mesentery \u2014\u00a0which was disconnected \u2014\u00a0became the basis of medical literature over the next century. \"During the initial research, we noticed in particular that the mesentery, which connects the gut to the body, was one contiguous organ,\" Coffey said. \"Up to that it was regarded as fragmented, present here, absent elsewhere and a very complex structure. The anatomic description that had been laid down over 100 years of anatomy was incorrect.\" The next step, Coffey said, is to determine the mesentery's function. \"If you understand the function you can identify abnormal function, and then you hve\u00a0disease,\" he said. \"Put them all together and you have the field of mesenteric science... the basis for a whole new area of science.\" Follow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman 1878 CONNECT TWEET 20 LINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2j5DrI0 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence met Thursday at the Capitol with Republican lawmakers, rallying them around the goal of repealing Obamacare. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Noam N. Levey and Noam N. Levey Contact Reporters After demanding for six years that the Affordable Care Act be gutted,\u00a0Republican leaders refused Wednesday\u00a0to outline concrete steps to repeal and replace it,\u00a0even as members of their party voiced growing reservations about rolling the law back without a viable alternative. Neither President-elect Donald Trump nor Vice President-elect Mike Pence , who met with House and Senate Republicans at the Capitol, offered lawmakers details about their repeal plan \u2014 a centerpiece of their winning campaign \u2014 short of vague promises that Trump would take executive action after he assumes office in just over two\u00a0weeks. And GOP congressional leaders would not say how they will proceed or even how long they will take to develop a replacement for the current law, widely known as Obamacare. \u201cThis is going to take a little time,\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said after the meeting with Pence. The lack of detail underscored the complexities of undoing the biggest expansion of the social safety net in decades without interfering with healthcare for\u00a0tens of millions of Americans. Republicans\u2019 wavering just a day after the start of a new Congress also may\u00a0give\u00a0opponents additional\u00a0time to shore up support for preserving Obamacare in some form. Cornyn and other Republican leaders repeated assurances Wednesday\u00a0that consumers would not lose coverage while Republicans work to develop an alternative to the law. More than 20 million Americans have gained coverage though the law and many more depend on its key protections, including a guarantee that people can get coverage even if they are sick and limits on how much patients can be forced to pay out of their pocket for medical care. \"We don\u2019t want to pull the rug out from anybody,\" said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). \"We don\u2019t want people to be caught with nothing.\" After meeting with Senate Republicans, Pence told reporters at the Capitol that Trump\u2019s executive orders would \u201censure that there is an orderly transition during the period after we repeal Obamacare to a market-based healthcare economy in America.\u201d The assurances have not convinced patient advocates, leading medical groups or even many conservative health policy experts, who are urging the GOP not to roll back the law without first developing an alternative. Many are skeptical Republicans can craft one; they have failed to do so for more than six years. This week alone, leading physician groups, including the American Medical Assn., joined the push to slow the repeal campaign. Others urging caution include the American Diabetes Assn. and the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society. A growing number of Republican senators are also voicing reservations about the lack of a clear plan, jeopardizing GOP leaders\u2019 vision for swift\u00a0repeal in a chamber where just three Republican defections could torpedo\u00a0legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure exactly what direction we\u2019re going to go to have a full and careful transition period,\u201d said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, whose state has seen a dramatic drop its uninsured rate thanks to Obamacare. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a centrist\u00a0who is being closely watched, urged party leaders to make more progress on an alternative to the current law before voting to scrap it. \u201cIt would be far better to have a detailed framework of what replacement is going to include as we are moving toward repealing,\u201d Collins said. Republicans , despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act , are struggling with\u00a0what parts of the law to roll back\u00a0and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate ,\u00a0to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal... Congressional Republicans , despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act , are struggling with\u00a0what parts of the law to roll back\u00a0and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate ,\u00a0to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal... (Noam N. Levey) On Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has publicly criticized the repeal push, joined Democrats in voting against a motion to start debating a resolution that would set the stage for repeal. Outside Washington, state Republican officials are raising concerns about repealing Obamacare as well. Michigan Gov.\u00a0 Rick Snyder , who was among the first Republican governors to expand Medicaid coverage through the healthcare law, called his state\u2019s expansion a national model in an interview with the Detroit News . Under Republicans\u2019 current repeal plan, the House and Senate over the next couple weeks would pass a budget resolution directing Congress to develop a repeal bill through a process called budget reconciliation. The House would then craft the repeal legislation, pass it and send it to the Senate. Under budget rules, Republicans, who have a 52-48 edge in the Senate, would need only\u00a0a simple majority to pass the bill and send it to Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that the repeal package, which congressional committees are to draw up by Jan. 27, would hew closely to repeal legislation that Republicans developed in 2015 and sent to President Obama a year ago. Obama vetoed it. That bill removed the unpopular insurance mandates in the law that require Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. It also rolled back federal aid for Medicaid; scrapped federal insurance subsidies for low- and moderate-income consumers; and eliminated a Medicare surtax on high-income households and other taxes on medical device makers and health insurance companies that go toward funding\u00a0the law. To allow Republicans time to develop an alternative, the bill delayed implementation of the repeal for two years. If congressional Republicans stick to this repeal-and-delay\u00a0strategy, Trump could take steps through executive action that might help stabilize insurance markets while a replacement is being developed, said Larry Levitt, an insurance market expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Trump made promises to blue-collar voters. Democrats plan to make sure he follows through \u00bb These steps might include tightening rules on when people could sign up for coverage in Obamacare marketplaces or even loosening requirements on what benefits insurers must offer, which could lower premiums\u00a0though would likely leave consumers with fewer protections. But in case those steps prove inadequate, Republicans appear to be laying the groundwork to shift blame back to Democrats. Trump said Wednesday \u00a0that the current healthcare law would will \u201cfall of its own weight.\u201d And Pence outlined for lawmakers plans for the new president to barnstorm the country attacking Obamacare and keeping up momentum for the repeal-and-replace push. \"I'm promising you, you will not be doing it alone,\" Pence told House Republicans, according to a source in the closed-door meeting, which was described as more of a pep rally than a strategy session. \u201cWe'll be making the case all around the country.\" Democrats, meanwhile, are working on their own political campaign, which is designed to capitalize on growing reservations in Republican ranks and polls showing public unease over repeal. \u00a0 After meeting separately in the Capitol with Obama, Democratic leaders warned that the GOP was risking chaos by unraveling Obamacare. \"They seek to rip healthcare away from millions of Americans \u2014\u00a0creating chaos for our entire economy,\" warned Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cIt is their obligation \u2014 they are voting for repeal \u2014\u00a0it is their obligation to come with replace.\u201d In a twist on Trump's campaign slogan, Democrats warned that Republicans want to \"make America sick again.\" Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Grace Beahm/AP hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/AP Dylann Roof appears at a court hearing in Charleston, S.C., in July 2015. Now found guilty of 33 federal hate crimes charges, Roof is defending himself during the sentencing phase of the trial. Grace Beahm/AP Dylann Roof delivered his opening statement in a South Carolina courtroom Wednesday, as the penalty phase of his federal trial got underway. Roof, who was convicted last month of murdering nine black churchgoers, will be representing himself as jurors weigh whether to give him the death penalty or life in prison. His remarks were brief, focused only on defending his decision to dismiss his lawyers for this phase of the trial. He said it's \"absolutely true\" that he chose to represent himself so that his lawyers would not present evidence of mental illness. \"The point is I'm not going to lie to you,\" Roof said. \"There's nothing wrong with me psychologically.\" Roof's opening statement was brief, just a couple minutes, here's what he said #RoofTrial : pic.twitter.com/oHYMA7fcyy \u2014 Mike Hayes (@michaelhayes) January 4, 2017 He did not address his crimes or the prosecution's opening remarks against him. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel approved the 22-year-old white supremacist's request to serve as his own counsel after a second hearing on his mental competency. The request for self-representation \u2014 and its approval \u2014 came over the protests of Roof's own lawyers. Roof has said he will not call witnesses or experts to the stand during this phase of the trial. Article continues after sponsorship Still, earlier this week, Gergel laid out strict rules for Roof's conduct while acting as his own lawyer. \"In an order, the judge detailed how Roof can behave while in court,\" Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio reports. \"He cannot approach witnesses, the jury or the bench and has to give opening statements from behind a podium.\" Court order filed about how Roof will interact with witnesses and jury during court proceedings. But no ruling on competency yet. pic.twitter.com/60iAfLD8t3 \u2014 Alexandra Olgin (@Alexolgin) January 2, 2017 Roof killed nine parishioners at Charleston's historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17, 2015. In a confession taped shortly after he was taken into custody, Roof made plain his racial motivations, adding: \"I am guilty. We all know I'm guilty.\" In Taped Confession, Charleston Church Shooter Says 'We All Know I Am Guilty' It took less than three hours last month for the jurors to concur. They found him guilty of charges ranging from murder and attempted murder to obstruction of religious belief and damage to religious property. Federal prosecutors, who are pursuing the death penalty, delivered a much longer opening statement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams focused his remarks on those who died in the shooting, and on what he called Roof's lack of regret. Central to the latter argument is a journal that prosecutors say Roof wrote in after his arrest. In the journal, excerpts of which were presented to courtroom reporters, Roof allegedly says that \"African-Americans have to pay for what they've done.\" \"I created the biggest wave I could,\" Roof allegedly wrote. \"I did all I can do, now it is in the hands of my brothers.\" More from Roof's journal, after lamenting he can't go to movies, eat good food... pic.twitter.com/7elGTbsEmH \u2014 Matt Zapotosky (@mattzap) January 4, 2017 In concluding his remarks, Williams warned that the testimony to come will be worse than what jurors have heard yet: \"It will be heartbreaking,\" the prosecutor said. The penalty phase of the trial resumed Wednesday with prosecutors calling their first witnesses. The prosecution plans to call up to 38 people as witnesses and experts during this phase of the trial, according to The Associated Press . This is not the only trial that Roof is facing \u2014 and not the only possibility for capital punishment. \"After the federal proceedings,\" reports NPR's Debbie Elliott , \"Roof is scheduled to be in state court early next year on murder charges that also carry the possibility of a death sentence.\" ",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 4, 2017 Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Hannity Julian Assange FULL Interview 1/3/17 Video by MAKINGAMERICAGREATAGAIN Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday. Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have &quot;hacking defense&quot; like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible...... \u2014         Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 4, 2017 There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence \u2014 with \u201c100 percent\u201d certainty. As he has previously, Mr. Assange said: \u201cOur source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties.\u201d But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks.com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2.0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D.N.C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange\u2019s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that \u201cterrible\u201d information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city\u2019s lead-contaminated water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here , among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query \u2014 for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. &quot;Without Trump\u2019s ... false claims ... the Wikileaks material would have deflated of its own boringness.\u201d https://t.co/l7NBicHRjP https://t.co/aUrgPMgoJv \u2014         David Frum (@davidfrum) Jan. 4, 2017 The president-elect appears to be getting a jump on the news. Pence backs up Trump \u2014 and Republicans squirm Vice President-elect Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump\u2019s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administration\u2019s icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump \u201cexpressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,\u201d Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post, Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the president-elect, saying he would not be commenting on \u201cevery little tweet or Facebook post.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he called Mr. Assange \u201ca sycophant for Russia , \u201d who \u201cleaks, steals data and compromises national security.\u201d Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll get up to speed on what\u2019s been happening and what Russia has or has not done,\u201d he said. From \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 to the White House Ms. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. Trump\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. OMAROSA's OFFICIAL SIZZLE REEL Video by OfficialOmarosa Top White House jobs are going to political veterans Ms. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W.

    "text": "Republicans name first targets in drive to repeal Obama regs Published               January 04, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 House Republican leaders on Wednesday identified their primary targets in the long-standing effort to roll back President Obama\u2019s \u201cjob-killing\u201d regulations, vowing swift action to nix two environmental rules. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Republicans would roll back one rule reducing methane emissions and another meant to ease the environmental impact of coal mining on streams. McCarthy argued the regulations limit the nation's energy production, and said the GOP-controlled Congress will seek to invalidate the rules starting at month's end. Republicans for years have clamored in vain about Obama\u2019s attempts to move the country from fossil fuels to renewable energy using a mix of financial incentives and federal regulations. But with a Republican president coming into office, they will have the power to roll back some of those rules. In his first floor speech of the 115th Congress, McCarthy said GOP House leaders will take a \u201ctwo-step approach\u201d to federal regulations \u2013 first, passing legislation to give Congress more power to repeal, and then repealing rules that are \u201charmful to the American people, costing us time, money, and, most importantly, jobs.\u201d Industry groups already have filed suit to block Obama's regulations designed to reduce methane emissions, and other major regulations are currently tied up in court. But GOP leaders hope to bring about a more certain verdict through the so-called Congressional Review Act, a rarely used process that requires a simple majority of both chambers to approve a joint resolution of disapproval and the president's signature to make a regulation invalid. Lawmakers have successfully used the act only one other time to quash a new regulation. Generally, they cannot get the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome a presidential veto, but under GOP President-elect Donald Trump, they'll have a limited window to test his campaign promises to repeal various Obama administration regulations. McCarthy said the process won't be completed quickly, but likens the effort to \"draining the bureaucratic swamp that undermines the will of the people.\" Obama has pushed for rules to protect air and water as part of his focus on curbing global warming. He argues that the regulations enacted have benefited the economy more than they have cost. He has also said his administration's use of regulatory authority is also a reflection of the GOP's unwillingness to work with him on legislative solutions. Republicans will also seek to repeal regulations implementing an education reform bill that some state officials have complained erodes local decision-making, McCarthy's office said. Business groups are lining up to support the effort with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce saying the work done in the House over the next several weeks \"is a step in the right direction toward bringing greater accountability, transparency, and integrity to federal rulemakings.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

By Mike DeBonis January 4 at 7:21 PM Follow @mikedebonis A House panel formed by Republicans to investigate the procurement of human fetal tissue for medical research has recommended stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood, heralding a new congressional assault on the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortions and women\u2019s health care. The GOP majority on the Select Investigative Panel included the recommendation in the 471-page final report , which was issued Tuesday on the dissolution of the panel. It was formed in 2015 after antiabortion activists recorded a series of undercover videos that they said documented abuses by abortion providers and intermediaries that provide fetal tissue to researchers. Over strong objections from Democrats, medical groups and abortion rights supporters, Republicans issued subpoenas to dozens of clinics, procurement firms and research institutions. Their final report suggests that some clinics and firms are illegally profiting from fetal-tissue transactions and that their business arrangements could create an incentive to perform more abortions. [Dozens of groups targeted as House fetal-tissue probe accelerates] While GOP panel members denied targeting Planned Parenthood as they conducted their investigation, the report closely scrutinizes several of the organization\u2019s affiliates, accusing them of \u201ccareless management\u201d and \u201ca general disinterest in clinical integrity.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that this is going to provide the information that is necessary for action to be taken,\u201d Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the panel\u2019s chairwoman, said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThis will be a Congress and an administration that will be known for standing for the women, for the protection of unborn children, and the protection of life.\u201d The panel\u2019s Democrats preemptively blasted the findings in a 114-page report of their own, released in December, that challenged the Republicans\u2019 key claims. They criticized the GOP members\u2019 \u201cMcCarthy-era tactics,\u201d accused them of relying on \u201cunsourced, unverified documents\u201d and argued that there is \u201cno legitimate basis\u201d to strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood\u2019s medical services. \u201cRepublicans spent nearly $1.6\u00a0million taxpayer dollars chasing inflammatory lies being peddled by antiabortion extremists,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), the panel\u2019s top Democrat, who said the body \u201cleaves behind a legacy of lies, intimidation and procedural misconduct.\u201d The panel has been sharply partisan from the outset: It was created on a party-line vote after some Republicans threatened a government shutdown unless Planned Parenthood was stripped of federal funding. Republicans have styled it as the \u201cSelect Panel on Infant Lives,\u201d while some Democrats preferred to call it the \u201cSelect Panel to Attack Women\u2019s Health.\u201d [In first hearing, GOP panel casts doubt on fetal-tissue research] One GOP recommendation is to ban federal funding for research on fetal tissue obtained through elective abortions while providing for the donation of miscarried fetuses for research through existing organ-donation programs. Another would have Congress direct the National Institutes of Health to develop new guidelines for the use of human fetal tissue. Other recommendations include having Congress \u201ctake appropriate measures\u201d to ensure that the Justice Department prosecute violations of the federal ban on profiting from the sale of fetal tissue and beefing up protections for \u201cborn-alive\u201d infants. But the most politically charged implications of the report are certain to surround Planned Parenthood, whose affiliates performed 324,000 abortions in 2014 among more than 9\u00a0million other discrete medical services. The group reported receiving $553\u00a0million in government funding that year, about half of its total revenue. Congress has barred federal funding for abortions since 1976, but health providers that offer abortions are eligible for Medicaid reimbursements and federal family-planning grants for other services. But antiabortion lawmakers have long challenged the notion of abortion providers getting federal funding of any sort. \u201cWhat we just want to do is just put that clear line there,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cIt is as simple as that: To be sure that [federal funds] are not going into abortion services.\u201d [Here\u2019s what happens if Congress ends funding for Planned Parenthood] Roughly 40 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding could be at risk with a Republican Congress willing to pass defunding legislation and an incoming Republican president willing to sign it. The panel\u2019s report stands to give antiabortion lawmakers a rallying point as they push to include that measure in a legislative package aimed at repealing President Obama\u2019s health-care reform law that is expected to pass this year. A Planned Parenthood executive on Wednesday called the GOP report \u201cnothing more than a partisan attack on Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s access to safe and legal abortion\u201d and noted that investigations in 13 states and by several other congressional committees found no wrongdoing. \u201cPlanned Parenthood has never profited while facilitating its patients\u2019 choice to donate fetal tissue for use in important medical research,\u201d said Dana Singiser, the organization\u2019s vice president for public policy and government affairs, who noted that only about 1\u00a0percent of its health centers offer the option to donate. Congress is not the only entity that Planned Parenthood and other organizations targeted by the panel have to be concerned about. Panel Republicans issued 15 referrals to federal and state law enforcement authorities over potential criminal violations, and Blackburn said she expects that the administration of President-elect Donald Trump will closely examine those. [GOP congresswoman meets with Trump as fetal-tissue investigation moves to a close] But it remains unclear how aggressive Trump will be regarding Planned Parenthood, an organization he has praised in the past, and whether he will push to defund it as part of his larger health-care plans. A bill repealing the Affordable Care Act that was vetoed by President Obama early last year included a provision targeting Planned Parenthood. Vice President-elect Mike Pence did not mention defunding the group when he went to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to discuss the GOP\u2019s health-care plans, according to several lawmakers. But Blackburn, a member of Trump\u2019s transition team, said she was confident he would sign defunding legislation. \u201cI truly think that Donald Trump is going to continue to speak on behalf of life and stand for life,\u201d she said.

    "text": "Classified Election Hacking Report Complete, President Obama to Be Briefed By JUSTIN FISHEL Jan 4, 2017, 4:53 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Saying Intel Briefing Was Postponed, Trump Continues Doubting Russian Election Hacking 0 Shares Email The classified report requested by President Barack Obama detailing Russia's alleged role in cyberattacks during U.S. presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete, and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials tell ABC News. President-elect Donald Trump , who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, is scheduled to receive his briefing on Friday. Both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency , the FBI and the CIA. U.S. officials denied claims from Trump that his special briefing was delayed so the U.S. intelligence community could strengthen its case against Russia. Officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the Trump transition team. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Officials familiar with the report say an unclassified version of its findings is not expected to made public until Monday, the same day Congress gets its classified briefing. Although the unclassified version will be far less revealing, pushing the public findings into next week will likely prolong the ugly spat between Trump and Democrats and the intelligence community over who is responsible for the cyberattacks. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly questioned the conclusions of the intelligence community, which on Oct. 7 stated publicly that it is \"confident\" Russia directed hacks of political organizations during the 2016 presidential election season. In doubting the claims, Trump referred to the intelligence community's false conclusions about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in the run-up to the Iraq War, and he has taken WikiLeaks founder and fugitive computer activist Julian Assange at his word that the Russians were not the source of the information leaked to his site. \"I know a lot about hacking,\" Trump said Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \"And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,\" he said, apparently referring to the intelligence community. On Thursday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is set to hold a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing with testimony from ODNI and NSA officials, who are not expected to comment at length on the new report before Obama is briefed. 0 Shares ",

By David Weigel and Joby Warrick January 4 at 7:22 PM Follow daveweigel Follow @jobywarrick President-elect Donald Trump tweeted some praise on Tuesday for a man most Republicans wanted nothing to do with. He had seen Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, defend himself during an hour of friendly, prime-time questions on Fox News. And he was impressed. \u201cJulian Assange said a \u201814-year old could have hacked Podesta,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhy was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had praised WikiLeaks. During his campaign for president, Trump had gleefully highlighted emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. By October, just the mention of WikiLeaks could start a roar of applause at Trump\u2019s rallies. Since then, Trump has continued praising the radical transparency group, harshly criticized by President Obama and other officials for what they describe as damaging national security leaks. He has defended its founder, who has lived in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London since August 2012 to avoid extradition on a rape allegation in Sweden. And Trump has been in sync with conservative media, once critical of WikiLeaks, which increasingly embraces Assange as a hero. Republicans have been slow to climb on board. In interviews, members of the congressional intelligence committees either declined to comment on WikiLeaks or made it clear that they wanted the organization shut down. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange prepares to speak on February 5, 2016 in London from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy where he continues to seek asylum following an extradition request from Sweden in 2012. (Carl Court/Getty Images) \u201cJulian Assange is no hero,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) \u201cSomeone who steals property is not bringing transparency \u2014 he\u2019s taking information that\u2019s not his to give.\u201d In a statement, Rep. Will Hurd (D-Tex.), a former CIA officer, said that Assange was not a \u201ccredible source\u201d for Trump or anyone else. \u201cThe same people who condemned Secretary Clinton for making sensitive and classified information vulnerable by using an unsecure server should be equally outraged that Assange continues to carelessly leak sensitive documents,\u201d Hurd said. On CNN, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u2014 a Trump critic who has asked for hearings into possible Russian meddling in the election \u2014 urged the incoming president to look more closely at Assange\u2019s tactics and motivations, and to take seriously U.S. intelligence estimates that contradict Assange\u2019s descriptions of the hacks. \u201cIt\u2019s the Democrats today; it could be the Republican Party tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us should be gleeful when a foreign entity hacks into our political system to interfere with our elections, and that\u2019s what the Russians did.\u201d Increasingly, reactions like those don\u2019t jibe with the way Assange is portrayed by the sort of conservative sources\u00ad that generally give Republicans glowing treatment. Assange\u2019s interview with Fox News was conducted by Sean Hannity, who had evolved from a critic to a frequent booster. From Assange\u2019s room in London, Hannity presented WikiLeaks in its favored terms \u2014 as a source of true, incorruptible journalism, bringing down the political elite. Hannity, who told Assange last month that he had \u201cdone us a favor,\u201d said Tuesday that he believes \u201cevery word\u201d Assange says. \u201cYou exposed a level of corruption that I for 30 years on the radio as a conservative knew existed, and I was shocked at the level of corruption, duplicity, dishonesty, ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion,\u201d Hannity told Assange. \u201cKnowing what WikiLeaks revealed about the Podesta emails on Clinton corruption, on pay to play, on Bernie Sanders being cheated, all of this is revealed. Not a lot of this was covered.\u201d With little pushback from Hannity and just as little demand for proof, Assange denied that Russian hackers had anything to do with its troves of hacked Democratic emails. With Hannity\u2019s urging, Assange said he was surprised that \u201celites\u201d had failed to elect Clinton; he had said, before the election, that Trump would \u201cnot be allowed\u201d to win. \u201cWe are happy to have credit for exposing the corruption and behavior that was occurring in that Clinton team and the DNC fixing things against Bernie Sanders,\u201d Assange said. \u201cWe are quite happy to accept that.\u201d The Fox interview won other fans: Sarah Palin, who had once compared Assange to the editor of an al-Qaeda magazine, apologized on Facebook and credited him with releasing \u201cimportant information that finally opened people\u2019s eyes to democrat (sic) candidates and operatives.\u201d At less-mainstream news outlets, where Trump\u2019s run and victory were celebrated, this praise had been echoing for months. The Drudge Report has linked videos with speculation that Assange has been aided by government insiders; Alex Jones\u2019s InfoWars, which once criticized Assange for slow-walking the stolen Clinton campaign documents, is rife with rumors that Assange has been silenced by the government, and full of mockery for the Republicans who criticize him. This treatment of Assange is a stark departure from what was, until recently, a near-universal condemnation of the Australian by conservative pundits and politicians as well as the national security establishment. Assange has inspired both admiration and hatred \u2014 sometimes by the same individuals \u2014 since his anti-secrecy organization first made global headlines in 2010. That was the year that WikiLeaks published thousands of stolen, heavily classified Pentagon documents that shed light on U.S. actions in the Iraq War. Most famous were the \u201cIraq War logs,\u201d which included cockpit video footage of American helicopter pilots opening fire on two Reuters journalists after mistaking them for insurgents. That same year, WikiLeaks published the first of more than 250,000 pilfered State Department cables containing sensitive and often candid assessments of foreign governments and politicians. Obama administration officials said publicizing the confidential records damaged relationships with key allies and put diplomats and intelligence operatives at risk. Assange, a former computer programmer and journalist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006, has defended the organization\u2019s tradition of publishing massive volumes of unfiltered intelligence, calling the release of confidential material a necessary antidote against excessive government secrecy. In a news release issued on the eve of last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, Assange said of his group\u2019s goals: \u201cWe publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish.\u201d The releases that started in 2010 prompted calls in conservative media for Assange\u2019s prosecution, or worse. Conservative commentator Jeffrey Kuhner, in a Washington Times op-ed piece that year, suggested that the U.S. government should have him assassinated. \u201cJulian Assange poses a clear and present danger to American national security,\u201d Kuhner wrote. \u201cThe WikiLeaks founder is more than a reckless provocateur. He is aiding and abetting terrorists in their war against America. The administration must take care of the problem \u2014 effectively and permanently.\u201d On Fox News, legal experts debated the best legal course against Assange, who was decried by one guest as a \u201cdeeply flawed individual.\u201d A column in the conservative publication National Review Online questioned why Assange wasn\u2019t dead already \u2014 perhaps \u201cgarroted in his hotel.\u201d Trump himself, in one of his then-frequent calls to Fox, called WikiLeaks \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and added that \u201cthere should be like death penalty or something\u201d for its releases. Lawmakers and national security officials were only slightly less harsh. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) described WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of Pentagon and State Department documents the \u201cgreatest, most damaging security breach in the history of this country.\u201d Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who would become chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, suggested that WikiLeaks be designated as a terrorist organization. As recently as late 2015, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of classified documents had \u201ccertainly helped our primary adversaries\u201d and inflicted \u201cjust enormous\u201d damage to the country. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., who oversees U.S. intelligence collection, went further, accusing Assange of putting lives at risk, particularly intelligence operatives working abroad. Assange\u2019s most fervent praise in the United States did not come from Democrats. It came from libertarians. Then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), who ran for president in 1988, 2008 and 2012, asked in a floor speech \u201cwhich has resulted in the greatest number of deaths: lying us into war or WikiLeaks revelations or the release of the Pentagon Papers?\u201d Assange, who does not often talk about domestic politics, appeared to notice where his defenders were coming from. In a 2013 discussion, streamed live from the Ecuadoran Embassy, Assange brushed aside the idea that Democrats or political independents were capable of reforming the United States. \u201cThe Republican Party, insofar as how it has coupled together with the war industry, is not a conservative party at all,\u201d Assange said. \u201cThe libertarian aspect of the Republican Party is presently the only useful political voice in the U.S. Congress.\u201d In the 2016 Republican primaries, the party\u2019s libertarian wing lost badly. But elements of their ideas, especially Paul\u2019s criticism of the national security state, were adopted successfully by Trump. The rest of the Republican Party has been slower to adopt or adapt. In 2010, as the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, then-Rep. Pete Hoekstra had called for decisive action against WikiLeaks and Assange. In an interview Wednesday, he said it should still be a goal to \u201cdo everything we can, legally, to shut down his networks.\u201d But Hoekstra argued that Trump was not praising or egging on Assange\u2019s publication of hacked material. \u201cI feel bad for John Podesta that he got his emails hacked,\u201d Hoekstra said. \u201cI\u2019d feel bad if mine were hacked. The reality in today\u2019s world is that if you\u2019re not extremely careful, you\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

How would you even stage that even if we were professionals with experience in such?\" CAUGHT ON VIDEO: 2-YEAR-OLD BOY PUSHES DRESSER OFF TWIN BROTHER STUCK UNDERNEATH In the video, which Shoff posted on YouTube over the weekend, twins Brock and Bowdy Shoff are seen\u00a0opening various dresser drawers and trying to climb up on the furniture. The dresser tipped over, trapping Brock underneath. Bowdy eventually managed to push the dresser off his brother.\u00a0 According to the New York Post, skeptics have pointed out that Ricky Shoff works for the company that sells the nannycam that recorded the incident. They also note that the dresser was empty at the time the twins were playing near it, and that the nannycam was pointed toward the dresser and not the twins' bed.\u00a0 When Ricky Shoff posted the video, he wrote on Facebook that he was \"a little hesitant to post this. But I feel it\u2019s not only to bring awareness, but it\u2019s also incredible. \"We are so grateful for the bond that these twin brothers share.\" FoxNews.com's Diana Falzone contributed to this report.

Buzz60 Shoppers walk into a Macy's department store. (Photo: Stephan Savoia, AP) After seeing sales drop during the holidays, Macy's said Wednesday it has either closed or will shutter 68 stores and cut an additional 6,200 positions\u00a0at a time when shoppers are going online to buy everything from scarves to lipstick. Of the 68 stores\u00a0out of 730 in total, nine closings had been previously announced and three locations have already shut down. But the retail giant revealed the locations of the remaining 59 stores, which will be shuttered by the middle of this year\u00a0and affect 3,900 employees, some of whom may be offered jobs at other locations. Macy's identifies 68 stores that will close The locations span the country, from Florida to Oregon. Some of the stores are relatively new to the chain. The Macy's store in the Eastland center in Columbus, Ohio, opened in 2006, and has 73 employees. Some, however, are historic or have been around for decades. Macy's said it will shutter its store in downtown Minneapolis opened in 1902, where it has 280 employees. Expect more store closings despite big holiday sales Additionally the retail giant says that it will be cutting \"layers of management'' at its central operations, and paring the number of managers supporting stores, making up the bulk of 6,200 jobs that will be lost. \"We\u00a0continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,'' Terry Lundgren, Macy's CEO said in a statement. \u00a0In regard to the store closings he added, \"we are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape. . . .These are never easy decisions.'' The news did not seem to sooth investors, with Macy's shares plunging 8.7%, to $32.70, in after hours trading. \"It's a big reduction in space and a lot of stores aren't pulling their weight,\" says Neil Saunders, analyst for Conlumino, a firm that follows the retail industry. who called the action \"harsh, but necessary.\" Having stemmed some of its losses, he says Macy's can now pour some of the savings into improving stores that show more promise. \"In stores where they think they have potential, they will invest more,\" Saunders says. \"That is the right direction. They\u00a0want to make sure the ones they have are really great stores and that requires money.\" But the bloodletting probably isn't over. \"I\u00a0don't think this is the end of it,\" he adds. The announcement was in keeping with Macy\u2019s guidance to investors\u00a0in August that it would be shutting about\u00a0100 stores to try to reverse sliding sales and profits. The chain also mapped out a strategy to boost revenue, ranging from hosting in-store events to woo foot traffic to enhancing the experience of searching online. But efforts fell short in the all-important holiday shopping period.\u00a0Sales at stores open at least 12 months that include licensed businesses dropped a combined 2.1% in November and December compared to last year, while sales at stores that do not include licensed businesses and open at least 12 months dropped by 2.7%. Macy's\u00a0is now reducing its full-year earnings guidance, expecting diluted earnings, not counting special charges, of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, rather than the previously forecast $3.15 to $3.40. Meanwhile, it maintained its full year\u00a0guidance predicting a 2.5% \u00a0to 3% drop in comparable sales at stores with licensed businesses. The retailer is one of many traditional store chains fighting the headwinds of a retail environment that has been transformed by the surge in online shopping. Sears for instance has shuttered dozens of stores, terminating the leases on 19 under performing locations just this week. ",

NBC News Sen. Bernie Sanders haunted Donald Trump and Republicans with the ghost of Twitter past on Wednesday. The Vermont senator printed an oversized tweet of Trump's to use as a visual aid during the Senate's debate over the future of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act. The president-elect's tweet from May 2015 claimed that he was the only Republican candidate to \"to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.\" Trump punctuated the tweet with a jab at former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015 \"I think it is interesting that we listen to what Donald Trump said during the campaign,\" Sanders said on the floor of the chamber, as the giant tweet was revealed. \"That Democrats hear what he had to say during the campaign \u2014 what he campaigned on \u2014 and more importantly Republicans listen and hear what their leader had to say about these issues.\" Republicans are fighting to repeal the legislation, an act that the Urban Institute said in a recent study would cause 24 million people to lose their health care coverage. Sanders said that Trump must be held accountable for his campaign promises, as they are what allowed him to win the presidency. Related: Pence and Obama Kick Off Obamacare Battle on Capitol Hill \"This is what he asked millions of elderly people and working class people to vote for him on \u2014 these are the principles that Donald Trump ran and won the presidency on,\" Sanders said. Sanders said in an earlier press conference with Democrats that there were two possible realities for the president-elect: either Trump should be considered a liar or the real estate mogul must proclaim clearly that he will veto any legislation that would cut any of the three entitlement programs that he mentioned. \"If he makes that clear to his republican colleagues we can save us a whole lot of time and start getting to work doing what this country desperately needs to have done.\" Mike Casca, Sanders' outgoing communications director, had the job of carrying the giant placards through Capitol Hill, and earned a grin from former GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz. earlier today, sen. ted cruz chuckled when i walked past him carrying this poster. pic.twitter.com/65iAY2106p \u2014 mike casca (@cascamike) January 4, 2017 Phil McCausland ",

    "text": "GOP Leaders Ready To Pivot From 'Do-Nothing' To Doing A Lot In 2017 It was likely Obama's last visit to the Capitol before the inauguration of his successor. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama told the lawmakers he wished he were in their place. \"The word he used was 'envy,' \" Earnest said, \"for the opportunity they have\" to fight GOP repeal efforts. Pence told reporters that Trump will sign executive orders on his first day in office to begin implementing the repeal of Obamacare, saying it was \"the first order of business.\" The incoming administration, Pence said, is working right now on \"a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place even as the Congress appropriately debates alternatives to and replacement of Obamacare.\" He did not offer any specifics on what those orders would entail. He said Republicans will be taking a \"two-track approach\" with a combination of executive and legislative actions. Article continues after sponsorship Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by fellow congressional Democrats, brands what Republicans are trying to do when it comes to health care as \"Make America Sick Again.\" Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by fellow congressional Democrats, brands what Republicans are trying to do when it comes to health care as \"Make America Sick Again.\" Evan Vucci/AP The new leader of Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer of New York, said GOP lawmakers seek \"to rip health care away from millions\" of Americans, \"which will create chaos.\" In his short, prepared statement, he repeated the word \"chaos\" four times. Schumer said Democrats in both the House and the Senate are united in their opposition to Republican attempts to \"make America sick again.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said Republicans asserted, however, that there would be \"an orderly transition, so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families,\" which he said are currently \"struggling\" under Obamacare. But replace it with what? Ryan offered no specifics, except to insist Republicans do \"have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it.\" But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, addressing reporters after hearing from Obama, said Republicans don't have the votes for a replacement plan. Pelosi blasted an approach that some Republicans have discussed, that would repeal the ACA but delay its effect to give lawmakers time to come up with a replacement. She called the strategy \"an act of cowardice.\" Trump himself weighed in today via his preferred method of communicating, tweeting that \"Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster\" and \"Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.\" He warned that \"massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess.

Bruce Rauner, seen here at a luncheon in Chicago on Dec. 2, 2016, will not be attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Gov. Bruce Rauner, seen here at a luncheon in Chicago on Dec. 2, 2016, will not be attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner will not attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. Inaugurations typically are opportunities for members of the winning party to celebrate claiming the White House while hobnobbing and raising money for campaigns. But Rauner, already in campaign mode for his 2018 re-election bid, has been consumed with a battle here at home as he tries to sway public opinion in his corner during a prolonged budget stalemate with Democrats who control the General Assembly. In addition, Trump takes the oath Jan. 20, and Rauner has a State of the State speech scheduled in Springfield five days later. \"The governor is 100 percent focused on Illinois including passing a truly balanced budget and changing our broken political system,\" Rauner's office said Wednesday about the decision to skip the festivities. The governor spent much of last year declining to talk about Trump. As the GOP presidential primary season played out, Rauner pledged to support the party's nominee. Rauner also said he was \"horrified\" by the rhetoric of the campaign. Bruce Rauner praised President-elect Donald Trump 's choice for education secretary Thursday, saying the Michigan billionaire and school voucher proponent is \"a very talented and very passionate education advocate.\" Betsy DeVos , whose husband is an heir to the Amway fortune, was named... Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner praised President-elect Donald Trump 's choice for education secretary Thursday, saying the Michigan billionaire and school voucher proponent is \"a very talented and very passionate education advocate.\" Betsy DeVos , whose husband is an heir to the Amway fortune, was named... (Kim Geiger) Rauner steered clear of a Trump appearance in July in Chicago, having a news conference of his own down the street at the Thompson Center while Trump was raising money at his eponymous hotel. Rauner also skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland when Trump accepted the party's presidential nomination. Since the November election, Rauner has warmed a bit to the president-elect, praising Trump's choice of education secretary and predicting that he will have a \"good relationship\" with the new administration. Still, after the two spoke by phone in the days after the election, Rauner avoided even referring to Trump by name when he recalled that conversation to reporters. Like Trump, Rauner was a political novice when he won the governorship in 2014 after waging a campaign that drew heavily on his background as a successful businessman. But the governor has tried to avoid comparisons between himself and the president-elect. Even when relating his conversation with Trump, Rauner made a point of saying he'd \"never spoken with him before,\" and instead emphasized that he has relationships with unnamed people within the Trump administration.

    "text": "Killer Charles Manson's failing health renews focus on cult murder saga Charles Manson Charles Manson, right, and Susan Atkins, at a Santa Monica courthouse in 1970. Charles Manson, right, and Susan Atkins, at a Santa Monica courthouse in 1970. (Associated Press) Richard Winton , Matt Hamilton and Hailey Branson-Potts Contact Reporters The long saga of Charles Manson , the cult leader whose murder spree more than four decades ago made him a subject of hate, fear, revulsion and fascination, moved to a hospital in downtown Bakersfield this week. Inside Mercy Hospital, Manson was being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding related to his colon, and according to one source with knowledge of his condition, was seriously ill. Manson was rushed there Sunday from Corcoran State Prison, and it remains unclear when his medical treatment will end. Manson, 82, was under heavy security, with officials concerned about the public getting into his room or causing disruptions. TV news crews stationed themselves outside the hospital awaiting word on the killer\u2019s condition. Two California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation vehicles sat at the curb. The scene also drew some onlookers who could be seen roaming outside the hospital, occasionally filming the scene. Manson\u2019s declining health has once again thrust him into the headlines \u2014 where he has appeared with regularity over the years amid his disciplinary problems, romantic engagements and parole hearings. Manson\u2019s grandson, Jason Freeman, told The Times that he had spoken to his grandfather about two weeks ago via telephone and that he seemed to be in good spirits. Freeman, who said his father is Charles Manson Jr., received word via family friends that his grandfather was hospitalized and said that he is trying to petition correctional officials to allow for a visit. \u201cI think at age 82, he\u2019s in pretty good shape. For being 82 and locked up,  he\u2019s kept himself together well physically,\u201d said Freeman, a married father of three who works in construction and Christian ministry in Florida. \u201cOld age is setting in. Nature is taking its course. There will be a day where he doesn\u2019t wake up again.\u201d Manson\u00a0and other members of his so-called family were convicted of killing actress Sharon Tate and six other people during a bloody rampage in the Los Angeles area during two August nights in 1969. Prosecutors said that\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers were trying to incite a race war that he believed was in the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter.\" Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was 8\u00bd\u00a0months pregnant when she was killed at her hilltop home in Benedict Canyon on Aug. 9, 1969. Besides Tate, four others were stabbed and shot to death: Jay Sebring, 35; Voytek Frykowski, 32; Abigail Folger, 25, a coffee heiress; and Steven Parent, 18, a friend of Tate's caretaker. The word \"Pig\" was written on the front door in blood. The next night,\u00a0Manson\u00a0rode along with his followers to the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, then left three members\u00a0to kill the couple. Manson has incurred more than 100 rules violations since 1971.\u00a0Over the years, he has been cited for assault, repeated possession of a weapon, threatening staff and possessing a cellphone, Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department\u00a0of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email Wednesday. \u201cSuffice it to say that he cannot be described as a model prisoner,\u201d she said. In 1982, while Manson was housed at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, prison guards discovered a hacksaw blade, marijuana and LSD in Manson\u2019s cell. Guards said they found other items in the facility that indicated Manson may have been trying to escape, including nylon rope and a catalog\u00a0that showed how to order hot-air balloons. Two years later, Manson was doused with a flammable liquid and set ablaze by a fellow Vacaville inmate, who told guards he attacked Manson in retaliation for threats the cult leader made against him for practicing the Hare Krishna faith. Manson was treated for second- and third-degree burns, and his scalp, hair and beard were singed. In 1985, he\u00a0 tried to smuggle \u00a0a hacksaw blade into San Quentin State Prison in the sole of his shoe, days after being transferred to that facility from Vacaville.\u00a0 During his sixth bid for parole in 1986, he described himself in a hearing as a \u201ccaged, vicious animal\u201d and said he didn\u2019t like to read and preferred to spend his time making dolls in his cell.\u00a0 In the decade between his 1981 and 1992 parole hearings, he accumulated 60 prison violations. Parole transcripts chronicling his prison offenses show that female officers bore the brunt of his verbal abuse. Manson has been housed at Corcoran State Prison since 1989. He has obtained illegal cellphones in the facility at least three times, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In March 2009, prison guards found\u00a0 an LG flip phone hidden \u00a0under Manson\u2019s prison mattress. He made calls and sent text messages to people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia.\u00a0 Recordings of Manson\u2019s raspy, high-pitched voice, broadcast by the entertainment news show \u201cInside Edition,\u201d featured him singing, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the world spinning on fire, I\u2019ve danced and sang in the devil\u2019s choir.\u201d Prison officials found Manson with a\u00a0 second cellphone , equipped with a camera, in January 2011. Manson obtained an illegal cellphone again in 2016, Thornton said.\u00a0 After the last cellphone incident, Manson was punished with the loss of 90 days\u2019 \u201cgood time\u201d credit toward parole, Thornton said.\u00a0 In 2014, Manson and Afton Elaine Burton, a 26-year-old\u00a0Manson devotee,\u00a0were\u00a0 granted a marriage license , but it expired before the two could marry. She had faithfully visited him in prison for seven years.\u00a0 Manson\u2019s next parole hearing is scheduled for 2027, when he will be 92. State prison officials declined this week to discuss Manson\u2019s condition, citing privacy rules. For loved ones of Manson\u2019s victims, the latest twist in the saga has revived old feelings. Tate's sister Debra Tate told the Associated Press she\u2019s waiting to learn more about Manson\u2019s condition. \"I would probably say a prayer for them and shed a tear and ask God to have mercy on their souls, but so far I haven't allowed myself to feel anything because it's unsubstantiated,\" Tate said. \"I'm not allowing myself to feel anything until I know that it's true.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss California's bracing itself for the Trump administration , California's drought looks to be easing as snow piles up in the Sierras , protesters are shutting down Mexico's streets over a sudden spike in gasoline prices , and nationwide, more than 84% of undergraduate computer science majors are men.

Ahead of Pence's press conference with Congressional leadership, the president-elect went on a Twitter rant blaming Democrats for \"massive increases\" in premiums and saying the law will \"fall of its own weight.\" Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Simultaneously, Obama visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill to urge them to defend the law that has provided 20 million Americans with insurance. \"He said, 'Listen, don't mistake my cool demeanor for a lack of outrage. I'm angry just like you are about what has happened in the election and after the election.' And I think you could sense that he, you know, is maybe feeling a little forlorn that he's not going to be in this fight in the way that we are,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on MSNBC after the private meeting. Related: Replacing Obamacare Will Be Difficult, Repealing It Could Be Just as Hard Another source in the room said the president lamented that he will soon be a private citizen because \"I would love to be on the field.\" Republicans began what is expected to be an arduous process of following through on repealing and replacing Obamacare the same day a new Congress was sworn in. Though the GOP will soon control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, they have yet to rally behind a single replacement plan. Pence signaled the first steps the GOP will take is continuing to make the case against the Affordable Care Act, which Democrat Hillary Clinton also pledged to modify during the 2016 campaign.

The worst injury is believed to be a broken leg, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference this morning. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said none of the injuries were life threatening. According to a representative for the New York Fire Department, \"One of the rails actually pierced the bottom of the train ... We are fortunate we didn't have more serious injuries.\" Andrew Gombert/EPA New York City Fire Department personnel treat injured passengers after an accident involving a Long Island Rail Road commuter train at the Atlantic Terminal Station in Brooklyn, New York, Jan. 4, 2017. WABC A Long Island Railroad train derailed in Brooklyn, New York, Jan. 4, 2017. Alex Wroblewski/Reuters Officials investigate after a Long Island Railroad train that derailed at Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, New York City, Jan. 4, 2017. Cuomo said the train hit the track's bumping block. \"When it hit the block, the block knocked it off the tracks,\" he said. \"It was a train that didn't stop when it was supposed to [and] hit the block at a fairly low rate of speed.\" \"As a result of the impact, the lead wheel assembly derailed, as did one additional axle,\" the MTA said in a statement. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Passenger Aaron Neufeld told ABC News, \"It didn't seem like we were going unusually fast ... I don't think it was anything out of the norm.\" He described the impact as a \"substantial jolt.\" He said he was thrown against the seat in front of him. A different passenger told New York ABC station WABC that after she heard a big thump, the scene was total pandemonium, with passengers falling on top of others, screaming and crying. Another woman told WABC she believed the train was traveling at a faster speed than usual right before the crash. About 430 passengers were on the train at the time of the derailment, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The incident happened on LIRR Track 6 around 8:15 a.m, the MTA said. The terminal is near the Barclays Center. WABC A Long Island Railroad train derailed in Brooklyn, New York, Jan. 4, 2017.

Jonathan Oatis/Reuters Emergency vehicles gather at the Atlantic Avenue Terminal after a commuter train derailed, Jan. 4, 2017, in Brooklyn, New York. Cuomo emphasized that today's incident was \"minor\" compared with the crash at Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey on Sept. 29, 2016, which killed one bystander and destroyed part of the historic train terminal. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration are involved in the investigation of this morning's crash. The MTA said there were no delays this morning as a result of the accident. Also today, in Philadelphia, at least 46 people were injured when two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority trolleys crashed. None of the injuries were life-threatening, an authority representative said. One trolley rear-ended the other, SEPTA said. No pedestrians were injured. The cause of that accident is under investigation as well. ABC News' Erin Dooley contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Hobos gang leader Paris Poe's back tattoo that states \"The Earth Is Our Turf\" with \"Hobo\" in the center. (Provided by U.S. attorney) Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A federal jury on Wednesday convicted six reputed leaders of the violent Hobos street gang of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging the gang carried out a slew of killings, kidnappings, robberies and shootings over the course of a decade. After a marathon 15-week trial that featured hundreds of witnesses and four days of closing arguments, the jury deliberated into a sixth day before finding all six defendants guilty of the main racketeering count that carries a sentence of up to life in prison, as well as nine other counts. Among those convicted was Gregory \"Bowlegs\" Chester, the gang's reputed leader who testified in his own defense last month. The jury also convicted alleged gang lieutenants Paris Poe, Arnold Council, Gabriel Bush, Stanley Vaughn and William Ford. As the verdicts were read in U.S. District Judge John Tharp's packed courtroom, Chester sat without expression, his elbow on the defense table and a hand resting on his right cheek. Behind him, Poe frowned and rolled his eyes, dressed in a gray suit and leather loafers with shackles on his ankles visible. Later, when the judge praised the jury for its \"extraordinary service,\" Poe appeared to smirk. Tharp set sentencing for June 23. The trial unfolded as skyrocketing gun violence in Chicago made embarrassing headlines across the country and even became an issue in the recent presidential election. Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump called for federal intervention if local authorities can't get a handle on a homicide rate that in 2016 reached levels not seen in two decades. Prosecutors alleged the Hobos' ruthless use of violence fueled the gang's rise to the top of the city's drug trade. Among the casualties were two gang rivals who had just attended a funeral, a semi-pro basketball player who was slain in a case of mistaken identity, an innocent bystander from Los Angeles visiting relatives and an elderly woman killed in a car crash as police chased a fleeing Hobo member, according to the charges. But the centerpiece of the case was the alleged murders of two informants who were cooperating with law enforcement against the gang. Jurors heard evidence that Poe and Council fatally shot Wilbert \"Big Shorty\" Moore outside a South Side barbershop in 2006 because they believed Moore had provided information to police that led to a raid on a Hobos residence. In April 2013, Poe cut off an electronic monitoring device and ambushed informant Keith Daniels outside his Dolton apartment, according to prosecutors. Dressed in all black and wearing a mask, Poe shot Daniels more than a dozen times in front of his fiancee and two young children as payback for Daniels' cooperation with the FBI in a drug conspiracy case against Chester, the charges alleged. In its verdict, which took nearly 20 minutes for the judge to read in the courtroom, the jury found that each of five murders was conducted by the gang in a \"cold and calculated\" and premeditated manner. The jury also found specifically that Moore and Daniels were killed to keep them from cooperating against the gang. The jury found the six defendants guilty on every count except one lesser charge against Ford of using a gun in furtherance of a gang crime. The verdict came after the jury indicated last week that it may have been deadlocked on at least one count. In a note to the judge after a fourth day of deliberations Thursday, the jury wrote that one person had refused to convict. \"There are some strong beliefs on both sides,\" the note said. Tharp advised jurors to continue deliberating. On the first day of deliberations, one juror had asked to be taken off the jury after he said he'd made up his mind and didn't want to continue. After questioning the juror further, though, Tharp said the man needed to remain on the panel. jmeisner@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Donald Trump, citing Julian Assange, again mocks intelligence officials\u2019 case for Russian hacking Donald Trump President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Wednesday in Palm Beach, Fla. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Wednesday in Palm Beach, Fla. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Noah Bierman and Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Despite Donald Trump \u2019s repeated calls for Americans to \u201cmove on\u201d from Russia\u2019s provocative cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential election, it won\u2019t be so easy \u2014 partly because the president-elect refuses to move on. Trump launched another barrage of mockery at\u00a0U.S. spy agencies Wednesday and aligned himself with Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks, a secretive group that has published millions of stolen U.S. military, diplomatic and intelligence documents. The odd alliance emerged as Congress plans its first hearing Thursday on the Russian election hacks and as U.S. intelligence officials scramble to craft a\u00a0convincing case for the skeptical president-elect and the public\u00a0that Russian intelligence agencies interfered with the election by stealing and leaking emails to WikiLeaks and other websites. On Friday, several top intelligence officials, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper , CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James B. Comey, are scheduled to meet with Trump in New York City to explain why they\u2019ve concluded that senior officials in the Kremlin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , authorized the hacking operation. Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s spokesman, said Wednesday that Trump questions U.S. officials\u2019 judgments about Russian interference in the campaign, and not the intelligence itself. \u201cWhat he wants to hear from them is, how does the raw intelligence justify the conclusion that is being presented?\u201d Spicer said. The intelligence officials also will brief Trump on the broader review that President Obama recently requested on Russian and Chinese hacks during the 2008, 2012 and 2016 U.S. elections and what was learned from those intrusions, two U.S. officials said. They said the classified report is nearly done and may be given to Obama on Thursday. The president\u00a0ordered it completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20 to ensure a full record is available, aides have said. Senior intelligence officials are grappling with how much of the report to make public without exposing sensitive surveillance systems and intelligence assets. They already have blamed two Russian spy services, the GRU and the FSB, for organizing the theft and release of sensitive emails last summer and fall, but haven\u2019t said exactly how they know. \u201cThere\u2019s no debate in the U.S. administration about the fact \u2014 and it is a fact \u2014 that Russia interfered in our democratic election,\u201d a senior U.S. official told reporters in a recent briefing on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe\u2019ve established that clearly to our satisfaction.\u201d New details may emerge Thursday when several of the nation\u2019s top spies \u2014 including Clapper and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, head of the National Security Agency \u2014 testify at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Russian hacks, the first since the November election. The committee chairman, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and many others in Congress are perplexed by Trump\u2019s deriding of the intelligence and by his praise for Putin, who has denied any Russian interference in the U.S. election. \u201cThis was done by the Russians, and I hope by Friday Mr. Trump will come to that realization,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the committee, told CNN. Trump\u2019s open disdain for U.S. intelligence judgments\u00a0has grown in recent weeks after the CIA and others concluded Russian leaders orchestrated the release of thousands of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta , to tip the election in Trump\u2019s favor. He has belittled the conclusions, comparing them to the CIA\u2019s inaccurate claims of Saddam Hussein\u2019s stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. And he questioned the motives of top intelligence officials, complaining Tuesday on Twitter that his briefing \u201con so-called \u2018Russian hacking\u2019 was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\u201d U.S. officials say the briefing was always scheduled for the end of the week, and was not delayed, to take advantage of the classified report prepared for Obama. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted praise for Assange for denying that Russians had provided the stolen emails to WikiLeaks. \u201cRussians did not give him the info!\u201d and \u201ca 14 year old could have hacked Podesta,\" Trump wrote, paraphrasing Assange. Assange made the claim to Fox \u00a0News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired Tuesday.\u00a0Hannity, Trump's biggest supporter in the media, flew to London to meet\u00a0Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has lived in exile for more than four years. \u201cOur source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party,\u201d Assange told Hannity. Assange didn\u2019t address whether Russian authorities conducted the original hacking\u00a0or how he knows Russian authorities were not behind the leaks. Assange remains in exile in the London embassy because he faces sexual assault allegations in Sweden. U.S.\u00a0officials have said Assange is under criminal investigation. The White House challenged Trump for aligning himself with a figure whom many in the U.S. intelligence community consider a threat to national security. \u201cThe president-elect will have to determine who he's going to believe,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cOn one hand, you've got the Russians and the aforementioned Mr. Assange. On the other side, you've got the 17 intelligence agencies of the United States government [and] outside cyber experts that have taken a look at this situation.\u201d Some Democrats all but accused Trump of supporting an enemy of the United States. \u201cThat he would accept the transparently self-serving denials of the Kremlin is alarming enough, but that would now cite people like Assange who have demonstrated universal hostility to the United States and its interests takes him into new and even more treacherous territory,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff of Burbank, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. U.S. intelligence analysts and cybersecurity experts concluded that the Podesta hack was part of a massive\u00a0\u201cspear-phishing\u201d operation that targeted more than 1,000 American politicians, academics and journalists and contained hallmarks of a Russian hacking ring working\u00a0at the behest of the government in Moscow.\u00a0 On Friday, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security released a report outlining some of the evidence pointing to Russia\u2019s role in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and on Clinton\u2019s campaign. At the same time, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats suspected of spying and the closing of two Russian-owned waterfront estates, on Long Island in New York and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, long used by Russian diplomats and believed to be\u00a0harboring spies, in direct response to the cyberattacks. On Wednesday, the State Department said that all 35 Russians had left the country by Sunday with their family members. Many of the children of the expelled officials were invited to the Kremlin\u2019s New Year\u2019s\u00a0 and Christmas parties when they arrived in Moscow on Monday, according to the official Tass news agency.

(Photo: Kent Porter, AP) 12 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE A series of winter storms is forecast to continue hammering California with several feet of heavy\u00a0snow and driving rain over the\u00a0next few days and into the weekend, good news for the drought-plagued state and for ski areas, but potentially bad news for travelers and homeowners worried about floods and mudslides. Meanwhile, a storm could also spread a stripe of snow across the South, all the way from Texas to Virginia, from late Thursday into Saturday. In the West, \"the combination of storms through this weekend has the potential to bring the biggest amount of rain and mountain snow to California since the drought began several years ago,\" according to AccuWeather meteorologist Jim Andrews . Storm total has now reached 4.5 FEET! Taken by #squawvalley patroller Ivan M. this morning #mysquawalpine pic.twitter.com/99MOBoEqJE \u2014 Squaw Alpine (@squawalpine) January 4, 2017 Several feet of snow has already\u00a0fallen in the Sierra Nevada from one storm, and several more feet is on the way from a second, more intense storm that should hit over the weekend. One ski area, Squaw Alpine, has recorded 4.5 feet, according to its Twitter account. Another 10 to 15 feet of snow could bury portions of the Sierra over the next 10 days, according to WeatherBell meteorologist Ryan Maue. Enormous snow totals still modeled:  10-15+feet from warm, very moist series of Atmospheric Rivers down-spouting over Sierra \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) January 4, 2017 Closer to the coast, heavy rain could lead to flooding, mudslides and debris flows in both the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas, the National Weather Service warned. The source of the heavy rain and snow in the West is what meteorologists call an \"atmospheric river,\" which acts like a fire hose to funnel\u00a0moisture from the tropical Pacific\u00a0toward California.

The identities of the four detainees are not immediately known.\u00a0 The transfers are proceeding despite renewed opposition from President-elect Donald Trump, who tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cThere should be no further releases from Gitmo.

McCarthy was fired by Emanuel fired in late 2015 in the aftermath of the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and then-Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, hold a press conference at Chicago Police Headquarters on Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2015. McCarthy was fired by Emanuel fired in late 2015 in the aftermath of the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel opted Wednesday not to get into a war of words over former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy 's comments to \"60 Minutes\" that the Police Department is in crisis and the city in a \"state of lawlessness.\" McCarthy, who was fired by Emanuel in late 2015 in the aftermath of the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video that roiled the city, was featured prominently on a segment that aired Sunday on the CBS news show about Chicago's soaring homicide numbers. \"We're reaching a state of lawlessness. That's what's happening,\" McCarthy said on the program about the city's gun violence and what he said was a feeling among many rank-and-file police officers that the department wouldn't protect them if they were accused of wrongdoing. Asked about those criticisms, the mayor wouldn't take the bait. \"Look, Garry McCarthy, he served five years here in Chicago and I know he is moving on,\" Emanuel said while appearing with police Superintendent Eddie Johnson at a ceremony at police headquarters to highlight a group of newly promoted detectives, lieutenants and field training officers. \"My focus is on the future. ... My view is on making sure 2017 not only is not a repeat of 2016, shows that what happened in 2016 is not the Chicago I know and see,\" Emanuel said. The segment also asserted police officers aren't being proactive enough to combat crime, citing statistics that showed an 80 percent decline in street stops in 2016. Emanuel, who in fall 2015 said police had gone \"fetal\" because they feared getting in trouble for actions during arrests, didn't directly respond to that contention. ",

Repeal Obamacare. Not everyone will be covered. His health care plan, released online in March, had far more in common with the kind of boilerplate health care proposals the rest of the Republican party touts than his earlier praise for Canada suggested it might. It would likely cause 21 million people to lose their health insurance and cost about $270 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan budget advocacy group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). It offers up unspecified amounts of grants to states to replace Medicaid, but it's not clear how or what those would look like, or how they would cover the millions of people that Trump's plan lets fall through the cracks. CRFB noted that block grants \"could generate a wide range of savings\" to the federal budget, but without details on them, it is \"impossible to score any savings\" from his plan. 6. I do want to keep parts of it, we might just amend it. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he would be OK with amending Obamacare instead of fully repealing it. He also indicated that he wanted to keep the protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, and the measure that allows parents to keep their children insured until age 26. \"Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\" Trump said in November in one of his first interviews as the president-elect. If they do repeal it, he said there would be no gap between the repeal of Obamacare and the replacement of it with something else. 7. Begin to repeal on day one. Vice President-elect Mike Pence told Congressional Republicans that Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare would begin day one . It's unclear, however, what if any plan there is for a replacement bill. 8. 'Be careful' -- don't take the blame! massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Shortly after Pence indicated that repeal efforts were in the works, Trump warned Republicans to \"be careful\" about taking on the bill -- and its liabilities -- arguing that it would \"fall on its own weight.\" Jane C.

    "text": "By Juliet Eilperin , Amy Goldstein and Kelsey Snell January 4 at 6:49 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @goldsteinamy Follow @kelsey_snell Congressional Republicans on Wednesday launched their long-promised effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even as they acknowledged that they may need several months to develop a replacement along conservative lines. Signifying how enormous a priority the issue is for the incoming administration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence met privately to discuss it with House and Senate Republicans. He offered no details afterward about what a new health-care law might look like but vowed to unwind the existing one through a mixture of executive actions and legislation. Meanwhile, President Obama made a rare Capitol Hill appearance, meeting behind closed doors with Democrats from both chambers. He urged members of his party not to help the GOP devise a new health-care law. The dueling high-level visits, on the same day that the Senate opened debate on a budget resolution that would begin rolling back the law, highlighted the sharp political fault lines that surround the future of the government\u2019s health policies. The president, who was accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) as he entered the Capitol, took no questions from reporters before or after the nearly two-hour meeting. But participants said he told members of his party that they did not have to \u201crescue\u201d Republicans and that they should \u201cstay strong\u201d as the GOP strives to replace the law. (Reuters) Pence told reporters that he and Trump would pursue a \u201ctwo-track approach\u201d to chip away at the ACA through executive powers and legislation. Trump is \u201cworking on a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place,\u201d Pence said, and is eyeing other policies that can be reversed. [ With Obamacare, GOP faces the \u2018Pottery Barn rule\u2019: You break it, you own it ] While Pence did not identify other policy targets, Republicans from Western states urged him Wednesday to undo some of the public land protections Obama has created through the 1906 Antiquities Act. Other executive actions, including those providing new safeguards for LGBT Americans and curbing greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change, also could come under fire. According to a lobbyist in touch with congressional aides on the ACA issue, the Trump transition team has been considering ways to strip down the health benefits that insurers must provide in plans that they sell to individuals and small businesses. This list of \u201cessential health benefits\u201d was envisioned by the law but was defined in a regulation written by the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, the incoming administration could alter it without help from Congress. [ Why Obamacare is unlikely to die a swift death ] Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to urge Republicans to \u201cbe careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster.\u201d In a dig at Schumer and his allies, Trump added: \u201cDon\u2019t let the Schumer clowns out of this web.\u201d Less than half an hour after Trump\u2019s social media messages, Schumer tweeted: \u201cRepublicans should stop clowning around with America\u2019s health care. Don\u2019t #MakeAmericaSickAgain.\u201d Schumer and other Democrats echoed Obama, saying they did not feel any responsibility to craft a substitute health-care bill. \u201cIf you are repealing, show us what you\u2019ll replace it with. Then we\u2019ll look at what you have and see what you can do,\u201d said Schumer, who met briefly with Pence on Wednesday. (Reuters) White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Obama told Democrats that they are well positioned to defend the law, which has extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans. However, Obama also told lawmakers that he recognized that he had not succeeded in selling the law to the public. \u201cThere was an acknowledgment that so many features were so popular, but there was a failure to communicate that,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. [ Donald Trump, meet your toughest hurdle: The U.S. Senate ] Pence, who was greeted by applause as he entered the House GOP meeting with Reince Priebus, Kelly Anne Conway and several other future White House aides, made it clear that Trump, starting on the first day of his presidency, intended to embark on an aggressive campaign to reverse executive actions made by Obama. \u201cThey didn\u2019t enumerate a list, just that which came by the pen can die by the pen,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.). The first bill Republicans introduced in the new Senate that convened Tuesday was budget legislation with instructions for House and Senate committees to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. The bare-bones spending outline requires members of four committees \u2014 Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce in the House; and Finance, as well as Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in the Senate \u2014 to produce bills just seven days after Trump\u2019s inauguration that each would save $1\u00a0billion over a decade by slashing elements of the heath-care law. [ Democrats: Trump will make America sick again ] House Republicans tasked with writing the repeal legislation said that no final decisions have been made on what it will include. Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio) who chairs a House subcommittee that oversees health care, called the incoming administration\u2019s Jan. 27 deadline \u201ca challenging goal.\u201d Among the unanswered questions is whether Republicans will immediately end health-care taxes, such as an additional 0.9\u00a0percent Medicare payroll tax and a 3.8 percent investment income tax, that were created to help pay for the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans have insisted that the taxes should be eliminated immediately, even if lawmakers decide to delay the repeal of other parts of the law. Others worry that repealing the taxes will make it impossible to pay to keep Obamacare afloat while a replacement is finished. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet,\u201d Tiberi said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not consensus on this.\u201d Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a member the Trump transition team, said in an interview that \u201cwe have six months to work out the replacement plan\u201d for the sweeping health-care law. Senate rules allow budget resolutions to pass by a simple majority \u2014 a maneuver that guarantees that the chamber\u2019s Democratic minority will not have enough votes for a filibuster to block repeal. Only changes related to taxes, spending or the long-term federal budget are eligible for the simple-majority treatment, however. Other parts of the law, such as the structure of the insurance marketplaces, probably would require a veto-proof margin of 60 votes in the Senate, a trickier task since the new Senate has 52 Republicans. (The Washington Post) Since its passage by Congress in the spring of 2010 \u2014 entirely with Democratic votes \u2014 the ACA has spurred the most significant changes to U.S. health policy since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid during the Great Society legislation of the 1960s. It also has faced sustained opposition from Republicans, leading to two Supreme Court cases and a lawsuit over cost-sharing subsidies that is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The ACA is best known for having expanded insurance coverage, starting in 2014, in two ways: new marketplaces selling private health plans to Americans who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job, and an expansion of Medicaid in about three-fifths of the states. The marketplaces got off to a shaky start because of computer dysfunction with HealthCare.gov, the federal enrollment website. [ Trump just met with super-influential health-care executives you\u2019ve probably never heard of ] Three years later, the U.S. Census reported that the nation\u2019s uninsured rate had declined to 9.1 percent , with most of a recent decrease coming from people who bought insurance on their own and more who had joined Medicaid. The president\u2019s visit to the Hill was part of a broader, last-ditch effort by his administration to preserve a central element of his domestic legacy. On Wednesday morning, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) drew attention to the stakes for his state by issuing a county-by-county breakdown of the estimated 2.7\u00a0million New Yorkers who would lose coverage if the law were repealed. He pointed out that New York would lose $595\u00a0million this year in federal money that has helped the state expand its Medicaid program. HHS officials have been trying to use to their advantage the fact that the change in administrations will take place while the fourth year\u2019s enrollment period for ACA health plans is underway. On Wednesday, HHS released HealthCare.gov enrollment figures showing that 8.8\u00a0million Americans chose or were automatically re-enrolled in ACA health plans between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 in the 39 states that rely on the federal exchange website. That is about 200,000 more than at the same time a year ago, although the proportion of new customers was lower. The new drive to unwind the health-care law will take time. Senate leaders must allow Democrats to offer a nearly unlimited number of amendments before a final budget vote. Democrats plan to use the process, known as a \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d to offer a long string of potentially toxic amendments that could make it difficult for Republicans to vote for the final legislation, Democratic leadership aides said. Mike DeBonis, Ed O\u2019Keefe, Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report. ",
