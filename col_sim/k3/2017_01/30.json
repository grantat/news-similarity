    "text": "Koch Brothers' Network Says Trump Immigration Ban Likely \u2018Counterproductive\u2019 By Liz Kreutz INDIAN WELLS, California \u0097 Jan 29, 2017, 4:35 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump's Frenzied First Week in Office 0 Shares Email Add the Koch brothers \u2019 network to the list of those questioning President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order on immigration. In a statement released Sunday, an official for the political network led by the Republican billionaires, said the organization believes Trump\u2019s ban on immigration from seven predominately Muslim countries will likely be \u201ccounterproductive.\ufffd? \"We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\ufffd? Brian Hooks, who oversees the Koch network\u2019s bi-annual seminars, said. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. \"Our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies,\ufffd? he added. On Saturday, as demonstrations broke out at airports across the country in response to Trump\u2019s immigration executive order, roughly 550 of the Koch brothers\u2019 top donors gathered near Palm Springs, California, for their network\u2019s winter seminar. Officials for the network told reporters they were encouraged by some of what they've seen so far from the new administration, but that it's too soon to say for certain. They pointed to Trump's regulatory reforms, his executive order on the Keystone pipeline, and some of his Cabinet appointments as areas where the Koch network is hopeful. \u201cThere\u2019s been some good things, for sure,\ufffd? Mark Holden, a top official for the network, told reporters of Trump\u2019s first full week in office. Such optimism is a shift from the Koch brothers\u2019 critical view of Trump during the campaign. The controversial political donors did not spend any money on the then-Republican nominee, focusing instead on supporting down-ballot races. The immigration ban was not a major topic of conversation here at the palm tree-filled oasis, however. Charles Koch didn't mention it during remarks at the opening reception, nor was it a topic of discussion during the post-dinner panel with Republican Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, and Mike Lee, R-Utah. Instead, the focus was on issues like health care and tax reform. Proud of how they did in races this past November, the network announced plans to be even more aggressive in their spending next cycle, as they hope to maintain control of the House and Senate. According to a spokesperson, the Koch network will spend between $300 and 400 million dollars on politics and policy during the 2018 races, up from $250 million in 2016. \"We had by far the most productive year in the history of this network,\" Charles Koch told donors about this past cycle. \"We're just getting started.\" 0 Shares ",

Got it President Trump signs an executive order Friday at the Pengagon that temporarily bans people from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the United States. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) By Greg Miller and Missy Ryan By Greg Miller and Missy Ryan January 29 at 6:35 PM Follow @gregpmiller Follow @missy_ryan Though cast as measures meant to make the country safe, the Trump administration\u2019s moves during its first week in office are more likely to weaken the counterterrorism defenses the United States has erected over the past 16 years, several current and former U.S. officials said. Through inflammatory rhetoric and hastily drawn executive orders, the administration has alienated allies, including Iraq, provided propaganda fodder to terror networks that frequently portray U.S. involvement in the Middle East as a religious crusade, and endangered critical cooperation from often hidden U.S. partners \u2014 whether the leader of a mosque in an American suburb or the head of a Middle East intelligence service. An executive order \u2014 issued Friday and titled \u201c Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States \u201d \u2014 bans entry to people from a list of Muslim-majority nations including Iraq, where U.S. military and intelligence agencies have for years relied on cooperation from Iraqi and Kurdish authorities, not to mention thousands of individual translators and contractors. \u201cUltimately, we fear this executive order will become a self- inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\u201d Republican Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) said Sunday in a statement. \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d [ Trump redefines the enemy and 15 years of counterterrorism policy ] (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Already, supporters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, quickly claimed the travel ban as a victory. Postings on social- media sites linked to the terrorist group predicted that President Trump\u2019s order would galvanize Muslims and claimed that it showed that the United States is at war with Islam. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In tweets Sunday, Trump said, \u201cThe joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d Separately, in a statement, Trump said the \u201cseven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,\u201d and he noted that Obama had barred refugees from Iraq for six months in 2011. Trump\u2019s inauguration vow to put America first and \u201conly America\u201d rattled allies. A leaked draft of an order on U.S. detention policies compounded those concerns by raising the prospect of rebuilding the CIA\u2019s network of notorious \u201cblack site\u201d prisons around the world. The immigration measures imposed late Friday were seen by U.S counterterrorism officials and analysts as particularly counterproductive and poorly conceived. \u201cThe whole order is and will be read as another anti-Islam, anti-Muslim action by this president and his administration,\u201d said Paul Pillar, a former top official in the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. \u201cIt is not targeted at where the threat is, and the anti-Islam message that it sends is more likely to make America less safe.\u201d Absent from the Trump list: Saudi Arabia or any of the other countries connected to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Nor does the president\u2019s action limit travel from Pakistan, where al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership still resides. Former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said that the order and other possible measures have likely forced U.S. diplomats, military commanders and agency station chiefs abroad into damage-control mode. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good people who will work hard at it, but there is no question that this has already created an irretrievable cost,\u201d Hayden said. The refu\u00adgee order \u201cinarguably has made us less safe. It has taken draconian measures against a threat that was hyped. The by-product is it feeds the jihadist narrative and makes it harder for our allies to side with us.\u201d Despite acute concerns about the impact overseas, analysts said much of the damage may happen in the United States. Counterterrorism officials have for years cast the successful integration of Muslims in the United States as a major security advantage over countries in Europe, where Muslims are more likely to be isolated and marginalized. Those who study extremism fear that the sense of belonging among U.S. Muslims may begin to fray, increasing the likelihood that a U.S. citizen or resident becomes radicalized, and complicates the already-difficult task for the FBI and local authorities to cultivate relationships with Muslim community leaders. \u201cIt was already an uphill climb,\u201d said Seamus Hughes, a former National Counterterrorism Center official who frequently traveled the country to meet with Muslim community members after terrorist attacks. [ A raid in Yemen leads to the first combat death of the Trump era ] Tips to the FBI or local police from concerned parents, religious leaders and concerned Muslim citizens have been \u201cthe lifeblood of most terrorism investigations\u201d in the United States, said Hughes, who is now at George Washington University. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone hesitating to report an imminent threat,\u201d he said, but adding, \u201cI can\u2019t see these orders as helping.\u201d Marcel Lettre, who oversaw intelligence matters at the Pentagon until earlier this month, said the new measures could impact decisions by allies in Europe or the Middle East, possibly affecting intelligence-sharing and law enforcement cooperation. \u201cThe political and policy environment might make it such that their publics will insist that they distance themselves from us in terms of tight partnering,\u201d Lettre said. \u200b But Rep. Devin Nunes (R- Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, \u201cIn light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe\u2019s tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration\u2019s executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland.\u201d In terms of overseas partnerships, no relationship has been placed under more immediate strain than that of the United States and Iraq. Trump used his speech at CIA headquarters on his first day in office to declare that it was a mistake for the United States not to have seized Iraq\u2019s oil reserves after the U.S. invasion in 2003, and to hint that there might be another chance to do so. The executive order sparked confusion and condemnation in Baghdad. Iraqis who had worked with the U.S. military for years, often at great risk, were among the first people affected by the regulations. Even before the new measures were issued, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters that his country\u2019s oil \u201cis for Iraqis.\u201d The comment also explicitly confirmed widely held suspicions in the Middle East of U.S. geopolitical motivations. \u201cIt\u2019s about oil and it\u2019s a plot to destroy Islam,\u201d said Dan Byman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. \u201cIf you want to combine conspiracy theories, [Trump] is doing a good job.\u201d Iraqi lawmakers over the weekend insisted that Iraq impose similar measures on the United States. Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Shiite cleric, called the decision to block Iraqi entry while Americans still come and go, \u201carrogance,\u201d and he demanded that U.S. nationals leave the country. Iraqis also have questioned the omission from the travel ban of certain Gulf and North Africa countries, whose nationals have been involved in high-profile terrorist attacks Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for Abadi, said that the U.S. security partnership with Iraq, including American support for operations against the Islamic State and a robust arms sales program, should make the relationship with Iraq different from other countries on the list. The new measures take place as the Pentagon continues to rely closely on Iraq in its campaign to defeat the Islamic State. More than 6,000 U.S. troops are now stationed in the country, advising Iraqi forces during a major battle in Mosul, the militant-held northern city. The decision undermines Abadi, straddled between a Western ally whose support he needs to fight militants and Shiite political peers who view the U.S. presence with hostility. Lukman Faily, who served as the Iraqi ambassador in Washington until last year, said that Abadi would try to draw a distinction between Iraq\u2019s security partnership with the United States and the perceived snub contained in Trump\u2019s new order \u201cIt will certainly put the prime minister in the most awkward position,\u201d Faily said. \u201cIt will not help him navigate his politics while he\u2019s completing [a major battle] and while he has an oil crisis to deal with.\u201d Hadithi sought to stress the temporary nature of the order. \u201cWe will have a discussion with the American side,\u201d Hadithi said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only for a short time to reorganize their visa and refugees work, we will understand it and take it positively.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear, however, whether the 90-day period stipulated in the executive order will be extended.

    "text": "WATCH President Trump's Travel Ban Creates Uproar, Draws Protests 0 Shares Email Congressman and Iraq War veteran Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said that President Donald Trump 's executive order on immigration and refugees amounts to \"a Muslim ban,\" despite the administration's assertions that the order aims solely to keep the country safe. \"What he's doing with this Muslim ban just is so wrong and un-American, you see why so many Americans across the country are rising up against it,\" the Democratic representative told ABC News' Martha Raddatz on \"This Week.\" When Raddatz noted, \"They will tell you again and again, it is not a Muslim ban,\" Moulton replied, \"There's no question what's going on here. We're not stupid. We see what Trump is up to.\" On Saturday, Moulton tweeted to President Trump: \"Your #MuslimBan is completely at odds with our most fundamental value: freedom. I'm ashamed that you are our president.\" Moulton also said he believes that Trump's new defense secretary, ret. Gen. James Mattis, does not support the executive order. The order signed Friday immediately suspends immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia , Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for 90 days. It also ends for 120 days the entry of any refugees into the U.S., and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees . \"You know, I worked for Gen. Mattis. I know him,\" said Moulton, who as a lieutenant in the U.S. Marines served four tours in Iraq , including two as special assistant to Gen. David Petraeus . Moulton also worked to gain asylum in the U.S. for an Iraqi interpreter who risked his life working with Moulton and fellow U.S. service members. \"There is no way in hell that he is supportive of this,\" the congressman said of Mattis. \"He relied on translators for his life, just like I did. He understands what it means to put your life in the hands of an Iraqi or an Afghan. And he also knows that implicit in that is that they put their lives in our hands, as well, and now we're abandoning them.\" Mattis along with Vice President Mike Pence stood at Trump's side when the president signed the order Friday. Moulton added that he believes the executive order is an indication that Mattis and another former high-ranking military officer in the administration, ret. Gen. John Kelly, the new secretary of homeland security , \"don't have a voice in the Trump administration, that Trump is just doing things for political gain, not in the best interests of our national security .\" The Democratic Massachusetts representative predicted the executive order will be used by terror groups as a recruiting tool and that it won't make the U.S. safer. \"It's fundamentally un-American, and it's also making America less safe. And that's something that Americans need to understand today, is that what Trump is doing is harming our national security. It will incite attacks against us. ISIS is already using this ban as propaganda. And it will prevent us from being able to get the allies that are so critical in our war against terror,\" Moulton said on \"This Week.\" 0 Shares ",

By Joby Warrick By Joby Warrick January 29 at 6:13 PM Follow @jobywarrick Jihadist groups on Sunday celebrated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying the new policy validates their claim that the United States is at war with Islam. Comments posted to pro-Islamic State social media accounts predicted that President Trump\u2019s executive order would persuade American Muslims to side with the extremists. One posting hailed the U.S. president as \u201cthe best caller to Islam,\u201d while others predicted that Trump would soon launch a new war in the Middle East. \u201c[Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi has the right to come out and inform Trump that banning Muslims from entering America is a \u2018blessed ban,\u2019\u201d said one posting to a pro-Islamic State channel on Telegram, a social-media platform. The writer compared the executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a \u201cblessed invasion\u201d that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world. [ Trump promised disruption. That\u2019s what he\u2019s delivering ] Several postings suggested that Trump was fulfilling the predictions of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American born al-Qaeda leader and preacher who famously said that the \u201cWest would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. \u201cWhen U.S. President Donald Trump says \u2018We don\u2019t want them here\u2019 and bans the Muslim immigrants from Muslim countries, there is one thing that comes to our mind,\u201d said another posting, beneath a banner of al-Awlaki and his quote. Another posting on the Telegram channel \u201cAbu Magrebi\u201d said Trump\u2019s actions \u201cclearly revealed the truth and harsh reality behind the American government\u2019s hatred toward Muslims.\u201d Leaders of the Islamic State speak frequently of their intention to drive a wedge between Western governments and their Muslim populations, and have welcomed outside help \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 in fulfilling that goal. In a 2015 essay in the Islamic State\u2019s English-language magazine Dabiq, the group said that its motivation for launching terrorist attacks in Europe was to provoke an anti-Muslim backlash that would force ambivalent Muslims to enlist with them. \u201cJihadists would have to argue to lengths that Obama, Bush, and others held anti-Islam agendas and hated the religion \u2014 not just radical terrorists,\u201d said Rita Katz, founder of the SITE Intelligence Group, a private organization that monitors jihadist websites. \u201cTrump, however, makes that argument a lot easier for them to sell to their followers.\u201d [ Top Republicans fret about ban\u2019s execution, possible consequences ] The reaction to the ban from Islamic State sympathizers came as current and former U.S. officials also expressed concern that the temporary ban would undermine the global fight against violent Islamic militants. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he worried about the ban\u2019s impact on Muslim troops fighting alongside Americans to destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \u201cThe effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, using an acronym for the Islamic State. Robert Richer, a 35-year CIA veteran and former chief of the agency\u2019s Near East division, said the ban was a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that could undermine future efforts to recruit spies and collect vital information about terrorists and their plans. How, he asked, can CIA officers persuade Iraqi and Syrian nationals to risk their lives to help the United States? \u201cThis was a win for jihadists and other anti-U.S. forces,\u201d said Richer, the deputy chief of the agency\u2019s Operations Directorate during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIt fuels the belief out there that Americans are anti-Islam.

Trump took steps Saturday to begin restructuring the White House National Security Council, adding the senior adviser to the principals committee, which includes the secretaries of state and defense. At the same time, Trump said his director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would attend \"where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\" Bannon served in the Navy before attending Harvard Business School, working at Goldman Sachs, starting his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm and later heading the ultraconservative outlet Breitbart News, which has been condemned for featuring racist, sexist and anti-Semitic content. \"He is a former naval officer. He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told ABC's \"This Week.\" Spicer said \"having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings who has a significant military background to help make -- guide what the president's final analysis is going to be is crucial.\" But to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the NSC \"sadly has some really questionable people on it,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing Bannon among them. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Bannon's appointment \"a radical departure from any National Security Council in history.\" He told \"Face the Nation\" on CBS: \"The role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been diminished, I understand, with this reorganization. One person who is indispensable would be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in my view. So, it's of concern, this `reorganization.\"' \u00a0 ",

Stephanie Keith/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Protestors rally during a demonstration against the new immigration ban issued by President Donald Trump at John F. Kennedy International Airport on January 28, 2017 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images By the time the sun rose on Sunday in the U.S., the chaotic weekend set in motion by Trump's executive order on immigration was beginning to give way to greater clarity \u2014 in some respects, at least. That order \u2014 which temporarily bars citizens from seven largely Muslim countries, as well as all refugees, from entering the U.S. \u2014 was blocked in part by a federal judge in Brooklyn on Saturday night. Judge Ann Donnelly issued a stay that would temporarily prevent federal agents from deporting anyone who entered the U.S. with a valid visa. Two additional federal district courts have issued restraining orders regarding President Trump's executive order on immigration. The orders, from Virginia and Massachusetts district courts, are effective for seven days. Trump, for his part, tweeted an ardent defense of his immigration freeze Sunday. Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Meanwhile at major international airports, both across the U.S. and around the world, that decision did little to ease the maelstrom of protests, outraged politicians and lawyers scrambling to offer legal help to refugees who had been blocked or detained. Article continues after sponsorship From the scenes at airports and the impact on families to reactions from foreign leaders \u2014 here is what we know Sunday. The Detainees And Deportees Trump's executive order bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan \u2014 including those who hold green cards as legal permanent residents of the U.S. That last detail came as a surprise to Hessam Noorian and his wife, who were detained for more than five hours with their 6-month-old son at Chicago's O'hare Airport. She is a citizen; he has a green card. They had been returning from a trip to Iran when they heard President Trump might ban travel by refugees, the couple told NPR's David Schaper. \"But I didn't know this applied to green card. I thought as long as you have green card, then you're are safe, you are fine,\" she said.

Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators protest against President Trump's executive immigration ban at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on January 28, 2017. Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images After they had been questioned and searched by authorities, they were released. Others, like a traveler from Iraq who spoke with NPR's Jeff Brady, remain less certain. His wife said he was detained at Philadelphia International Airport. A half-day later, as she spoke with Jeff, she had still not been able to reach him to learn what had happened. At the same airport, federal authorities deported two families from Syria despite legal paperwork to enter the U.S. \"Banning immigrants and refugees is not only unjustifiably cruel, it also puts Americans at home and serving abroad at great risk,\" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement. \"The Trump administration very well may have just given these families a death sentence.\" In Seattle, lawyers \"were able to spare at least two people placed on a departure flight back out of the U.S.,\" reports Liz Jones of member station KUOW. \"But at least one refugee from Somalia was deported.\" Sara Assali of Allentown, Pa., told Bobby Allyn of WHYY that she had been expecting six members of her Orthodox Christian family from Damascus, Syria, on Saturday. That reunion had been 14 years in coming, Assali said, and all six had finally obtained their visas in 2015. But Assali said U.S. Customs and Border Patrol detained her family members and told them they would need to fly instead to Doha, Qatar, or risk losing green cards and visas. \"We weren't expecting this because we paid everything. The green cards have been paid for, the visas have been paid for, everything has been approved,\" Assali said. \"To suddenly be told, 'No, you no longer qualify to enter the country,' it kind of comes as a slap in the face.' \" The Protests And Political Backlash By the end of Saturday, protesters had gathered outside several airports and inside baggage claims to register their objection to Trump's executive order. Mayor Marty Walsh addressed the demonstrators outside Boston's Logan International Airport, asking them to \"join us\" and \"stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters.\" We\u2019ll fight today, and we\u2019ll fight tomorrow. Join us at 1 p.m. on Sunday at Copley Square. pic.twitter.com/zrH3cd2eXl \u2014 Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) January 29, 2017 At New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport, where The Associated Press reports 12 refugees were detained Saturday, the protests assembled early in the day and gathered momentum by nightfall. \"I never thought I'd see the day when refugees, who have fled war-torn countries in search of a better life, would be turned away at our doorstep,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement supporting the demonstrators. \"This is not who we are, and not who we should be.\" Demonstrators protest against President Trump's executive immigration ban at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on January 28, 2017.

Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images The international airport in Charlotte, N.C., drew protesters on Saturday, as well. The demonstrations there grew more acrimonious than most, as six people were arrested after police and protesters \"engaged in a brief skirmish,\" reports Nick de la Canal of member station WFAE. But the Rev. Jay McKinnon, an organizer of the Charlotte protests who spoke to de la Canal, said he would not be dissuaded from further protest. Trump is \"doing what he said he would do,\" McKinnon said Saturday. \"It's a resistance to that \u2014 to his policies, to him thinking that this is okay in our name.\" Reaction Beyond U.S. Borders Initially, British Prime Minister Theresa May was noncommittal in her judgment of the executive order. On a diplomatic trip in Turkey on Saturday, May deferred to Trump, telling reporters only that \"the United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.\" Overnight, however, the line from 10 Downing Street drew a slightly sharper contrast. \"Immigration policy in the United States is a matter for the government of the United States, just the same as immigration policy for this country should be set by our government,\" her office said through a spokesperson, according to The Guardian . \"But we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.\" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, speaking at a news conference in Paris, \"questioned how such orders could be imposed by a country that embraces Christian values like the U.S.,\" NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. Still stronger rebukes came from the countries listed on Trump's immigration freeze. \"President Trump is dealing with Iraq as if the U.S. had no relationship with the country,\" Razaq al-Haidari, a member of Iraq's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told NPR's Alice Fordham. \"When in fact the US leads an anti-ISIS coalition working to improve Iraq's armed forces and thousands of American soldiers, officials and advisers are operating there.\" Others in Iraq took an even harder line, Alice reports. \"A spokesman of a powerful bloc of paramilitary forces says all Americans should now be banned from Iraq, and all Americans in Iraq should be deported,\" Alice says. Where Do We Go From Here? The temporary stay issued by the federal judge in Brooklyn appears to cover as many as 200 people across the country, NPR's Carrie Johnson reports. But that stay, which addresses only those who traveled to the U.S. before the immigration freeze was enacted, means only that they cannot be deported immediately. Carrie breaks it down: \"Judge Ann Donnelly found that sending the travelers home could cause them irreparable harm to the refugees and no harm to the us government. The judge didn't make a broad ruling about the constitutional claims in the case.\" The Department of Homeland Security says that it intends to continue enforcing the order, and that it retains the right to revoke visas. But advocate groups have vowed to escalate the fight against the executive order in court. ",

    "text": "(Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell) \"I don't want to criticize them for improving vetting,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC's \"This Week.\" He cautioned that the United States doesn't have a religious test for entry into the country, and he stopped short of saying that Trump's action amounted to a Muslim ban. \"I think we need to be careful,\" McConnell said. \"We don't have religious tests in this country.\" The Department of Homeland Security noted that \"less than one percent\" of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \"inconvenienced\" by the executive order - though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Federal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of Trump's action flooded courtrooms. A federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in California, Virginia, Seattle and Boston. Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigration and to impose what became known as his \"Muslim ban,'' remained unbowed Sunday. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it. Just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \"Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!\" Kelsey Snell, Abby Phillip Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., on Sunday cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country but stopped short of rejecting President Donald Trump 's order to halt the admission of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. McConnell... Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., on Sunday cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country but stopped short of rejecting President Donald Trump 's order to halt the admission of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. McConnell... (Kelsey Snell, Abby Phillip) Later in the morning, Trump tweeted, \"Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\" Many Americans agreed with Trump. \"He doesn't hate Muslims,\" said Kelley Anne Finn of Manassas, Virginia, who was interviewed at Dulles airport Sunday. \"He doesn't hate anybody. He's trying to protect us.\" Administration officials said Sunday that they think it is possible for the White House to both comply with a judge's order and continue enforcing Trump's executive action. Their thinking is that the court order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the court order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place. The officials pointed out that while the order affects deportations, the travelers stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States. That interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo. As Sunday wore on, it became clear that the answers to those questions would have to wait until another day. The protesters outside the White House pushed on, wielding poster boards with messages such as \"Islamophobia is un-American\" and \"Dissent is patriotic,\" chanting \"No justice! No peace!\" and singing renditions of \"This Land is Your Land.\" And in airports from Baltimore to Bangor, from Dallas to Denver, shouts of \"Let them go!\" and \"Let them in!\" reverberated Sunday. In many cities, demonstrators invoked the same chant: \"No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here.\" --- The Washington Post's Philip Bump in New York, Daniel Gross in Boston, and Michael Chandler, Steve Hendrix, Jenna Johnson, Sarah Larimer, Michael Laris, Ellen Nakashima, Ed O'Keefe, Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell, Elise Viebeck and David Weigel in Washington contributed to this report.

The American Civil Liberties Union, assisted by immigration and refugee groups, have successfully brought multiple suits forward to curb Trump's executive order that restricts the access of travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations \u2014 Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \"We have been able to curb the immediate and disturbing consequences of an unconstitutional and unconscionable executive order,\" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. The original ruling against the executive order came from a federal judge in New York who said that those who arrived in the United States legally from the seven nations could not be deported. This applied to visa and green card holders alike and is a nationwide injunction. Related: Merkel: Terror Fight Does Not Justify Trump Immigration Ban The ACLU with the help of refugee and immigrant rights groups in Massachusetts and Virginia were able to gain additional footholds beyond the baseline order made in New York. In Boston, two federal judges placed a restraining order on Trump's travel ban that will last for at least seven days. In Virginia, lawyers earned the right to meet with detainees and the DHS and Customs and Border Protection were forbidden from deporting legal immigrants for a week. The Trump administration and the Department of Homeland Security pushed back on the rulings. A senior White House official said Sunday that the president had the right and Constitutional power to enact the order. According to the official, the judge's decision changed nothing. \"All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited,\" the official said. \"The executive order is a vital action toward strengthening America's borders, and therefore sovereignty. The order remains in place.\" With the federal judges' ruling appearing to conflict with the executive order, uncertainty and chaos continued across the nation as lawyers sought access to those detained at airports and reports rolled in that Customs and Border Patrol agents were not abiding by the federal ruling.

It\u2019s out of our hands, the officers said. Their fate was up to their superiors. Passengers were afraid to talk to one another, Moosavizadeh said. No one knew whether they\u2019d be released or sent back to Iran. \u201cMost of them, they thought they were going to get deported,\u201d she said, through her son. At one point, she was taken elsewhere for questioning. Customs officers asked her when she last visited the U.S., who she lives with in Iran and where she gets her income. When she returned, she snacked on almonds she\u2019d packed in her purse. \u201cThank God I put them in my purse, otherwise I didn\u2019t have anything on me,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, in Phoenix, her sons frantically refreshed news articles and peppered her grandson, Siavosh Naji-Talakar, with questions he couldn\u2019t answer. Huddled among\u00a0throngs of boisterous protesters demanding the detainees be released,\u00a0Naji-Talakar could do little but wait.\u00a0 Over and over, they chanted, \u201cLet them in!\u201d They said they\u00a0wouldn\u2019t leave otherwise.\u00a0 Some offered Naji-Talakar food and a couch for the night, others money for a hotel room. Nearby, the detainees heard the cries, faintly. They had no idea, though, if those who had gathered were there to support or decry them. A customs officer, Moosavizadeh said, told the group that it wasn\u2019t safe for them to let them go. Eventually, officers began calling passengers one by one. Detainees were taken away, alone or in pairs, while those left behind wondered if they were being released or deported. \u00a0 \u201cWe all thought they were going to give us hard time first and then send us back,\u201d Moosavizadeh said. She added that she wants Trump to know that Muslims condemn Islamic State. \u201cThey might be Muslim, but they\u2019re not a part of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all brothers and sisters and we don\u2019t believe in their values \u2014 at all.\u201d Protesters rally against President Trump's new immigration order. Moosavizadeh\u2019s name was among the last ones called, at about 1 a.m.\u00a0 Finally, she said, she was \u201creleased from prison.\u201d When she spotted her grandson in the crowd, she felt like she was flying.\u00a0 He saw her too,\u00a0and bolted. \u201cI pushed people out of the way, I was like, \u2018Get out of my way,\u2019\u201d Naji-Talakar said. \u201cI ran up to her and gave a big old hug.\u201d That\u2019s when the cheering and chanting started again.

Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images Switzerland's Roger Federer serves against Spain's Rafael Nadal during the men's singles final on day 14 of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on January 29, 2017. Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images Roger Federer won his 18th Grand Slam title and put some extra distance on the all-time list between himself and Rafael Nadal, the man he beat 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in a vintage Australian Open final on Sunday night. It was the 35-year-old Federer's first major title since Wimbledon in 2012, his first in Australia since 2010, and it reversed the status quo against his nemesis, Nadal. Both players were returning from extended layoffs \u2014 Federer for six months after Wimbledon with an injured left knee; Nadal for a couple of months with an injured left wrist \u2014 and were seeded 17th and ninth respectively. \"It's been a different last six months, I wasn't sure I was going to make it here but here I am \u2014 we made it,\" Federer said after accepting the trophy from Australian great Rod Laver, who lends his name to the main stadium at Melbourne Park. \"I would have been happy to lose too, to be honest. The comeback was perfect as it was. Tennis is a tough sport, there's no draws. If there was going to be one, I would have been happy to have it tonight and share it with Rafa, really.\" Article continues after sponsorship Federer had lost six of the previous eight Grand Slam finals he'd played against Nadal, and had only previously beaten the left-handed Spaniard in 11 of their 34 matches. Nadal remains equal second with Pete Sampras on the all-time list, with the last of Nadal's 14 majors coming at Roland Garros in 2014. He missed his chance to be the first man in the Open era to win each of the four Grand Slams twice. Instead, Federer became the first man in the Open era to win three Grand Slam titles at least five times (Wimbledon 7 titles, U.S. Open 5, Australian Open 5 and French Open 1). After four sets where the momentum swung alternately from one player to the next, the fifth had all the tension and drama that these two players are famous for. Nadal went up an early break and it seemed as if the injury time-out Federer needed after the fourth set may have been an indicator of things to come. But the Swiss star rallied, and broke back in a pivotal sixth game and took control in a period when he won 10 straight points. Nadal saved three break points in the eighth game but lost momentum again when Federer finished off a 26-shot rally \u2014 the longest of the match \u2014 with a forehand winner down the line. Consecutive forehand errors gave Federer the pivotal break for 5-3, but Nadal made him work for the very last point. Serving for the match, Federer had to save two break points with an ace and a forehand winner. At deuce, he was called for a double-fault but challenged the out call on his second serve. The call was overturned, and he got to play two. Not long after, he fired an ace to get his second match point and hit a forehand crosscourt winner to finish off. His celebrations were delayed, though, when Nadal challenged the call. Federer watched the replay on the tournament screen, and leaped for joy when it showed his last shot was in. His 100th match at the Australian Open ended with his fifth title at Melbourne Park. \"Congratulation to Roger ... Just amazing, the way he's playing after such a long time of him not being on the tour,\" Nadal said. \"For sure, you have been working a lot to make that happen. So congratulations.\" Nadal spent two months recovering from a left wrist injury before heading to Brisbane for a warmup tournament, breaking his usual routine. He reached the quarterfinals there, and had no expectations of reaching the final in Australia. \"I had some hard time not being able to compete in full condition. ... some injuries, well not new for me, but still tough when it happens,\" Nadal said. \"I fight a lot these two weeks. Today, a great match, probably Roger deserved it a little bit more than me.\" No two players had met more often in Grand Slam finals in the Open era, and Nadal had previously dominated. But they hadn't met in a major final since the 2011 French Open, won by Nadal. Three months ago, they were both on breaks when Federer joined Nadal in Mallorca for the opening of the Spaniard's tennis academy and the pair joked about ever being able to contend for majors again. Yet here they were, first Grand Slam tournament of the season, renewing the classic rivalry that saw them dominate tennis a decade ago. The long-odds final \u2014 No. 9 against No. 17 \u2014 unfolded after six-time champion Novak Djokovic was shockingly upset by No. 117-ranked Denis Istomin in the second round and top-ranked Andy Murray, a five-time losing finalist in Australia, went out in the fourth round to left-handed serve-volleyer Mischa Zverev. Serena Williams Defeats Sister Venus To Take 23rd Grand Slam Title Federer beat Zverev in the quarterfinals and U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka in an all-Swiss semifinal to reach the championship match. The six years between his Australian titles set a record, too, longer than the five years that both Boris Becker and Andre Agassi had between championships in Melbourne. It capped a remarkable weekend for 30-somethings \u2014 all four singles finalists were 30 or older \u2014 after Serena Williams beat her sister Venus Williams in the women's final to capture her Open-era record 23rd Grand Slam title.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President Trump\u2019s order to suspend the country\u2019s refugee program and temporarily ban immigration from seven mostly-Muslim nations erupted Sunday into a full-scale political battle -- with Trump and top aides defending the move amid nationwide protests and congressional Democrats vowing a relentless Capitol Hill fight to undo the order. \u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants, and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression. But we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d Trump said Sunday afternoon. \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. \u2026 My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d Trump issued the statement as hundreds of protesters marched in Washington and in other cities across the country to protest the president's self-described \u201cextreme vetting\u201d -- which resulted this weekend in dozens of foreign visitors and some legal permanent U.S. residents being detained at domestic airports. Earlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., staged a press conference with some immigrant children and adults impacted by the bans and vowed to fight them on Capitol Hill \u201cwith every fiber of my being.\u201d Sen.\u00a0Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., said that she would introduce two bills Monday. One of the bills would rescind Trump's order, while the other would give Congress greater oversight of the president's immigration authority. \u00a0 And California Democratic Rep. Lou Correa said the executive orders on illegal immigration \u201cdirectly challenge the right to due process under the Constitution\u201d and that he\u2019ll introduce legislation to fund legal aid to those who are \u201ctargeted.\u201d Congressional Democrats led by Schumer, who said he\u2019s already appealed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, will have a difficult task getting any kind of measure through the Republican-control Congress that would reverse the executive order. \u201cI doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks. I think they\u2019re wondering why we don\u2019t do that already,\u201d said Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, who as an Army officer served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. However, Trump is facing opposition for some congressional Republicans, including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, and Barbara Comstock, of Virginia, along with Sens. Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and John McCain, of Arizona. \"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d Graham and McCain said in a joint statement. \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d Trump, a Republican, tweeted in response that the statement was \u201cwrong\u201d and that the senators were \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d The executive order Trump issued Friday imposes a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. On Saturday afternoon -- as reports surfaced about foreign visitors being detained at New York\u2019s Kennedy airport and elsewhere -- Trump said his plan to prevent Islamic terrorists and others for attacking the United States was \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d But by Saturday evening, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued a temporary halt on the part of the executive order that allows the Trump administration to deport people from the largely-Muslim countries. \u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday morning. Meanwhile, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cThese are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists.\u201d And White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus argued that as many as 80 percent of Americans agree with the policy change, while dismissing media reports about chaotic scenes Saturday at U.S. airports. \u201cI do not think there was any chaos,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d while predicting more people will be detained and offering \u201cno apologies.\u201d Priebus also seemed to suggest that foreign arrivals who have so-called \u201cgreen cards\u201d that allows them to permanently live and work in the United States will not be subject to the additional screenings. \u201cAs far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d he told NBC. Kelly said later that allowed green card holders into the country \u00a0was \"in the national interest\u201d of the country. And Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman \u00a0of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said Trump's order had been \"poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.\" Trump, Conway and Priebus argued Sunday that the seven countries were in fact identified by President Obama in 2015 and pointed out that roughly 40 other such nations included Afghanistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were not part of the travel ban. Trump is also facing opposition from attorneys general in 15 states and the District of Columbia, who issued a statement Sunday condemning his order as \u201cunconstitutional, un-American and unlawful.\u201d \u00a0 ",

Chuck Schumer, D-NY, speaks during a press conference to push for an overturn of President Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigration to the United States for refugees and some Muslim travelers, at a press conference Jan.\u00a029, 2017, in New York.\u00a0 (Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) David Weigel, Ed O'KeefeThe Washington Post Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump 's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for Democratic National Committee leadership positions joined protesters at airports around the country. On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) fought back tears as he announced that Democrats would introduce legislation to stop the order. \"This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\" he said, flanked by refugees at a news conference in New York. \"Look at these faces! Are they any kind of threat to America? No, they're the promise of America.\" Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., are inviting all Democratic lawmakers to join them at 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to show solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. And in an interview, Sen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn., said he would introduce legislation to overturn Trump's order by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. \"I think ultimately this ban will be struck down by the courts, but we need to put legislation on the table that Republicans could support, that overturns the ban,\" Murphy said. \"(The president) clearly campaigned on this ban, but the fact that he put no thought into how it was drafted or how it would be implemented is incredibly dangerous.\" Given that stance, Murphy said, Democrats must \"force a debate\" this week on Trump's order by slowing consideration of the president's remaining Cabinet nominees, especially Rex Tillerson, his choice to serve as the next secretary of state.

Hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the White House on Sunday afternoon protesting against President Donald Trump 's refugee ban, which stranded scores of travelers at U.S. airports Saturday before being partially lifted by a federal judge.

(Faiz Siddiqui, Michael Laris, Michael Alison Chandler) \"We should take every ounce of time that we're allowed on these nominees, to talk about the disaster that has been the first week of this administration, especially when it comes to foreign policy,\" he said. Schumer and Democrats are eager to move quickly because they believe there is a rare opportunity to ride a wave of GOP opposition to Trump's moves. Democrats argue that one of the only ways they can influence policymaking in the next two years is to drive a wedge between Trump and members of his own party. At his news conference, Schumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and others. (Jerry Markon, Katherine Shaver) Details of the legislative proposals were still being sorted out Sunday afternoon, but most are likely to be introduced by Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight of refugee and immigrants' rights issues, aides said. Schumer was working to coordinate the proposals Sunday; Murphy said he had received a call from the leader early in the day to confer. Democratic leaders were also exploring the options for holding more public events to draw attention to the opposition to Trump's orders - with the party seeking to once again tap into the anger that has driven millions of Americans into the streets. Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., who has taken a leading role in Democratic messaging, said Sunday that the Senate needs \"to pass legislation immediately which effectively rescinds Trump's un-American and unconstitutional ban on people from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States\" and to slow the nomination process. \"Almost without exception, Trump's Cabinet nominees are extremely controversial and way outside of the American mainstream,\" Sanders said. \"In my view, the Senate needs to take as much time as possible on the floor for a full discussion and debate about each of these nominees.\" For the party's restive base, that fight - just nine days into the new president's term - could not come soon enough. While Democrats have embraced the protests against Trump and Republican policies, and while some helped organize more than 70 rallies on Jan. 15 against repeal of the Affordable Care Act, progressives have criticized the party for not voting en masse against Trump's Cabinet picks. \"You better show up ready to do real work on Monday after all this pro bono work we, the people, did for you on our day off,\" said CNN host W. Kamau Bell in a Saturday night tweet. In several cases, Democratic lawmakers took one of the most basic steps available to them as members of Congress: They provided services for constituents. Reps. Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y., and Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., who represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, showed up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and helped activists and attorneys seek the quick release of green-card holders and refugees stuck in legal limbo after their arrival. In Houston, where the candidates for DNC roles participated in the second of four \"future forums,\" activists filled a ballroom at Texas Southern University to ask why Democrats were not doing more. One attendee could be heard shouting, \"Elizabeth Warren sold us out,\" a reference to her committee vote in favor of Ben Carson's nomination to become secretary for health and human services. On Saturday afternoon, before the protests had gotten fully underway, some of the Houston event's biggest cheers came when the candidates were asked whether they would oppose all of Trump's nominees - something no Democrat has done. \"With what we have seen in the last seven days, I think we may be underreacting,\" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said. \"We've got refugees who were vetted more than the Trump Cabinet was vetted,\" said former labor secretary Thomas Perez . Rep. Keith Ellison , D-Minn., the first Muslim member of Congress, said that the party needs to follow the lead of activists and that those activists are needed for direct action against Trump. \"It is street action that creates the economic and social conditions for legislation to get passed,\" Ellison said. After the forum, Buttigieg joined Perez and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison at the protests breaking out at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. \"We knew this would be a day of reckoning when Donald Trump assumed the Oval Office,\" Perez said to protesters. \"Lady Liberty has taken a few body punches, but the American people will fight back.\" By Saturday night, many more elected Democrats were joining protests - and enabling them. After the Port Authority suspended the AirTrain that transports people from New York's subway to JFK Airport, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, D-N.Y., reversed its decision. Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. , D-Pa., showed up at Philadelphia's airport in a tuxedo, having left a formal event to help local elected officials negotiate with customs officers to see stranded immigrants and refugees. At Dulles International Airport , Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., did the same - to little avail. At Boston's Logan International Airport, Warren delivered a speech against Trump's order that was amplified by the crowd, a \"people's microphone\" that had been used by the Occupy Wall Street movement. And Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., joined marchers protesting Trump's travel ban outside the White House on Sunday afternoon. Booker, Harris and Warren, considered possible Democratic presidential contenders in 2020, had cast three of just 11 \"no\" votes against Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. Murphy noted that the Senate quickly confirmed James Mattis , the revered former Marine general, to serve as defense secretary \"because he assured us that he was going to argue against the very ban he watched Trump sign.\" At a summer 2016 roundtable, Mattis had said the idea of a \"Muslim ban\" would make actors in the Middle East think America had \"completely lost it.\" \"Many of us gave the president and his Cabinet a little benefit of the doubt last week,\" Murphy said. \"I don't see that there's any reason that that should continue. Almost every single one of these nominees try to prop up their nomination by contradicting Trump in their confirmation hearing. It's pretty clear now that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are running this administration and the nominees that have been confirmed thus far have been marginalized.\" By Sunday afternoon, nearly every congressional Democrat had condemned the executive order, including Sen. Heidi Heitkamp , D-N.D., who faces a 2018 re-election campaign in a state Trump carried by 35 points. None defended it, but several remained silent. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly , D-Va., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned that Democrats can only do so much to try to stop Trump, given their diminished powers on Capitol Hill. \"We're going to have to pick our battles in the next two years because we don't have the majority,\" he said. \"There are so many moving parts here, and we need to prioritize what we respond to and what we propound. We have to be proactively propounding an alternative vision that recalls American core values.\" In the House, Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif., a longtime advocate for immigrant and refugees' rights, is set to introduce a bill this week that would block implementation of Trump's order, according to senior House aides. And Pelosi informed colleagues Sunday afternoon that among the options her caucus would consider is filing an amicus brief in support of the American Civil Liberties Union if legal cases to block or reverse Trump's travel ban reach the Supreme Court. Connolly said that he and many other Democrats have been stunned by how organically Americans have been drawn into the streets to protest Trump's early decisions as president. Just days after the Jan. 21 Women's March on Washington, 200 more people than usual showed up at a regular meeting of the Fairfax County Democratic Party. \"That's a sign,\" he said. \"And there are all kinds of people networking and asking the question, 'What can I do?' There's not a sense of 'Throw up your hands, our fate is sealed.' It's quite the opposite. It wasn't a feckless, powerless act. It was a call to arms. And I believe it's going to lead to mass organizing across the country to resist this constitutional assault.\" ",

The move was quickly panned by world leaders and by elected officials in the U.S., including several from within Mr. Trump\u2019s own party. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus says it is possible for President Trump's immigration ban to be expanded to \"other countries that have ... In his statement, Mr. Trump stressed that the ban is only temporary and noted that it doesn\u2019t apply to all Muslim-majority countries. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday morning that the Trump administration may expand the number of countries included on the list. \u201cThere are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.\u201d He cited past precedent on the issue, saying the Obama administration implemented a pause on refugee arrivals back in 2011. \u201cMy policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\u201d Mr. Trump said he has \u201ctremendous feeling\u201d for Syrian refugees, but that national security must come first. \u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica has always been the land of the free and home of the brave.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Protests Build Across the Country Against Trump's Immigration Order By Ben Gittleson Jan 29, 2017, 7:59 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Backlash Grows Against Trump's Immigration Order 0 Shares Email President Trump defended his executive order restricting the entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-dominated countries, saying the move was not about religion but about keeping the country safe, but administration officials appeared to backtrack on the scope of the order, even as demonstrators gathered across the U.S. to protest. Massive crowds packed Boston's Copley Square, Battery Park in New York City and outside the White House, and public areas in other cities, with demonstrations also held at airports from coast to coast to protest the order, which suspended immigration from countries with ties to terror -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for 90 days. The order also indefinitely suspends Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. Trump said in a statement released today that the countries chosen for what he called the \"extreme vetting\" of the order had been \"identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\" \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\" the statement reads. The administration, however, appeared to backtrack on one element of the order, saying late today that green card holders from those seven countries were not barred from re-entering the U.S., whereas earlier the administration had indicated they were. Some Colleges Warning Foreign Students on Travel After Trump's Immigration Order \"In applying the provisions of the president's executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest,\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement today. \"Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.\" A senior administration official confirmed this evening that legal permanent U.S. residents are exempt from the executive order. The official said the people who were set aside for additional screening were a \"fractional marginal minuscule percentage\" of travelers and said it is not an injury for green card and visa holders to be subject to additional screening. The order has been criticized by Democratic elected officials and 16 attorneys general released a statement condemning the order as unconstitutional. \"We are confident that the Executive Order will ultimately be struck down by the courts. In the meantime, we are committed to working to ensure that as few people as possible suffer from the chaotic situation that it has created,\" said the statement, issued jointly by attorneys general of California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. A number of Republicans have also criticized the order, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who issued a joint statement today. \"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\" the senators said. \"We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. \"Such a hasty process risks harmful results,\" the statement said. \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism ... Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred.\" Protesters marched along Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol this afternoon, chanting, \"No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here,\" and \"No Ban. No wall.\" According to immigrant and refugee advocacy groups, a number of people were being held today at airports across the country with some facing imminent deportation despite the stay on deportations issued by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. aaronds/Instagram Protesters of President Donald Trump's immigration ban gather at Copley Park in Boston, Jan. 29, 2017. Among the people held after the ruling, according to Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, were: A 2-year-old U.S. citizen with green card-holding parents and a 66-year-old woman traveling from Iraq to visit her son, an active-duty U.S. service member who flew up to North Carolina to help her. A lot of people were being handcuffed, Heller said. In one dramatic case late last night, an Iranian Fulbright scholar whose friends were waiting for her at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was forced to board a Ukraine International Airlines flight just before midnight -\u2013 hours after a federal court in Brooklyn issued a stay on the order, according to Heller. Only after high-level intervention did the plane turn around on the tarmac and let the woman deplane, Heller said. Genna Martin/seattlepi.com viaAP Seattle city councilwoman Kshama Sawant raises a fist over the crowd, as more than 1,000 people gather at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to protest President Donald Trump's order that restricts immigration to the U.S., Jan. 28, 2017. The International Refugee Assistance Project encouraged anyone with a green card to reroute their flight through Boston if they don't want to be detained, after a ruling there said people couldn\u2019t be deported or detained. The New York ruling said people couldn't be deported, but it allowed detention. The advocates and lawyers said the haphazard implementation of the order has resulted in what Heller called \"rogue\" Customs and Border Protection officers pressuring green card holders to cancel them. She said that CBP officers repeatedly told them they were awaiting more information from Washington; finally, they stopped talking and \"told us to just call President Trump,\" Heller said. The groups said they're examining rulings in Boston, New York, and Virginia, to see whether there is overlap and whether they complement each other, and determine whether the rulings applied nationwide. In the case of the New York ruling, they said that the order did, but in the case of Boston, it was unclear, as it appeared it would, although it contained local references. Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters Activists gather outside the White House to protest President Donald Trump's executive actions on immigration, in Washington, Jan. 29, 2017. Thousands of attorneys have turned out en masse across the country, they said, including more than 4,000 people who signed up to help with the IRAP and many more showing up own their own, too. The executive director of the National Immigration Law Center said about 2,000 lawyers had formed a group dedicated to providing support on a regular basis. Protesters at airports across the country reacted with jubilation Saturday night at the news that in response to a legal challenge issued by the ACLU a federal court in Brooklyn had granted an emergency stay on the president's executive order that bans immigration from Syria , Yemen, Sudan, Somalia , Iraq, Iran and Libya. Following the court's decision, the Department of Homeland Security said in a press release that it \"will continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people.\" The statement noted that Trump's executive orders remain \"in place,\" despite the emergency stay. \"The president's Executive Orders remain in place -- prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the release said. The ACLU contended that the stay applied nationally to all cases, but that was not necessarily clear from the ruling, and an atmosphere of confusion still surrounds the orders, and how they will be applied going forward. Today, the spontaneous protests that were sparked by news of travelers being detained were expected to continue in a more planned fashion at airports across the country. carrie1010/Instagram Protesters of Donald Trump's immigration ban rally at Copley Square in Boston, Jan. 29, 2017. The protests started Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where hundreds of people chanted \"No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here,\" angered at the detention of a number of people arriving from the countries listed in Trump's order, including the two Iraqi men whose cases were taken by the ACLU. As the day went on, the protests spread to other major airports like Washington Dulles International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. The two Iraqis who were detained at JFK were both released later in the day, drawing widespread media attention. One of the men, Hameed Jhalid Darweesh, expressed his gratitude for those who supported him while he was detained. \"America is the land of freedom,\" Darweesh said. \"The land of freedom, the land of the rights. This is what brought me to come here, and I'm very thankful.\" Neither Darweesh nor the other Iraqi were technically refugees according to the definition in the president's executive order at the time of their detention, but appear to have come to the U.S. on visas, a Trump administration official told ABC News. A senior Department of Homeland Security official said that 375 travelers were affected by the executive order Saturday at airports across the country. Within that group, 109 people were in transit and then denied entry to the U.S., 173 were denied entry to the U.S. before boarding their flights in a foreign port, and 81 were granted waivers because of their legal permanent resident or special immigrant visa status. The number of people being held at U.S. airports is expected to dwindle today, but passengers at airports across the world may be kept from boarding flights to the U.S. Trump said the executive order was part of a vetting plan to prevent \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from reaching American soil. The seven-page document calls for an immediate suspension of immigration from countries with ties to terror -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for a time period of 90 days. But none of the countries on the list have had anything to do with terror incidents on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks, and Saudi Arabia -- where 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were from -- is not included. It also calls for the complete suspension of Syrian refugees for an indefinite period. It also calls on the secretary of state to suspend the entire U.S program for admitting refugees for 120 days while authorities review the application and adjudication process. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said today on \"This Week\" that the seven countries had been identified by the Obama administration as needing further scrutiny, and said other countries could be added to the list at a later date.

In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Priebus was asked about reports that the executive order affected green card holders, contrary to recommendations from the Department of Homeland Security. \"We didn't overrule the Department of Homeland Security, as far as green card holders moving forward, it doesn't affect them,\" Priebus first said. But when pressed by host Chuck Todd on whether it impacts green card holders, Priebus reversed himself, saying, \"Well, of course it does. If you're traveling back and forth, you're going to be subjected to further screening.\" Related: Trump Immigration Ban Still In Place Despite Court Ruling, Says DHS Asked whether the executive order would affect U.S. citizens, he again indicated it would, suggesting it was up to the \"discretionary authority\" of a Customs and Border Patrol agent whether to question citizens coming from the countries in question. \"I would suspect that if you're an American citizen traveling back and forth to Libya you're likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come into an airport,\" he said. He also suggested the executive order could come to encompass more than the current seven countries included in the ban, and that the order focused on people coming from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen because those were identified by Congress as \"being the seven most-watched countries in regard to harboring terrorists.\" \"Perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward \u2014 but in order to do this in a way that was expeditious, in a way that would pass muster quickly, we used the 7 countries\" already identified by Congress, he said. Priebus added that the order was rolled out quickly because \"this is all done for the protection of Americans, and waiting another three days, waiting another three weeks is something that we don't want to get wrong.\" \"President Trump is not willing to get this wrong which is why he wants to move forward quickly and protect Americans,\" Priebus added. A federal judge issued an emergency stay on parts of the executive order Saturday evening, but the DHS and the White House responded early Sunday, saying that the order continues to remain in force.

Lawyers from around Chicago showed up to assist any immigrant having problems. (Chris Sweda) Stacy St. Clair and Grace Wong Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune An email blast went out after lunch Saturday, calling for lawyers to help people being held at O'Hare International Airport in the wake of President Donald Trump 's immigration order. Julia Schlozman received the message just a few hours after signing up to volunteer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. After quickly reading through the email, she hopped on a CTA bus and then grabbed the Blue Line to O'Hare. An attorney who specializes in criminal justice reform, Schlozman has never practiced immigration law. But she went anyway, believing her research skills, brainstorming ability and enthusiasm could somehow help. \"I wanted to contribute in any way I could,\" she said. \"I just felt like I had to do something.\" She wasn't the only Chicago-area lawyer with that feeling. About 150 attorneys showed up at O'Hare on Saturday to help secure the release of more than a dozen travelers held as part of Trump's crackdown on immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. They threw their weekend plans away, rescheduling family outings, ignoring household chores and canceling restaurant reservations to assist clients they had never met nor would ever bill. Immigration attorney Maria Baldini-Potermin was catching up on work at her office when she received the email. Wearing yoga pants and a Girl Scouts T-shirt, she headed straight to the airport. Attorneys assisting family of detainees at O'Hare Mohammad Amirisefat of Chicago waits for news about relatives at O'Hare International Airport on Jan.\u00a028, 2017. His sister, Zehra Amirisefat, 30, a U.S. citizen, landed at O'Hare with her 6-month-old child on a return trip from\u00a0Iran and\u00a0her husband, a green card holder, was detained.

His sister, Zehra Amirisefat, 30, a U.S. citizen, landed at O'Hare with her 6-month-old child on a return trip from\u00a0Iran and\u00a0her husband, a green card holder, was detained. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"The Chicago Bar is responding to the challenge,\" she said. \"It's inspiring to see.\" Armed with laptops and iPads, the attorneys looked like \"The Paper Chase\" cavalry as they commandeered the dining area directly across from the McDonald's kiosk in the international terminal. The initial email quickly made its way to social media, leading to an overflow legal crowd in the O'Hare food court by 6 p.m. The travelers were not formally detained, which prevented the attorneys from speaking with them. Instead, the lawyers gleaned as much information as they could from the travelers' family members who were waiting anxiously at O'Hare. They shared that information with local congressional offices in the hopes that the elected officials could persuade the Department of Homeland Security to release them. While some attorneys lobbied Congress, others teamed up to work on legal briefs, do research or walk through the terminal with signs offering legal assistance. ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Protesters gather at Copley Square in Boston on Jan. 30, 2017. (Photo: Darren McCollester, Getty Images) Protesters marched, chanted and waved signs\u00a0across the nation Sunday as angry immigrant advocates pressed their demand for an end to President Trump's executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. Rallies underway in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Los Angeles and other cities\u00a0Sunday drew thousands, part of a groundswell of fury that erupted at\u00a0airports across the nation Saturday\u00a0and showed no signs of abating. \"There is such an energy and anger that I have to do something about it,\" said Jan Rudzinski, of Arden, Del., as she joined\u00a0a rally in Philadelphia where signs said \"Welcome Muslims\" and \"Let them in.\" In Washington, thousands gathered and marched outside the White House. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio joined\u00a0a rally \"for our city's values\" at Battery Park, where Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, called the ban \"mean-spirited.\" Schumer said Trump's order\u00a0only served to \"embolden and inspire\" terrorists around the world. Thousands of demonstrators thronged Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday, met not only by squads of police in riot gear but by a knot of Trump supporters who stayed across the street, holding signs and American flags and trying to engage the crowd with a loudspeaker. The protests briefly cut off traffic to the busy terminal that serves most international flights, but travelers still made their way through. A line of police separated the groups. Paul Blair, 35, of Los Angeles, held a sign that\u00a0read, \"Cruelty is not strength.\" \"I've never made a sign before in my life,\" he said, but added that he felt \"pretty strongly this is a cruel policy that serves no purpose and doesn't benefit America.\" Another protester, Nahtahna Cabanes, 40, also of Los Angeles, handed out dozens of tamales to the crowd from a large aluminum tray. Cabanes said she found them on a table but that they were not being consumed. So she took it upon herself. \"You've got to feed the revolution, right?\" she said with a smile. At least three protests unfolded in the Detroit area, home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the USA. \"This is where the march became a movement,\" said Phoebe Hopps, one of the Michigan coordinators for last week's\u00a0Women's March on Washington. Hopps, who lives in Traverse City, Mich., scrambled Saturday evening for a permit from the Wayne County Airport Authority. In all, at least five protests took place across Michigan. For Ayah Kutmah, 18, a student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the issue was personal. \"My parents are Syrian,\" she said, having just arrived at the airport Sunday from her hometown of Louisville, Ky. She protested there before she got on her plane, then joined marchers in Detroit when she landed. She held a sign that said \"Welcome\" in English and in Arabic. \"This ban is really personal to me, and to my family.\" I'll be joining New Yorkers at Battery Park this afternoon to stand up for our city's values. See you there. \u2014 Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 29, 2017 In Boston, thousands turned out in Copley Square, many holding signs, including\u00a0\"Brown and proud\" and \"No wall no ban.\" \"Can you hear us Washington?!\" tweeted Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. \"We\u2019re standing strong in Boston to support & protect ALL of our people & we will not back down. #NoBanNoWall \" In Virginia,\u00a0the advocacy group CASA's call for a rally\u00a0at\u00a0Dulles International Airport drew dozens of placard-carrying protesters. \u201cWe will not stop until this executive order is canceled and we arrive at common-sense, immigration reform that takes into account the lives of immigrant and refugee families,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0CASA Virginia state director Michelle LaRue said. Protests\u00a0targeted major airports from\u00a0Los Angeles to Chicago to New York. Other demonstrations were taking place in\u00a0town squares and smaller airports from Bangor, Maine, to Bloomington, Ind., to Boise. At San Francisco's airport, hundreds of people choked the international terminal for a second straight day, waving sings that read \"Let Them In\" and \"No Ban No Wall.\" A phalanx of lawyers lined up to offer free legal aid to refugees affected by the executive order. \"I am committed to spending my weekends protesting,\" said Liz Freese-Cabrera, a video producer who attended the Women's March in Washington, D.C. She said she had spent 12 hours protesting at the airport on Saturday. \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 29, 2017 The executive order, signed Friday, suspends entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan,\u00a0Libya,\u00a0Somalia\u00a0and Yemen. Immigration ban fallout: What you need to know Protesters began swarming major airports\u00a0Saturday. In Chicago, thousands of\u00a0demonstrators\u00a0gathered at O'Hare International Airport.\u00a0In New York, more than 2,000 at John F. Kennedy Airport chanted \"Let them in!\" At Los Angeles International Airport, 200 protesters, shouted, \"No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA.\" In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings on Sunday afternoon met with travelers who had been held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, handing them bouquets of white roses and telling reporters, \"The tide is turning and the sun is rising \u2014\u00a0and these important visitors to our city are here. We have wished them welcome and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\" WFAA-TV reported . Federal Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn granted an\u00a0emergency stay Saturday at the behest of\u00a0immigration\u00a0rights lawyers.\u00a0The judge\u2019s ruling applies to those who have already arrived in the U.S. and those who are in transit who hold valid visas.\u00a0Judges in Massachusetts and Virginia also ordered halts. Moments ago, @JudgeClayJ and I greeted travelers who were detained at @DFWAirport since yesterday. We are very sorry. pic.twitter.com/BHFkpFwNzI \u2014 Mayor Mike Rawlings (@Mike_Rawlings) January 29, 2017 The Department of Homeland Security earlier Sunday shrugged off court rulings, saying they will have little impact on \"overall implementation\" of Trump's order. But Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly late Sunday said in a statement that the entry of lawful permanent residents was \"in the national interest.\" Accordingly, he said, if these people aren't considered to be a threat, their cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Within 24 hours of Trump signing the executive order, its impact was resonating worldwide as officials struggled to interpret Trump's decision \u2014 leaving refugees and immigrants who had already been vetted and approved to enter the country detained at airports and stuck in legal limbo.

Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA A dozen people who landed in the U.S. after Trump signed the executive order were detained and some were separated from their families at New York's John F. Kennedy international Airport on Friday, according to lawmakers and attorneys. Two of the detained were Iraqi refugees and one \u2014 identified as Hameed Khalid Darweesh \u2014 was an interpreter working with the U.S. government for a decade, according to his attorneys. Photo gallery: 'Trump Out, Refugees In': Ban Sparks Protests at Airports Across the Nation Darweesh was eventually released Saturday afternoon. The other Iraqi detainee was also released, NBC New York reported. Two people were released from Philadelphia International Airport on Sunday and reunited with their families, according to Mayor Jim Kenney. But there were reports of people detained around the country and lawyers stressed it was hard to know exactly how many people had been detained and where. At least three federal judges in New York, Massachusetts and Virginia have temporarily halted parts of Trump's executive order, blocking the deportation of those coming into the country with valid visas and others who are legally authorized to enter the country. Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Sunday that the president had the right and Constitutional power to enact the order. The judge's decision changed nothing, the official added. News of the detentions brought a mass of protesters to JFK and other airports on Saturday, with more protests kicking off in cities around the country on Sunday. New York City In New York City, thousands of protesters were gathering in Manhattan's Battery park on Sunday afternoon for a march and second day of protests. The New York immigration Coalition's Executive Director Steve Choi told NBC News 12,000 people had signed up for the rally. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio attended the protest. Today at 2pm in Battery Park, I'll stand with thousands of concerned New Yorkers to protest Trump's shameful executive order. \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) January 29, 2017 I'll be joining New Yorkers at Battery Park this afternoon to stand up for our city's values. See you there. \u2014 Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 29, 2017 Gillibrand told the crowd of protesters Trump's executive order \"goes against everything that we as New Yorkers stand for.\" \"Fight for what you believe in, never stop fighting,\" she said. Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, who was a vocal critic of Trump at Saturday's airport protest, addressed the president directly and said \"Mr. President, look around here, this sea of people, this is what America is all about.\" \"Mr. President, we are not going away. We are not backing down \u2014 from our airports, to the courts, to the streets we will continue to fight for justice and freedom, she said to cheers from the crowd. Dallas, Texas Protesters returned to Dallas/Fortworth International Airport on Sunday morning, in a crowd that started off as a few dozen and soon ballooned into hundreds chanting \"Set them free!,\" NBC DFW reported.

All 11 detainees were released by 11 a.m. on Sunday, according to Mayor Kasim Reed. San Francisco, California Droves of protesters were excepted again at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on Sunday afternoon and at least 50 lawyers were also at the airport offering legal help, NBC Bay Area reported. The airport issued a statement saying they \"appreciate all those who have so passionately expressed their concerns over the President's Executive Order relating to immigration.\" \"We share these concerns deeply, as our highest obligation is to the millions of people from around the world whom we serve,\" the airport said in the statement. SFO said it was making supplies available to affected travelers \"as well as to the members of the public who have so bravely taken a stand against this action by speaking publicly in our facilities.\" Daniella Silva ",

Kennedy International Airport after receiving what he called \u201calarming reports\u201d that the federal government was planning to violate the court order. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an interview, Mr. Schneiderman said that the executive order was unconstitutional and that he and other attorneys general were exploring the possibility of legal action. \u201cThere may be grounds for a claim that this does damage to a state, if they\u2019re damaging our state institutions\u201d like universities and hospitals, he said. The president has broad power to control immigration. A federal law allows him to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants\u201d if he determines that their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d But another law appears to limit that power, saying that \u201cno person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d Saturday\u2019s court orders, issued in haste, contained little reasoning. Judge Donnelly, in Brooklyn, wrote that there was a strong likelihood that the two plaintiffs in the case, who seek to represent a class of refugees, visa holders and others, could establish that their removal would violate the Constitution\u2019s due process and equal protection guarantees. Based on that conclusion and the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d the plaintiffs would suffer, Judge Donnelly issued a temporary nationwide injunction barring their removal. She did not order their release. The order in Boston, from Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court there, was in one sense broader and in another narrower. It limited border screening practices to those in place before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, and it barred not only removal but also detention. But it seemed to be limited to people arriving or held at Logan International Airport there. The order from Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the Federal District Court in Alexandria applied only to legal permanent residents being held at Dulles International Airport. The order in Seattle, from Judge Thomas S. Zilly of the Federal District Court there, applied to two plaintiffs. It is possible that one of the four cases will definitively resolve an important aspect of the legality of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. But the cases were filed very quickly, and civil rights litigators generally like to locate ideal plaintiffs and hone their legal theories before filing test cases that could turn into legal landmarks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Brooklyn case, for instance, did not make a claim based on the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion, though some lawyers said that was the executive order\u2019s central flaw. \u201cThe smoking gun they put in the executive order is the idea that they would grant exceptions for minority religions,\u201d Mr. Romero said. Mr. Trump has said that was meant to favor Christians over Muslims. But opening such a challenge requires preparation, Mr. Cole said. \u201cThe one thing you can\u2019t do under the establishment clause is denomination favoritism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very promising claim, but it requires the right plaintiff.\u201d Follow Adam Liptak on Twitter @adamliptak .

USA TODAY NETWORK Thousands of people protest President Trump's immigration ban on citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, 2017. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, EPA) Forty-eight hours after President Trump signed\u00a0an executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, chaos reigned at U.S. airports, as authorities, travelers and lawyers struggled Sunday to understand how the ban\u00a0is being implemented. Attorneys for civil rights and immigration advocacy groups said\u00a0Customs and Border Protection agents are interpreting Trump's orders\u00a0differently. At some international airports,\u00a0including Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas, all people who were detained have been allowed to enter the United States. At others, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York's JFK International Airport, lawyers said an undetermined number of travelers remained in custody. Three federal courts \u2014 in New York, Virginia and Boston \u2014\u00a0have issued rulings since Saturday night to protect people who were in transit to the U.S. when the order went into effect Friday and got caught in\u00a0legal limbo. The \u00a0ban affects people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The\u00a0Department of Homeland Security said that as of Saturday night, 109 people had been detained, but it has yet to follow through on a New York judge's order to release a list of all people still being detained, including travelers who may have arrived on U.S. soil Sunday. The result?\u00a0\"Mass confusion,\" said\u00a0\u00a0Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case in New York. \"The government took no steps to make sure that people understood what the order means and how it should be implemented. (Trump) just threw it out there without ensuring that it would be implemented fairly and even-handed and properly.\" Protests against Trump's immigration plan rolling in more than 30 cities The White House and Homeland Security countered that they provided new guidelines to agents working at airports and that only a small fraction of travelers were affected by the order. On Saturday, when asked about the roll-out of his executive order, Trump said \"it's working out very nicely.\" And several White House officials appeared on Sunday talk shows to say that civil rights groups were blowing the confusion out of proportion. So where do things really stand? A ruling issued late Saturday by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York barred Customs and Border Protection officials across the country from deporting any immigrants, including refugees and legal immigrants from the seven predominantly Muslim countries targeted in Trump's order, so long as they hold a valid visa. That order dealt only with immigrants who had already arrived in the U.S. or were already in transit. Homeland Security said it would comply with that order, but made clear it would continue carrying out Trump's executive order, meaning they will try and stop any other refugees or legal immigrants from the seven countries listed in the president's order from heading to the U.S. Lawyers will soon begin arguing the overall legality of Trump's executive order, a possibly weeks-long process that will ultimately determine whether the order is allowed to stand. Experts question legality of Trump's immigration ban on Muslim countries But much remains unclear. Part of the problem has been the lack of information coming from the departments of Homeland Security and State. The first official mention of the new guidelines to appear online came from an Arabic-language Twitter account run by the State Department. It sent out three tweets on Saturday instructing citizens from the seven countries listed in Trump's order not to travel to the U.S., pay any visa fees\u00a0or show up for visa\u00a0interviews. The tweets did not mention, however, that those with permanent resident status \u2014 or green-card holders \u00a0\u2014 from those countries are still allowed to enter the U.S. Homeland Security said\u00a0it provided new guidance to all of its port officials immediately after Trump signed the\u00a0order,\u00a0and updated its computerized targeting system to identify those people.\u00a0But the department did not start providing guidance to travelers until Sunday. Homeland Security's first tweet came early Sunday, which linked to the department's statement declaring that it would carry out Trump's order and that\u00a0\"prohibited travel will remain prohibited.\" There was no guidance on which travelers should stay home and no clarification of how the order affected green-card holders. It wasn't until Sunday night that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly declared\u00a0that he had deemed \"the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\" That leaves refugees and people entering the country on temporary visas, such as for business and tourism, barred from entering the country. The web sites of both agencies made no mention of the new order as of Sunday evening. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, echoed the sentiments of many Republicans when he praised Trump for his executive order, arguing that the U.S. vetting system was overdue for an overhaul. But he criticized the way it\u2019s been carried out. \"(The administration) failed to provide clear guidance on the policy which caused substantial confusion at the ports of entry,\"\u00a0Labrador said. \"Inadequate review and poor implementation of this executive action threatens to undermine otherwise sound policy.\" 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jH83mv NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28 in New York City. Protesters demonstrate against the Trump administration's refugee and immigration orders at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28 in New York City. (Stephanie Keith / Getty Images) Christi Parsons and Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporters President Trump defended his new immigration crackdown on Sunday as a stand against terrorism that will improve\u00a0American national security, even as the White House appeared to back away from a key element amid the chaos at U.S. airports over the weekend. Trump said in a written statement Sunday afternoon that his crackdown on admissions of travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries had nothing to do with religion but was instead \u201cabout terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d \u201cI have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d The statement came after the White House \u2014\u00a0facing a backlash from\u00a0lawmakers, including some Republicans \u2014\u00a0appeared to back down on one piece of the\u00a0new immigration order, signaling that travelers trying to enter the country from the\u00a0seven banned countries will be allowed in if they hold green cards. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that these legal permanent residents are exempt from the travel ban \u201cmoving forward,\u201d even though over the weekend other administration officials said the rule did apply to them. The apparent reversal came amid a national controversy over the new order that temporarily halts the entry of all refugees to the U.S. and any traveler from seven majority-Muslim countries:\u00a0Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\u00a0 Federal judges across the country have blocked parts of the president\u2019s executive action\u00a0since it came down on Friday, mostly preventing the deportation of some travelers who ran into the first wave of implementation. The back-and-forth over the green card holders reflected confusion about the policy, which also indefinitely bars Syrian refugees from entering the U.S.\u00a0 Lawyers for some of the affected immigrants said border agents were applying the rules differently. Further complicating the picture was a statement from the Department of Homeland Security asserting that its agents would enforce all of Trump\u2019s orders while also complying with judicial orders. As some of the orders block deportation, that left individual officers to try and figure out which priorities to honor. In the chaos, Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans waved red flags on Sunday, warning the administration to slow down and make sure the tough new rules were implemented with deliberation. U.S.  Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) blasted the Trump executive order for what they said was a \u201chasty\u201d implementation. \u201cIt is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. \u201cSuch a hasty process risks harmful results,\u201d the senators said. \u201cWe should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.\u201d Trump fired back with a late-afternoon tweet, saying their statement was \u201cwrong\u201d and that they are \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer\u00a0said Democrats will introduce legislation as soon as Monday to stop the president\u2019s\u00a0actions. House Democrats are taking similar legislative action, and lawmakers from both chambers will rally Monday evening at the Supreme Court to protest Trump's orders. \"This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\" said Schumer, the New York Democrat, choking up as he stood with immigrants and refugees at a news conference\u00a0Sunday. \"It must be reversed immediately.\" Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats\u00a0are exploring legal options, including an amicus\u00a0brief in support of the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0against\u00a0the actions. But the chances of passing a bill through the Republican-controlled Congress are slim, as most\u00a0GOP leaders and lawmakers have not objected to Trump's ban. White House officials on Sunday defended the Trump plan, insisting he took great care in crafting it. If the announcement came as a surprise to many, they say, that was by design. The White House did not want to tell too many people about it in advance, thinking that too much notice would compromise the strategy, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. \u201cThe people that needed to know, knew,\u201d he said Sunday on ABC. \u201cThe appropriate leadership was notified.\u201d Still\u00a0the confusion over the particulars was significant \u2014 especially on the question of the green cards. In explaining the new order, administration officials on Saturday told reporters\u00a0that the green card holders from the seven banned countries would have to get waivers in order to return to the U.S. after traveling outside the country. Speaking on condition of anonymity to reporters on Saturday, the White House official said green card holders from one of the seven affected countries who are currently outside the U.S.\u00a0would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the U.S., according to a pool reporter who was present. Those green card holders in the United States would have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, the official said. On Sunday, Priebus said otherwise. \u201cAs far as green card holders, moving forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d Priebus told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in an interview, adding that border officials still retain \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to hold people from the suspect countries before letting them enter the U.S. The interpretation of the new rules continued in foreign capitals, with British officials announcing publicly that they had gotten clarification from the U.S. government regarding U.S.-bound travelers from their country. \u201cIf you are a U.K. national who happens to be traveling from one of those [banned]\u00a0countries to the U.S., then the order does not apply to you, even if you were born in one of those countries,\" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement to British citizens. The only dual nationals who might have extra checks are those coming from one of the seven countries themselves, for example, a U.K.-Libya dual national coming from Libya to the U.S., Johnson\u2019s statement said. The White House did not immediately confirm the British summary.

Protesters gather at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Saturday to denounce President Trump's executive order banning immigrants from certain nations. (G. Morty Ortega / Getty Images) Matt Pearce and Shashank Bengali Contact Reporter Jeffrey Buchalter was reflooring\u00a0his foyer in Chesapeake Beach, Md., and listening to MSNBC over the weekend when he heard the news: An Iraqi who had worked with American forces as an interpreter had been stopped from entering the U.S.\u00a0under a new executive order on immigration from President Trump. The story stopped him cold. Buchalter, an Army veteran who works as a law-enforcement instructor\u00a0at the Department of Homeland Security, had served multiple tours of duty as a military policeman\u00a0in Iraq, service that cost him dearly. He was decorated for injuries sustained from gunfire and improvised explosive devices. Exams revealed he\u2019d suffered herniated discs, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he spent 2 \u00bd years at Walter Reed Army Medical Center trying to get right. Read the story But he was still alive, and now the married father of two children. And he believes that\u2019s thanks in part to the work of Iraqi interpreters who acted as guides during his work in their country.\u00a0So he told his younger daughter and son they were going to take a trip: a two-hour drive to Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., where, for the first time in his life, Buchalter would join a protest. \u201cThis is not what we fought for, having been in Iraq\u00a0and working with these interpreters,\u201d Buchalter said in a phone interview Sunday. When he saw an Iraqi family emerge from detention, he presented them with something he hoped would convey America\u2019s goodwill \u2014\u00a0a Purple Heart. \u201cKnowing their culture and how they view America, for me, it was a way to send a message to them:\u00a0What they believe America was, it is,\u201d Buchalter said. \u201cIt's the greatest place in the world.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order Friday to block travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations triggered confusion, fear and anger\u00a0around the nation as protesters and attorneys gathered at airports to try to force the release of at least dozens of travelers who had unexpectedly become detainees. Many of America\u2019s veterans were among those frustrated by the order, inspired largely by the story of Iraqi interpreter Hameed Khalid\u00a0Darweesh. Darweesh, 53, was detained after arriving\u00a0at John F. Kennedy International Airport\u00a0in New York, despite holding a\u00a0special immigrant visa granted to American military translators following a decade of what one U.S. official had deemed \u201cfaithful and valuable service to the United States\u201d in Iraq, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Darweesh\u00a0had worked for the U.S.\u00a0as an interpreter, engineer and contractor from 2003 to 2013, continuing even as Iraqi colleagues were assassinated for their work supporting the American invasion. Now he wanted to immigrate to the U.S. It\u00a0had taken Darweesh two years of interviews and security screenings to obtain the visa, but, for the moment, all that appeared to be suddenly worthless. Veterans were infuriated by his story. \u201cThe idea that we would be detaining Iraqi interpreters who put their lives on the line to help troops like myself in Iraq is disagraceful,\u201d wrote veteran\u00a0Jon Soltz, chairman of an Iraq\u00a0veterans\u2019 political action committee, VoteVets. The group launched a petition calling on Trump to rescind the visa restrictions and to provide aid for U.S. military interpreters. Those frustrated by Darweesh\u2019s treatment included one of his\u00a0former American colleagues in the 101st Airborne division, Brandon Friedman, who had met Darweesh as an infantry lieutenant when the division swept into Baghdad to drive out\u00a0the forces of Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein. \u201cHe was anti-Saddam and wanted to help us,\u201d said Friedman, who would go on to work in the Obama administration, recalling how Darweesh accompanied platoons on dangerous missions. \u201cThe guy was absolutely fearless. Guys in our company would go out in all the body armor and everything, and he would go out in khakis and a baseball cap, at least in the beginning.\u201d Not only was Darweesh\u2019s\u00a0work essential for soldiers to navigate Iraqi communities, but when a car bomb detonated near the unit\u2019s base,\u00a0\u201cHe was wounded himself, and he pulled wounded soldiers to safety,\u201d Friedman said. And now veterans who knew Darweesh were upset. \u201cIf you could see all the Facebook posts from guys in the unit this week, everybody loved him. He was just such an integral part of the unit,\u201d Friedman said.\u00a0Many veterans were \u201cabsolutely\u201d opposed to Trump\u2019s blanket exclusion of\u00a0military interpreters,\u00a0\u201cbecause if you've been over there, you know their importance,\u201d said Friedman. He called the ban \u201cdeplorable\u201d and said it gives interpreters less incentive to help U.S. troops in the future. As public scrutiny grew Saturday, protesters and immigration attorneys massed at airports around the nation, and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Darweesh\u2019s behalf. Darweesh was freed earlier in the day, and his ACLU lawsuit\u00a0later led to a late-night ruling from a federal judge in New York, who temporarily\u00a0barred American officials from deporting arriving travelers who otherwise had legal travel documents. But the executive order still makes life uncertain for other Muslims abroad who had assisted the American military and whose hopes for entry to the U.S. have dimmed. Chase Millsap, a former Marine infantry officer who served multiple tours in Iraq, has been trying to help a former Iraqi soldier he served with to gain asylum in the U.S. The Iraqi man, whose name Millsap asked be withheld for his safety, fled with his family to southern Turkey in 2014, after Islamic State militants reached the outskirts of Baghdad and began hunting for the soldier\u2019s Shiite family, Millsap said. The soldier, whom Millsap nicknamed \u201cthe Captain,\u201d applied for refugee status through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services but has been waiting for a decision for nearly three years. \u201cThis ban sets the clock back even further \u2014 at least 120 days, and after that who knows if they\u2019re going to pick it back up,\u201d said Millsap, now a writer and filmmaker in Los Angeles. On Friday, after Trump signed the order, Millsap called his friend in Turkey and broke the news. The Iraqi man, who has a wife and two children, and also supports his sister and her three kids, had been taking English classes in anticipation of being allowed to immigrate to the U.S. \u201cFor me, it was a punch to the gut,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cI had to tell him we\u2019ve left him behind and we\u2019re not going to step up and do the right thing, at least right now. \u201cFor him, it was really sad. I could tell the frustration in his voice.\u201d Millsap said he had been heartened by the ad hoc coalition of lawyers, human rights advocates and veterans from all branches of the military that was speaking up on behalf of Iraqis and others affected by Trump\u2019s ban. \u201cThis is very apolitical,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cThese are people who served directly alongside of us. For us, it\u2019s very simple to say we need to help them. A lot of these guys are directly under threat and going underground. Let\u2019s make sure they have a path to safety.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Have the women\u2019s marches started a movement? \u00a0 In the presidential election, just seven of L.A.\u2019s 1,700 precincts went for Trump. \u00a0 In a fiery State of the State, Brown returned to a familiar conclusion. \u00a0 Prosecutors believed two officers feared for their lives when they fatally shot Ezell Ford in 2014. \u00a0 'La La Land' danced its way to 14 Oscar nominations. \u00a0 Mary Tyler Moore \u00a0was a beloved TV icon who symbolized the independent career woman.\u00a0Chinese New Year begins this weekend.

Leaders React to Trump's Order Several Republicans spoke out on Sunday in response to President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on immigration from seven countries. Senator John McCain said he feared it would provide propaganda for the Islamic State. By ELSA BUTLER on Publish Date January 29, 2017. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 A growing group of Republican lawmakers criticized President Trump\u2019s refugee policy on Sunday even as party leaders in Congress continued to show restraint. The executive order Mr. Trump issued on Friday, which targets Syrian refugees and all travelers from several predominantly Muslim nations, had drawn little dissent from Republicans initially even as Democrats denounced it and protests erupted around the country and the world. But on Sunday, several members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party said that the process, while initiated with the right intention, had been too hastily enacted and warned that it could backfire against United States interests. Two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, led the criticism, saying in a statement that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was not properly vetted and that it could be seen as the United States turning its back on Muslims who had risked their lives to serve as interpreters for the country\u2019s military and diplomats. \u201cUltimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\u201d they said, adding, \u201cThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McCain also said the plan was carried out without proper consultation of United States allies and that it mistakenly lumped together the country\u2019s adversaries, like Iran, with allies, like Iraq. Republicans have largely supported Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive agenda, but in his first major decision on national security, he is finding uncharacteristic opposition from his party in the blush of his early days in office. Mr. Trump did not take well to the input, singling out Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter as \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two... \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 29, 2017 ...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 29, 2017 But as they day went on, they were not alone in their criticisms. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that while he supported stronger screening, the order had been \u201cpoorly implemented,\u201d especially for green card holders. \u201cThe administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated,\u201d Mr. Corker said. Indeed, the administration moved to ease some of those concerns late Sunday, when the Department of Homeland Security announced that lawful permanent residents would be exempt from the ban. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, likewise said the order was \u201coverly broad\u201d and that the blanket travel ban \u201cgoes to far.\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seemed to echo those criticisms, adding that \u201cwhile not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one, which is inconsistent with our American character.\u201d Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio, went further, questioning the hastiness of the order\u2019s rollout and calling for a re-evaluation of the White House\u2019s unilateral effort. \u201cIn my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security and again for this notion that America has always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,\u201d Mr. Portman said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Similar concerns were voiced by some Republicans in the House. Most prominent among them was Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who said that \u201cit was clear\u201d that adjustments were needed to the order, but defended it in principle. Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a former undercover C.I.A. officer, called the measure \u201cthe ultimate display of mistrust\u201d that would \u201cerode our allies\u2019 willingness to fight with us\u201d and put Americans at risk. Advertisement A handful of other Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, also offered criticism, though more cautious, on Saturday.

Privacy Policy The Republican leadership \u2014 and senior members of the House \u2014 have either supported Mr. Trump or been largely silent about the order. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that the United States did not make policy based on religion, though his criticism was muted compared with his colleagues\u2019. Speaker Paul D. Ryan released a statement on Friday praising the order, but his aides repeatedly declined requests for further comment. Mr. McConnell cautioned against vilifying Muslims who are key allies in the American war on terror. The country, he said, needed to \u201cbe careful\u201d with how the order is carried out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think we need to be careful. We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d As tensions mount, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will be debated on Capitol Hill this week. Democrats pledged on Sunday to introduce legislation undoing them and limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s executive authority. And the measure could add pressure to Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to lead the Justice and State Departments, who will probably be asked to offer their positions on the ban. Some Republicans compared the order to a measure that overwhelmingly passed the House in 2015 not long after the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris . But that bill was far less broad than Mr. Trump\u2019s order, focusing narrowly on the screening process for Syrians and Iraqis who entered the United States as refugees. That bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate , who argued that it too closely mirrored Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign talk of a Muslim ban, and congressional Republicans largely put off the issue during the rest of the campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s order, which was enacted on Friday, halted the entry into the United States of all refugees for 120 days, barred the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspended for 90 days the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 all predominantly Muslim countries. It prompted chaos across the globe as the United States\u2019 borders were sealed off to the affected groups and the Department of Homeland Security rushed to apply uneven enforcement. By Saturday night, judges in at least two states had issued stays preventing the government from deporting certain arrivals caught in the rollout of the order. Democrats were nearly united in their condemnation of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, with several of them rushing to airports to speak out in defense of people who had been detained and even those representing states that Mr. Trump won voicing dissent. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse the action on Sunday, saying it made the country \u201cless humanitarian, less safe, less American.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt must be reversed immediately, and Democrats are going to introduce legislation to overturn it,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters gathered for a news conference in New York. Republicans who spoke out were more measured, directing their criticism at the planning for the policy and its carrying out, though their disagreement with Mr. Trump was still clear. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, wrote on the website Medium that the president \u201cand his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.\u201d Mr. Sasse said Mr. Trump was right to focus on border security but disagreed with how he was carrying out the policy. And Representative Barbara Comstock, a Republican whose Northern Virginia district includes a large Muslim population, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s action had gone \u201cbeyond the increased vetting actions the Congress has supported.\u201d Jennifer Steinhauer and Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.

Caption Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president. Jan. 28, 2017 People protest the Muslim immigration ban at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. President Trump signed an executive order that halted refugees and residents from certain predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants, refugees and U.S. legal residents \u2014 green-card holders \u2014 from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen. People subject to being denied entry include dual nationals, who are those born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom. While lawyers are still reviewing a federal court\u2019s temporary stay, administration officials said they believe it is possible for the White House to both comply with the judge\u2019s order and continue enforcing Trump\u2019s executive action. Their thinking is that the judge\u2019s order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the judge\u2019s order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place. The officials pointed out that while the order affects specifically deportations, the travelers currently stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States. That interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo. Just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world \u2014 a horrible mess!\u201d Later in the morning, Trump tweeted, \u201cChristians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d The president\u2019s aggressive action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, but also from a growing number of lawmakers in his own party. \u201cYou have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright. Leaders of the influential Koch network on Sunday also expressed opposition to the controversial ban, it is not in keeping with their aims to build a free and open society. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies.\u201d But Republican leaders in Congress on Sunday did not join the opposition to Trump\u2019s order. \u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d He cautioned that the United States doesn\u2019t have a religious test for entry into the country, and stopped short of saying that Trump\u2019s action amounted to a Muslim ban. \u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security noted that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order \u2014 though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country Saturday was one of widespread uncertainty and even chaos at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Federal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of President Trump\u2019s action flooded courtrooms from coast to coast. Late Saturday, a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in Virginia, Seattle and Boston. In Brooklyn, Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportations after determining that the risk of injury to those detained by being returned to their home countries necessitated the decision. Next came a temporary restraining order by District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, who blocked for seven days the removal of any green-card holders detained at Dulles International Airport. Brinkema\u2019s action also ordered that lawyers have access to those held there because of the ban. In Seattle, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas S. Zilly granted an emergency stay preventing the deportation of two people had been detained at the Sea-Tac International Airport, according to the ACLU of Washington, which joined other advocates in filing an emergency motion. The two people remain in federal custody and will have a hearing later this week, the group said. Just before 2 a.m. Sunday in Boston, two federal judges ruled for two University of Massachusetts Dartmouth associate professors \u2014 Iranian nationals who are permanent legal residents in the United States \u2014 who were held at Logan International Airport when they landed after travel for an academic conference. The judges there also put a seven-day restraining order on Trump\u2019s executive action. It allows any approved refugee, visa holder, or green-card holder to fly into Boston over the next 7 days and requires Customs and Border Protection to notify airlines that fly into Logan Airport that those passengers will not be detained or forced to return. The ruling applies only to Massachusetts. The president\u2019s order also triggered harsh reactions from key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Lawyers and advocates for immigrants are advising them to seek asylum in Canada. [ The tumultuous politics of U.S. immigration policy, from Roosevelt to Trump ] Yet Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and impose what became known as his \u201cMuslim ban,\u2019\u2019 was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday in the Oval Office. \u201cYou see it at the airports, you see it all over. It\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d In New York, Donnelly seemed to have little patience for the government\u2019s arguments, which focused heavily on the fact that the two defendants named in the lawsuit had already been released. Donnelly noted that those detained were suffering mostly from the bad fortune of traveling while the ban went into effect. \u201cOur own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\u201d she said at one point, noting that, had it been two days earlier, those detained would have been granted admission without question. During the hearing, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt informed the court that he had received word of a deportation to Syria, scheduled within the hour. That prompted Donnelly to ask if the government could assure that the person would not suffer irreparable harm. Receiving no such assurance, she granted the stay to the broad group included in the ACLU\u2019s request. A senior Department of Homeland Security official said late Saturday that 109 people had been denied entry into the United States. All had been in transit when Trump signed the order, he said, and some had already departed the United States on flights by late Saturday while others were still being detained awaiting flights. Also, 173 people had not been allowed to board U.S.-bound planes at foreign airports. The protests that had begun at airports around the country on Saturday continued on Sunday, with crowds swelling in terminals from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles and places in between. In Washington, protestors flocked to Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport. By early afternoon, a raucous crowd of demonstrators filled Lafayette Square and part of Pennsylvania Avenue. Fencing that remained from the recent inauguration kept them from getting closer to the gates of the White House.

U.S. Central Command announced Sunday that the casualties were sustained in an operation against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our elite servicemembers,\" Commander of U.S. Central Command Gen. Joseph Votel said in a statement. \"The sacrifices are very profound in our fight against terrorists who threaten innocent peoples across the globe.\" In a statement released Sunday, President Trump expressed his condolences: \"Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. The sacrifices made by the men and women of our armed forces, and the families they leave behind, are the backbone of the liberty we hold so dear as Americans, united in our pursuit of a safer nation and a freer world.\" The Pentagon says the three service members were wounded in a raid, and another member of the military was injured when an aircraft had to make a \"hard landing at a nearby location.\" That aircraft was intentionally destroyed afterward.

Alice reports that a local official, speaking on condition of anonymity, says he believes three children and six women were among 40 people killed in the raid, which took place in the central Yemeni province of Bayda. Fourteen members of AQAP were killed in the raid, according to Central Command, and U.S. military captured information \"that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots.\" Of those AQAP members killed in the operation, Yemeni officials report that three were senior members of the local al-Qaida affiliate, according to The Associated Press.

Attorneys struggled to determine how many people were affected by the rules, which Mr. Trump said Saturday were \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d But critics described widespread confusion, with travelers being held in legal limbo because of ill-defined procedures. Some lawyers manned tables at New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport to offer help to families with detained relatives. Demonstrators denounce president's order which blocks refugees from entering the country and imposes ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority nat... \u201cWe just simply don\u2019t know how many people there are and where they are,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. Advocates for travelers say they did not have clear picture about what\u2019s happening and that the chaos is likely to continue. The executive director of National Immigration Law Center, Marielena Hincapie, said \u201cthis is just the beginning.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really in a crisis mode, a constitutional crisis mode in our country, and we\u2019re going to need everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is definitely one of those all-hands-on-deck moments.\u201d Protests were planned or underway Sunday, including one in suburban Chicago organized by Jewish groups to show support for Muslims, as well as at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., and Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Thousands of protesters streamed into New York City\u2019s Battery Park, gathering Sunday near the ferries that carry tourists to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the place where 12 million people entered the United States in the golden age of immigration. Make that 10,000 (and growing!) https://t.co/xS1Om0ZTcs \u2014 NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) January 29, 2017 U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer \u00a0addressed the crowd, saying, \u201cWe are gonna win this fight everybody!\u201d People held signs with slogans including \u201cAmerica was built by refugees,\u201d and \u201cMuslim ban is un-American.\u201d The rally followed a night of big demonstrations at New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport, where thousands of people spontaneously gathered to demand the release of detained travelers. Schumer also appeared alongside refugees and their families to denounce the ban at a press conference in New York City late Sunday morning, CBS New York reported. \u201cDonald Trump seems to want us to believe that immigrants are terrorists and criminals but look at these families, they are the promise of America,\u201d Schumer said. \u00a0 In Washington, massive crowds gathered at the White House Sunday to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, CBS affiliate WUSA reported. #BREAKING : Massive crowds have gathered at the White House to protest @POTUS immigration plan.

Thousands chant \"No Muslim Ban\" and \"No hate no fear immigrants are welcome here\" #wbz pic.twitter.com/K2tGINmTL9 \u2014 Paul Burton (@PaulWBZ) January 29, 2017 A federal judge in New York issued an order Saturday temporarily blocking the government from deporting people with valid visas who arrived after Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban took effect. But confusion remained about who could stay and who will be kept out of the country in the coming weeks. Federal courts in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state took similar action. Michigan\u2019s civil rights chief, Agustin Arbulu, condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying he hoped the federal court ruling would led him to narrow its scope. \u201cDuring this time of uncertainty and confusion, we urge everyone to act with restraint and not in ways that foster fear and division,\u201d Arbulu said. Criticism also continued abroad. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini, lashed out at Mr. Trump on Sunday, insisting that instead of building walls, the continent will \u201ccelebrate\u201d every wall which is torn down and \u201cevery new bridge that is built up.\u201d Among those caught in limbo: Iraqis who had been promised a life in America because of their service to the U.S. military, frail and elderly travelers from Iran and Yemen, and longtime U.S. residents traveling abroad who don\u2019t know if they will be allowed to return home. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? What\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d asked Mohammed al Rawi, an Iraqi-born American citizen in the Los Angeles area, after his 69-year-old father, coming to visit his grandchildren in California, was abruptly detained and sent back to Iraq after 12 hours in custody. \u201cAre they going to create camps for Muslims and put us in it?\u201d On Saturday, large protests erupted at airports throughout the country where travelers were being held, a day after Mr. Trump signed the order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. Mr. Trump also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. An official with the Department of Homeland Security who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The lawmakers arrived after 3 p.m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and \u201cthey said we\u2019ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,\u201d according to Mr. Connolly. \u201cI said that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That\u2019s where the problem is, and that\u2019s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable.\u201d The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to \u201cclaw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mayors of Dallas, Chicago and Boston spoke out as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. \u201cWe have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\u201d he said. The order roiled relations with America\u2019s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Saturday, said she reminded him of the obligation of the United States to take refugees under the Geneva Conventions . Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Sunday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did \u201cnot agree with this kind of approach.\u201d The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump\u2019s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. \u201cShame,\u201d they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d \u201cNo hate, no fear,\u201d they added later. \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from inauguration day prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,\u201d Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. \u201cThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles and David Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the issue. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, co-chairman of the Kochs\u2019 donor network. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive.\u201d Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d and urged the president to \u201cmake appropriate revisions.\u201d Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. \u201cThey are sadly weak on immigration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSenators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Michael D.

    "text": "Catholic bishop attacked on altar during Mass for baseball Hall of Famer Published               January 29, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print The Most Reverend Manuel A. Cruz, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark. (Archdiocese of Newark) A Catholic bishop in New Jersey was slightly injured during a memorial Mass for a revered Hall of Fame baseball player when a crazed man in a white robe walked up to the altar and punched him in the mouth. The attack Saturday caught the 63-year-old Most Reverend Manuel A. Cruz, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark, completely by surprise, knocking him backward until he fell on the altar, according Tapinto.net , a local news website. Officers with the Essex County Sheriff\u2019s Office rushed the altar and handcuffed the attacker, who may have showed up for the Mass at Newark\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in a classic purple Cadillac Eldorado with a faux-zebra skin interior, the website reported. About 75 people witnessed the attack, according to the website reported. The Mass was being held to commemorate the life of baseball great Roberto Clemente, who died in a 1972 plane crash as he flew to Nicaragua to deliver aid to earthquake victims. \u201cWe are all praying for Bishop Cruz,\u201d said Newark elected official Luis Quintana, who organized the Mass and was in tears when he spoke to Tapinto. \u201cIt's hard to understand what would provoke a man to attack a member of the clergy within the sanctity of a church. It just doesn't make any sense.\u201d The punch may have loosened some of Cruz\u2019s teeth, according to the website. Cruz was taken to the hospital for treatment and authorities said his injuries were not serious, the Newark Star-Ledger reported. Officers told the paper the man who was arrested for the assault was Charles Miller, a 48-year-old Newark man. Officials weren\u2019t saying why Miller punched Cruz. \u201cWe are thankful that law enforcement officers were able to apprehend the assailant,\u201d said James Goodness, spokesman for the Newark Archdiocese. \u201cThis is not something that we expect to happen in any of our churches.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 11:02 AM EST At the Pentagon for a swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Ret. Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump signed two executive actions -- one on rebuilding the military and one making major changes to America\u2019s policies on refugees and immigration. \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d the president told an audience at the Pentagon Friday. Donald Trump calls for \u201cextreme\u201d ideological screening test for new immigrants Hours later the White House released details of the executive order titled \u201cProtecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States.\u201d It indefinitely suspends the United States\u2019 Syrian refugees program, which Trump had vowed to do on the campaign trail.\u00a0 U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order he said would impose tighter vetting to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States at the Pentagon in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2017. REUTERS It says \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and suspends \u201cany such entry\u201d until the president has determined that \u201csufficient changes have been made to the USRAP [U.S. Refugee Admissions Program] to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\u201d Trump\u2019s order directs the State Department to stop issuing visas to Syrian nationals and halts the processing of Syrian refugees. That will remain in effect until Trump determines that enough security changes have been made to ensure that would-be terrorists can\u2019t exploit weaknesses in the current vetting system.\u00a0 The president, during his signing of the order at the Department of Homeland Security, also called on the Pentagon and the State Department to create a plan for safe zones in and around Syria to offer protection for Syrians fleeing the war there. But the signed order itself makes no mention of a plan for safe zones in Syria. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation. Several other points included in the action: Trump ordered a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is America\u2019s broader refugee program. The suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the United States. \u00a0 The executive action appears to be capping the number of refugees from other countries at 50,000 people in in fiscal year 2017, saying more than that \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 The action says that when U.S. Refugee Admissions Program admissions resume, the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, \u201cto prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s order did not spell out specifically what additional steps he wants to see the Homeland Security and State departments to add to the country\u2019s vetting system for refugees. Instead he directed officials to the review the refugee application and approval process to find any other security measures that can be added to prevent people who pose a threat from using the refugee program. Trump\u2019s executive order suspends all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. It was unclear from the law cited in the order which countries would be affected, though a draft of the order pointed to a legal provision that identified Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, all majority-Muslim countries, for at least 30 days. The order also calls for Homeland Security and State Department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that don\u2019t provide it. The order says the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States. In a portion of an interview released Friday, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that one group of refugees could look forward to some relief. He told the Christain Broadcasting Network that Christians in Syria find it \u201calmost impossible to get into the United States.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThe reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody -- but more so the Christians,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Christians comprise about 10 percent of the Syrian population, according to the CIA World Fact Book. Before the details of the action came to light, uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s plans to ban immigrants from certain countries from entering the U.S. caused stress among some already. Nuha Alsakkaff fled her war-torn country of Yemen six years ago. CBS Evening News Nuha Alsakkaff, 26, fled her war-torn country of Yemen more than six years ago. Alsakkaff is now a U.S citizen and is trying to get the rest of her family here, too. But if immigrants from Yemen are banned, she says she\u2019ll be devastated. \u201cI can\u2019t save my people. I can\u2019t save my family,\u201d she told CBS News . ",
