President Trump signed documents inviting the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline to resubmit a proposal for the project , which the Obama administration rejected in 2015, and instructing the Army to expedite the review and approval process for the section of the Dakota Access Pipeline that hasn't been built. \"We're going to renegotiate some of the terms, and if they'd like, we'll see if they can get the pipeline built,\" Trump said of the Keystone XL pipeline. \"This not a done deal,\" Bill McKibben of the group 350.org , which has lobbied against pipelines for years, said in a statement. He called the pipelines \"unwise and immoral\" because they contribute to climate change. Trump also signed a document requesting a federal plan to incentivize the use of U.S.-made pipes for pipeline projects. Proposed And Existing TransCanada Pipelines Source: TransCanada Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe and Alyson Hurt / NPR The lobbying group representing the petroleum industry issued a statement in favor of the policy reversal. A spokesperson for the TransCanada company, which proposed the Keystone XL project, said the company was preparing to resubmit a proposal. Energy Transfer Partners, which is building the nearly completed Dakota Access Pipeline, did not immediately comment. Article continues after sponsorship Both the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline provoked protests from a diverse group of citizens concerned about the climate impacts and potential environmental contamination from the projects, as well as the safety of their routes across large swaths of the country and the mechanisms by which the federal government approved those routes. Dozens, Including Sierra Club Director, Arrested At White House Keystone Protest McKibben promised to fight the president's move, saying, \"The last time around, TransCanada was so confident they literally mowed the strip where they planned to build the pipeline, before people power stopped them. People will mobilize again.\" A portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline is under review by the Army Corps of Engineers, which announced last week that it was gathering information for an environmental assessment of a crossing under the Missouri River in North Dakota \u2014 an area that the nearby Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is sacred land. Demonstrators, sometimes numbering in the thousands, set up several camps on occupied land near the proposed crossing site beginning last summer, in support of the Standing Rock Sioux. The tribe filed a lawsuit against the federal government to block the pipeline, which was retracted earlier this month. The protests diminished after the Army Corps blocked the final permit in December and announced it would reassess the pipeline route, taking into account concerns about the risk of water contamination and allegations that the tribe was not adequately consulted about a route that violated sacred land. On Tuesday, the tribe released a statement through the American Civil Liberties Union, promising to take legal action against the federal government. In Victory For Protesters, Army Halts Construction Of Dakota Pipeline \"Trump's decision to give the go-ahead for the Dakota Access Pipeline is a slap in the face to Native Americans and a blatant disregard for the rights to their land,\" it stated. The tribe also addressed the president's stated plan to streamline what he called the \"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process\" for environmental reviews of pipeline and manufacturing projects. \"The Trump administration should allow careful environmental impact analysis to be completed with full and meaningful participation of affected tribes,\" the Standing Rock Sioux wrote in its statement. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota released a statement praising the president's actions, calling the pipelines \"crucial energy infrastructure projects\" and saying they would create jobs. Demonstrators remain camped on the North Dakota prairie in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They've winterized tents and other structures.

They've winterized tents and other structures. Amy Sisk/Prairie Public Radio Amy Sisk of Prairie Public Radio was at the site on Tuesday and reports that demonstrators remain camped on the North Dakota prairie near the site where the Dakota Access Pipeline's slated to cross under the Missouri River. \"They're living in winterized tents, tepees and wooden structures, many keeping warm by fireplaces installed inside their makeshift homes,\" she tells us. \"Demonstrations have slowed this winter in the wake of the December announcement that the Army Corps of Engineers would launch a new environmental review of the pipeline. Word that Trump has begun the process of expediting this review and advancing the project spread quickly through camp Tuesday. For many, this did not come as a surprise. \"Protesters vow to continue their stand against the pipeline. But the camp's future is in limbo, amid flooding concerns after a heavy winter snowfall. And the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked protesters to leave. Some I talked to are moving to higher ground so as to avoid the floodplain, yet continue the fight as the Trump administration weighs in.\" ",

    "text": "News Watchdog The Price of Pork Proposed hog confinement killed after rural neighbors speak out Several residents from around Illinois spoke out against hog confinements during a news conference organized by the\u00a0Illinois Citizens for Clean Air & Water at the Capitol in Springfield. Gary Marx and David Jackson Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Facing opposition from local farmers, one of the state's largest pork producers has pulled its application to build a hog confinement in downstate Fulton County, handing opponents a rare victory in their efforts to slow the growth of the massive livestock facilities in the state. The hog producer, an affiliate of Professional Swine Management, formally withdrew its notice of intent to construct from the Illinois Department of Agriculture last week after sustained protests from neighbors who feared that waste from the proposed 20,000-hog confinement could foul rivers and creeks, and that the operation might ruin roads and jeopardize their rural way of life. \"It's a great thing,\" said Fulton County crop and livestock farmer Matt Howe, referring to the decision to cancel plans for the hog confinement. \"Twenty-thousand animals is a monstrosity. I don't count it as agriculture.\" Two weeks ago, Howe resigned from the Fulton County Farm Bureau's board of directors to protest the group's apparent support for the facility, initially called Cleer Farm and recently changed to Memory Lane Acres. Howe said his own farm and home sit just 3,000 feet from the proposed site. Last Wednesday, the Fulton County Farm Bureau held a meeting in which a handful of farmers voiced continued opposition to the facility, according to Farm Bureau officials and participants. \"They wanted to know our concerns with the hog confinement and why we were opposing it,\" said farmer Craig Porter, who is also a member of the local Isabel Township Board. The next day, Professional Swine Management pulled the plug on the project, though the company could submit a new application that would restart the permitting process, state agricultural officials told the Tribune. Officials with Professional Swine Management could not be reached for comment. Company officials said last month that they would not comment on their plans in Fulton County or any aspects of their business. PRICE OF PORK: Read the series Open link County farm bureaus are part of a politically influential statewide network that says it is dedicated to family farmers but has been criticized for promoting industrial-scale food production. Bill Carlberg, president of the Fulton County Farm Bureau, told the Tribune in a written statement that \"our members had questions and concerns about the Memory Lane farms project, which they expressed to us at a recent meeting.\" The decision to cancel Memory Lane Acres is not the only recent setback for Professional Swine Management, which over the years has withstood periodic opposition from local residents and environmental groups to install 27 hog operations in Illinois, Iowa and Missouri with a total of more than 120,000 sows. In nearby Bernadotte Township, the company's Runway Ridge facility, a proposed 20,000-hog confinement located on farmland near the famed Spoon River, also has stalled in the face of opposition. The Tribune highlighted Fulton County residents' battle against Runway Ridge and Memory Lane Acres as part of its ongoing series, \"The Price of Pork.\" Holding thousands of pigs at a time, modern livestock confinements are designed to store millions of gallons of manure, then apply the waste as fertilizer to nearby farmland. But pollution incidents tied to Illinois hog confinements killed 492,000 fish and impaired 67 miles of streams from 2005... (David Jackson, Gary Marx, Ryan Marx) Waste spills from hog confinements accounted for nearly half of the 1 million fish killed in Illinois water pollution incidents from 2005 to 2014, killing at least 492,000 fish and impairing 67 miles of waterways, the Tribune found. Fulton County commissioners on Dec. 13 passed a resolution urging the state to halt action on Runway Ridge and all new large confinements in the county until \"there is meaningful reform\" to the state law that governs the construction and oversight of the massive livestock operations. The law gives Illinois communities little if any power over the siting of new confinements. The Fulton County resolution urged lawmakers to give communities a voice and \"protect citizens of all counties in the state of Illinois.\" On Tuesday, Howe, Porter and a dozen other small farmers and residents gathered at the state Capitol building in Springfield to launch an effort to persuade legislators to strengthen the Livestock Management Facilities Act, which governs the permitting and siting of hog confinements. Citing the Tribune investigation and describing noxious odors, declining property values, damaged roads and other problems associated with confinements, the speakers urged state legislators to give local authorities the power to approve or deny permits for constructing the massive facilities. \"The LMFA is a toothless tiger,\" said Judy Koehler, a former Republican state representative and Illinois Appellate Court justice who owns land near a hog confinement in western Illinois. \"It is working for 'Big Ag' against the little guy, the family farm.\" Past efforts in Illinois to toughen the livestock facilities law stalled in the face of strong opposition from rural lawmakers backed by farm and livestock associations. But Karen Hudson, co-founder of Illinois Citizens for Clean Air & Water and a longtime critic of confinements, said she hopes the balance of power may be shifting as more local farmers join environmentalists in opposing the livestock facilities. \"We have a growing number of Farm Bureau farmers who are being affected and who are stepping forward,\" Hudson said. Sen. Andy Manar, a Democrat from Bunker Hill who is on the Agriculture Committee, said he would support closing what's known as the \"expansion loophole\" in the law. Currently, many large hog confinements in the state can grow dramatically in size with little or no public input. \"This is a place where we could potentially move forward,\" Manar said. Broader changes would be difficult given the political divisions in Springfield, he added. Another committee member, Democratic Sen. David Koehler of Peoria, said Tuesday that he is committed to reviewing the state livestock facilities act to ensure that current laws protect citizens while at the same time being \"sensitive to the needs of legitimate producers.\" \"Do we have adequate laws and do we have adequate enforcement and do we have adequate transparency? \u2026 I'm just not sure we have a well-functioning system right now,\" said Koehler, who is no relation to Judy Koehler. Republican Rep. Charlie Meier, a grain and livestock farmer from Okawville, cautioned against giving local counties control over the siting of livestock confinements, saying they don't have the necessary expertise or funds to regulate the massive facilities. \"One in six jobs in the state of Illinois are agriculture,\" Meier told the Tribune. \"We need to protect the last thriving business in the state of Illinois.\" ",

Those figures appear to come from two different studies. A 2012 Pew report found millions of invalid voter registrations due to people moving or dying. But the author of that report, David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, tweeted back in late November that this isn't voter fraud. \"We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted,\" he said . On Tuesday, Becker added , \"As I've noted before, voting integrity better in this election than ever before. Zero evidence of fraud.\" The second study was a highly criticized work by Old Dominion University professors who found 14 percent of non-citizens said saying they were registered to vote. The study was based on a sample of a few hundred respondents. During the campaign season, one of the authors said the Trump campaign was exaggerating the study's findings. \"Both sides of the debate on non-citizen voting have exaggerated our findings concerning non-citizen representation,\" political scientist Jesse Richman wrote . \"There are many on the left side of that debate who have relentlessly sought to discredit our results and want to push the level of estimated non-citizen participation to zero. On the right there has been a tendency to misread our results as proof of massive voter fraud, which we don't think they are. Our focus has been on the data, rather than the politics.\" The National Association of Secretaries of State on Tuesday reiterated in a statement the organization's confidence in the lead-up to the 2016 election in the \"systemic integrity of our election process as a bipartisan group.\" \"We are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump, but we are open to learning more about the Administration's concerns,\" the statement read. Spicer on Tuesday said Trump is \"very comfortable\" with his win and likely won't call for an investigation despite alleging widespread fraud. However, the issue is clearly a sore spot for the White House. Two sources told NBC News that Trump reportedly spent the first 10 minutes of his bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders at the White House on Monday night repeating relitigating claims that the millions of votes casts by \"illegals\" cost him the popular vote. The claim is unverified and is one that Trump initially made in November after it became clear that he lost the popular vote to Clinton . Clinton's popular vote margin eventually grew to 2.9 million votes. Some clearly frustrated Republican lawmakers begged Trump to stop repeating the fiction. \"To continue to suggest that the 2016 election was conducted in a fashion that millions of people voted illegally undermines faith in our democracy,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham , of South Carolina, told reporters in a hallway of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in D.C. \"It's not coming from a candidate for the office, it's coming from the man who holds the office. So I am begging the president, share with us the information you have about this or please stop saying it.\" President Donald Trump meets with CEO of General Motors Mary Barra, left, CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Sergio Marchionne, right, and other auto industry leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Jan. 24. Shawn Thew / Pool via Getty Images Republicans questioned about Trump's claim were careful not to weigh in on the president's specific comments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not answer whether he agreed with Trump's claim that millions voted illegally, but said, \"the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true.\" Others such as Senators John Thune, R-South Dakota and Cory Gardner, R-Colorado., both members of leadership also walked a very fine line, refusing to agree with the president but refusing to denounce him either. \"I don't know what that number is. You'll have to get that information for him. But like the leader said, there's always a certain amount of irregularity that goes on in elections - someplace perhaps more so than others. How you quantify that I'm not sure but he must have his methodology,\" Thune said. Trump's remarks were denounced by Democratic elected officials in Washington and nationwide, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, laying into the White House for propagating the inaccurate voter fraud claims. Sanders called the claims \"nonsensical\" and \"delusional.\" \"When Trump talks about 3 to 5 million people voting illegally he is sending a message to every Republican governor in this country to go forward with voter suppression,\" Sanders warned.

At President Trump\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, environmental professors like Bethany Wiggin listened carefully to candidate Trump talk about climate change, which is why she, her colleagues and her students are now racing to back up on other servers information available on government websites, CBS News\u2019 Jim Axelrod reported. \u00a0 Temporary restrictions announced on Tuesday -- that EPA employees can no longer post or blog from government accounts -- stoked their fears that the administration will limit access to data as it rolls back environmental protections. \u201cI\u2019m really worried that the facts might become more difficult to access,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s kind of a vulnerability of internet materials already, she said. \u201cThey become more vulnerable still when controlled by an administration who finds them inconvenient.\u201d\u00a0 Staff at the Agriculture Department have also received orders not to release any documents to the public. \u201cThis includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds and social media content,\u201d read the email memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press. Agricultural Research Service spokesman Christopher Bentley said the ban would not include scientific publications released through peer-reviewed professional journals. \u201cAs the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s chief scientific in-house research agency, ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America,\u201d Bentley said, according to a statement. The agency said that \u201cinformation on our projects, people and locations\u201d would still be available on its website. AP reported over the weekend that staff at the Interior Department were temporarily ordered to stop making posts to its Twitter account. The prohibition came after the official account of the National Park Service, a bureau of the department, retweeted a pair of posts to its 315,000 followers that seemed to be a swipe at Trump on his initial day in office. The first was a photo that compared the crowd gathered on the National Mall for Trump to the much-larger gathering that stood in the same spot eight years earlier for President Barack Obama\u2019s swearing-in. Trump later falsely claimed that more than 1 million people attended his inauguration, which Spicer insisted was the most-watched in history. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Edward Majerczyk, 29, also was ordered to pay $5,700 in restitution for counseling services for one undisclosed celebrity victim whose photos were disseminated online. Majerczyk is accused of orchestrating a \"phishing scheme\" that illegally accessed more than 300 email and other online accounts, including those belonging to actress Jennifer Lawrence. According to his plea deal, Majerczyk sent emails to his victims that appeared to have come from internet service providers seeking usernames and passwords. Majerczyk illegally accessed the accounts of those people who provided that information. Majerczyk pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles last year to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information. He signed a plea agreement for his case to be transferred to Chicago. He was not charged or accused of selling or posting the material online. Both sides agreed he should receive a 9-month prison term. The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Majerczyk's attorney Thomas Needham said in a court filing that his client was \"suffering from depression and looked to pornography websites and internet chat rooms in an attempt to fill some of the voids and disappointment he was feeling in his life.\" Needham said in a sentencing memo that the fallout from the hacking scandal \"deeply affected\" Majerczyk, who has seen a therapist for anxiety and panic attacks. Federal agents have said Lawrence broke down and became distraught during a 2014 meeting about nude photos of her that appeared online. Lawrence called the leak a \"sex crime\" in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine. Pennsylvania man pleads guilty to 'Celebgate' nude-photo hack Majerczyk is the second man arrested in connection with the \"Celebgate\" scandal of 2014. A\u00a0Pennsylvania man, Ryan Collins, 36, pled\u00a0guilty to a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and was sentenced to 18 months in October 2016. The FBI said Collins engaged in a similar \"phishing scheme\" to obtain access to his victims' accounts by sending emails\u00a0that appeared to be from Apple or Google, asking for\u00a0usernames and passwords.\u00a0When the victims complied (FBI Tip #1: Don't ever do this),\u00a0Collins used his illicit access to steal \"personal information including nude photographs and videos\" from his victims' accounts. As with Majerczyk, Collins was not charged with actually sharing or uploading the private photos of female celebrities online. ",

Got it The headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis January 24 at 6:44 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @brady_dennis Trump administration officials instructed employees at multiple agencies in recent days to cease communicating with the public through news releases, official social media accounts and correspondence, raising concerns that federal employees will be able to convey only information that supports the new president\u2019s agenda. The new limits on public communications appear to be targeting agencies that are charged with overseeing environmental and scientific policy, prompting criticism from officials within the agencies and from outside groups focused on climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency as well as the Agriculture and Interior departments now have formal policies restricting what they should convey to the public about their work. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he and his colleague were \u201clooking into\u201d whether the administration had changed the way many agencies share information publicly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover that we\u2019re going to review the policies,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cbut with respect to the question you\u2019re asking, I don\u2019t have information at this time.\u201d Many new administrations \u2014 including former president Barack Obama\u2019s \u2014 have moved quickly to take control of the U.S. government\u2019s public relations machinery and centralize decision-making upon taking office. But the sweeping nature of some of the new controls is unusual, and the fact that they come as departments have been communicating through an array of digital platforms has made the changes particularly visible. The moves also underscore the kind of skirmishing that could continue to take place between incoming political appointees and civil service employees. At the EPA, for example, communications staff received a memo instructing them that \u201cno social media will be going out\u201d and \u201ca digital strategist will be coming on board\u201d to oversee it. It added, \u201cIncoming media requests will carefully screened.\u201d According to a former agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, members of Trump\u2019s EPA landing team spent significant time asking about who controlled the department\u2019s communications levers, especially regarding social media. EPA\u2019s numerous social media accounts appear to have fallen silent since Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the lone exception of the agency\u2019s Office of Water, which sent out a handful of tweets over the weekend, including a link to what local communities are doing to protect their waterways and advice on using an app to help people figure out whether their local waterway is polluted. [ Trump officials instruct EPA to halt all grants, contracts ] \u201cThe EPA fully intends to continue to provide information to the public,\u201d the agency said in a statement Tuesday, in response to questions about the media blackout. \u201cA fresh look at public affairs and communications processes is common practice for any new Administration, and a short pause in activities allows for this assessment.\u201d Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook said in a statement that the new restrictions were significant cause for concern. \u201cVladimir Putin must be proud,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe EPA, like all federal agencies, is funded by taxpayer dollars, and Americans have the right to know what\u2019s being done to protect or harm public health and the environment. Americans of all political stripes should be furious.\u201d Separately, the Interior Department reactivated its official Twitter accounts early Saturday after an abrupt shutdown after the National Park Service account retweeted two items viewed as unsympathetic to the new president. One referred to the size of the inauguration crowd on the Mall, while another addressed policies that were excised from the White House website after Trump\u2019s swearing in. Speaking to reporters about the Park Service incident, Spicer said, \u201cMy understanding is that because they inappropriately violated their own social media policies there was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth.\u201d Some issues appear to be off limits for park system officials now that Trump is in office. Badlands National Park tweeted several times about the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the implications of climate change, noting at one point, \u201cBurning one gallon of gasoline puts 20lbs of carbon into our atmosphere #climate.\u201d But by early Tuesday evening, those tweets were deleted. The EPA appears to be the focus of concerted attention from the new administration: Officials there have also halted the granting of any new contracts or awards by the department. But the agency is not alone. At the Agriculture Department, a slew of officials \u2014 including deputy under- and assistant secretaries, agency heads, and individuals serving in acting capacities in those posts \u2014 received a memo Monday instructing them to clear any media communications with the secretary\u2019s office. \u201cIn order for the Department to deliver unified, consistent messages, it\u2019s important for the Office of the Secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed responses to questions related to legislation, budgets, policy issues, and regulations,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cPolicy-related statements should not be made to the press without notifying and consulting the Office of the Secretary. This includes press releases and on and off the record conversations.\u201d Employees of the agency\u2019s scientific arm, the Agriculture Research Service, were ordered in a separate memo to cease publication of \u201coutward facing\u201d documents and news releases. The ARS guidance was not issued in coordination with other offices at the USDA, department officials said, and partially contradicted the department-wide memo that went out on the same day. \u201cStarting immediately and until further notice, [the Agricultural Research Service] will not release any public-facing documents. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds, and social media content,\u201d wrote ARS chief Sharon Drumm in an email to employees. USDA Acting Deputy Administrator Michael Young, in a phone call with reporters Tuesday evening, said he had discussed the issue with ARS and indicated he would be open to clarifying or rescinding the research agency\u2019s confusing guidance. \u201cThe ARS guidance was not reviewed by me. I would not have put that kind of guidance out. My guidance has to do with policy-related announcement and that sort of thing,\u201d Young said. \u201cI had my memo drafted before the ARS memo, I was not a part of it.\u201d Department officials scrambled to clarify the memo Tuesday afternoon, after intense public scrutiny and media requests, stating that ARS had not \u201cblacked out public information\u201d and adding that scientific articles published through professional peer-reviewed journals have not been banned. Such a decree would have conflicted with established scientific integrity standards and previous media guidance \u201cencouraging, but not requiring, USDA scientists to communicate with the media about their scientific findings.\u201d \u201cAs the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s chief scientific in-house research agency, ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America,\u201d ARS said in a statement to The Washington Post Tuesday afternoon, seeking to clarify the scope of the memo. Under President George W. Bush, several agencies restricted journalists\u2019 access to researchers working on climate change and other issues. President Obama instructed agencies to develop a \u201cscientific integrity\u201d policy aimed at clarifying how federal employees could disseminate such information without fear of retribution. Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, noted that both EPA and USDA have scientific integrity policies that \u201camong other things, protect scientists\u2019 right to speak out about their work. The American people deserve to know the results of taxpayer-funded research.\u201d Separately, Interior chiefs of staff, bureaus and offices received a memo from Julie Little, director of the Office of Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, instructing them to clear all correspondence to or from the Secretary with her office at least five days \u201cprior to any deadline for Departmental clearance.\u201d The memo also instructed officials to forward any correspondence from lawmakers, state and tribal officials and \u201cnational level environmental/recreational and industry officials\u201d with Little\u2019s office \u201cprior to responding, regarding of addressee or signature level.\u201d Officials at several agencies \u2014 including the Justice and Labor departments, NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey \u2014 said they were continuing to communicate as they had before Trump occupied the Oval Office. In some cases, reporters described media blackouts at agencies that had not transpired. The National Institutes of Health issued an email to its Institute and Center directors informing them they should not communicate on public forums and with public officials on new or pending regulation, policy or guidance that is under review. The guidance referred to the rules that are now in limbo, given the fact that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a regulatory freeze Friday on any regulations that had not yet been published in the Federal Register. \u201cContrary to erroneous media reports, HHS and its agencies continue to communicate fully about its work through all of its regular communication channels with the public, the media and other relevant audiences,\u201d said a Health and Human Services official in an email. \u201cThere is no directive to do otherwise.\u201d Jose DelReal, Lenny Bernstein, Sarah Kaplan and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A former Navy sailor imprisoned for taking photos inside a submarine has sought a pardon from President Donald Trump, who, as a candidate, often cited his case as unjust. Supporters of Kristian Saucier, 29, say the one-year sentence he drew last summer was overly harsh in light of treatment afforded former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over her illegal private email server, and former President Obama\u2019s granting of clemency to Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, who leaked classified information. Saucier's attorney, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News that he met with Trump's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, about Petty Officer First Class Saucier\u2019s case, and at Flynn\u2019s request submitted a formal pardon request. Daigle said the punishment didn\u2019t fit the crime. Kristian Saucier with his daughter, Kassy, and wife, Sadie (Courtesy of Ronald Daigle) \u201cIt was a hyper-charged political atmosphere,\u201d Daigle said, \u201cpolitics played a role in it.\u201d Saucier, who served as a machinist's mate aboard the USS Alexandria from 2007 to 2012, used his cellphone to photograph parts of the submarine's nuclear propulsion system while it was docked at the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, Conn. Saucier, who is married and has a 2-year-old daughter, began his 12-month sentence in October at the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, Mass.\u00a0 He was convicted of unauthorized retention of national defense information, which is a felony, and received an \"other-than-honorable\" discharge from the Navy. He faced a possible 10 years in jail, his lawyers said. His problems began when a worker at the naval base found Saucier\u2019s cellphone near a Dumpster and, while going through it, found the photographs. The worker brought the cellphone to a retired Navy petty officer, who then notified federal agencies about the sensitive submarine pictures. \u201cWhen you look at how many years ago this occurred, coupled with his military service, and other individuals such as Hillary Clinton and [Clinton aide] Huma Abedin, who clearly mishandled classified information, it\u2019s unfair,\u201d said Greg Rinkley, one of the attorneys who represented Saucier. \u201cIt smacks of two types of justice systems in the United States.\u201d Abedin was a Clinton adviser whose estranged husband and former congressman Anthony Weiner was found to have some of the former secretary of state\u2019s emails on his computer when it was seized by federal investigators in connection to another case. Daigle said that when he served as a military police officer in Iraq from 2005 to 2006, he saw \u201chundreds, or thousands\u201d of photos that service personnel had taken that could be considered sensitive. The norm was to handle them in-house, Daigle said. Saucier\u2019s family has said that he took the photos to show his future children what he did aboard the submarine. Tom Carson, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, declined to comment on Saucier's attorneys' criticisms that prosecutors were overzealous. Carson said in an email to Fox News: \"For any pardon application, when the Office of the Pardon Attorney requests our office's position on a pardon, we will review the application and provide our position.\" At the time of the court proceedings on the charges, prosecutors balked at attempts to compare the petty officer\u2019s actions to those of other officers or even that of Clinton. Noting that intent is crucial when determining punishment, some experts noted that Clinton maintained that she did not know that she was doing anything wrong, whereas Saucier conceded that he believed he should not have been taking the photographs. Acting on behalf of the Navy, Rear Adm. Charles Richard submitted a victim impact statement that described Saucier\u2019s photographs as having \u201chad far-reaching consequences for the United States and the Officers, Sailors and families who serve it.\" \"Therefore, the Navy respectfully requests that the court consider a sentence of confinement, and a fine, at the high end of the applicable range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines,\" Richard said, according to Military.com Daigle says that the photos he saw while in Iraq, where he had customs duty and had to go through belongings, \u201cwere far worse\u201d than Saucier\u2019s photos. He said that Saucier had an outstanding career, and had wanted to be in the service for the long haul. \u201cKris was an absolute great performer who made rank quickly because he did so well,\u201d Daigle said. Daigle hopes that Saucier receives a pardon that would erase the conviction from his record, and commutation of his sentence.

Rescue workers facing \"extreme conditions\" continue to dig through the rubble, searching for the 14 people still said to be missing. Survivors Found Trapped In Rubble Of Hotel Hit by Avalanche Also in mountainous central Italy, a emergency helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain, and the Italian news agency ANSA reports that six people were killed. The helicopter was carrying an injured person from the Campo Felice ski resort and \"came down from a height of around 600 metres,\" the agency added. It is not clear what caused the chopper to crash, and in photos from the site it appears to be completely destroyed. The wreckage of a helicopter lies in the snow after crashing Tuesday in the Campo Felice ski area of central Italy. Gregorio Borgia/AP hide caption toggle caption Gregorio Borgia/AP Wednesday's avalanche that buried the Hotel Rigopiano was likely triggered by a series of earthquakes in the area, as The Two-Way reported . ANSA says \"eleven survived the disaster, including nine who were pulled out of the ruins by search teams.\" The first funerals began today, including a service for the hotel headwaiter Alessandro Giancaterino. Giancaterino \"had offered to stay for a double shift on Jan. 18 to spare a colleague from having to make his way to the hotel through the snow,\" according to The Associated Press. The rescuers found three puppies amid the ruins of the buried hotel yesterday \u2014 but as fire services spokesman Luca Cari told Deutsche Welle , that doesn't mean raised hopes for efforts to find human survivors.

Meanwhile, prosecutors are beginning to investigate \"whether a series of missed communications, underestimations of risks and delays in responding to days of heavy snowfall contributed to the toll from the avalanche,\" the AP reports. They're looking at phone calls to emergency dispatchers in particular, as Christopher Livesay in Rome tells our Newscast unit. The dispatchers \"appear to have ignored early cries for help.\" ",

The withdrawal, which threatens to distance the U.S. from some of its Asian allies, fulfilled a campaign pledge by Trump to end U.S. involvement in the 2015 pact and likely marks the beginning of a new chapter in Washington's approach to global trade \u2014 one more focused on shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. Unlikely Allies Trump, who hopes to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs during his term, signed the executive memorandum authorizing the withdrawal in the Oval Office. Later, as he met with union leaders in the White House's Roosevelt Room, he said, \"We're going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country.\" The move received support from some of his opponents, including Rust Belt Democrats. Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., who denounced the TPP in last year\u2019s Democratic presidential primaries, arguably pushing Hillary Clinton to retract her support for the pact, praised Trump yesterday and said he was glad the deal was \"dead and gone.\" Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during an event on the Trans Pacific Partnership on Capitol Hill June 3, 2015 in Washington, DC. End of a Long Fight Although the agreement was already considered dead because of its lack of support from either major party's presidential candidate, Trump's signing of the memo nevertheless ended what Thea Lee, the policy director and chief international economist at the AFL-CIO , described to ABC News as a \"six year fight\" to stop the pact. Union leaders like AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa, praised the move in separate statements, suggesting it would protect workers. Union households \u2014 long considered a key component of the Democratic base \u2014 helped Trump win the 2016 presidential election. He matched Ronald Reagan 's support in that cohort in 1984 \u2014 the highest level in that group for a Republican since then, according to ABC News exit polls. Lee, however, was reluctant to praise Trump so easily for signing the directive. \"The TPP was dead already,\" she said. \"Trump just disposed of the body.\" Lee said her organization saw the accord, which President Obama made the centerpiece of his foreign policy pivot toward Asia, as \"deeply flawed.\" She called it a \"corporate empowerment agreement,\" part of a trend of deals that made it easier for companies to ship jobs overseas. Despite her criticisms of the deal, she said she is reserving judgment on whether Trump's promise to fight for American workers can be believed. \"It's hard to say right now what we can expect from his administration,\" she said, since some of his proposed appointees \u2014 who she said are from the \"Goldman Sachs wing of the Republican Party\" \u2014 appear more likely to support future similar trade deals than his rhetoric would suggest. Lee also said that it's still unclear what Trump will seek to do with other trade deals, as with his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \"Will he label China a currency manipulator?\" Lee asked, referring to one of his promises . \"That still remains to be seen.\" Questions About Cause of Job Losses Mireya Solis, the Philip Knight chair in Japan studies and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argued in favor of the TPP in the past, praising the agreement for its potential to \"enhance American influence in Asia.\" She told ABC News that the deal would have had a small but positive effect on American jobs and cited a study by the United States International Trade Commission to support that claim. Solis said opponents of the TPP \"are misjudging the problem,\" referring to the much discussed decline in American manufacturing jobs. \"We're very bad at training American workers to reinvent themselves.\" She said that advances in technology were hurting workers more than trade deals like the TPP and that it could have boosted exports. Robert E. Scott, the senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute , who argued against the deal, said the notion that it would have strengthened exports is \"simply not coherent,\" based on the degree to which it would have empowered corporations. Scott, who voiced skepticism about how effective the TPP would have been in strengthening U.S. influence in Asia, said that the framework of the deal was designed to help \"really big companies\" and implied that what would have happened to workers as a result of the deal was an afterthought. \"It would have redistributed wealth from the poor to the ultrarich,\" he said. \"This is a win for workers, in my view.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By christina capatides CBS News January 24, 2017, 5:28 PM Badlands National Park Twitter account goes rogue, starts tweeting scientific facts The recent posts by Badlands National Park in South Dakota. @BadlandsNPS/Twitter Email Last Updated Jan 24, 2017 6:33 PM EST Just days after The National Park Service (NPS) was forced to shut down its Twitter activity over two retweets the Department of the Interior deemed inconsistent with the agency\u2019s mission, the Twitter account for Badlands National Park in South Dakota seems to have gone rogue, tweeting numerous scientific facts about climate change that have since been deleted. The first tweet about climate science came at 11:40 a.m. local time Tuesday. It said: \u201cThe pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). As of December 2016, 404.93 ppm.\u201d @BadlandsNPS/Twitter Just moments later, the same account tweeted, \u201cToday, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years\u201d \u2014 with the hashtag \u201c#climate\u201d added for good measure. @BadlandsNPS/Twitter Then, at 12:25 p.m., the next tweet said: \u201cFlipside of the atmosphere; ocean acidity has increased 30% since the Industrial  Revolution. \u2018Ocean Acidification\u2019 #climate #carboncycle\u201d @BadlandsNPS/Twitter But the messages were short-lived. As of 5:35 p.m., all the above tweets have been deleted. In response to that action, Democratic National Committee press secretary Adrienne Watson released the following\u00a0 statement : \u201cVladimir Putin would be proud.\u201d\u00a0 This comes as the Trump administration has instituted a temporary media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency, causing the EPA\u2019s social media accounts to fall silent after Friday\u2019s Inauguration Day.\u00a0 President Trump's promised roll back on environmental protection, combined with his belief that climate change is a hoax, has environmentalists a... The EPA\u2019s final tweet before the social media blackout simply reads, \u201c@GinaEPA shares a report about actions taken by the agency under the Clean Air Act during the last eight years,\u201d with a link to a blog post by now-former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. While the main National Parks Service Twitter account is now back up and tweeting, its posts since the temporary halt at that agency have remained largely innocuous: benign tweets about new research libraries, sled dogs in Denali and the motivational power of the mountains. Those posts seem certain not to rub the Trump administration the wrong way. Badlands\u2019 posts on the carbon cycle and climate change , however, seem to have proven otherwise.\u00a0 President Trump has, in the past, tweeted that he believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by China. During their confirmation hearings, however, several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees disagreed with that notion, including ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , Trump\u2019s choice to take over the EPA. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer answered a question from the Huffington Post\u2019s Jennifer Bendery on climate change \u2014 specifically, about the fact that 2016 was the hottest year on record and how President Trump plans to deal with that fact \u00a0\u2014 by saying, \u201cHe\u2019s going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are best for the environment. One of the things he talked about during the campaign is there\u2019s a balance, and he\u2019s trying to make sure we use our resources appropriately, that we maximize things to make sure that we don\u2019t do so at the detriment of economic growth and job creation.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Elizabeth Keatinge (@ekeatinge) has more. Time White House press secretary Sean Spicer calls on a reporter during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 A Trump Administration directive ordering employees at the Environmental Protection Agency to halt external communications and posts on social media\u00a0fueled news reports Tuesday that a number of other agencies were issuing similar gag orders to their workers. But while the EPA confirmed it was freezing such activity as well as new contracts and grants, administration officials spent much of Tuesday tamping down conspiratorial rumors of wide-spread media blackouts. White House Spokesman Sean Spicer said he was aware of the news reports but not familiar with any broad edict. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it,\u201d he told reporters during the daily White House briefing Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover that we\u2019re going to review the policies.\u201d Horse soring restrictions among those halted by Trump ban on new rules The agencies reportedly affected in some measure included Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But spokespeople for those agencies called the reports\u00a0overblown or flatly refuted them. \u201cContrary to erroneous media reports, HHS and its agencies continue to communicate fully about its work through all of its regular communication channels with the public, the media and other relevant audiences,\u201d according to a statement from the agency. \u201cThere is no directive to do otherwise.\u201d That was in response to a Huffington Post story that officials at some smaller agencies within HHS had been told not to send \u201cany correspondence to public officials\u201d according to memos obtained by the online news site. And BuzzFeed reported that some Agriculture employees have been told not to publicly share summaries of scientific papers or tweeting through its official site. A spokeswoman for the USDA had yet to return a call for comment Tuesday afternoon. But according to a Reuters report,\u00a0the agency said an internal email sent to workers calling for a suspension of \u201cpublic-facing documents\u201d at its Agricultural Research Service was flawed and\u00a0new guidance would be issued to replace it. Only the EPA did not dispute the reports. But a statement from the agency said it \u201cfully intends to continue to provide information to the public. A fresh look at public affairs and communications processes is common practice for any new Administration, and a short pause in activities allows for this assessment.\u201d Political opponents pounced on the administration. \u201cThis administration is launching direct attacks on truth and transparency in our gov\u2019t. Very troubling -- and honestly, anti-democratic,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during the Women's March on Washington, Saturday. \u00a0(Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP) More alarming to state regulators is the temporary suspension of EPA grants and contracts. The abrupt move to suspend funding posed \u201csignificant concern\u201d for some states that are already having to cope with incremental aid from Washington since Congress has yet to pass a 2017 budget, said Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, executive director and general counsel of the Environmental Council of the States. ECOS is the association representing state environmental agencies. \u201cStates were immediately concerned that they would be having to make cuts in staff ... because the money flow is already sporadic,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u00a0received phone calls from all over the country from states of all political stripes.\u201d Environmental groups also registered their anger. \u201cPresident Trump's move to freeze all communications and EPA grant programs on the first day of his job should be a major red flag for all Americans at the start of a new administration,\u201d said Liz Perera, climate change policy director for the Sierra Club. \u201cThe EPA was created to ensure that all Americans can enjoy clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and have their health protected from environmental and climate threats. Trump's action puts American lives and communities at risk.\u201d Myron Ebell, headed the EPA transition team for the Trump administration, told ProPublica Monday the move was not unprecedented. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don\u2019t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first,\u201d Ebell said. \u201cThis may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it\u2019s very similar to what others have done.\u201d Trump\u2019s choice to run the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Reports of the EPA directive came days after the Interior Department temporarily shut down its Twitter site after a National Park Service employee retweeted side-by-side photos of the crowds that gathered in 2009 on the National Mall for President Barack Obama\u2019s first inaugural and the apparently much smaller crowd that\u00a0came to witness Trump\u2019s swearing-in Friday.

Nasser Nasser/AP hide caption toggle caption Nasser Nasser/AP Tuesday's announcement includes plans for new construction in the Israeli settlement of Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. Nasser Nasser/AP Israel says it plans to build 2,500 more homes for Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. This is the second such announcement this week, after Israel approved permits for 560 units in East Jerusalem . President Trump, who took office on Friday, is widely expected to be more supportive of settlement expansion than his predecessor. Settlements are widely viewed as an obstacle to peace by the Palestinians and the international community, and Palestinian officials have responded angrily to today's announcement. \"We are building \u2014 and will continue to build,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on Facebook . Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new houses are \"in response to housing needs,\" according to The Associated Press. \"Most of the units are located within settlement blocs, while some 100 of them are located in the settlement of Beit El, and others in Migron,\" the Israeli newspaper Haaretz writes . \"However, a look at the planned locations shows the construction is slated for outside the settlement blocs, as well.\" The Obama administration had been sharply critical of settlement expansion. That culminated last month in a rare U.S. abstention from a U.N. Security Council vote condemning settlements built on land annexed by Israel in 1967; the U.S. has typically vetoed resolutions that are critical of Israel. Article continues after sponsorship 7 Things To Know About Israeli Settlements But there is reason to think the Trump administration will take a different approach. Trump slammed the U.S. abstention on Twitter , saying that \"we cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.\" As the AP reports, Beit El, which is set to see additional homes because of today's announcement, \"has received donations from Trump's designated ambassador to Israel and from the family of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser.\" Nabil Abu Rdeneh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the move \"a challenge and provocation and disregard for the Arab world and the international community [that] requires a real and serious position from the entire world,\" the wire service reported. NPR's Parallels blog recently explained how settlements have rapidly expanded in the past two decades: \"When the Israelis and Palestinians first began peace talks after a 1993 interim agreement, the West Bank settlers numbered a little over 100,000. Today they total around 400,000 and live in about 130 separate settlements. ... \"They have grown under every Israeli government over the past half-century despite consistent international opposition. Hard-line leaders like Netanyahu have actively supported them. Moderates and liberals have also allowed settlements to expand, though usually at a slower rate. The settler movement is a powerful political force, and any prime minister who takes it on risks the collapse of his government.\" Another big issue is whether Trump will carry out his campaign pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem, changing decades of U.S. policy. \"The U.S. position has long been that the legal status of Jerusalem is yet to be determined,\" NPR's Mark Katkov explained . \"A law passed by Congress in 1995 requires the U.S. to move its embassy to Jerusalem but allows presidents to waive that requirement, which all have done.\" The provocative idea, applauded by some Israelis, is strongly opposed by Palestinians and could cause unrest across the region.

    "text": "Jan. 24, 2017, 4:00 p.m. park city, utah Steven Zeitchik Meryl Streep accepts the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 74th Golden Globe Awards. (HFPA / Zuma Press) Decided on by about 7,500 fewer voters than the Oscars -- and with many fewer degrees of credibility -- the Golden Globes are often derided as an awards-show punchline. Who are these 80 entertainment reporters to determine what Hollywood thinks are the best movies of the year, when so many thousands of industry veterans vote on awards just weeks later? But the first group may have had an unusually large effect on the latter this year. When the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and\u00a0Sciences announced its nominations Tuesday morning, it had put \"Elle\" star Isabelle Huppert on the shortlist for lead actress, while leaving out favorites Amy Adams (\"Arrival\") and Annette Bening (\"20th Century Women\"). Huppert's profile was raised dramatically in the critical final days of voting when the Globes gave her an upset victory of sorts in lead actress in a drama award -- then she gave a bubbly speech that played well to the thousands of voters watching. Though\u00a0it's impossible to know how many votes shifted, her elevated stock in the final five days of voting only helped her candidacy. Also nestling its way into voters' minds from the Beverly Hilton ballroom was Meryl Streep, who\u00a0was considered a bubble candidate at best for her role as a bad opera singer in the little-seen \"Florence Foster Jenkins.\" But she became a hero, especially in many precincts of Hollywood, at the Golden Globes, when she gave a fiery anti-Trump speech that included such as lines as \"When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\" A backlash from Trump and Trump supporters only solidified her status, and Streep's Oscar chances began to steadily rise, until Tuesday she notched an Oscar spot that might otherwise have gone to Adams or Bening. (Whether the Globes speech and its attention prompts Oscar producers to give her a platform at their show as well remains to be seen.) But maybe the biggest contribution the Globes made to the Oscars comes with a polarizing personality: Mel Gibson. Gibson was a somewhat unexpected juggernaut on Tuesday, his \"Hacksaw Ridge\" earning six nominations, including picture and director (both over Oscar darlings Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese). As it turned out, Gibson was nominated for picture and director by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.\u00a0as well. In fact, the group was one of the first to normalize the filmmaker after the string of racist, misogynist and anti-Semitic comments that put him in \"director jail\" a decade or so ago. They invited him to introduce the top honor of motion picture-drama last year at a point when few high-profile shows would have Gibson on. (It devolved into awkward barbs between him and Globes host Ricky Gervais.) Gibson had been shunned by much of Hollywood following the multiple incidents -- so much so that Robert Downey Jr. asked forgiveness for him several years back. The Globes' embrace of Gibson helped pave the way for him to return to Oscar's good graces. The HFPA won't win over skeptics who say the group does not represent people in mainstream Hollywood. But Tuesday's Oscar nominations proves at least one thing: Those people are watching. Latest updates ",

    "text": "2017-01-23T18:34:03-05:00 January 23, 2017 6:34 PM ET The debut issue of The New York Times on Sept. 18, 1851, known then as The New-York Daily Times , contained one wedding announcement , and one wedding announcement only, for the newlyweds Sarah Mullett and John Grant. He was 26 and she was 23. The ceremony took place at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Fredonia, the town in western New York where the bride had grown up. The bridegroom was from Jamestown. They were married Sept. 10, by the Rev. T. P. Tyler. The announcement was a mere sentence, a bare-bones beginning for a Times institution. Photo So why were John and Sarah the chosen ones? Based on old newspaper clippings and census reports, it appears that the Mulletts were a prominent family in Fredonia. The bride\u2019s father, James, epitomized upward mobility. He grew up on a farm in Vermont, the oldest of 13 children, and made his way to Fredonia, where he became a self-taught lawyer (such a thing was possible in those days). He eventually became a State Supreme Court justice. The bridegroom was a cousin of Ulysses S. Grant, then an Army lieutenant, who would go on to become a general and president. Today, oil portraits of John and Sarah hang side by side in the New Haven family room of Wendy Grant Haskell, 63, who is a psychotherapist and the Grants\u2019 great-great-granddaughter. Each is wearing black, and a similarly dour and humorless expression, as if they had whispered to each other beforehand, \u201cDon\u2019t smile!\u201d \u201cI think they are trying to project importance, status and prestige,\u201d Ms. Haskell said, adding that the portraits were probably painted soon after the wedding. (When I first called Ms. Haskell to inquire about John and Sarah Grant, she was flummoxed; I think she thought I was trying to sell her a Times subscription. When I explained my reason for calling, she said she had no idea the Grants had appeared in the newspaper\u2019s first wedding announcement. \u201cWhat a hoot!\u201d) See the announcement in the first issue of The New-York Daily Times. Her brother David Marshall Grant, an actor you might recognize from \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\" or his Tony-nominated performance as Joe Pitt in \u201cAngels in America,\u201d said: \u201cI would guess, looking at those portraits, that it was a less joyful time. I\u2019m sure there were struggles just to get by. I can\u2019t imagine what it was like just to make breakfast. I\u2019m angry when there\u2019s a line at Starbucks.\u201d John and Sarah Grant\u2019s lives probably did not turn out exactly as they envisioned. After the wedding, they settled in Jamestown, where John was co-owner of a grocery store dealing in tea, fruit, molasses and salt, among other products. Sarah kept house, according to the census, and had a live-in Irish servant. The couple had one son, James Mullett Grant, who married and also had one son, Havens Grant. Then, sometime before the turn of the century, James Mullett Grant traveled alone to Havana and never returned. \u201cJohn and Sarah Grant were all about the promise of being a really significant couple starting a whole line of prosperity, but then look at what happened,\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cTheir son fell off the edge of the earth.\u201d On June 2, 1883, John Grant\u2019s obituary appeared in The Evening Observer, a local newspaper. As brief and terse as his wedding announcement, the notice merely reported that he had \u201cdropped dead\u201d in his home at age 60. Sarah Grant died 29 years later. Then things got even more interesting. The couple\u2019s grandson, Havens Grant, went to Yale, became a lawyer in New York City, married a free-spirited poet and ran a moonshine business on the side during Prohibition. Today, the Grant descendants gather every Christmas at Ms. Haskell\u2019s home in Connecticut and take a family photo with John and Sarah\u2019s portraits in the background. In a recent photograph, everyone is wearing colorful tie-dyed scarves or shirts. David Marshall Grant appears with his husband, KC Reischerl, and their daughter, Evelyn May Reischerl Grant, who is 6 and the youngest descendant. She is also the only female family member in the photo. Ms. Haskell\u2019s three sons are gay and appear with their partners. Photo Sarah and John Grant\u2019s descendants and their partners in 2014. Click the image for a who\u2019s who. Credit Wendy Haskell Ms. Haskell\u2019s son David Haskell is an editor at New York magazine and is carrying on the family moonshine tradition. He is a co-owner of Kings County Distillery , which is based in Brooklyn Navy Yard and makes craft whiskeys. What would John and Sarah Grant think? If they were to see the lineup of gay couples in tie-dye, David Marshall Grant said, \u201cI think they would think they had gone to Mars; it\u2019s an astonishing example of what happens in time.\u201d Lois Smith Brady wrote the Vows column from its inception in 1992 to 2001, when she moved to Aspen, Colo.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The green light for Keystone came after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s approval of two pipeline projects linked to Alberta\u2019s oil sands in late November. Expanded pipeline capacity and its potential to expand the market for the oil sands, which overwhelmingly export to the United States, are welcome developments in Alberta and neighboring Saskatchewan, both oil-producing provinces. But there is considerable opposition to Keystone and oil sands pipelines in general in other parts of Canada and within many indigenous communities. In addition to the Keystone and Dakota directives, Mr. Trump signed three others intended to ease the way for businesses and promote American manufacturing. One instructed the Commerce Department to develop a plan to ensure that all future pipelines built in the United States be constructed out of American-made materials. Another was aimed at streamlining what he called \u201cthe incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process and reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing.\u201d The last directive was intended to expedite environmental reviews for \u201chigh-priority infrastructure projects\u201d like highways and bridges. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions came on a day when he met with the leaders of the country\u2019s largest automakers, whom he has been pushing to produce more of their products in the United States. He singled out General Motors in a Twitter post this month for building the Chevy Cruze hatchback in Mexico. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201d he wrote . Hosting the automakers on Tuesday, he made a point of holding out a chair for Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYou\u2019re not being singled out, believe me, Mary, I promise,\u201d he told her as journalists recorded the moment. \u201cBut you have a lot of plants from a lot of different items built in the United States. And it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s happening big league.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump said he understood that manufacturers faced regulatory burdens in the United States and he would make it easier for them to make their products in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make the process much more simple for the auto companies and for everybody else who wants to do business in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find this to be from being very inhospitable to extremely hospitable.\u201d Anticipating criticism from advocates of tackling climate change, he added: \u201cI am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it. But it\u2019s out of control and we\u2019re going to make it a very short process. And we\u2019re going to either give you your permits or we\u2019re not going to give you your permits. But you\u2019re going to know very quickly. And generally speaking we\u2019re going to be giving you your permits.\u201d The auto executives offered praise for Mr. Trump after the session. \u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged by the president and the economic policies that he\u2019s forwarding,\u201d Mark Fields, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, told reporters outside the White House as they left. He cited the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cWe appreciate the president\u2019s courage to walk away from a bad trade deal,\u201d he said. Ian Austen contributed from Ottawa.

President Donald Trump poses with labor leaders Jan. 23, 2017, in the Oval Office at the White House. (Nicholas Kamm / AFP/Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The White House on Tuesday stuck firmly to President Donald Trump 's claim that millions of people voted illegally in the November election, but provided no evidence to back up his assertion. Trump spokesman Sean\u00a0Spicer\u00a0said the president \"does believe\" that he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton only because of widespread illegal ballots. \"He believes what he believes, based on the information he was provided,\"\u00a0Spicer\u00a0said. But he would not detail what information he was referring to, citing only a 2008 study that called for updating voter rolls but did not conclude there has been pervasive election fraud. Spicer, who spent several years at the Republican National Committee before joining the White House, would not say whether he shared the president's belief. He also sidestepped questions about whether the White House would investigate the voter fraud allegations, saying only, \"Anything is possible.\" Trump first raised the prospect of illegal voting during the transition. Then, during a reception with lawmakers at the White House Monday evening, he again claimed that he'd lost the popular vote because 3 million to 5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally had voted. That's according to a Democratic aide familiar with the exchange who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Trump's assertion appears to be part of a continuing pattern for him and his new administration in which falsehoods overshadow his outreach efforts. Both Trump and\u00a0Spicer\u00a0made false comments over the weekend about the crowds who gathered for the inauguration. Technically, the proper way to describe claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election is to state that there's no evidence that it happened. Shortly after the election, we tallied up reports of in-person voter fraud that occurred last year and found a grand total of four examples. There... (Philip Bump) Aides and associates of the president say that he is dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote and believes Democrats and the media are questioning the legitimacy of his presidency. On Tuesday, the president tweeted a photograph from the inauguration taken from an angle that accentuated the crowd and said he planned to hang the image in the press area of the White House. Trump has packed his first days in office with meetings with business leaders and lawmakers. He's also moved to unravel former President Barack Obama 's legacy, including signing orders Tuesday to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. Both projects had been blocked by the Obama administration. Donald Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without... Days after being sworn in, President Donald Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without... (Abby Phillip, Mike Debonis) Besides taking steps to advance construction of the oil pipelines, subject to renegotiation of the agreements, Trump also signed a notice Tuesday requiring the materials for the pipelines be constructed in the United States, though it was unclear how he planned to enforce the measure. \"From now we are going to start making pipelines in the United States,\" he said. Trump has sought to focus his first full week in office on jobs and the economy. Republicans, as well as some unions, have cited the pipeline projects as prime opportunities for job growth. Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy. The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border. Separately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe. The pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Even as Trump moves to implement his agenda, he is still making false claims. On Tuesday, Trump summoned the heads of the big three American automakers, General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler, for a breakfast meeting. He pledged to scrap regulations and reduce taxes on corporations that keep jobs in the U.S., though he did not specify his plans for either. His administration, he said, will \"go down as one of the most friendly countries\" for business. The president also said it will announce candidate next week to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. \"We will pick a truly great Supreme Court justice,\" Trump told reporters. \"Probably making my decision this week, we'll be announcing next week.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "Senate Confirms Trump's Nominee for US Ambassador to the UN By richard lardner, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 24, 2017, 6:25 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Jan. 18, 2017 file photo, UN Ambassador-designate, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has overwhelmingly approved Haley's nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) 0 Shares Email The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by a decisive margin Tuesday as Republican-led committees paved the way for three more of his Cabinet nominees to be approved just days into the new administration. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley won strong support for the U.N. post despite her lack of foreign policy experience. Senators voted 96-4 on Haley's nomination. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Haley is a proven leader who will be a \"fierce advocate\" at the U.N. for American interests. But not everyone was sold. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Haley didn't convince him that she'll serve effectively. The U.S. ambassador to the international body should be an expert on international affairs, Coons said, \"not someone who will be learning on the job.\" A Senate vote is expected soon on Trump's choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson . The Foreign Relations Committee narrowly approved his nomination Monday, 11-10. No Democrats on the panel voted for Tillerson. Tillerson's bid got a key boost when Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced his support Tuesday. Manchin, who faces re-election in 2018 in a state that backed Trump heavily in the presidential election , said Tillerson's extensive business career \"will bring a unique perspective to the State Department.\" The vote on Haley capped a day when the GOP-led panels endorsed Trump's choices to lead the Transportation, Housing, and Commerce departments. Yet congressional Republicans criticized Democrats for not moving quickly enough on all of the president's selections. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, forced a one-week delay \u2014 until Jan. 31 \u2014 of the committee's vote on Trump's attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Feinstein said senators \"owe it\" to the more than 1 million women who marched in Washington and other locations on Saturday to be careful in considering Sessions' nomination and his willingness to protect equal rights. She also said the committee received 188 pages of new material that needs to be reviewed. Committee rules allow any member of the panel to delay a vote. Deliberations over two of Trump's picks turned testy as both nominees faced questions from Democrats over their personal finances. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the president's choice for health secretary, defended his decision to invest in health care companies as he testified before the Senate Finance Committee. Panel staffers found Price undervalued around 400,000 shares of stock in Australian drug company Innate Immunotherapeutics that he purchased last August. He reported the shares were valued at $50,000 to $100,000, but those shares were worth up to $250,000. Price blamed a \"clerical error\" and answered \"no\" when Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked if he'd used poor judgment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Trump's nominee for budget director, South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, should be disqualified because he failed to pay more than $15,000 in payroll taxes for a babysitter more than a decade ago. Mulvaney said he discovered the unpaid taxes while preparing for the nominating process. He has since paid the taxes. Trump's choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also being scrutinized by Democrats about her qualifications, political donations and longtime work advocating for charter schools and school choice in her home state of Michigan. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., delivered a withering critique of DeVos on Tuesday, saying he has no confidence she will fully support traditional public schools and students. The Senate Commerce Committee approved by voice votes Trump's choices of conservative billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to run the Commerce Department and Elaine Chao to lead the Transportation Department. Ross has specialized in buying distressed companies that still have a potential for delivering profits. He has known Trump for more than 20 years, was an early supporter of his presidential campaign and served as an economic policy adviser to Trump's team. Chao, an experienced Washington hand, was labor secretary in President George W. Bush's administration and deputy transportation secretary under President George H.W. Bush. She is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Chao is expected to play a major role in Trump's effort to fulfill his campaign promise to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. Ben Carson, nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, won unanimous approval from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The former Republican presidential candidate and celebrated neurosurgeon would lead a sprawling agency with 8,300 employees and a budget of about $47 billion. Sen. Michael Crapo of Idaho, the committee's Republican chairman, praised Carson and said the department \"will benefit from having a secretary with a different perspective and a diverse background.\" Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the panel's top Democrat, said he had reservations but welcomed Carson's promises to address lead hazards in public housing. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Joan Lowy, Stephen Ohlemacher, Alan Fram, Jennifer Kerr and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner 0 Shares ",

Rex Tillerson, Trump's pick for secretary of state who is widely expected to receive full Senate backing, said during his confirmation hearing that the U.S. would block China's access to the disputed Asian islands. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed,\" Tillerson said. Chinese newspapers responded furiously. Watch the full report at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday on the NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt \"China has enough determination and strength to make sure that his rabble rousing will not succeed. Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish,\" wrote the state-run Global Times.

China sees this expansion as its legal right and a vital way to protect one of the country's main shipping lanes. U.S. officials have described the island building project as an attempt by China to assert military dominance over the region. \"That's not international territory, that's Chinese territory,\" Lu said, insisting that China has every right to build whatever it wants on the islands. As the Trump administration moves quickly to make good on its campaign promises, China appears to be putting down markers and drawing foreign policy red lines not to be crossed. Play ",

By NICHOLAS FANDOS Continue reading the main story Photo Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, during a briefing on Tuesday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 During a private meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, President Trump asserted that between three million and five million unauthorized immigrants had voted for his Democratic opponent and robbed him of a victory in the national popular vote. There is no evidence to support the claim, which has been discredited repeatedly by numerous fact-checkers . That did not stop Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, from standing by the president\u2019s words on Tuesday during a briefing with reporters at the White House. \u201cAs I said, I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. That much appears to be true. Mr. Trump repeatedly raised doubts about the integrity of the American voting system in the period before the election in November and has falsely said since his victory that millions of people voted illegally. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 27, 2016 Pressed to present the evidence on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer appeared to conflate two different studies that Mr. Trump\u2019s staff had previously cited in defending his claim. \u201cThere\u2019s one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThere\u2019s other studies that have been presented to him.\u201d Here are the facts Neither study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. The first study was conducted in 2014 by professors at Old Dominion University and discussed on Monkey Cage , a blog hosted by The Washington Post. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said they were registered to vote. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly criticized by political scientists who said that a more careful examination of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections. The second study , conducted in 2012 by the Pew Center on the States, found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or \u201csignificantly inaccurate\u201d; that more than 1.8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls; and that almost three million were registered in multiple states, probably because they had moved from one state to another.

Stephen Yang / Reuters, file President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders Tuesday to advance the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies have vigorously protested the Dakota Access project, saying it would damage cultural sites. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told NBC News that the tribe would take immediate legal action to fight the executive order. \"The Trump administration's politically motivated decision violates the law and the Tribe will take legal action to fight it,\" said Archambault. \"We are not opposed to energy independence. We are opposed to reckless and politically motivated development projects, like DAPL, that ignore our treaty rights and risk our water. Creating a second Flint does not make America great again.\" In a statement, Greenpeace executive director Annie Leonard pledged that the same group of environmentalists, Native American activists and farmers that successfully stalled the projects in the past will continue to fight their advancement. Protesters march against the Dakota Access Pipeline in Pasadena, California on Jan. 2, after the Rose Parade. Protesters calling for Wells Fargo bank to divest from the pipeline mixed in with parade spectators leaving the venue after the parade. Robyn Beck / AFP - Getty Images, file \"Keystone, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and fossil fuel infrastructure projects like them will only make billionaires richer and make the rest of us suffer,\" she said. \"We will resist this with all of our power and we will continue to build the future the world wants to see.\" Backers of the pipelines say they will create jobs and cut energy costs. During a meeting with auto executives earlier Tuesday, Trump described himself as \"an environmentalist\" but argued that federal regulatory and permitting processes are too drawn out. \"I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist,\" he said. \"I believe in it, but it's out of control and we're going to make a very short process and we're going to either give you your permits or we're not going to give you your permits, but you're going to know very quickly.\" The Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline in November 2015, and it denied a permit for the Dakota Access project late last year.

    "text": "Trump says he\u2019ll announce Supreme Court pick next week Tuesday\u2019s White House meeting with Senate leaders and members of the Judiciary Committee is designed to be a general discussion to see if any names on Trump\u2019s list of 21 potential high court nominees would present problems. It is not designed to elicit specific endorsements or opposition to any specific nominee. From the White House perspective, it is viewed as a gesture of respect of the Senate advise-and-consent role.\u00a0 Both Hardiman and Gorsuch are regarded as conservative, but neither is thought by the White House to be unconfirmable. Nor are they nominees who would, the White House believes, elicit a massive Senate Democratic uprising. That is the working theory, but confirmation fights in the modern era have been unpredictable.\u00a0 There is a sense within the White House that 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 from pro-Trump states are particularly vulnerable and MAY vote for confirmation -- hence the White House\u2019s desire to move as rapidly as possible to preserve its leverage. Hardiman is a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Originally from Waltham, Mass., Hardiman attended Notre Dame and Georgetown Law School. He worked in private practice in Pittsburgh, then was a hearing office for the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Gorsuch is a former Washington, D.C. lawyer and Supreme Court clerk educated at Harvard and Oxford who is considered a solid conservative. He sailed through his Senate confirmation in 2006, and was even introduced by both the Republican (then-Sen. Wayne Allard) and Democratic (then-Sen. Ken Salazar) senators from his home state of Colorado. Gorsuch\u2019s ascendancy may come as a surprise because legal conservatives had been urging Trump to tap Alabama-based federal appeals court judge William Pryor. A former Alabama deputy attorney general under Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, Pryor was appointed to fill Sessions\u2019 position as Alabama attorney general after he was elected to the U.S. Senate. Pryor is a highly regarded judge who many believe would have been the most worthy successor to Antonin Scalia, but his nomination to the Eleventh Circuit in 2003 was hotly contested. Selecting Hardiman would diversify the high court in one way -- if confirmed, Hardiman would be the only one on the high court without an Ivy League degree. The Massachusetts native became the first person in his family to go to college when he attended the University of Notre Dame. He paid his way through law school at Georgetown by driving a taxi.\u00a0 Democrats filibustered Pryor\u2019s nomination because of his views on abortion \u2013 during his confirmation hearing, Pryor stood by his comments calling Roe v. Wade \u201cthe worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\u201d Ultimately, Bush appointed Pryor to the bench using a recess appointment in 2004, and Pryor was permanently confirmed as part of the Gang of 14 compromise negotiated by Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2005. Republicans on Capitol Hill told Mr. Trump they\u2019re wary of the blowback from Democrats if Pryor were to be his pick. But Pryor also was no favorite of the religious right. Because he is not a results-oriented judge, Pryor does not always reach a conservative outcome. For example, he joined an appeals court opinion supporting transgender rights, consistent with Supreme Court precedent. And as state attorney general, Pryor sought to remove Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore from office after Moore refused a federal court order to remove a massive 10 Commandments rock from the state courthouse.\u00a0 One potential obstacle for Hardiman is a gender stereotyping case, similar to a case that tripped up Pryor with the religious right. Writing for the court, Hardiman\u2019s opinion allowed a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by a gay man describing himself as \u201ceffiminate\u201d to proceed. Mr. Trump\u2019s team believes Gorsuch is significantly less likely to inflame the left, while also being an acceptable choice to the far right. Gorsuch sided with Hobby Lobby in the Obamacare contraception case and wrote a book about assisted suicide that indicated his pro-life views. Before joining the bench, Gorsuch took few if any controversial positions as a D.C. lawyer in private practice or during his brief stint in the civil division of the Bush Justice Department.\u00a0 Hardiman \u200eis also seen as a solid conservative, but with a slightly more enigmatic record. Hardiman serves on the same court as President Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Michael Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were first reported by the Washington Post . The conversations between Flynn and Kislyak took place in late December, around the time that then-President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia and expelled 35 diplomats in response to Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Flynn had been investigated for the past five months as part of a broader probe of Russia's ties to the Trump campaign, which is ongoing. That investigation was initiated last spring and involves an interagency task force that includes representatives from the\u00a0FBI, CIA, NSA and Treasury Department. At least three members of the Trump campaign were the focus of the investigation.\u00a0 At one point in the larger investigation, the FBI requested four warrants from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, commonly known as the FISA court. At least one of the warrants was granted and at least one other was not. It is not known whether any of the warrants specifically dealt with Flynn's contacts with Russian officials, which escalated after the November elections.\u00a0 On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that the administration had not been informed of any particular investigation and would not interfere with any probe. Spicer added that Flynn told him Sunday night that Flynn and Kislyak spoke twice in late December. During the course of those conversations, Flynn said the men exchanged Christmas greetings and discussed a Dec. 25 plane crash that killed members of a Russian military choir, peace talks in Syria and plans for a post-inauguration phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

    "text": "WATCH President Trump Still Believes Millions Voted Illegally: White House 0 Shares Email After being repeatedly pressed about President Donald Trump 's unsubstantiated claims that \"millions\" of people voted illegally in the presidential election, White House press secretary Sean Spicer left the door open to a possible investigation into the claims during a press briefing Tuesday. On Monday, Trump said during a meeting with congressional leaders in the White House that \"3 to 5 million illegals\" voted, according to two Democratic aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spicer told reporters Tuesday \"maybe we will\" launch an investigation into Trump's claims. \"Anything's possible, I think, at some point,\" he added. \"There is no investigation. I said it was possible. Anything is possible. It was a hypothetical question.\" Trump has made repeated claims about voter fraud after losing the popular vote in the election in November, though thus far, no evidence has been presented that backs up his allegations. \"He continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have presented to him,\" Spicer said Tuesday. At least five reporters asked questions on the issue during the press briefing, and at one point Spicer dismissed the suggestion that Trump kept bringing up the topic of the unsubstantiated voter fraud because the president was upset about the vote count. Spicer said Trump \"won very handily\" and \"he's very comfortable with his win.\" When pressed for specific evidence supporting Trump's \"long-standing belief,\" Spicer cited a 2008 study by Pew Research and \"other studies that have been presented to [Trump].\" The Trump transition team was previously asked about this topic and cited the Pew study, which came out in 2012 and focused on the results of the 2008 election and the need to update voter registration rolls. The primary author of the study in question previously responded, tweeting that \"the report made no findings re: voter fraud.\" Spicer did not give names or sources for the other studies. \"We'll see where we go from here, but right now the focus that the president has is putting Americans back to work,\" Spicer said. 0 Shares ",

By Anne Gearan By Anne Gearan January 24 at 5:47 PM Follow @agearan South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was confirmed Tuesday to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, placing a rising Republican political star in charge of advancing President Trump\u2019s agenda in an institution whose effectiveness he has questioned. She will step down from her post in South Carolina to take one of the country\u2019s highest profile diplomatic jobs and one that would burnish her resume for higher office later. Haley, who has no formal diplomatic experience, won significant Democratic support. The vote of 96-4 reflected some Democrats\u2019 view that Haley would be a sensible diplomat and speak her mind in the new administration. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approved her nomination by voice vote earlier Tuesday. She won praise from Democrats during her confirmation hearing last week, where she freely aired disagreements with Trump on some policy matters and said that the new president would welcome a range of views. View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far Haley, who had been critical of Trump as a candidate, voiced heavy skepticism about Russia and optimism about NATO, both deviations from some of Trump\u2019s statements. She unequivocally rejected the idea of a Muslim registry or ban, which Trump has never fully disavowed. She said she is comfortable with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican first\u201d approach and would reassert the traditional role of the United States in recent decades of protecting Israel from United Nations action it considers biased. She also declared her support for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a shift that Arab leaders have previously said could ignite violence in the Middle East. At her Jan. 18 hearing, Haley questioned the priorities and effectiveness of the world body, which Trump has called a toothless debating society, but said she intends to \u201cfix\u201d what doesn\u2019t work. \u201cI have no problem calling people out,\u201d Haley said. The United Nations is \u201coften at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers,\u201d Haley said, adding that she would use the \u201cleverage\u201d of potential cuts in U.S. funding to demand reform. \u201cWe contribute 22 percent of the U.N.\u2019s budget, far more than any other country.

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin By Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin January 24 at 1:25 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @eilperin President Trump signs executive orders on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines saying, \"we are going to renegotiate some of the terms.\" (Reuters) President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, another step in his effort to dismantle former president Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. He also signed an executive order to expedite environmental reviews of other infrastructure projects, lamenting the existing \u201cincredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\u201d \u201cThe regulatory process in this country has become a tangled-up mess,\u201d he said. It remained unclear how Trump\u2019s order would expedite those environmental reviews. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Indeed, Trump\u2019s order on the Dakota Access pipeline left some ambiguity. The executive order directs the Army Corps of Engineers to \u201creview and approve in an expedited manner, to the extent permitted by law.\u201d Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. His order for the Keystone XL project \u201cinvites\u201d the company to \u201cre-submit its application.\u201d In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. \u201cI am very insistent that if we\u2019re going to build pipelines in the United States, the pipe should be made in the United States,\u201d he told reporters. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The protest of an oil pipeline that is being constructed close to the Standing Rock Indian reservation has become a rallying point for Native Americans across the United States. Here's what you need to know. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. Last week the tribe asked remaining protesters \u2014\u00a0about 500 to 700 of whom were still in the main camp near the pipeline site \u2014 to leave and return to their homes. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. [ Voices from Standing Rock: Six views from the angry prairie standoff over the pipeline ] The executive order from Trump on the Keystone XL pipeline threatens to undo a major decision by Obama, who said the project would contribute to climate change because it would carry tar sands crude oil, which is especially greenhouse gas intensive because of the energy it takes to extract the thick crude. Obama\u2019s announcement followed a similar finding by the State Department, which has reviewed applications for cross-border pipelines. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. But it was unclear what Trump\u2019s caution about renegotiation would mean for TransCanada\u2019s plans. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. On Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cFrom now on, we\u2019re going to be making pipeline in the United States. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. We\u2019re going to put a lot of workers, a lot of skilled workers, back to work. We will build our own pipeline, we will build our own pipes, like we used to in the old days.\u201d [ On White House website, Obama climate priorities vanish, replaced by Trump\u2019s focus on energy production ] Speaking to reporters Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president supported energy projects \u201clike Dakota and the Keystone Pipeline, areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America\u2019s energy supply more, that\u2019s something that he has been very clear about.\u201d Referring to comments Trump has made during the campaign and after the election, Spicer said: \u201cHe was talking about that being a big priority. That\u2019s one of those ones where I think that the energy sector and our natural resources are an area where I think the president is very, very keen on making sure that we maximize our use of natural resources to America\u2019s benefit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s good for economic growth, it\u2019s good for jobs, and it\u2019s good for American energy,\u201d Spicer added. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. \u201cMaking American energy great again starts with infrastructure projects like these that move resources safely and efficiently,\u201d said Stephen Brown, vice president of federal government affairs at Tesoro Companies. \u201cWe are pleased to see the new direction being taken by this administration to recognize the importance of our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure by restoring the rule of law in the permitting process that\u2019s critical to pipelines and other infrastructure projects,\u201d said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. Many lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), backed the president\u2019s bid to revive the pipelines. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Greenpeace Executive Director Annie Leonard noted in a statement that a broad coalition of opponents \u2014 \u201cindigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists\u201d \u2014 managed to block the projects in the past and would not give up now. \u201cWe all saw the incredible strength and courage of the water protectors at Standing Rock, and the people around the world who stood with them in solidarity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stand with them again if Trump tries to bring the Dakota Access Pipeline, or any other fossil fuel infrastructure project, back to life.\u201d \u201cWe will resist this with all of our power, and we will continue to build the future the world wants to see,\u201d she added. 1 of 20 ",

Boltuck has been lobbying the state for information about the intersection's dangers for eight years. (Photo: Stephen R. Herm, for Reveal) 23 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Richard Boltuck did not plan to spend most of his waking hours fighting with public officials. He just wanted the state to install a left-turn traffic light at an accident-prone intersection near his home in Bethesda, Maryland. This request would drag on for more than eight years, and place Boltuck, an economist, squarely in the center of a national debate over just how transparent state and local governments should be when members of the public request information about dangerous roads, bridges and intersections. His efforts took on new urgency earlier this year, when three members of a family \u2013 en route to a high school play \u2013 died in a horrific accident at the very intersection that was the target of Boltuck\u2019s complaints. As the father, Michael Buarque de Macedo, attempted a left turn on the four-lane state road, his Chevy Volt was hit broadside by a BMW driven by Ogulcan Atakoglu, 20, who police said had been speeding at 115 miles per hour, 70 miles per hour above the speed limit. Buarque de Macedo, 52; his wife, Alessandra, 53; and their 18-year-old son, Thomas, were killed in the February crash; daughter Helena, who was 15 at the time of the accident, survived with substantial injuries. Atakoglu pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to 12 years in prison, which he is appealing. \u201cThis tragedy,\u201d Boltuck said, \u201chighlights the need for the engineering studies we have been requesting.\u201d But Boltuck\u2019s efforts to get those studies from the state were delayed for years. He and others in his neighborhood began asking for the information in 2008, as they sought data to challenge the state\u2019s conclusions that no left-turn light was needed. They were stymied by a little-known provision of federal law that gives states wide latitude to keep important engineering studies and other data secret from members of the public. Often these studies and data form the basis of a ranking system that states use to determine which roads, bridges and intersections merit urgent attention and federal dollars. Known as Section 409, a term well understood by state transportation officials across the country \u2013 but by few others \u2013 federal law 23 U.S. 409 has been interpreted by many state governments and state courts to allow their agencies to keep secret studies, surveys and other data about dangerous roads, bridges and intersections if there is even a remote possibility that someone might one day sue the government for failing to make needed redesigns or repairs. Boltuck bumped up against this barrier when he asked for what he thought were \u201cgarden-variety public records\u201d from Maryland\u2019s highway department. \u201cWe wanted to level the playing field so that both we and the State Highway Administration had the same information,\u201d he said. Instead, his request opened up a legal fight that he ultimately lost. A state administrative law judge said the state was within its rights to withhold certain accident data, analyses and engineering studies, noting that Boltuck might well \u201cwidely disseminate\u201d the information, and that they could eventually find their way into the hands of someone who might sue the state for failing to fix the intersection. But then, state officials \u2013 comfortable that they did not have to provide the documents \u2013 gave Boltuck some of them anyway. With those documents, he and his neighbors, sitting around his kitchen table and examining piles of documents, found that the state had not included seven of 13 accident reports from 2004 to 2007. \u201cThere were several accidents missing from the reports that the state had compiled to decide not to install a turning light,\u201d he said. In July, the Maryland General Assembly approved a bill that backers said would make the selection process for road improvements and repairs more transparent, making public a new ranking system for projects. The measure was vetoed by Gov. Larry Hogan, who said it actually would have the opposite effect and would politicize the process. The legislature overrode Hogan\u2019s veto. But the measure does not address the type of document Boltuck was seeking \u2013 the backup documents and data that inform the selections of projects. Like Maryland, many states shield this information from public disclosure, making it difficult for individuals, corporations and communities to make informed decisions about state spending, public safety and driving patterns. \u201cThis really restricts the ability to hold governments accountable,\u201d said Keith Kessler, a Seattle lawyer who has handled many accident cases and relies on Washington state\u2019s public records law. Kessler said when he does get access to accident data and other information, he mostly gets it piecemeal and then hires an expert to crunch the data, something community groups or individuals rarely can afford. In many states, individual accident reports are available to the public, but the cumulative data and the rankings by the state of specific sites are usually not obtainable. This information gap leaves drivers, school bus dispatchers, truckers, cyclists and pedestrians at a disadvantage, without information that would enable them to avoid dangerous routes. It opens the possibility that the decisions about which site gets fixed and when could be based on favoritism, not objective data. It also forces the public to rely on third parties \u2013 such as insurance companies \u2013 that scrape state accident databases for information about individual accidents, and then offer up their own lists of dangerous intersections, roads and bridges. Without data and access to state studies such as those Boltuck sought, residents who think their community may have been overlooked cannot compare reports to decide whether those third-party sources are accurate and whether states\u2019 decisions are meritorious or misguided. As with most state open government laws, where you live will determine how much information you can get. A few states, notably Kansas and New York, have seen state court rulings that make the documents and data available to the public. In a case brought by the newspaper Newsday, New York state\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, found in 2005 that the federal law doesn\u2019t require that dangerous locations lists \u201cshall be confidential\u201d \u2013 only that they cannot be used in discovery in lawsuits. And the court noted that \u201cif the information is published, it still cannot be entered into evidence,\u201d a step beyond discovery, or the information exchange that takes place before trial. \u201cCongress evidently did not think that the possibility that some plaintiffs would indirectly obtain information justified requiring nondisclosure of the documents for all purposes. If it had wanted to achieve that result, it could have said so,\u201d the New York high court said. Most states keep the information out of public view and away from tenacious residents who might use the information as leverage, to lobby the government to fix the routes. The U.S. Supreme Court endorsed that position in 2003, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas. In Pierce County v. Guillen, the high court concluded that the public interest in getting the roads repaired overcame any efforts by the public to obtain the information a state might collect when it is applying for federal funds. Along with Washington state, a dozen states had sought that ruling: Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Vermont, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which signed onto an amicus brief supporting the secrecy statute. Other states have litigated the issue, such as Tennessee, which exempts the information specifically from its public records law. Some states, including Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania, are making some of the data public, but usually note that it cannot be used in a court case, and usually leave it to the individual to analyze it. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision said that it was ultimately in the public interest to exempt the studies from discovery, because the studies and data collection systems had been devised to encourage candor among public officials. Congress could reasonably believe, Thomas wrote, that allowing states to collect the information and keep it secret could result in \u201cmore candid discussions of hazardous locations, better informed decisionmaking, and, ultimately, greater safety on our Nation's roads.\u201d For Michael Gendler, a client of Kessler\u2019s, and also a Seattle lawyer, the fight to get state highway data about a bridge had particular significance. Gendler became a quadriplegic after a 2007 bike accident on a local bridge. He soon discovered that there had been other similar accidents on the bridge. But he was stymied in the same way that Boltuck was. A state agency insisted that Gendler had to certify that he would not use the records in a lawsuit against the state or other government agency. Gendler refused. \u201cI ... do not want to waive my right as a citizen to have access to these public records to promote my ability to become fully informed about the history of this bridge and about the conduct of the governmental agency or agencies responsible for providing a reasonably safe road,\u201d he wrote. Gendler said he knew he had to find a work-around, and was fortunate to be able to get the raw data and employ experts, something that is out of reach of most community activists, such as Boltuck. \u201cOur position was we will use our own experts, we just want the accident record, we don\u2019t want any analysis of it, or records,\u201d he said, recounting his legal battle. \u201cIf you are asking for raw data, the states allow you to gather and analyze the raw data.\u201d But he and Kessler relied heavily on the state\u2019s public records law, he said. And getting records, Gendler noted, depends on how effective those laws are. \u201cIf you have a weak public records act, you might not get the records, notwithstanding the obvious horror of your learning that there was that kind of accident so close in time to what happened without corrective action being done or prioritized,\u201d he said. Gendler said that his original request was for accident reports at the same location, Seattle Montlake Bridge, that were held by the Washington State Patrol. He had suspected that the bridge was unsafe for cyclists for almost 10 years, following replacement and repairs of the bridge. The police agency refused unless he would certify that he would not use the records in a lawsuit against the state, a suit he actually was getting ready to file. His refusal to agree was critical to his eventual success in securing an $8 million settlement. The state had maintained that the records were protected under federal law and did not have to be disclosed because they were part of a database, maintained by the state Department of Transportation, that it used to apply for federal funds. Gendler and Kessler, his lawyer, eventually got the information, but not until the case went all the way to the Washington state Supreme Court. That 2012 ruling found that because the state police had to collect the data anyway, and even though another state agency might use it for the secret dangerous roadways ranking system, the data were still subject to public disclosure under the state public records act. In Bethesda, there is still no left-turn signal at the intersection of Braeburn Parkway and River Road. However, after public outcry following this year\u2019s fatal accident the state said in August that it planned to install a flashing light that alerts oncoming drivers that someone ahead in the opposite lane is attempting a left turn. State highway spokesman Dave Buck said at the time, that studies did not warrant the left-turn light that Boltuck had sought. Last month, there was another accident at the site involving high school students, injuring two. But by year\u2019s end, there was no flashing light yet installed. Boltuck says the plan is too little too late. Now he\u2019d prefer to see the left turn prohibited, and the intersection closed. Even if a flashing warning light is installed, he said, the intersection remains \u201cinherently dangerous.\u201d Miranda S.
