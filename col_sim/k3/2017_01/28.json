His mother Mamie wanted the nation to see the brutality of his killers. Mamie Till \u201cI wondered, why was it necessary to shoot him?\u2019\u201d she said years later. Till was visiting family in Mississippi when a story started going around town that he had whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a 21-year old white cashier at a grocery store. After Till\u2019s body was found a few days later, Bryant\u2019s husband and brother-in-law were charged with murder. At the trial, Bryant testified Till made lewd advances, verbal and physical.\u00a0 \u201cIn court she testified to something that was tantamount to attempted rape.  What she said was \u2018that part\u2019s not true,\u2019\u201d said author Tim Tyson. Carolyn Bryant Tyson writes in his new book \u201cThe Blood OF Emmett Till,\u201d due out next week, that in an interview conducted a decade ago she took it all back. The book is published by Simon and Schuster, a division of CBS. \u201cShe was trying to say nothing that went on between them constituted any excuse for anyone harming him, let alone what happened to him,\u201d Tyson said. Despite overwhelming evidence, the men were acquitted in less than an hour by an all-white jury. They would later admit to a magazine they had killed Till. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was able to get some footage of Bryant in 2004, then Carolyn Donham, but she refused to answer any questions, as her son made clear to Ed Bradley.

Activists protest as President Donald Trump attends the Congress of Tomorrow Republican Member Retreat Jan. 26, 2017, at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Mike DebonisThe Washington Post Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party's quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. The recording reveals a GOP that appears to be filled with doubts about how to make good on a long-standing promise to get rid of Obamacare without explicit guidance from President Donald Trump or his administration. The thorny issues lawmakers grapple with on the tape - including who may end up either losing coverage or paying more under a revamped system - highlight the financial and political challenges that flow from upending the current law. Senators and House members expressed a range of concerns about the task ahead: how to prepare a replacement plan that can be ready to launch at the time of repeal; how to avoid deep damage to the health insurance market; how to keep premiums affordable for middle-class families; even how to avoid the political consequences of defunding Planned Parenthood, the women's health-care organization, as many Republicans hope to do with the repeal of the ACA. \"We'd better be sure that we're prepared to live with the market we've created\" with repeal, said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. \"That's going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we'll be judged in the election less than two years away.\" Republican anxiety is mounting over voting to unravel the health care law without having an alternative in hand, fanned by words of encouragement from Donald Trump to a GOP senator who wants to simultaneously repeal and replace the statute. GOP leaders have made dismantling President Barack Obama ... Republican anxiety is mounting over voting to unravel the health care law without having an alternative in hand, fanned by words of encouragement from Donald Trump to a GOP senator who wants to simultaneously repeal and replace the statute. GOP leaders have made dismantling President Barack Obama ... (Tribune news services) Recordings of closed sessions at the Republican policy retreat in Philadelphia this week were sent late Thursday to The Post and several other news outlets from an anonymous email address. The remarks of all lawmakers quoted in this story were confirmed by their offices or by the lawmakers themselves. \"Our goal, in my opinion, should be not a quick fix. We can do it rapidly - but not a quick fix,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. \"We want a long-term solution that lowers costs.\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, warned his colleagues that the estimated budget savings from repealing Obamacare - which Republicans say could approach a half-trillion dollars - would be needed to fund the costs of setting up a replacement. \"This is going to be what we'll need to be able to move to that transition,\" he said. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Tex., worried that one idea floated by Republicans - a refundable tax credit - would not work for middle-class families that cannot afford to prepay their premiums and wait for a tax refund. Republicans have also discussed the idea of generating revenue for their plan by taking aim at deductions that allow most Americans to get health insurance through their employers without paying extra taxes on it. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who has drafted his own bill to reform the Affordable Care Act, said in response, \"It sounds like we are going to be raising taxes on the middle class in order to pay for these new credits.\" Tom Price, Lamar Alexander Carolyn Kaster / AP Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Sen.

Tom Price, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017, prior to the start of Price's confirmation hearing before the committee. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Tex., who chairs a key tax-writing subcommittee, countered, \"I don't see it that way,\" adding that there is \"a tax break on employer-sponsored health care and nowhere else\" equal to $3.6 billion over 10 years. \"Could you unlock just a small portion at the top to be able to give that freedom [to self-employed Americans]? That is the question,\" Brady said. Rep. John Faso, R-N.Y., a freshman congressman from the Hudson Valley, warned strongly against using the repeal of the ACA to also defund Planned Parenthood. \"We are just walking into a gigantic political trap if we go down this path of sticking Planned Parenthood in the health insurance bill,\" he said. \"If you want to do it somewhere else, I have no problem, but I think we are creating a political minefield for ourselves - House and Senate.\" The concerns of rank-and-file lawmakers appeared to be at odds with key congressional leaders and Andrew Bremberg, a top domestic policy adviser to Trump, who have laid out plans to repeal the ACA using a fast-track legislative process and executive actions from the administration. However, these leaders acknowledged in Thursday's meeting, as they have before, that Obamacare cannot be fully undone - or replaced - without Democratic cooperation. That and other aspects of the unfinished GOP plan prompted several wary lawmakers to urge their leaders to move more deliberately - even as the Trump administration appears to be moving ahead with repeal. Thursday, the White House ordered federal health officials to immediately halt all advertising and other outreach activities for the critical final days in which Americans can sign up for 2017 health coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., dismissed the concerns aired in the meeting during an interview at a Politico event Friday. (Tribune news services) \"We have a responsibility to work for the people that put us in office,\" he said. \"That's the oath we take: to defend the Constitution, to fight for the people we represent, and this is a fiasco that needs to be fixed.\" Of particular concern to some Republican lawmakers was a plan to use the budget reconciliation process - which requires only a simple majority vote - to repeal the existing law, while still needing a filibuster-proof vote of 60 in the Senate to enact a replacement. \"The fact is, we cannot repeal Obamacare through reconciliation,\" McClintock said. \"We need to understand exactly: What does that reconciliation market look like? And I haven't heard the answer yet.\" Several important policy areas appeared unsettled. While the chairmen of key committees sketched out various proposals, they did not have a clear plan for how to keep markets viable while requiring insurers to cover everyone who seeks insurance. At one point Cassidy, a physician who co-founded a community health clinic in Baton Rouge to serve the uninsured, asked the panelists a \"simple question\": Will states have the ability to maintain the expanded Medicaid rolls provided for under the ACA, which now provide coverage for more than 10 million Americans, and can other states do similar expansions? \"These are decisions we haven't made yet,\" said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., worried that the plans under GOP consideration could eviscerate coverage for the roughly 20 million Americans now covered through state and federal marketplaces and the law's Medicaid expansion: \"We're telling those people that we're not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them.\" Republicans are also still wrestling with whether Obamacare's taxes can be immediately repealed, a priority for many conservatives, or whether that revenue will be needed to fund a transition period. And there seems to be little consensus on whether to pursue a major overhaul of Medicaid - converting it from an open-ended entitlement that costs federal and state governments $500 billion a year to a fixed block grant. Trump and his top aides, including counselor Kellyanne Conway, have publicly endorsed that idea. But doing so would mean that some low-income Americans would not be automatically covered by a program that currently covers 70 million Americans. Many of the concerns aired Thursday were more political than policy-oriented. Faso's remarks about Planned Parenthood generated tepid applause. Ryan said this month that he expects the House to pursue the organization's defunding in the reconciliation bill. Those expressing qualms included some of the top congressional leaders who are in line to draft the health-care legislation. Alexander, for one, is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Ryan and other leaders have said they intend to pursue a piecemeal approach, following the reconciliation bill with smaller ones that address discrete aspects of reform. Bremberg, chairman of Trump's domestic policy council, offered little detail in the session about particular executive actions the Trump administration intends to take or what legislative proposals the new president favors. Instead, he pointed to the executive order Trump signed last week, his first, as proof of his commitment to undoing Obamacare's mandates and said his choice of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be his health and human services secretary \"should speak volumes to people trying to understand what he's hoping to achieve.\" \"This is not a technocrat,\" Bremberg said. \"This is an experienced, compassionate doctor who has experienced the health-care system firsthand and who has been a leader here in Washington trying to address the policy reforms that need to take place. Having both of those in a secretary is going to be very important and very powerful.\" Even as Bremberg offered few details about what the president plans to do, he emphasized that last week's executive order \"repeatedly\" used phrases \"such as 'to the maximum extent permitted by law' \" to enable his political appointees to start dismantling the ACA by executive authority. \"I'm sure many of us have been very concerned about the interpretation of that phrase in the last six or so years,\" Bremberg quipped, referring to the previous administration. \"The president has now officially given direction [not only] to HHS, but to all of these agencies that have responsibility . . . to exercise all available discretion to begin helping the American people and to begin fixing our health-care system.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bremberg's remarks. Faso warned that by defunding Planned Parenthood in the reconciliation bill, \"we are arming our enemy in this debate.\" \"To me, us taking retribution on Planned Parenthood is kind of morally akin to what Lois Lerner and Obama and the IRS did against tea party groups,\" he said, a reference to accusations that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative political groups for audits. Faso continued: \"Health insurance is going to be tough enough for us to deal with without having millions of people on social media come to Planned Parenthood's defense and sending hundreds of thousands of new donors to the Democratic Senate and Democratic congressional campaign committees. So I would just urge us to rethink this.\" The Washington Post's Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane contributed to this report. ",

Journalists, who still don\u2019t seem able to understand that Trump is almost always several steps ahead of them, once again are heralding the president\u2019s seeming preoccupation with the issue. Is the president actually so thin-skinned that he needs the world to acknowledge that a huge number of people turned out to honor him as he was sworn in? Um, no. So what\u2019s really going on in his mind? Here\u2019s my opinion: Everything Donald Trump does is strategically calculated to achieve a goal. His communication is designed not to simply convey his gut feelings, but to make people focus on one thing \u2014 call it a decoy \u2014 so he can do six other things while they\u2019re distracted. In this case, Trump has masterfully used the media\u2019s pathetic naivet\u00e9 and desire to battle him to make them focus on a throwaway battle \u2014 his seeming obsession with crowd size (which I can almost guarantee he could not care less about) \u2014 while he determinedly does what he does care about: signing orders that resurrect pipeline projects, retooling our broken immigration laws, laying the groundwork for a better health care system and preparing to build the wall. For journalists who still don\u2019t get it, here it is, again, in direct terms: When Trump says something like \u201cIf I were you I would take your camera and look at the size of the crowd,\u201d he is actually saying, \u201cLet\u2019s debate crowd size, again, because otherwise you might ask me questions about my real and historically powerful plans and ideas, which I don\u2019t trust you to report on fairly, anyhow.\u201d A journalist who might even come close to Trump\u2019s level of strategic communication should then say, \u201cAh, the old watch this hand while I work magic with my other one? No, we shall not linger an instant on that silly issue my colleagues in the media are focused on. Let\u2019s sit down and talk about the pipelines, again. I don\u2019t want to walk around and snort another line of that drug you know the media is addicted to.\u201d The drug, by the way, is called taking the easy path of the pithy, sensational, stupid story. And lots of journalists who get paid lots of money seem to be hopelessly hooked on it. The rest of us, over the next 90 days or eight years, will watch Trump masterfully ignite one squabble after another that the members of the press fall all over themselves to engage in, while he remakes the world. Man, I am just so happy this guy went to work for us. I\u2019m still pinching myself. It\u2019s like a miracle.

Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that sell a lot of imported goods are among the strongest opponents of the border-tax idea. (Scott Olson / Getty Images) Don Lee Contact Reporter President Trump\u2019s desire to fund\u00a0the cost of\u00a0a wall across the southern border with Mexico has suddenly brought out of obscurity\u00a0a\u00a0border-tax idea that has been around for many years and is\u00a0embedded in the GOP blueprint for tax reform. The plan would subject importers to higher taxes than exporters or\u00a0those that produce at home for domestic consumption. But the proposal \u2014\u00a0which would essentially replace much of the current corporate tax system \u2014 \u00a0is so fraught with controversy and challenges, politically and legally, that many\u00a0experts give it\u00a0long odds of\u00a0being adopted, despite strong backing\u00a0from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and\u00a0House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin\u00a0Brady (R-Texas).\u00a0 Trump himself had initially dismissed the idea as too complicated, but Thursday he and administration officials suggested that they were considering a 20% tax\u00a0as an\u00a0option\u00a0to generate revenue from imports from countries such as Mexico to pay for the wall. Although it wasn\u2019t entirely clear what kind of tax\u00a0the president had in mind, it appeared Trump was opening the door to a so-called border-adjustment tax, also referred to\u00a0as a destination-based tax because the taxes are determined by where the\u00a0goods and services are sold. Under such a\u00a0proposal, a company\u00a0that imports all of its goods would face a 20% tax on sales of those goods in the U.S.\u00a0 By contrast, a business that produces and sells only in the U.S. could reduce the 20% tax bite substantially\u00a0because it would be able to deduct the labor costs incurred domestically that went into the products. Most to gain are exporters: A\u00a0company in the U.S.\u00a0that produces at home would be exempt from paying the tax\u00a0on its\u00a0foreign revenue, and moreover it could deduct the domestic labor costs for those goods or services sold. That means\u00a0a profitable\u00a0export business\u00a0could even wind up with\u00a0a\u00a0negative tax liability, thus a refund.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe export rebates will end up being politically problematic because it will involve the Treasury sending checks to profitable companies instead of collecting taxes from them,\u201d said Eric Toder, a former Treasury official who co-directs the Tax Policy Center.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u00a0don\u2019t think the optics of that would go over very well.\u201d Many economists like the proposal\u00a0because it is simpler\u00a0than the current tax code, which has a high 35% tax rate and is also teeming with special deductions and loopholes. Significantly, the import\u00a0tax\u00a0would sharply reduce,\u00a0if not eliminate, incentives for multinational firms\u00a0to relocate headquarters outside of the U.S., a practice known as corporate inversion, or to manipulate the tax system in other ways to\u00a0shift their profits offshore to avoid U.S. paying taxes. \u201cIt will strongly encourage companies to locate production activities in the United States\u00a0because the taxes paid on profits are going to depend on where they\u2019re sold, not where they\u2019re produced,\u201d said Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley who has written about border-adjustment tax\u00a0over\u00a0the last decade.\u00a0 Based on a 20% tax, the proposal\u00a0in itself would generate more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years. But the border-adjustment\u00a0tax\u00a0is only part of a comprehensive tax overhaul\u00a0plan by House Republicans, which includes substantial cuts in individual income taxes,\u00a0largely benefiting higher-income Americans. On the whole,\u00a0experts say, the House tax reform would reduce federal tax revenue overall, even with the gain from the border-adjustment\u00a0tax. The proposed tax faces opposition from\u00a0many camps, liberals who don\u2019t like the seemingly regressive nature of a consumption tax, and fiscal conservatives. Some of the\u00a0most vocal\u00a0critics are\u00a0large importers such as oil refineries and retailers, which will feel the biggest hit in taxes. And the idea\u00a0won\u2019t be easy to sell to the American public, either. That is because in the end, these taxes will be borne by consumers as businesses that sell imported goods are certain to pass on at least some of their increased taxes to shoppers.\u00a0\u00a0 Publisher Steve Forbes, who twice ran to be\u00a0the Republican presidential nominee\u00a0and is an ardent critic of excessive taxation, argued in a full-page ad this week in the Wall Street Journal that\u00a0the border tax\u00a0could\u00a0result in\u00a0a 30-cent jump in gas prices and consumers paying 20% or more for everyday goods, much of which are imported from China and other low-wage countries.\u00a0 Economists point out\u00a0that such fears are overblown, however. Even as\u00a0a border-adjustment tax raises\u00a0the cost\u00a0of imports, domestic demand for foreign goods\u00a0will fall, thereby pushing up the value of the dollar. At the same time, as U.S. exporters pay fewer taxes, they will be able to lower their prices in foreign markets, which would drive up demand for dollars and also tend to lift up the dollar value relative to other currencies. All in all, economic theory\u00a0suggests that a stronger dollar would offset the additional cost to American importers and consumers.\u00a0 However, Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Bank, doubts that the\u00a0exchange-rate adjustment would\u00a0completely offset the higher costs. And neither he nor anyone else can say how quickly the dollar\u2019s\u00a0value would rise. What\u2019s more, some countries peg\u00a0their currency values\u00a0to the dollar, which would prevent an appreciation of the greenback, and\u00a0international currency markets are notoriously unpredictable.\u00a0 \u201cUnless the dollar appreciates quickly and countries don\u2019t\u00a0fix their exchange rates, at least in the short run you\u2019re going to be paying more for all that\u00a0stuff,\u201d said\u00a0Kimberly Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College who has written about the problems of the border-adjustment tax.\u00a0\u201cSo that government revenue is coming in, but it\u2019s coming in on the backs of the people who shop at Wal-Mart and the Gap.\u201d Because of such competing interests, business organizations\u00a0like the Chamber of Commerce have been reluctant to take a position on the tax, foreshadowing the upcoming political battle in the halls of Congress and the White House. \u201cMost of the major groups want to remain mostly netural,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, an analyst at the Tax Foundation.\u00a0 Toder, of the Tax Policy Center, agrees\u00a0that shifting from the current system of corporate taxation to a destination-based tax on cash flow would make the U.S. a more desirable place for investment, to\u00a0build factories or to conduct operations. The plan could even lead to higher wages, he said. Still, he doesn\u2019t think the proposal will fly, in part because of the preference to exporters, which also is expected to raise\u00a0legal objections under the World Trade Organization . Clausing\u00a0and Reuven Avi-Yonah, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote\u00a0in a paper this month that the wage-deduction element of the border-tax plan makes it incompatible with the WTO rules prohibiting export subsidies.\u00a0 Berkeley economist Auerbach disputes the notion that the border-adjustment tax is an export subsidy:\u00a0\u201cReducing taxes on wages does encourage domestic employment, but I don\u2019t see how that can be characterized as a trade-related policy,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss So-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge. \u00a0 A surge in media mergers is expected under Trump\u2019s pro-business agenda. \u00a0 Chinese New Year begins tomorrow. \u00a0 Grocery store tomatoes are often tasteless but researchers at the University of Florida have discovered a game-changer.

At least one body was recovered from the ashes in Santa Olga, according to Deutsche Welle , and about 6,000 residents fled the city as the flames moved in. \"This is an extremely serious situation \u2014 of horror, a nightmare without an end,\" the mayor of the coastal city of Constitucion told the German broadcaster. \"Everything burned.\" The remains of a home destroyed by fire in Santa Olga on Thursday.

The newspaper reported: \"In total, 4,000 people \u2014 including firefighters, troops and national forestry bureau officers \u2014 and 46 aircraft have been deployed to combat the fires, according to the National Emergency Bureau. \"Some residents, lacking any training or protective gear, have used tree branches and bottles of water to try to douse the flames.\" The Chilean government has appealed for international help.

We know nothing about them,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday. \"They can say they vet them. They didn't vet them. They have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don't know anything about them and you have no papers?\" Though the United States government already utilizes a thorough nine-step vetting system for refugees, the president's executive order is said to go further. It is still unclear what these steps would mean and if it would target any particular religious group as the president stated on the campaign trail. According to the Pew Research Center , the United States welcomed almost 85,000 refugees in 2016. Forty-six percent of them were Muslim. The president sets the number of refugees accepted annually into the U.S. and from that authority can suspend the program at any time. President George W. Bush took similar actions following the 9/11 attacks when the program was suspended for several months. Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the Homeland Security committee, said on Friday that he applauds the president's move. \"We are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\" McCaul said in a statement. \"Today, President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States.\" The response from advocates for refugee rights was swift. \"I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war,\" Malala Yousafzai, a student activist and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate said in a statement through a press office. \"I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants \u2014 the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the social media platform to express his concern about the executive order' impact on those fleeing violence and oppression in their homelands. His great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. The parents of his wife, Priscilla, were refugees from China and Vietnam. \"We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation,\" he wrote . \"We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today.\" Trump also called for a \"great rebuilding\" of the nation's military. \"New planes, new ships, new resources, new tools for our men and women in uniform.\" Halimah Abdullah ",

Got it Cups depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump for sale in St.Petersburg, Russia. The two leaders are set to talk Saturday. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP) By Karen DeYoung and David Filipov By Karen DeYoung and David Filipov January 27 at 2:17 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @davidfilipov President Trump said Friday that it is \u201cvery early\u201d to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia, suggesting no action is likely in a Saturday call that will be his first official conversation with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. Trump spoke at a White House news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who reaffirmed her support for keeping the sanctions in place until substantive progress has been made toward ending the conflict in Ukraine. She said she would continue to press that argument with other European allies. The United States and Europe imposed sanctions, beginning in 2014, to protest Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and military intervention on behalf of Ukrainian separatists. Additional U.S. sanctions were levied by the Obama administration last month as punishment for what the intelligence community said was Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election process . U.S. policy toward Russia has become one of the front lines in a simmering power struggle between the White House and powerful congressional Republicans, some of whom have looked to members of Trump\u2019s foreign policy team for support. At the news conference, Trump said he hoped for \u201ca great relationship with Russia\u201d but had \u201cno guarantees.\u201d President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Don Emmert and Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images) \u201cAs far as again Putin and Russia, I don\u2019t say good, bad or indifferent,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That\u2019s possible. And it\u2019s also possible we won\u2019t. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully.\u201d Couching a possible relationship in personal terms, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019ve had many times where I thought I\u2019d get along with people and I don\u2019t like them at all.\u201d [ Trump meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May ] Trump\u2019s comments followed earlier remarks by a senior White House adviser that sanctions removal was \u201cunder consideration,\u201d sparking warnings from senior Republican lawmakers. In a statement Friday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that he hoped Trump \u201cwill put an end to this speculation\u201d about lifting sanctions \u201cand reject such a reckless course.\u201d McCain and leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have threatened to introduce legislation to prevent it. Defense Secretary James Mattis, prodded by McCain at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, said: \u201cWe have a long list of times where we\u2019ve tried to engage positively with Russia. We have a relative short list of successes in that regard . . . and I think the most important thing right now is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with with Mr. Putin.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Friday that he was \u201cagainst lifting any sanctions on the Russians. These sanctions were imposed because of their behavior in Crimea, eastern Ukraine, and now we know they\u2019ve been messing around in our elections as well,\u201d McConnell told Politico. \u201cIf there\u2019s any country in the world that doesn\u2019t deserve sanctions relief, it\u2019s Russia.\u201d (Jenny Starrs, David Filipov, Julie Vitkovskaya / The Washington Post) Numerous Russia analysts outside government have also opposed lifting sanctions, while some have also cautioned against legislation that could weaken Trump\u2019s leverage with Putin by signaling, early in the administration, that the new U.S. president\u2019s powers are limited. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bad idea, almost as bad as some in the Senate, which would deprive President Trump of the opportunity\u201d to set his own policy, said Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Washington-based Center for the National Interest. Trump himself first gave rise to speculation about reversing the sanctions. After repeatedly praising Putin during his campaign, he told the Wall Street Journal days before his inauguration that he expected to keep them intact for \u201ca period of time.\u201d But, he said, \u201cif you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\u201d In an interview with the New York Times, Trump suggested sanctions could be scrapped in exchange for nuclear arms reductions. Statements by McCain, McConnell and others followed remarks Friday morning by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway that sanctions would be \u201cunder consideration\u201d when Trump speaks to Putin. Asked just hours before Trump\u2019s news conference whether Russia, before sanctions are lifted, would have to \u201cchange its behavior\u201d in Ukraine and in Syria, where Russian warplanes have aided the Syrian government in bombing rebels and civilians, Conway told Fox News, \u201cYou know what the president has said \u2014 it\u2019s America first, and that includes in his foreign policy and his national security moves.\u201d The scheduled Saturday call was first announced early Friday in Moscow by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. [ Trump lays groundwork to change U.S. role in the world ] Putin has cautiously expressed optimism that Trump can improve the U.S.-Russia relationship. In addition to the lifting of sanctions, Russia is also pushing for a reduction of NATO\u2019s military presence near its borders and counterterrorism cooperation in Syria.\u00a0 On a grander scale, Moscow hopes the new administration will relax what it sees as a policy of containment since the fall of the Soviet Union left the United States as the world\u2019s sole superpower, allowing the Kremlin to have a greater influence in world affairs and, in Russia\u2019s view, to feel more secure at home. Saturday\u2019s call will cap a week in which Trump has begun sweeping foreign policy changes\u00a0in line with the \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to global affairs that\u00a0he has promised. But Moscow has consistently cautioned about \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d over what Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for Russia, and Peskov stayed on script Friday. \u201cOne can hardly expect substantive contacts on the entire range of affairs from this call,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cLet us wait and see. Let us be patient.\u201d Moscow\u2019s establishment has welcomed Trump as a pragmatist who will not try to enforce American values on the rest of the world.\u00a0In a nationally televised news conference earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov railed against the \u201cmessianism\u201d \u00a0and export by the West of \u201cpost-Christian values\u201d that embrace \u201cpermissiveness,\u201d a nod toward the conservative ethos that has found increasing support in the Kremlin. \u00a0\u201cIf we hear that in the foreign policy of Donald Trump the main thing will be the fight against terrorism, then we, of course, can only welcome that, since that is exactly the thing that has been lacking with our American partners,\u201d Lavrov said. The Obama administration frequently characterized Russia as an unreliable partner at best and raised cautions about Trump\u2019s willingness to work with Putin amid growing concerns about the nature of his ties to Moscow.\u00a0 Trump has denied any business involvement in Russia, a claim that is impossible to verify\u00a0because he has refused to release his tax returns. But a look at his record since the 1980s shows that he and his family have launched several efforts to do business in Russia. Just after the election, a Russian deputy foreign minister was quoted saying his government had been in contact with Trump\u2019s campaign, and afterward, reports emerged that Russian intelligence had compromising information on the future president . Trump has vehemently denied the allegations and has sought to portray his upbeat words about Putin as a positive.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Trump is an ally for abortion opponents, too Opponents of abortion gather every year on the National Mall and march to the Supreme Court. Usually their defiance is not much more than symbolism \u2014 the court is the origin of Roe v. Wade, the decision in 1973 that they have sought for more than 40 years to overturn. This year they have ample reason to believe that under a Republican-dominated government, they will begin to see movement for the first time in more than a decade. In previous years, no president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. This year, the Trump administration will be out in full force with the appearances of Mr. Pence and Ms. Conway. President Trump, in one of his first official acts, signed an order prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad who discuss abortion as a family-planning option. And in a break with previous Republican presidents, he has embraced the idea of a litmus test for his Supreme Court nominees and pledged explicitly to name someone who opposes abortion. He said he would announce his choice on Thursday to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February. The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 27, 2017 Mr. Trump has become an unlikely champion for the movement, with abortion opponents saying he is probably their most unflinching White House ally since President Ronald Reagan. Though Mr. Trump spent much of his life as a supporter of abortion rights, he spoke more vividly and forcefully on the issue during the campaign than any recent Republican nominee. Advertisement And while many groups opposing abortion were vehemently opposed to Mr. Trump during the Republican primaries last year, almost all of them came around. Today, however unexpectedly, they march in a Washington suddenly more friendly to their interests. Photo People on the National Mall for the March for Life rally on Friday in Washington. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Voices of the marchers Many of the activists said they were looking forward to President Trump appointing Supreme Court justices who might overturn the right to abortions and to the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Marchers waved signs spelling out their beliefs in messages like \u201cSave the babies,\u201d \u201cPro-Child, Pro-Women, Pro-Life,\u201d and \u201cTrump for Baby Bumps.\u201d Still, some of the marchers remained wary of the new president. Kathleen Crank, 19, a sophomore at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan., traveled on a five bus caravan of 260 students to come to the march. She said she was happy to have a president who would oppose abortion but wasn\u2019t excited about much else about Mr. Trump. She said she waited until the last minute and decided not to vote for either him or Hillary Clinton. \u201cTheir stance on abortion is probably the only issue I\u2019m glad about for this administration,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that after eight years of reading Obama\u2019s tweets celebrating Roe v. Wade, I\u2019m glad we finally have an administration that is recognizing we need to cut funding for abortions in other countries and bringing it back down to the state level.\u201d Ms. Crank also said she saw abortions as less about religion than about preserving the rights of unborn children. \u201cIt\u2019s more a social justice issue for unborn babies than a religious one to push an agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone should be able to live their life and live it however they want to.\u201d Annette Saunders, 60, drove five hours with her husband from Norwalk, Conn., to volunteer with Save the Storks , a group that opposes abortion, and to hand out signs that said, \u201cFor those who can\u2019t.\u201d Though she voted for Mr. Trump, Ms. Saunders said she agonized over the decision because she found him to be \u201ccrass\u201d and was frustrated by the tape of him using vulgarities to talk about women. \u201cI was concerned but I felt like God told me to vote for Donald Trump ,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is standing up for pro-life and his vice president certainly is and I\u2019m excited about seeing a turnaround.\u201d Advertisement Young voters say why they turned to Trump Photo A bag featuring President Trump\u2019s likeness at the rally on Friday.

They were part of a group that traveled to Washington from Archbishop Hoban, a private Catholic high school in Akron, Ohio. Both said Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to abortion were the centerpieces of their support for the new president. They grew up in families dedicated to the cause. Ms. Rauh had supported former President Barack Obama but became enthusiastic in 2016. \u201cI thought Obama was a pretty good president,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are some things that need to be changed, like Roe v. Wade. I think Trump has got a plan and is ready to do it.\u201d \u201cI want women to have their rights,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think there are a bunch of women in the womb that are being killed, too.\u201d Mr. Banks, the son of a police officer, said he was thrilled by Mr. Trump\u2019s patriotism. He said he hoped the new president found a way to outlaw abortion.

By Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff By Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff January 27 at 3:29 PM Follow @missy_ryan Follow @Tmgneff President Trump announced two executive actions, one relating to vetting refugees, the other to increased military funding, on Jan. 27 at the Pentagon. (The Washington Post) President Trump paid his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Friday, signing executive actions subjecting potential immigrants to greater scrutiny and seeking to enhance American military power. Appearing at the\u00a0Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes, which honors military personnel who have received the Medal of Honor, Trump held up an order he said would establish new measures designed to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from entering the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said, flanked by Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.\u201d The text of the orders was not immediately available. A draft of one executive order obtained this week by The Washington Post, in keeping with Trump\u2019s campaign promises to subject immigrants to \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d\u00a0laid out plans for a\u00a0temporary ban on the entry of people from certain countries, many of them majority Muslim. It also ordered a temporary halt to refugee admission, prompting an outcry from civil rights groups. Some advocates have said the measures, if implemented, would amount to a ban on Muslims entering the country. [ Draft executive order would begin \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 of immigrants and visitors to the U.S. ] Trump said in remarks before a crowd of current and retired defense officials that he was also signing an order that would \u201cbegin a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States,\u201d including plans for new aircraft, ships and other military equipment. The incoming administration has already signaled its intent to restore defense funding and improve military capabilities following a period of declining budgets and shrinking ranks. In another\u00a0 draft executive order \u00a0obtained this week, the White House instructed Mattis to conduct a 30-day review of military readiness and lay plans for ensuring the United States can meet a host of challenges, not only such terrorist groups as the Islamic State but also \u201cnear-peer\u201d nations that could include Russia and China. It also signaled a desire to invest in a host of military capabilities, including Special Operations forces and nuclear weapons. It was not immediately clear if the draft orders made public this week were the same ones signed by Trump on Friday. [ What is an executive order? And how do President Trump\u2019s stack up? ] In his first week in office, Trump has created anxiety among allies by staking out positions in favor of waterboarding, insisting that North American Free Trade Agreement partner Mexico will pay for a wall along the U.S. border and laying out a number of controversial executive orders. His\u00a0first official interaction with senior military leaders suggested he will attempt to follow through on promises to grow U.S. defenses, boost military spending, and restore personnel cut in recent years. But it provided few clues about how a leader with little national security experience will approach fraught issues including the potential for conflict with nations like China and North Korea and decisions on when to risk American lives overseas. After\u00a0a visit of about 90 minutes that included a meeting with senior uniformed officials, Trump\u00a0said that the Hall of Heroes, one of the Pentagon\u2019s most solemn spaces, was a \u201ctestament to the undying courage\u201d of U.S. service members. Appearing to read from prepared remarks, Trump spoke in noticeably\u00a0more somber tones than he did in front of the CIA\u2019s Memorial Wall last weekend. The new president was criticized by some former officials for failing to show adequate gravity during that event. \u201cI am privileged to be here with you and I promise that our administration will always have your back,\u201d Trump said, addressing U.S. service members. \u201cWe will always be with you.\u201d In his remarks, Trump repeatedly praised Mattis, a retired Marine officer with a long combat record who Trump called \u201ca general\u2019s general.\u201d Already, Mattis has already suggested he may differ with his commander-in-chief on key issues such as the importance of the NATO alliance. [ Draft executive order shows how Trump wants to grow the U.S. military significantly ] Earlier in the day, speaking alongside visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump suggested he would defer to Mattis on treatment of detainees. Trump has said he favors waterboarding, while Mattis does not. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree, but I would tell you that [Mattis] will override because I\u2019m giving him that power,\u201d Trump said of harsh interrogation methods. Trump, who has tapped a number of prominent former generals to lead his national security team, has also promised to aggressively combat militant groups as part of his drive to exterminate \u201cradical Islamism.\u201d Trump takes command as U.S. advisers support local troops battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, U.S. military personnel have coached Iraqi commanders as they oversee a push through the city of Mosul, seized by militants more than two years ago. In Syria, a small force of Special Operations troops are working with a Kurdish-led force laying the groundwork for an assault on Raqqa, another Islamic State stronghold. Military officials have been developing options that the incoming administration might support in the campaign against the Islamic State. Those could include the authority to place U.S. troops even closer to the front lines in Iraq, increased forces for Syria and greater authority for military commanders to expand the way U.S. forces are used without going to the White House for approval. A defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said Trump\u2019s meeting with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officials\u00a0lasted roughly an hour. Trump was accompanied by his national security adviser, retired Gen. Mike Flynn, and the meeting covered a broad array of topics, including the role of the national guard and the responsibilities of the combatant commands, the official said. Officials agreed on the need to accelerate progress against the Islamic State, though it was unclear if a timeline or specifics were addressed. While North Korea and other threats were discussed, the official declined to say if Russia was another topic. In a statement issued after Trump\u2019s visit, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that Mattis shared \u201cthe president\u2019s goal of ensuring our military leaders have the support they need to accelerate the campaign against [the Islamic State], and to build combat readiness now and for the future.\u201d John Wagner and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.

Sanders declined to say whether Trump requested additional official photos of the crowd from the agency. \u201cHe\u2019s not somebody who sits around and waits,\u201d Sanders said, adding that the call demonstrates the president's proactive management style and the reason he beat Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . 2009 vs. 2017: Comparing Trump's and Obama's Inauguration Crowds The retweet on Inauguration Day was of two photos shown side-by-side, comparing Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration crowd to Obama's 2009 inauguration crowd. As part of its policy, the National Park Service does not release official crowd estimates for permitted events. The retweet was removed last Friday and the National Park Service issued an apology the following day. Employees were also told last Friday to \"stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety,\u201d according to a statement from an Interior Department official.

    "text": "info <p>This photo provided by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows agents taking a person into custody in New Jersey, March 28, 2012, during operation Cross Check III, a federal arrest sweep of undocumented immigrants who allegedly committed serious crimes or were considered threats to national security.</p> Close AP Photo/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement NEW YORK - President Donald Trump signed an executive order \u00a0Wednesday that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a weekly list of \u201ccriminal actions committed by aliens.\u201d \u201cMany aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety,\u201d the order states. \u201cThis is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 The order also calls for the establishment of an Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens, to, among other things, study \u201cthe effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security did not provide answers to Crimesider \u2019s questions regarding how the federal government would go about collecting this data from the nation\u2019s more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies, but the order nonetheless begs the question, how big a problem is crime committed by immigrants? Florida State University Professor of Criminology Daniel Mears says that \u201cgood data\u201d focused on immigrant criminality - specifically undocumented immigrant criminality - is scarce. Determining definitively whether someone who has been arrested is in the country legally can take significant effort, and the result might not be noted in all law enforcement records. In addition, researchers often have to rely on arrest and conviction numbers, which may be misleading because they can reflect law enforcement priorities more than criminal behavior. A jurisdiction might see a spike one year, for example, if a police chief or prosecutor decides to prioritize enforcement against immigrants.\u00a0 Despite this, Mears and others who study this subject seem to agree that most research indicates immigrants actually commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. According to analysis of the 2010 census and the American Communities Survey done by the non-profit \u00a0 American Immigration Council , immigrants to the United States are significantly less likely than native-born citizens to be incarcerated. The authors found that 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born. Murder in San Francisco sparks immigration debate The divide was even sharper when the authors examined the incarceration rate among immigrant men the authors believe likely to be undocumented \u2014 specifically less-educated men from El Salvador and Guatemala between age 18-29. According to AIC senior researcher Walter Ewing, there are very few ways for men in this demographic to emigrate legally. According to the analysis, these likely undocumented immigrants had an incarceration rate of 1.7 percent, compared with 10.7 percent for native-born men without a high school diploma. One study published in the journal Criminology and Public Policy in 2008 looked at recidivism among inmates at the Los Angeles County Jail in 2002 and the authors wrote that their results \u201clend no support to the ubiquitous assertion that deportable aliens are a unique threat to public safety.\u201d\u00a0 This conclusion is no surprise to Christopher Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University who has studied antisocial behavior like drug use, gambling and fighting in immigrant and non-immigrant populations. \u201cThe evidence is really compelling that immigrants are involved in these behaviors at a far lower rate than native-born Americans,\u201d Salas-Wright says. A paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2007 found that immigrants had incarceration rates about one-fifth that of native-born Americans, and that the difference actually increased between 1980 and 2000. The reasons for this so-called \u201cimmigrant paradox\u201d aren\u2019t fully understood, said Salas-Wright, but \u201cone theory is people who choose to pick up their lives and move to a foreign country and set up a new life tend to be healthier people. And they tend to be interested in making this new life work.\u201d In other words, he said, after undertaking the economic and social sacrifice necessary to emigrate, it doesn\u2019t make sense to imperil that new life by committing crime or engaging in risky behavior. During his campaign, President Trump often spoke about immigrants as criminals, and highlighted violent crimes to make his point, including the 2015 shooting death of Kathryn Steinle , who authorities say was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been deported five times. It was a powerful example, but not exactly representative of the millions of immigrants living in the country today, researchers say. Kathryn Steinle, left, and Francisco Sanchez Close \u201cTo ascribe group guilt to crimes just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says AIC\u2019s Walter Ewing. \u201cIf every time a native-born white man shot up a mall we tried to round up all native-born white men, it wouldn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Steinle was killed in San Francisco, a so-called \u201c sanctuary city ,\u201d which offers certain protections for undocumented immigrants who might otherwise be deported by federal immigration officials. Mayors of some sanctuary cities, including Philadelphia\u2019s Jim Kenney , Boston\u2019s Martin Walsh , New York\u2019s Bill de Blasio, and Chicago\u2019s Rahm Emanuel argue that forcing local law enforcement to act as immigration officers will deter immigrants from reporting crime and negatively impact public safety. U.S. leaders split over Trump's crackdown on \"sanctuary cities\" As part of Trump\u2019s order to compile a weekly list of \u201ccriminal actions committed by aliens,\u201d the president directed that the list include \u201cany jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\u201d While there is no doubt that some immigrants commit crimes, Salas-Wright says that the myth that they are generally criminals is \u201ctoo bad, because it doesn\u2019t match up with what we know.\u201d\u00a0 To this point, FSU\u2019s Mears wonders what Trump\u2019s plan to create a public list of crimes committed by \u201caliens\u201d is supposed to accomplish. \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal here? If the goal is to vilify immigrants or to create the appearance that immigrants disproportionately contribute to crime in America \u2014 which isn\u2019t true \u2014 then that makes sense. But if the goal is to reduce crime, this isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.\u201d Anne Piehl, the director of the Program in Criminal Justice at Rutgers University, agrees, saying that immigration and crime have, since at least the 1920s, gotten \u201cconflated in ways that I don\u2019t think are particularly productive in terms of policy.\u201d She continues: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about immigration issues as a way to solve the crime problem, but if we really want solve the crime problem, immigration is a very small part of it.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The president had signalled he wanted to return to the harsh interrogation techniques used under President George W.

President Donald Trump, left, hands Defense Secretary James Mattis, right, a pen after he signed an executive action on rebuilding the military during an event at the Pentagon in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. (Susan Walsh / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Setting a hard-line tone on national security, President Donald Trump on Friday ordered strict new screening for refugees to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States and alternated tough talk with kind words in his diplomatic standoff with Mexico. Trump traveled to the Pentagon where he joined Defense Secretary James Mattis for the signing of an executive action to bring sweeping changes to the nation's refugee policies and put in motion his plans to build up the nation's military. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" During his election campaign against Hillary Clinton, Trump pledged to put in place \"extreme vetting\" procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. The White House did not immediately release details on the order Trump signed, but a draft of the order called for suspending the issuing of visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 30 days. Donald Trump has repeatedly characterized as incubators of crime are generally safer than other cities, according to a new analysis of FBI crime data. There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, but most observers adopt criteria used by Immigration and... The so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that Donald Trump has repeatedly characterized as incubators of crime are generally safer than other cities, according to a new analysis of FBI crime data. There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, but most observers adopt criteria used by Immigration and... (Christopher Ingraham) Joined earlier in the day at the White House by British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump reaffirmed the United States' \"special relationship\" with Great Britain. But he was also asked about more contentious issues, including his recent statements that torture \"does work\" in prying information out of terror suspects. Giving ground, he said his defense secretary's opposition would override his own belief. Hours later he stood at the Pentagon as Mattis, the retired general, was sworn in as the military's chief. Trump was also pressed on whether he would revert back to Bush-era use of torture, in the news since The Associated Press and other news organizations obtained copies of a draft executive order signaling sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. Trump said he would defer to the views of Mattis, who has questioned the effectiveness of such practices as waterboarding, which simulates drowning. \"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. ... I don't necessarily agree. But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert,\" Trump said. The draft order, which the White House said was not official, also would reverse Obama's effort to close the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba \u2014 a place Trump has said he wants to fill up \"with bad dudes.\" Trump Bryan R.

(Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) The draft also requests recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America's image on the world stage Trump held firm Friday on another controversy \u2014 trade and illegal immigration from Mexico. He told reporters at a joint news conference with May that he had a \"very good call\" with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto earlier in the day, but he reaffirmed his belief that Mexico has \"outnegotiated and beat us to a pulp\" on trade \u2014 and that would change. \"We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing,\" he declared a day after the Mexican leader canceled his visit to Washington in response to Trump's plans to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it. While the refugee actions are aimed at thwarting terrorists, the border wall is more for keeping out immigrants trying to enter the U.S. for economic reasons \u2014 though Trump has continually also raised concerns about criminals flowing north. The flurry of national security moves and foreign policy outreach capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House, giving Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the United States around the globe.

(Louisa Gouliamaki / AFP/Getty Images) Trump, who met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, has the authority to determine how many refugees are accepted annually, and he can suspend the program at any time. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later. During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. Trump, according to the draft of the executive action, plans to cut that to 50,000. The draft order says that while the program is suspended, the U.S. may admit people on a case-by-case basis \"when in the national interest\" and the government will continue to process refugee requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion ... is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" That suggests it would allow the admission of Christians from Muslim-majority countries. In an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status. \"We are going to help them,\" Trump said. \"They've been horribly treated.\" Applauded by some in his own party, Trump's refugee action was strongly criticized by some Democrats.

(Photo: Ron Kosen, AP) 54 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife are dropping controversial suits they filed in December to buy small plots of land that are part of a 700-acre waterfront estate they own on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. In a letter published in The Garden Island , a local newspaper, Zuckerberg wrote of the complex legal tangle, \"it's clear we made a mistake.\" Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan bought the\u00a0700-acre waterfront estate on\u00a0Kauai for $100 million in 2014. In December 2016, they filed eight lawsuits against several hundred people to buy 13 plots on eight acres partitioned during the 1850s. Ownership of some of the plots was unclear, crossing multiple generations and many heirs. According to Zuckerberg's letter, some have had no inhabitants for decades. Others come with complex legal land agreements dating back more than 160 years. The plots are mostly one acre or smaller and all lie within the 700-acre estate. Zuckerberg's legal maneuver, called \"quiet title and partition,\" was meant to clarify ownership rights to the land and force it to be sold to the highest bidder through a public auction, allowing Zuckerberg to purchase it. Some Hawaiians\u00a0had harshly criticized the maneuver after the suits became public. The outcry grew louder after Zuckerberg took to Facebook to explain his intent, with some charging him with contributing to a trend with roots in colonialism. A group\u00a0is planning a protest at the wall of Zuckerberg's estate Saturday. ",

    "text": "Twitter Despite his 22 years in LaGrange, Ga., Louis Dekmar had not heard of Austin Callaway \u2014 but some members of his community knew Callaway's story well. Callaway, a 16-year-old African-American in police custody, was abducted at gunpoint by a mob. Hours later, Callaway was discovered with five bullet wounds in his head. He died shortly afterward in the hospital. The police department did not pursue an investigation into the lynching. A grand jury's only comment on it was to recommend better jail cell locks. That was Sept. 8, 1940. On Thursday Chief Dekmar, a white man, stood before a gathering at Warren Temple United Methodist Church, and he apologized. \"As LaGrange police chief, I sincerely regret and denounce the role our police department played in Austin's lynching, both through our action and our inaction,\" Dekmar told the assembly. \"For that, I'm profoundly sorry. It should never have happened.\" Dekmar was joined during that remembrance by Mayor Jim Thornton and other authorities in the town. The full remembrance was live-streamed on Facebook by LGTV LaGrange Television for viewers outside the bounds of the church, and can be watched in the video above. Dekmar's speech begins at about the 25-minute mark. It was a moment long in coming \u2014 nearly three-quarters of a century, in fact. Article continues after sponsorship For Dekmar, the path to this apology began several years ago, when he learned of a comment one elderly black woman made to another while waiting to see detectives: \"They killed our people,\" the woman said. It was only after some research that Dekmar learned of Callaway's story. And it was only with the help of the NAACP, local politicians and LaGrange College that a formal remembrance of Callaway could finally come together. He tells NPR that the comment shared between the two women hammered home a crucial point for him. \"Despite the fact that very few people are alive today that were alive then, the attitudes about the police department \u2014 and the attitudes as it relates to the city government in general \u2014 is influenced by those experiences which are passed down through generations,\" Dekmar says. And those memories, and the distrust of law enforcement that they engender, create a filter between the police department and the community. He says that's why moments like Thursday's ceremony, however tardy they are in coming, remain necessary. This is particularly true given the racial makeup of the community in LaGrange, which is about 48 percent African-American . Dekmar says law enforcement in the area is about 14 percent black, though he says his department has worked hard to improve diversity within its ranks. Resentment toward police persists among members of the local black community, he says \u2014 \"and rightfully so,\" given the memories of lynchings like Callaway's. \"Apology is never enough,\" Kristen Reed, who attended the remembrance, told reporter Sam Whitehead of Georgia Public Broadcasting. \"I don't think an apology is ever enough for a murder or for a lynching and for the injustice that followed.\" Still, after the ceremony, Reed noted the rarity of such a moment. \"For them to feel the need to say they were sorry sends a message, especially in a climate like this,\" Reed said. And for Dekmar, it's that small step that matters. \"We don't expect ever to erase the past,\" he says. \"But what I hope last night will do is interrupt the past.\" ",

    "text": "Got it President Trump departs the White House en route to Marine One on Thursday. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) By Ashley Parker and Sean Sullivan By Ashley Parker and Sean Sullivan January 27 at 4:26 PM Follow @ashleyrparker Follow @WaPoSean No one can accuse Donald Trump of campaigning in poetry. But after just one week in the White House, the new president is bumping up against the hard reality of governing in prose. Many of the sweeping actions President Trump vowed this week through his executive orders and proclamations are unlikely to happen, either because they are impractical, opposed by Congress and members of his Cabinet, or full of legal holes. The reality \u2014 that yawning gap between what Trump says he will do and what he actually can do \u2014 underscores his chaotic start, which includes executive actions drafted by close aides rather than experts and without input from the agencies tasked with implementing them. On a host of issues, from health care to trade to immigration, Trump began his presidency with executive orders intended to both placate and excite his base by keeping his bold campaign promises \u2014 in rhetoric, if not immediate, tangible results. And the White House says Trump\u2019s executive actions should be viewed as initial moves to enact his agenda. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) \u201cWe\u2019re taking the first steps to get it done, with the understanding that some of these things may be a process, but you have to begin the process and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing\u00a0\u2014 taking bold action and doing everything he can to make sure these things happen,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\u00a0\u201cI have no doubt these things are going to happen.\u201d [ In his first major TV interview as president, Trump is endlessly obsessed with his popularity ] But the reality is far more complicated.\u00a0On immigration, for instance, Trump\u2019s call for a border wall paid for by Mexico first has to be funded by Congress. And the possibility that Mexico would pay for the wall\u00a0\u2014 always a long shot\u00a0\u2014 grew even more remote this week after Mexico\u2019s president on Thursday canceled his planned visit to Washington to meet with Trump, citing disagreement over the wall.\u00a0The White House said that one possible option would be to pay for the project with a border tax on Mexican imports. On trade, Trump can withdraw from and renegotiate trade agreements, as he promised during the campaign. But there is no guarantee that he will have willing partners with whom to renegotiate better trade deals, and certainly not necessarily with better terms. And change will hardly be instantaneous: Under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, the president or any other leaders must give six months\u2019 notice of his or her intention to withdraw. Trump has also promised to order an investigation into his false claims that 3\u00a0million to 5\u00a0million people voted illegally in November for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who beat Trump by nearly 3\u00a0million votes. But there is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim, and although he has the authority to launch a fact-gathering investigation, it is unlikely to unearth the extensive election fraud he is asserting.\u00a0 One national security executive order he is considering would allow the Central Intelligence Agency to reopen \u201cblack site\u201d prisons abroad , as well as reconsider the agency\u2019s now-shuttered enhanced interrogation program. But it does not have buy-in from Defense Secretary James Mattis or CIA Director Mike Pompeo, both of whom privately told lawmakers they were not consulted. Many lawmakers in both parties have also expressed strong opposition to the directive.\u00a0 5 challenges Trump may face building a border wall View Graphic 5 challenges Trump may face building a border wall The ad hoc nature of Trump\u2019s executive orders \u2014 including some finalized at the last minute or prompted by an off-the-cuff conversation Trump had with a friend or business executive \u2014 has further undermined their impact.\u00a0 Trump, for example, said that only after a discussion with industry leaders this week did he\u00a0realize that the nation\u2019s pipelines are not necessarily made with U.S.\u00a0steel. The epiphany scrambled aides to draft an executive order requiring that they be constructed with solely\u00a0American-made materials. But specifying U.S.-made steel is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement , except in cases of national security \u2014 which this is not. \u201cIt would certainly be subject to challenge at the WTO,\u201d said Rob Shapiro, a Commerce Department official under President Bill Clinton. Although it could take five years to adjudicate at the WTO, he said, there is also \u201cthe possibility of retaliation by\u00a0whoever does produce them. The truth is that\u00a0\u2018America first\u2019 is contrary to global trade.\u201d Trump, however, does not seem to realize the limited power of his executive orders and has made public signing ceremonies a trademark of his first week.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump needs to go back to civics class because he can direct his employees to do various things, but he cannot repeal a bunch of laws through his executive orders because he needs congressional consent \u2014 and the executive orders themselves say that,\u201d said Rena Steinzor, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s law school. Steinzor, who is also a member of the Center for Progressive Reform, added that the language in many of Trump\u2019s executive orders explicitly acknowledges that they can only be done in accordance with the law.\u00a0\u201cHe can\u2019t just sit there and show people pieces of paper with his overly emphatic signature and say,\u00a0\u2018I have changed the world,\u2019 because that\u2019s not how we do it,\u201d she said. Some of Trump\u2019s actions have caught fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill off guard. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the new action or what\u2019s being proposed,\u201d said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), as he was peppered this week with questions about Trump\u2019s draft order revisiting interrogation practices. And although there is broad consensus among Republicans about the need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act\u00a0\u2014 a process Trump began with an executive order the day he was sworn in \u00a0\u2014 there is far less harmony on exactly when and how to handle the issue. Trade, infrastructure and tax restructuring have also exposed rifts in the party.\u00a0 \u201cPunitive tariffs are not helpful,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a centrist lawmaker. \u201cTrade wars do not end well.\u201d In many ways, Trump is simply experiencing the stark difference between campaigning and governing, a riddle that has bedeviled nearly every incoming president, including Barack Obama. Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, said that although\u00a0\u201cit would be a serious mistake to underestimate the patience Trump supporters have for him and his agenda,\u201d he wondered if Trump himself may grow frustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s going to find that running a business is a lot simpler than running the government,\u201d Newhouse said.\u00a0 [ Tracking Trump\u2019s promises ] David Axelrod, a former senior Obama adviser, pointed to Obama\u2019s executive order his first week in office to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, noting that he faced stiff congressional opposition and never completed his pledge. But Trump, he said, could face an even more difficult challenge, in part because he presented himself \u2014 rather than his policies \u2014 as the linchpin. \u201cThe appeal he had as a candidate is that people clearly want someone to snap their fingers and just make something happen, and he saw that desire and played to that desire,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cNow comes the reality, and he\u2019s going to be snapping in the dark.\u201d Axelrod added, \u201cHe campaigned as an autocrat and now he\u2019s the president, and the president isn\u2019t an autocrat \u2014 and he\u2019s going to find that some of the things he wants to do are difficult.\u201d Many Republicans, however, say that Trump\u2019s supporters may give him a generous amount of time and latitude before demanding concrete results. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said a goal such as building a wall along theborder with Mexico is largely symbolic. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of greater security and greater control,\u201d Ayres said.\u00a0\u201cIf he gets part of a wall built and Congress has to pay for it, the response from his supporters will be,\u00a0\u2018Well, we didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it, but at least we got the wall.\u2019 \u201d And Judd Gregg, a former Republican governor and senator from New Hampshire, said that for Trump supporters, concrete changes may be beside the point, at least initially. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in the verbal jockeying and the confrontational verbal approach than the results,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo as long as he\u2019s poking a stick in the eye of the people his constituency feels are a problem, the rest won\u2019t matter.\u201d Steven Mufson contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

President Trump shows his signature on executive orders alongside Defense Secretary James Mattis and Vice President Pence on Jan. 27, 2016, at the Pentagon. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Trump\u00a0charged his new Defense secretary with rebuilding the military and announced an executive order to clamp down on refugee admissions in the United States during a visit Friday to the Pentagon. The presidential national security memorandum \u2014 a never-before-seen form of presidential directive \u2014 calls for a 30-day review of military readiness. It requires the the Pentagon and Office of Management and Budget to come up with a plan to bolster the military, and calls for an examination of the nation's nuclear arsenal and missile-defense capabilities. Trump signed the memorandum after a\u00a0swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Jim\u00a0Mattis. Trump called the former Marine general \"a man of action\" in whom he has \"total confidence.\" \"Our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will our\u00a0dedication to peace,\" Trump said. In a signing ceremony in the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes, the president also signed a separate executive order that he said would \"keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\" In signing the two orders together, Trump drew a connection between migration and national security. \"We want to make sure we don\u2019t want to admit into our country the very terrorists that our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. Trump's directive did not specifically mention the Islamic State, but Trump also received a briefing by military brass on plans to expand the pace and scope of the bombing campaign against targets in Iraq and Syria. That could be accomplished by providing more aerial spy planes and other assets from the military and intelligence communities, said Scott Murray, a retired Air Force colonel who helped direct the effort to target ISIL fighters and their infrastructure. Commanders could also re-examine limits on the number of civilian casualties that the military risks when it hits\u00a0targets of the Islamic State, also referred to as ISIL or ISIS,\u00a0Murray said. Known as the \u201cnon-combatant value,\u201d the rule restricts the number of civilians who can be put at risk in an airstrike. Last year, the military delegated the authority for those attacks from higher headquarters to top officers in the field. The result was more airstrikes. Special operations forces could be deployed to provide on-the-ground guidance for bombs in real-time, Murray said. Basing A-10 ground-attack jets in Turkey would allow them to loiter over targets for longer periods, he said. Read more: New rules allow more civilian casualties in air war against ISIL After Trump's visit, Mattis expressed gratitude for Trump's support and said he \"shares the president's goal of ensuring our military leaders have the support they need to accelerate the campaign against ISIS, and to build combat readiness now and for the future,\" said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, in a statement. Last week in his inaugural address, Trump decried the state of U.S. military forces and has called to bolster them. The United States\u00a0has \u201csubsidized the armies of other countries while allowing the sad depletion of our military,\u201d Trump said. Friday's memo called on the Pentagon to develop a plan aimed at addressing the military's readiness to fight, including manpower shortages, insufficient maintenance and funding needed for fuel and ammunition. During the campaign, Trump called for a significant buildup of the Navy. He called for the fleet increase its strength from 274 ships to 350, a 27% boost. The Army has already begun to increase its ranks. Legislation approved last year would reverse the reduction\u00a0of soldiers planned by President Barack Obama, boosting the size of the Army by 16,000 to 476,000 soldiers. ] Read more: Posted!

Donald Trump speaks about immigration and refugees during a campaign event in Sunrise, Fla., on Aug. 10, 2016. (Cristobal Herrera / European Pressphoto Agency) Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman Contact Reporters President Trump signed an executive order Friday that would temporarily halt the nation\u2019s refugee program and usher in the most sweeping changes in more than 40 years to how the U.S. welcomes the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. The order would block all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and suspend the acceptance of refugees from war-torn Syria indefinitely. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not letting into our country the very threats that our soldiers are fighting overseas,\u201d Trump said after swearing in new Defense Secretary James N. Mattis at the Pentagon. Trump would also block visa applicants entirely from a list of countries that the administration considers of major terrorism concern, including Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, until a new \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedure for visa applicants can be launched. Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States Open link The action capped Trump\u2019s frenetic first week in the White House, as well as a busy day that included his first meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May. Trump also spoke by phone for about an hour with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, attempting to soothe what has already become a tense relationship. And he swore in Mattis and signed a second directive that instructs the Pentagon to draw up a list of plans to upgrade equipment and improve training. The U.S. has admitted more than 3.3 million refugees since 1975, including more than 80,000 refugees in the last year. Under Trump\u2019s plan, those numbers would plummet to a trickle for the next several months. For the full fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the order sets a cap of 50,000 refugees. The order provides an exception for \u201creligious minorities,\u201d a category that could include Christians fleeing largely Muslim countries as well as other groups including Yazidis and Bahais that face persecution in the Mideast. Trump said in an interview Friday with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the order would help Christians fleeing Syria enter the United States. The order also expands the ability of local jurisdictions to block the settlement of refugees they object to. During the Obama administration, the federal government stopped efforts by some local officials to block refugee resettlements. Trump\u2019s action, seen as part of his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, sparked an international outcry, given the historic role that the U.S. and other industrialized nations have long played in embracing victims of war and oppression. The last major change in U.S. refugee policy came during the Vietnamese resettlement programs of the mid-1970s. In recent months, Trump has backed away from a blanket ban on Muslims and instead said he would focus on blocking people from countries linked to terrorism. Democrats, however, say the new order is just a more cleverly worded way of achieving the same goal. And the Council on American-Islamic Relations immediately announced that it would sue. \u201cMake no mistake \u2014 this is a Muslim ban,\u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris of California. \u201cBroad-brush discrimination against refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, most of whom are women and children, runs counter to our national security interests, and will likely be used as a terrorist recruitment tool.\u201d But Trump won backing from some key congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who leads the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cWe are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants,\u201d McCaulsaid. \u201cBut as we know, terrorists are dead-set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan horse to attack us.\u201d The new vetting procedures would block admission of individuals who engage in \u201cacts of bigotry or hatred\u201d or \u201cwould oppress members of one race, one gender or sexual orientation.\u201d Trump called the vetting procedures \u201ctotally extreme\u201d during an interview with Fox News on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have extreme vetting for people coming into our country, and if we think there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s not going to be so easy for people to come in anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the president of a safe country,\u201d Trump told ABC News on Wednesday when asked about the policy. \u201cWe have enough problems.\u201d In the ABC interview, Trump said Germany and other European countries had made a \u201ctremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people.\u201d He said residents of countries left out of the ban \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia \u2014 would nonetheless face what he calls \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d and dismissed concerns that his actions will inflame tensions in the Muslim world. \u201cThe world is as angry as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat, you think this is going to cause a little more anger?\u201d Critics called Trump\u2019s order a betrayal of long-held American ideals. \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said in a statement. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , whose family fled the communist takeover of then-Czechoslovakia when she was a child, said she had benefited personally from the American \u201ctradition of openness.\u201d \u201cThis order would end that tradition and discriminate against those fleeing a brutal civil war in Syria. It does not represent who we are as a country,\u201d she said. Traditionally, the U.S. has accepted refugees based on their \u201cvulnerability\u201d and their ties to friends and family in the U.S., said Michelle Bran\u00e9, a director at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission. \u201cReligion and nationality are factors to consider in evaluating the refugee claim, but the program should not exclude a refugee on one of those grounds alone,\u201d she said. Several of those who condemned Trump\u2019s order noted that it was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day , a reminder that thousands of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany were denied safe harbors in the United States and elsewhere, forcing them back to Nazi-controlled territory, where many were murdered. \u201cDonald Trump is retracting the promise of American freedom to an extent we have not seen from a president since Franklin Roosevelt forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York City.

Brown, AFP/Getty Images) 30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump ended his first week in office Friday by ordering the State Department to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures for immigrants from countries with ties to terrorism. After speaking at the Pentagon, Trump signed an executive order to implement the new vetting measures to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States.\u00a0Doing so, he said, is one\u00a0way to honor the sacrifices made by Americans who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001,\u00a0and those fighting terrorism around the world. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" Trump's expected ban on refugees, who could be affected? Media outlets, including the New York Times and Reuters, have reported this week that Trump's order would suspend the U.S. refugee program and temporarily halt all legal immigration from Syria and six other countries with close ties to terrorism.\u00a0The White House did not immediately release the order Trump signed on Friday, but critics and supporters responded quickly. Trump drew widespread condemnation from Democrats, immigrant and civil rights groups\u00a0around the world. The American Civil Liberties Union described Trump's \"extreme vetting\" as \"just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims.\" And\u00a0David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said the order was completely unnecessary since the U.S. already has the \"strongest, most successful\" resettlement program in the world. \"In truth, refugees are fleeing terror \u2014 they are not terrorists,\" Miliband said. \"And at a time when there are more refugees than ever, America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" This is what it looks like for refugees rescued from Mediterranean Sea Congressional Republicans said they would work with Trump to implement the new vetting procedures. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, described the U.S. refugee program\u00a0as a \"Trojan Horse\" for would-be terrorists that had been ignored by President Obama. \"President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States,\" McCaul said. \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\" President Obama had increased the refugee resettlement program during his time in office, increasing the cap from 60,000 to 70,000 to 85,000 in 2016. He reserved 10,000 of those spots for refugees from Syria. While Trump has claimed that most Syrian refugees coming to the U.S are single, military-age men, the\u00a0State Department said those numbers didn't add up. As of Nov. 2015, 77% of Syrian refugees who entered the U.S. were women and children. Only 23% were adult men, and only 2% were \"single men unattached to families.\" 30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jGhjoD NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The money that the United States voluntarily contributes to the United Nations is a little over 0.1 percent of the total federal budget . Some Republican lawmakers have sought in the past to make some of the assessed dues also voluntary, but that idea has never passed muster with Congress.One area that is likely to draw scrutiny from the Trump administration, judging from what Ms. Haley said during her confirmation hearing , is peacekeeping. The United States pays the largest share of the peacekeeping budget \u2014 about 28 percent \u2014 but provides virtually no soldiers.The threats to cut funding come as China has stepped up its role at the United Nations, increasing its support for peacekeeping and development aid. China also has a veto in the Security Council.\u201cThis is a time of strength, this is a time of action, this is a time of getting things done,\u201d Ms. Haley said on Friday, adding that she was prepared to re-evaluate the United Nations\u2019 efforts. \u201cEverything that\u2019s working we\u2019re going to make it better. Everything that\u2019s not working we\u2019re going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we\u2019re going to do away with,\u201d she said. Her tone was in contrast to a far more conciliatory approach just days ago, when she faced a Senate confirmation hearing. There, she said she did not favor a \u201cslash and burn\u201d approach to American contributions to the United Nations, but she questioned its value to American national interests. \u201cAre we getting what we pay for?\u201d she asked. Ms. Haley, 45, a former Republican governor of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics during the campaign, had tried to distance herself from some of what Mr. Trump has said about international diplomacy. She has said she favors continuing sanctions against Russia, for instance, but also cooperation with the Kremlin on counterterrorism. She has said she is concerned about security threats posed by refugees, and while she said climate change was \u201con the table,\u201d she said she did not favor policies that imperiled business. Correction: January 27, 2017 An earlier version of this article misstated the portion of the federal budget that the United States contributes to the United Nations. Its contributions represent a little more than 0.1 percent, not 1 percent. ",

During an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, the president said today that Christians in Syria have been treated unfairly in the refugee process. \"They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them,\" Trump said in a clip of the interview that was released this afternoon. Trump Speaks to Mexican President by Phone 1 Day After Canceling Meeting In the remarks released by CBN in advance of the full interview airing on Sunday, Trump did not give any examples or cite evidence to support his claim that it is more difficult for Syrian Christians to gain refugee status than Syrian Muslims . According to the CIA World Factbook , as of June 2014, 87 percent of Syrians were Muslim while 10 percent were Christian. And likewise, there were more Muslim refugees from Syria who came to the United States last year than Christian refugees. The Refugee Processing Center reports that in 2016, there were 15,302 Muslims who arrived in the U.S. from Syria and there were 93 people, also from Syria, who identified as either Catholic, Christian, Protestant or Jehovah's Witness. \"The Middle East is a region of extraordinary ethnic and religious diversity,\" said Chris Boian, the senior communications officer of the U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR. \"UNHCR believes that any human being that has been forced to flee his or her homeland to escape life-threatening conflict and persecution should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\" he told ABC News. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH Vice President Mike Pence Addresses March for Life 0 Shares Email For the first time at the annual anti-abortion March for Life rally, a vice president addressed the crowds gathered in Washington, D.C. Vice President Mike Pence, a Catholic and longtime supporter of the anti-abortion movement who enacted some of the strictest abortion laws in the country as governor of Indiana, told cheering supporters gathered on the National Mall \u201clife is winning again in America.\u201d \"Along with you, we will not grow weary, we will not rest until we restore a culture of life in America for ourselves and our posterity,\" said Pence. The march, which began in front of the Washington Monument, ends at the steps of the United States Supreme Court. Pence said at the pre-march event that next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee in the anti-abortion jurisprudence of the late Antonin Scalia who \u201cwill uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.\u201d Out on the campaign trail, Trump frequently said that he would nominate \u201cpro-life\u201d judges to the Supreme Court. And while Trump was not able to attend the rally, he expressed his support on Twitter. \u201cThe #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support!\u201d Trump tweeted. The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017 Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway joined Pence in representing the Trump administration. \u201cSteps away from here in the White House a president and vice president sit at their desks and make decisions for a nation. as they sit there, they stand here with you,\u201d said Conway. \u201cThis is a time of incredible promise for pro-life, pro-adoption movement. Our action must reach those women who face unplanned pregnancies, they should know they are not alone. They\u2019re not judged. They\u2019re protected and cared for and celebrated. So to the March for Life 2017 allow me to make it very clear -- we hear you, we see you, we respect you, and we look forward to working with you.\u201d The March for Life draws advocates against abortion rights from around the country to Washington, D.C. It is held each year around the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, made on Jan. 22, 1973. Many in the movement against abortion rights have spoken highly of the Trump administration. Tom McCluksy, vice president of government affairs at the March for Life, expressed optimism for the advancement of an anti-abortion agenda in the first 100 days. \u201cTrump has made pro-life promises and has assembled a team of personnel with incredible pro-life convictions, and qualifications, starting with ... Pence,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. This year\u2019s march centers on the theme \u201cThe Power of One.\u201d Beyond Pence and Conway, speakers included Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and conservative author Eric Metaxas. \u201cIt is our hope that this year\u2019s March for Life will encourage each of us to seek and fulfill our unique mission to the best of our ability because only in doing so we will collectively build a culture of life in the U.S. -- a culture where abortion is unthinkable,\u201d March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

Holocaust survivor Josiane Traum lights a memorial candle during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day Commemoration at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on Jan. 27, 2017 in Washington. (Win McNamee / Getty Images) Abby PhillipThe Washington Post A statement from President Donald Trump marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day omitted any mention of Jews or anti-Semitism, a departure from recent bipartisan precedent set by previous presidents. The statement calls for remembrance of \"victims, survivors, heroes,\" but nowhere does it mention the millions of Jewish people killed during the Holocaust, nor does it mention the ideology of anti-Semitism that led to the killings. Here's the statement from Trump in full: \"It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror. \"Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent. \"In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world.\" In a series of tweets, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, noted the omissions. \"@WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay, misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just 'innocent people,' \" Greenblatt tweeted. \"Puzzling and troubling @WhiteHouse #HolocaustMemorialDay stmt has no mention of Jews. GOP and Dem. presidents have done so in the past.\" Steven Goldstein, executive Director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, was also critical of the White House statement. \"President Trump's statement today for International Holocaust Remembrance Day makes NO MENTION of Jews,\" he said in a statement. \"How can you forget, Mr. President, that six million Jews were murdered because they were Jews? You chose the vague phrase 'innocent people.' They were Jews, Mr. President.\" The international day of remembrance has fallen on the day the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated since 2006. Former president Barack Obama's statements on the day noted the \"6 million Jews and millions of other people\" who were killed by Nazis. In 2005, when President George W. Bush marked the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, he declared it \"a reminder that when we find anti-Semitism, we must come together to fight it.\" In 2007, Bush's statement marking the day noted: \"We must continue to condemn the resurgence of anti-Semitism, that same virulent intolerance that led to the Holocaust, and we must combat bigotry and hatred in all their forms, in America and abroad.\" The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Fred Brown, a spokesman for the Republican Jewish Coalition, blamed the controversy on political partisans. \"It's outrageous that people are using Holocaust Remembrance Day for partisan reasons or to try and settle scores,\" Brown said in a statement. \"The horrors of the Holocaust are not to be taken lightly. We must never forget the millions of Jews who suffered at the hands of hate, and the heroes who died fighting it.\" ",

    "text": "By Natalie Kitroeff Jan. 27, 2017 Part-time casual longshoremen outside the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Casual Longshore Dispatch Hall in Wilmington, where some lucky workers will nab a shift. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) If Cynthia Byington wins her version of the lottery, she will probably have to wait a decade to claim her prize. But Byington doesn\u2019t mind, because the reward is a shot at one of the rarest lifelines left for working-class Americans: a unionized blue-collar job.\u00a0 In February, for the first time in over a decade, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union will raffle off thousands of part-time gigs working at Los Angeles-area ports. The slots don\u2019t come with benefits or steady hours. But eventually, after putting in years at the docks, some of those part-timers may earn the chance to become unionized longshoremen, who can make as much as $200,000 per year.\u00a0 \u201cYou get full benefits your entire life. Even if it\u2019s not \u2018til I turn 90, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Byington, 53, said. You get full benefits your entire life. Even if it\u2019s not \u2018til I turn 90, it\u2019s worth it. \u2014 Cynthia Byington 92430124 Casual longshoremen who showed up for shifts earned less than $31,000 on average in 2016. Full-time union members get paid $161,000 on average. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) The 2,400 names drawn in the raffle will become \u201ccasual\u201d longshoremen.\u00a0\u00a0 Although they perform the same work as union members \u2014\u00a0loading\u00a0thousands of containers on and off massive cargo ships to keep\u00a0the ports running on time \u2014\u00a0they work far fewer hours. And the wait to receive full union benefits can stretch over a decade. The average casual\u00a0worker\u00a0who showed up for weekly shifts earned nearly $31,000\u00a0in 2016,\u00a0according to data from\u00a0the\u00a0Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents the shipping companies and terminal operators that employ the dockworkers.\u00a0Full-time union members get paid $161,000 on average, but those with seniority can earn tens of thousands more. A worker shows a ticket with her assignment for the day. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) A part-time worker waits near the gate at the dispatch hall. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Today, there are part-timers who have been waiting 13 years to get into the union. But the PMA said that for now, there are no firm plans\u00a0to elevate any of them. Hundreds of thousands are expected to have applied for the new casual slots, the PMA said. Scores of Southern Californians rushed to post offices and postal stores\u00a0across the South Bay in January, buying up the 4x6-inch blank cards required to enter the raffle. At the Postal Annex, a tiny storefront about five miles from the ports in San Pedro, owner Patrick Meehan could barely take a breath without getting a phone call about the lottery. He said hundreds of people streamed into his store in the three days before the deadline hit in late January. The massive interest in the longshoremen\u2019s lottery is a sign of just how desperate Americans are to gain even the most tenuous ground toward a stable, high-paying career working with their hands. \u201cIt says a lot about the state of our current labor market,\u201d said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the UC Berkeley Labor Center. \u201cThere are a dwindling number of blue-collar union jobs where people with\u00a0just a high school education can make a good living.\u201d\u00a0 Fewer than 14% of workers in manufacturing, construction and trucking belonged to a union in 2015, down from nearly 40% in 1973, according to a database of Census data compiled by economists from Trinity University and Georgia State University. That\u2019s what propelled Byington to put her name in the running. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d said Byington, who lives in a mobile home in Wilmington. She has seen longshoremen and women buy houses and put their kids through college on their union-won paychecks. Another friend recently got a full set of teeth implants, thanks to union-provided dental care.\u00a0 Workers line up on the street to find out if they'll get a shift at the ports. This ritual is repeated every morning for casual longshoremen and women. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) \u201cIf you say someone is a longshoreman, it means respect, even if they are a little spoiled,\u201d Byington said. Earning that title, and the respect that comes with it, takes longer than ever.\u00a0 In the 1990s, longshoremen would spend three to five years freelancing before they got elevated onto the rolls of the ILWU, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former casual workers. But then the recession hit, trade faltered, and the PMA temporarily stopped hiring union members. The ports are using more automated machines , which is part of the reason the union workforce hasn\u2019t grown much. In 2016, the Port of Los Angeles processed 17% more container traffic\u00a0than in 2005, but the number of full-time union longshoremen had increased by only 3.5% over that period. Longshoremen also say employers have been relying more and more on part-timers. \u201cThe PMA, terminal employers and ILWU work together to maintain a balanced approach on the number of registered workers needed at the ports,\u201d said Wade Gates,\u00a0a spokesman for the PMA. Craig Merrilees, a spokesman for the union, said the union has traditionally pushed to get more full-time positions, but the dockworkers\u2019 bosses are reluctant. The last time the PMA\u00a0added full-time union members to the payroll was in 2012. \u201cGenerally speaking, the employers would like to see more casual workers earning a little less pay,\u201d Merrilees said. Mario Huerta says he has been working part time for 10 years at the docks, desperately trying to amass enough experience to become a union longshoreman. Huerta and other casuals show up\u00a0around 6 a.m. at a dingy dispatch hall and wait to hear if their number gets called for one of three shifts at the port. If they don\u2019t get called up in the morning, they can return around 4 in the afternoon for the next round of work opportunities. On good weeks, a part-timer will manage to nab two to three eight-hour shifts, casuals said. Part-timers gather near the dispatch hall early in the morning. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) After driving 60 miles to Wilmington from his home in Riverside on a recent Friday, Huerta was assigned a shift that would likely involve securing containers to a ship deck. \u201cSometimes I get work two or three days a week. Sometimes it's only one day a week,\u201d Huerta said, standing in the rain just outside the building where casuals go to get dispatched. He has no idea when the unsteady work will turn into something long-term. \u201cHow close am I to being elevated?\u00a0Nobody seems to know,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least today I have work.\u201d Several others who failed to get work that day said they felt as if they\u2019re being kept out of the union for as long as possible so that the shipping companies can avoid hiring more highly paid, full-time longshoremen. Sometimes I get work two or three days a week. Sometimes it's only one day a week \u2014 Mario Huerta The casuals all cobble together odd jobs on days they can\u2019t find work at the docks, including gigs in construction, landscaping and as security guards. Chris Grove, 39, has spent 13 years reporting for duty at the casual hall and says the instability of the work \u201ctore up\u201d his marriage. Grove, who comes from a long line of longshoremen, including his mother, says the work at the ports was steady and continuous until the recession of 2008-2009.\u00a0 \u201cI was able to put groceries on the table and keep the wife happy,\u201d he says. After the financial crisis, though, his name barely ever came up for shifts. So he got a second job, installing security systems, and then another, installing satellite dishes\u00a0for DirecTV. \u00a0He put his name on a list to join an elevator construction union\u00a0and became a bouncer and then a security guard at a cannabis collective. He even got paid to register voters.\u00a0 The work was unpredictable, he says, and his paycheck was so much thinner than it once was. Grove still shows up for work at the casual hall some weekends, but now he\u2019s more focused on his day job: In 2014, after waiting for eight years,\u00a0he was admitted into the International Union of Elevator Constructors and makes good money with a full slate of benefits.\u00a0 Times staff writer Ronald D.\u00a0White contributed to this report.

The video appears to show Bratten being hit several more times as she gets up and leaves the room with the aid of a walker, the paper reported. Her son noticed bruises on her body and installed a camera, the paper reported.

Credit Henry Romero/Reuters MEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid the diplomatic showdown over President Trump\u2019s order to build a border wall \u2014 and who should pay for it \u2014 Mr. Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico spoke by phone on Friday, both leaders said. The two spoke for about an hour, and both presidents made an effort to say that the call had been productive, suggesting that tensions had cooled, at least publicly. But they stood their ground on their positions, with no suggestion that the call had resolved their disagreement over fundamental issues. \u201cWith respect to the payment for the border wall, both presidents recognized their clear and very public difference between their stances on this very sensitive issue,\u201d the Mexican president\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe presidents also agreed for now to not speak publicly about this controversial issue.\u201d The standoff with Mexico\u2019s president has been the first full-blown foreign policy clash with a foreign leader for the Trump administration. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After Mr. Trump ordered the border wall to be built , months of tensions between the two men came to a boil this week. On Thursday, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has long urged diplomacy in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexico, canceled a meeting with the new American leader. Mr. Trump quickly fired back, saying that Mexico saddles the United States with criminals, illegal immigrants and unfair trade. On Friday, he repeated the same themes. \u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a news conference in Washington. \u201cThe border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re no longer going to be the country that doesn\u2019t know what it is doing.\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cI have great respect for the Mexico. I love the Mexican people.\u201d But \u201cas you know,\u201d he added, Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders.\u201d Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President Trump on Friday continued his crackdown on illegal immigration, signing sweeping new orders that tighten the country\u2019s refugee and visa policies \u2013suspending almost all refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely barring entry for some Syrians. Trump signed the executive action at the Pentagon, where he met with the joint chiefs of staff and participated in the swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary James Mattis. \"We don\u2019t want them here.\" - President Trump Trump said the new measure was intended \u201cto keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Trump said. The executive order also suspends visa entry into the U.S. from seven countries that have predominately Muslim populations. They include: Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen. The order also creates an \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process for any and all immigrants and visitors to the U.S. \u00a0 House Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News, \u201cIt\u2019s a safer day for America.\u201d American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero blasted Trump's plan as unconstitutional. \u201c\u2018Extreme vetting\u2019 is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" Romero said in a statement issued moments after the signing. \"Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions.\" Trump defended the executive order during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \"Right now, the FBI has over 1,000 [terrorism] investigations going on \u2026 and these are people that we let in,\" Trump said from the White House Thursday. \"We don\u2019t need this. Some people have come in with evil intentions. Most haven\u2019t, I guess, but we can\u2019t take chances.\" Trump added that the U.S. has taken in tens of thousands of people. \u201cWe know nothing about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say they vetted them. They didn\u2019t vet them, they have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don\u2019t know anything about them and they have no papers?\u201d Civil rights and refugee advocates around the world have sounded the alarm over Trump\u2019s executive order after a draft copy was leaked late Wednesday. \u201cThese actions taken by Donald Trump are tantamount to a Muslim ban,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, the legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u201cThis is the Muslim ban that was promised by him on the campaign trail.\u201d As president, Trump has the authority to set how many refugees are allowed in annually. He can also choose to suspend the program altogether. Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush suspended refugee processing. It was later restarted. In the last budget year, the U.S. has accepted 84,995 refugees of which 12,587 were from Syria. Former President Barack Obama set the refugee limit for the current budget year at 110,000. Sources close to Trump tell Fox News he has plans to cut that by more than half to 50,000. In an interview with CBN, Trump said persecuted Christians from Syria would get priority. \u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Advertisement ",

Everything that is not working, we are going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary, we are going to do away with,\" Haley pledged.

Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, said in a statement to The Garden Island newspaper Friday that they\u2019re ending the cases \u201cto find a better path forward.\u201d They say they \u201cwill work together with the community on a new approach.\u201d The 14 parcels mostly belong to Native Hawaiian families awarded the land during the mid-19th century, when private property was established in Hawaii.\u00a0 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing backlash for building a wall on his Hawaii property. Residents in the area say it is \"immense\" and blocks ... Many original owners died without wills. Ownership today is split among hundreds of descendants, many of whom are unaware of their shares.\u00a0 In 2014, Zuckerberg spent $100 million to buy 700 acres of beachfront land on Kauai\u2019s North Shore. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The couple filed court cases last month to identify the parcel owners and ask the court to auction the land. The suits filed by Zuckerberg were aimed \u201cat forcing these families to sell their land at a public court auction to the highest bidder,\u201d according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \u00a0\u00a0 The move to get the land through a unique Hawaii law angered locals and prompted a state lawmaker to propose a bill that would force Zuckerberg into mediation before buying real estate on Kauai.\u00a0 State Rep. Kaniela Ing said that, in the past, sugar barons in Hawaii employed the same laws Zuckerberg is using to take land from Native Hawaiians, accusing the technology entrepreneur of \u201ccompleting the theft.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
