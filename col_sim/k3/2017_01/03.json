The two real estate titans have already collaborated on the Trump International Golf Club, where luxury villas have racked up almost $2 billion in sales. Amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest, Trump has promised he won't be making any new business deals while in office. But Sajwani said his ties to the Trumps extend beyond the president-elect \u2014 to daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr. \"All his three children are very much involved, and I think under their leadership we will have no issue in expanding and growing and maintaining our business relation,\" Sajwani said. \"They are very much involved with the details,\" Sajwani said. \"They're very protective of their brand.\" Donald and Ivanka Trump with Dubai developer Hussein Sajwani. Masala.com \"My wife and Ivanka are very good friends,\" he added. \"They send emails. She's been here to my house. We've been in New York having lunch and dinners with them regularly. And, you know, you enjoy working with somebody \u2014 it's not only cold business relation.\" Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. have all represented the brand to wealthy foreigners \u2014 who often have links to powerful politicians \u2014 from Canada and Turkey to South America and Central Asia. Ivanka has posted on social media about business meetings in at least 13 countries since 2010. Sajwani recalled that Ivanka was pregnant when she was working on the project and \"quite involved until almost a few days before delivery.\" He happened to be in New York three days after she gave birth, and he marveled that Ivanka got on the phone to talk business with him and was back in the office a couple of days after that. He said he met then-candidate Trump before the election for the opening of his Washington hotel. Over dinner, he said, it became clear that if Trump won, he would need to hand over the reins of the business to the younger generation. Sajwani was back in the United States after the election and met with Ivanka, who is now exploring a possible move to Washington to be closer to the White House. Play ",

Trump has made eight of 17 Cabinet picks, with four remaining. The primary targets include Rex Tillerson for secretary of state; Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general; South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney for the Office of Management and Budget; Betsy DeVos as the new education secretary and Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive nominated to be treasury secretary. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is attempting to fill his rigged Cabinet with nominees that \u2026 have made billions off the industries they\u2019d been tasked with regulating,\u201d incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. \u201cIf Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d Republicans who control the Senate and House plan to begin the confirmation hearings on Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. Republicans have a 52-to-48 majority over Democrats in the Senate. The nominees will get enough votes in the GOP-run Senate committees but would run into delays when both parties cast final votes on the chamber floor, despite needing only 51 \u201cyeahs.\u201d Democrats could use procedural moves to extend the debate on each of the nominees. But they don\u2019t have the power to use the filibuster to block the nominations, because in the last Congress they changed the threshold on such filibusters from 60 to 51 votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and fellow Republicans don\u2019t like the Democrats\u2019 plan and argue they didn\u2019t oppose outgoing Democratic President Obama\u2019s nominations when he took office in 2008. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats worked together and expeditiously to carefully consider his nominees,\u201d McConnell spokesman David Popp told Fox News on Monday. Popp points out that the Senate held hearings on multiple nominees before Obama was even sworn in, confirmed seven of them on Day One and that nearly all of them were confirmed within two weeks.\u00a0 \u201cSen. Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time,\u201d Popp continued. \u201cSo surely they won\u2019t object to treating the incoming president\u2019s nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness.\u201d The others on the purported list of eight are Georgia GOP Rep. Tom Price, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services; Andrew Puzder for labor secretary; and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to run the EPA. Those not on the purported list are Marine Gen. James N. Mattis for defense secretary; South Carolina GOP Gov. Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and former Marine Gen. John Kelly run the Department of Homeland Security. Fox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Part 6A Changed Man The Afghan War and the Evolution of Obama A strategy that went from a \u201cgood war\u201d to the shorthand \u201cAfghan good enough\u201d reflects the president\u2019s coming to terms with what was possible in Afghanistan. By MARK LANDLER JAN. 1, 2017 WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama \u2019s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama\u2019s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. \u201cThe fever in this room has finally broken,\u201d the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer in nation-building mode.\u201d What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States \u2014 after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2,000 American lives lost \u2014 would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, \u201cthe counterterrorism challenges are real.\u201d As bleak as Afghanistan\u2019s prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan \u2014 the \u201cgood war\u201d to George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cbad war\u201d in Iraq \u2014 had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. Video A Developing Stance on the Afghan War President Obama's shifting approach to the conflict is a lens through which to judge his legacy as a wartime leader. By A.J. CHAVAR on Publish Date January 1, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,\u201d the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech , \u201cthat war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly.\u201d More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama\u2019s thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. \u201cWhen it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,\u201d he said in the interview, \u201cthat this is a long slog.\u201d \u2018A War That We Have to Win\u2019 Continue reading the main story Photo Two Marines on a mountain ridge overlooking the Pakistani border near Kamu, Afghanistan, in 2008. The Taliban often attacked an American outpost in the area from firing positions on the mountain ridge. Credit Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a \u201cdumb war.\u201d But in the same speech he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t oppose all wars.\u201d He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \u201cI would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,\u201d he told the crowd that day in Chicago\u2019s Federal Plaza. Advertisement Continue reading the main story By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq \u2014 the \u201cgood war,\u201d in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration\u2019s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. \u201cThis is a war that we have to win,\u201d he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10,000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50,000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country \u201cprecarious and urgent.\u201d More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year.

Credit Peter Schumacher/The Burlington Times-News, via Associated Press When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70,000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obama\u2019s military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq \u2014 a troop-heavy, time-consuming, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a well-functioning government. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40,000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. \u201cThere was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview.\u201d \u201cIn many ways, I think, he deferred,\u201d said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice.

Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number \u2014 20,000, for example \u2014 look like a path to certain defeat. \u201cPresident Obama was asking the military for broad options,\u201d said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only \u201cvariations\u201d on \u201cthe more robust counterinsurgency model.\u201d Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? \u201cWhen he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more,\u201d Mr. Eikenberry said. \u201cBut what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define.\u201d Given Mr. Obama\u2019s innate wariness of nation-building, it didn\u2019t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,\u201d he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. \u201cObama believes the military can do enormous things,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. \u201cIt can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can\u2019t create a political culture or build a society.\u201d \u2018Afghan Good Enough\u2019 Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Obama and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement in Kabul in May 2012. The two had long had a rocky relationship. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept \u201cAfghan good enough.\u201d The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from nation-building to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100,000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, \u201cWow, this place looks great!\u201d The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama\u2019s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan\u2019s security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an \u201cenduring partnership\u201d between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war.

The two had long had a rocky relationship \u2014 on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government \u2014 and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was \u201cvery aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because I\u2019d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us.\u201d Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a long-term security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. \u201cThe most underappreciated part of foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cis dealing with flawed partners.\u201d ISIS, a New, Radiating Threat Photo A bomb blast targeted NATO forces in Kabul in July 2015. Credit Shah Marai/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. \u201cThe mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,\u201d said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. \u201cISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The American-trained Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama\u2019s war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now,\u201d he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a \u201cbroken record\u201d on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10,000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend \u201cwell beyond your presidency,\u201d according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the front-line fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. \u201cThis goes to the politics of what I\u2019m leaving for the next president,\u201d he told the group , according to one of the participants. \u201cMy interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X,\u201d he added, referring to troop numbers, \u201cbut to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision.\u201d Photo President Obama addressed graduates at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., in May 2014. In his speech, he said the United States would train and equip foreign armies but leave the front-line fighting to them. Credit Gabriella Demczuk/The New York Times Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10,000 from more than 100,000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. \u201cAfghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The country \u201cwas riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It\u2019s still there.\u201d In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare \u2014 a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,\u201d he said. \u201cAs commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,\u201d he went on, \u201cI spend a lot of time brooding over these issues.

By David Weigel January 1 at 7:46 PM Follow daveweigel For six years, since they took back the House of Representatives, Republicans have added to a pile of legislation that moldered outside the White House. In their thwarted agenda, financial regulations were to be unspooled. Business taxes were to be slashed. Planned Parenthood would be stripped of federal funds. The \u00adAffordable Care Act was teed up for repeal \u2014 dozens of times. When the 115th Congress begins this week, with Republicans firmly in charge of the House and Senate, much of that legislation will form the basis of the most ambitious conservative policy agenda since the 1920s. And rather than a Democratic president standing in the way, a soon-to-be-inaugurated Donald Trump seems ready to sign much of it into law. The dynamic reflects just how ready Congress is to push through a conservative makeover of government, and how little Trump\u2019s unpredictable, attention-grabbing style matters to the Republican game plan. That plan was long in the making. Almost the entire agenda has already been vetted, promoted and worked over by Republicans and think tanks that look at the White House less for leadership and more for signing ceremonies. (Peter Stevenson,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) In 2012, Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s Grover Norquist described the ideal president as \u201ca Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen\u201d and \u201csign the legislation that has already been prepared.\u201d In 2015, when Senate Republicans used procedural maneuvers to undermine a potential Democratic filibuster and vote to repeal the health-care law, it did not matter that President Obama\u2019s White House stopped them: As the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action put it, the process was \u201ca trial run for 2017, when we will hopefully have a President willing to sign a full repeal bill.\u201d \u201cWhat I told our committees a year ago was: Assume you get the White House and Congress,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told CNBC in a post-election interview last month. \u201cCome 2018, what do you want to have accomplished?\u201d Negotiations with the incoming Trump administration, he said, were mostly \u201con timeline, on an execution strategy.\u201d Few presidential candidates have dominated the coverage of an election like Trump did in 2016. In the campaign\u2019s final stretch, Republican candidates often got less attention for their records in Congress than for their positions on Trump\u2019s controversial statements. The irony, as Democrats realized after the election, was that congressional Republicans were poised to have more influence over the national agenda in 2017 than congressional Democrats did after the 2008 election that put Obama in the White House with his party in control on Capitol Hill. While the Democratic majority in 2009 was larger than the GOP advantage this year, the Democrats were hamstrung in ways they came to regret. Responding to the Great Recession, they spent the transition and first month of 2009 on a $831\u00a0billion stimulus package, with Obama aides openly hoping that they could pass it with bipartisan supermajorities. Every House Republican and all but three Senate Republicans opposed it, and within 20 days of inauguration, the first tea party protests had broken out against it. Protesters twinned their opposition to the stimulus with opposition to the bank bailouts, which had bipartisan backing. Since November, Republicans have preempted any problems like this by making no attempt to frame their agenda as bipartisan. 1 of 55 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. In his first news conference after the election, Ryan said that voters had delivered a mandate for \u201cunified Republican government.\u201d Eight years earlier, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had said only that Americans \u201cvoted in large numbers for change\u201d and said the White House would be driving the agenda. This year\u2019s agenda from House and Senate Republicans has clarity that was often lacking from Trump\u2019s own campaign. Senate Republicans favor using a procedure known as \u201cbudget reconciliation,\u201d in which measures can be passed with a simple 51-vote majority rather than a filibuster-proof 60 votes, to tackle the ACA and to undo much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. As part of undoing the financial overhaul law, some GOP leaders have begun planning strategies for how to effectively kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whether by giving Congress control over its budget or finding cause to replace its director, Richard Cordray, with a weaker board. \u201cI\u2019d like to repeal the whole thing, period,\u201d Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby said of Dodd-Frank in a December interview with the Wall Street Journal. The reconciliation process is also likely to be used to pass tax changes, which both Trump and congressional Republicans want to use to lower rates and end the estate tax. Republicans also are examining ways to undo many of the regulations and other orders enacted by Obama and his administration, including ones issued in the weeks since Trump\u2019s victory and designed to solidify the Democratic president\u2019s environmental legacy. GOP leaders have cited the 21-year old Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to cast simple majority votes of disapproval for regulations, as a way to block anything the administration has ordered since June 2016. Since its passage, the CRA has been used only once. But in December, the conservative House Freedom Caucus began compiling a list of more than 200 regulations it views as vulnerable to a disapproval vote. They include \u201cburdensome\u201d school lunch standards, tobacco regulations, laws that set higher wages for contractors and elements of the Paris climate-change agreement. \u201cTalking to some individuals with the Trump transition team, they are taking this extremely serious[ly],\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told the Heritage Foundation last month. Republicans intend to supplement the CRA by enacting a law that would subject any regulation with an economic impact greater than $100\u00a0million to a vote of Congress, a change that would have prevented nearly every climate or employment rule change of the Obama years. The measure, called the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, or Reins, is a conservative priority that passed the Republican House in 2011, 2013 and 2015 with backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Republican aides now hope for a vote on Reins in the coming days so it can be sent for Trump\u2019s signature immediately after he is sworn in on Jan. 20. Some Republican lawmakers also want legislation that would stop courts from deferring to federal agencies\u2019 interpretations of statutes \u2014 a practice known as \u201cChevron deference,\u201d after the 1984 Supreme Court case that went against the energy company \u2014 and have them instead defer to Congress. Little of this was discussed during the presidential campaign, and none has much buy-in from Democrats. Just one rural Democrat in the 115th Congress, Rep. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, voted for Reins. But Democrats do not see the next few months playing out for them the way the first half of 2009 played out for Republicans. \u201cI think there was a unique benefit to Republicans in obstructing the Obama agenda,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who served in the House in Obama\u2019s first term and arrived in the Senate in 2013. \u201cIn 2008, Obama\u2019s entire premise was built on fixing Washington by ending partisanship. It was dependent on getting two parties to work together. Mitch McConnell figured out quickly that he alone held the keys to success or lack of success.\u201d Democrats, said Murphy, would oppose Republicans where they can. But they are not in a position to block everything. \u201cTrump pays lip service to bringing people together, but his theme is that \u2018only he can fix it,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about results, not whether Washington is \u2018working,\u2019 so there\u2019s not the same political benefit to pure obstruction.\u201d Instead, Democrats see opportunities on issues on which Trump clashed with his party or where Republicans themselves worry that the party\u2019s position is unpopular. One of them is the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which sailed through the House in 2015. Last month, when Obama issued an order halting state efforts to defund the group, the legislation\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), said new \u201cpro-life majorities in Congress\u201d would \u201cnot only roll back this latest overreach but also enact new legal protections for these most vulnerable members of our society.\u201d Trump, who became antiabortion late in life, sent mixed messages about Planned Parenthood, praising its non-abortion work in televised debates. That, say Democrats and abortion rights advocates, suggests a wedge can be shoved between the Republican Congress and the president. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t run on, nor was he elected to act on, attacking reproductive health care,\u201d said Ericka Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. There\u2019s less clarity about how to respond on other Republican priorities. Legislation to allow concealed weapons to be carried across state lines, a major goal of the National Rifle Association, was endorsed by Trump and may be hard for red-state Democrats to oppose. A possible Trump-backed stimulus package intrigued even blue-state Democrats when it was floated in November. Interest waned when, in lieu of detailed spending plans, Trump allies suggested the stimulus would consist of tax breaks. In the short term, Democrats are focused more on Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and the looming Supreme Court nomination. In 2009, 59 Democratic senators were occasionally bogged down in getting the 60th vote to confirm lower-level Obama appointees such as Tom Perez as an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and Harold Koh as a legal adviser at State. In 2017, thanks to Democrats\u2019 change of the filibuster, Republicans no longer need to get 60 votes for cloture on nominees; they need a simple majority for any administration position or any judicial opening lower than the Supreme Court. This, Democrats admit, will give Republicans more running room and more floor time to pass bills. Shellshocked after being defeated in an election few people expected they could lose, some concede that Trump\u2019s ability to command media attention will make it harder to turn their losing congressional battles into headlines. They will try. On Jan. 15, Democrats will organize rallies in several states to draw attention to Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to leave Social Security and Medicare untouched \u2014 a difference with Republicans like Ryan. And the party\u2019s concurrent fight over who will head the Democratic National Committee has focused, in large part, on how the party can draw attention to the fast-moving Republican Congress and promote its own work, something Hillary Clinton failed to do in the campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019ll see a greater number of people who are uninsured, more people who are unemployed and more kids getting low test scores,\u201d said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leading candidate for DNC chairman. \u201cBut if we think Trump will create bad conditions and that\u2019ll be enough for Democrats to win, we are absolutely wrong.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Photo: Andy Wong, AP) BEIJING \u2014 The world's most populous nation has the second-largest economy, one of the highest savings rates and mushrooming wealth. Yet virtually no one has a will to pass on an\u00a0estate. And now it's become a huge problem. Thirty years after communist China\u00a0embarked on a course that allowed individuals to accumulate wealth,\u00a0members of\u00a0the first generation to benefit are starting to die, creating a spike in inheritance disputes that are\u00a0clogging up the courts and turning families against each other. The problem has gotten so bad that even the ruling Communist Party \u2014\u00a0previously no fan of inherited wealth \u2014\u00a0is concerned. \u201cWhen people die without a will their children scramble for their property, damaging family ties and having a negative effect on society,\u201d the state-run Xinhua News Agency\u00a0has warned. Only 1% of China\u2019s 220 million seniors have drawn up inheritance plans, according to the best estimates.\u00a0The reason\u00a0is cultural: talking about death is taboo and writing a will is akin to putting a curse on yourself. A group of senior citizens write their wills at a free legal center in Beijing. \u00a0(Photo: Hannah Gardner) Even the rich and educated often don\u2019t write them. Consider the publicized case of\u00a0Yan Jiying, a coal baron from the northern province of Shanxi.\u00a0He died in 2015\u00a0at the age of 71, leaving his estranged wife, long-term mistress and six children\u00a0to fight over his assets. At one point the conflict was so bad that his company, Sanjia, stopped paying wages.\u00a0Local officials tried to broker a peace but to no avail. \u201cChina is entering a crucial period. If we don\u2019t find a way to transfer wealth responsibly it will affect social stability,\u201d said\u00a0Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology. To remedy the problem,\u00a0the government is calling on local authorities around the country to establish free legal centers for those over 60.\u00a0One charity doing that since 2013 is the China Will Registration Center, founded by Chen Kai, a young lawyer with a passion to\u00a0protect\u00a0seniors.\u00a0His offices in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Nanjing have\u00a0processed 40,000 wills at no charge\u00a0since it was established and is the largest\u00a0provider of probate services in China. The waiting list for appointments at his first Beijing center now stretches into September, proof that people will write a will if they can find support they trust, Chen\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cWe want to teach old people that they are the masters of their fortune, that they have the right to decide what happens to their hard-earned money, \u201d he said. On a recent morning around a dozen seniors were squeezed around a communal table at the center, diligently transcribing the final copy of their will. They begin by dictating\u00a0their wishes to a lawyer, who types up a draft. The clients\u00a0are\u00a0then evaluated by a visiting psychiatrist to establish clarity of mind, they record video testimony of their wishes in the presence of two independent witnesses, and finally copy the final document by hand. People walk past motorists stuck on a traffic jam during the morning rush hour in Beijing, Dec. 15, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Andy Wong, AP) For many, the last step is the hardest. Most are over 70\u00a0and have shaky hands or poor eyesight.\u00a0Transcribing a page of formal Chinese characters mistake-free is no easy task. But Chen is adamant that they do it this\u00a0way, saying he has seen too many badly written wills challenged. He wants his clients to be sure their wishes will be respected even if some family members\u00a0do not like them. According to a recent article in the People\u2019s Daily, 70%\u00a0of inheritance cases in Beijing courts stem from the lack of a will. In\u00a0the cases where a\u00a0will is challenged, 60%\u00a0are found to be invalid. Chinese television is\u00a0highlighting the issue in shows like Third Mediation Room, China\u2019s answer to Jerry Springer, and Family Property, a drama about three brothers who fight over the family business after their father dies without a will. At the will registration center in Beijing, many said they had come after discussing their wishes with family members.\u00a0Liu Maolin, 74, said he had decided to write a\u00a0will because he wanted to be sure his daughter, who cares for him, gets his apartment, not his son, a businessman\u00a0who lives in Japan. His family agreed this was a fair arrangement, but he conceded there is always a risk of a later dispute. \"I didn\u2019t want them to end up like the people on television. This way they can\u2019t argue after I am gone.\u201d 16 CONNECT TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iWY5dv NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Ryan (R-Wis.) on Capitol Hill in Washington. President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter A Republican-controlled Congress opens Tuesday with the most sweeping conservative agenda in decades, providing Donald Trump ample room to gut the Affordable Care Act, slash corporate tax rates and undo Obama -era environmental regulations. The House is almost certain to reelect Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) as its first order of business, dispensing with the messy political infighting that has hobbled Republicans in the past. And the Senate will swiftly begin vetting the president-elect\u2019s most controversial Cabinet picks, ready to confirm some when Trump is inaugurated as president on Jan. 20. Yet Republicans remain at odds on some high-profile issues \u2014 such as how aggressively to investigate Russian hacking in the 2016 election \u2014 and how to fulfill other big-ticket promises, such as replacing Obamacare. Despite firm Republican control of both the White House and Congress, the internal disputes have left them without a clear plan yet for Trump\u2019s first 100 days, or an endgame for the two years of the 115th Congress. Trump\u2019s often shifting views on major issues will test relations with GOP\u2019s leaders on Capitol Hill, and his willingness to skirt ideological rigidity gives\u00a0incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco an opening to influence and shape the president\u2019s evolving agenda. Janet L. Yellen and the Federal Reserve should be looking at easier days ahead. Yellen, in what will probably be her last full year as Fed chair, may\u00a0finally get help from somewhere else in Washington. Tax cuts and... After three years of almost single-handedly juicing up the slow-growing economy, Janet L. Yellen and the Federal Reserve should be looking at easier days ahead. Yellen, in what will probably be her last full year as Fed chair, may\u00a0finally get help from somewhere else in Washington. Tax cuts and... (Don Lee and Jim Puzzanghera) President Obama will visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Democrats bracing for their new role, not just as the minority party, but as the main roadblock preventing Trump from dismantling the healthcare law and other parts of the Obama agenda. Republicans will also assemble behind closed doors. Vice President-elect Mike Pence , who was a popular conservative congressman before he was elected governor of Indiana, is likely to serve as a crucial link between the Trump administration and its allies in Congress. Given Trump\u2019s inexperience in government, Pence is expected to play an enhanced role, perhaps like the one former Vice President Richard Cheney held under President George W. Bush. At a minimum, Pence could provide a vital conduit between the untested new president and his more ideological party members in Congress, especially as Ryan\u2019s own relationship with Trump has been strained. Ryan flip-flopped over Trump \u2014 first withholding his endorsement, then ultimately campaigning for him \u2014\u00a0but the speaker insists he and the president-elect have let bygones pass as they talk almost daily on their plans for fulfilling Republican promises to voters. \u00a0\u201cVery soon after the race, Donald and I said:\u00a0\u2018Look, this is fantastic. We have so much to do. Let's forget about, you know, any differences in the past and let's get working on this agenda,\u2019\u201d Ryan said recently on Fox News. \u201cAnd that's exactly what we've been doing from -- that day on.\u201d Once Trump takes office, Republicans will face\u00a0enormous pressure to score some legislative wins after six years of trying to block most of Obama\u2019s initiatives. Lawmakers will vote this week on low-hanging fruit -- a popular GOP measure to rein in the executive branch by requiring congressional approval for new federal regulations with an economic impact of more than $100 million. The measure, which passed the Republican House three times since 2011, is a GOP priority. Its supporters say it would have prevented nearly all the climate and employment rule changes of the Obama era. Republicans are also expected to punish Democrats for last year\u2019s gun control sit-in, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), by imposing new rules that would slap up to $2,500\u00a0fines on lawmakers who film such floor protests from smartphones or other devices. Whether that would pass judicial review is less clear. Opponents say the proposed ban is clearly unconstitutional. But the GOP\u2019s top promise \u2014 to end Obamacare \u2014 remains a tough haul. Votes are expected in coming days on legislation to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. But these first steps will be largely symbolic while lawmakers debate the details of dismantling the healthcare law. With 20 million Americans now benefiting from Obamacare, the GOP\u2019s gutting of it comes with an asterisk. Republicans are also likely to postpone fully dismantling the healthcare law until they can sort out their own ideas for a yet-to-be-determined\u00a0alternative.\u00a0 That could push a full Obamacare repeal and replace until 2018 or 2019, after the midterm elections. \u201cRepeal and delay, it doesn\u2019t even have alliteration,\u201d Pelosi scoffed on a conference call Monday with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an admission that it\u2019s a lot for them to lose politically.\u201d Throughout his campaign for president, Donald Trump painted a gloomy picture of the American economy, scoffing at employment data that he said masked the truth. \u201cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,\u201d the Republican said at an election-day\u00a0rally\u00a0in Michigan, lamenting how he saw global... Throughout his campaign for president, Donald Trump painted a gloomy picture of the American economy, scoffing at employment data that he said masked the truth. \u201cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,\u201d the Republican said at an election-day\u00a0rally\u00a0in Michigan, lamenting how he saw global... (Michael A. Memoli) Similarly, Republicans are still working out the details of tax reform beyond the lower rates proposed in the House\u00a0GOP\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d blueprint agenda for the new year.\u00a0 Ryan will almost certainly re-emerge as speaker in Tuesday\u2019s floor vote. But his leadership remains constrained by the same internal party divisions that hobbled his predecessor, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), and that have prevented Republicans from making gains on a cohesive agenda. Democrats, despite being in the minority in both the House and Senate, will be more than bit players in the new Washington environment. Senate Democrats are planning a robust grilling of Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices, particularly Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the conservative orthopedic doctor who has been tapped to helm the Health and Human Services Department and the Obamacare unraveling. Democrats are also lining up against Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general, and have raised questions about ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, who has substantial ties with Russia, as secretary of State. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) intends to have several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks \u2013 likely the national security team -- cleared for quick confirmation after Trump takes office. But McConnell faces his own difficulty as several top Republicans, including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are pushing for an aggressive investigation in Congress of Russian cyber-attacks during the presidential race. McCain plans to hold his first hearing on the issue Thursday. McConnell has resisted calls by a bipartisan group, led by McCain and Schumer, for creation of a separate special committee \u2013 or an independent panel like the bipartisan commission that investigated the terrorist attacks after Sept. 11, 2001. Many Republicans are optimistic for the days ahead, ready to \u201chit the ground running,\u201d Ryan\u00a0has said. Congress adjusted its calendar to work more, with several five-day work weeks in the House as it\u00a0races to deliver on election promises. Normally the House is in session only four\u00a0days a week. Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

By Tom Hamburger January 2 at 6:01 PM Follow @thamburger A bipartisan group of ethics advocates lobbed a second\u00a0letter\u00a0to President-elect Donald Trump on Monday evening\u00a0warning him that he needs to do more to separate himself from his family business interests. The letter comes after Trump announced some changes in his business empire, with more expected before Inauguration Day. The letter signers\u00a0include\u00a0two conservative allies of Trump senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 Peter Schweizer, the author of the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d which outlined possible conflicts of interest posed by\u00a0Hillary Clinton because of donations to her husband's charitable foundation, as well as John Pudner, who went to high school with Bannon and now runs\u00a0the advocacy group Take Back Our Republic. Monday's letter urged the incoming president \u201cto divest your business enterprises into a true blind trust managed by an independent trustee having no family relationship with you, or the equivalent, in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics in Government Act.\u201d The letter expressed appreciation for the steps that have been taken by Trump to address his conflicts of interest problems, including\u00a0terminating or limiting plans for Trump projects in\u00a0Brazil, Azerbaijan, Georgia and elsewhere and shutting the president-elect's charitable foundation. But the ethics experts\u00a0said more action is required: \u201cAs long as you continue to maintain ownership of The Trump Organization, no other steps that you take will prevent the serious conflicts of interest, appearance of conflicts, and Emoluments Clause problems that will exist throughout your presidency.\u00a0In these circumstances, you cannot separate the presidency\u00a0 from your business enterprises.\u201d As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, questions and concerns have been raised over how his business interests may interfere with the business of running the country. The Washington Post spoke to Public Citizen to untangle and unpack the potential consequences of Trump's conflicts. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) The 29 signers to the letter included Republicans and Democrats, and liberal and conservative groups. In addition to Schweizer and Pudner, signers include\u00a0Norm Eisen, President Obama\u2019s chief ethics lawyer, and Richard Painter, former president George W. Bush\u2019s chief ethics lawyer. They also include two former\u00a0Republican governors\u00a0and five former Republican House members. The signers conclude with a tough warning: \u201cRespectfully, you cannot serve the country as president and also own a world-wide business enterprise, without seriously damaging the presidency.\u201d --Rosalind S.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 3, 2017 12:49 AM EST U.S. government officials have been notified of new cases of attempted or potentially successful cyber intrusions, CBS News has learned. Officials would not go into specifics or reveal the number of new cases. But the revelation raises concerns that Russian cyberattacks have been more extensive than originally thought. Since the U.S released a report on election-related cyberattacks on Thursday, a government official said more cases have come to light, CBS News\u2019 Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports. U.S. releases report detailing hacking allegations against Russia The intelligence information made public last week revealed some of the tools and infrastructure allegedly used by Russian hacking units. Those signatures were flagged over the weekend after officials connected with Vermont\u2019s electric grid said\u00a0 malware code used in operation \u201cGrizzly Steppe\u201d was found on a Burlington Electric Department laptop .\u00a0 A team of Department of Homeland Security analysts has been working to determine if Russian hackers successfully breached Vermont\u2019s system.  But so far, investigators have not been able to determine the intent behind the Vermont incident , and there are no indications the power grid is compromised. \u00a0 \u201cWhile our analysis continues, we currently have no information that indicates that the power grid was penetrated in this cyber incident,\u201d said Todd Breasseale, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. \u00a0 Late Monday night, The Washington Post reported that federal officials \u201care finding evidence that the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility, according to experts and officials close to the investigation.\u201d Monday\u2019s revelation about new cases of attempted or potentially successful cyber intrusions came just days after\u00a0 the Obama administration announced a series of actions in response to what the White House called \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election.\u201d In addition to sanctions announced on Thursday, 35 Russian diplomats have been expelled from the United States . While President Obama and most congressional Republicans have denounced Russia for its alleged election interference, President-elect Donald Trump has been reluctant to do so , even after FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper backed the CIA\u2019s judgment that Russia interfered. The CIA said in December it has high confidence that Russians tried to influence the election and that they favored Mr. Trump. \u201cI know a lot about hacking,\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Trump said before his New Years Eve party at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night. \u201cAnd hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And also - I know things that other people don\u2019t know - and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d Mr. Trump promised new information on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Sean Spicer, the Trump transition\u2019s spokesman, seemed to walk that back. \u201cWell it\u2019s not a question of necessarily revealing, remember the president-elect is privy to a lot of classified information, intelligence reports, he gets briefed by his national security team on a daily basis,\u201d Spicer said, speaking on CNN. It is unclear, however, where Mr. Trump or his national security team are getting their intelligence reports. All U.S. intelligence agencies are in agreement that the Russian government with the blessing of Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated \u201caggressive\u201d cyberattacks prior to and during the U.S. election. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Larry Davis said in a statement Monday that crews responded to a medical call at the home about 5 a.m. One child died at the scene and three others died at a hospital. Officials didn\u2019t release any identifying information, including the children\u2019s ages. Other family members and first responders are being treated.\u00a0 Toxic Phosphine gas is produced when aluminum phosphide is mixed with water or moisture, CBS Amarillo affiliate KFDA reports . Aluminum phosphide is a dangerous \u201crestricted-use pesticide,\u201d and it\u2019s used to kill mice, prairie dogs and gophers. A license is needed to buy it. The Amarillo Fire Department said in this case it was clearly purchased from an unlicensed dealer, since the person who used it didn\u2019t know that mixing it with water could be damaging, KFDA reported. Once inhaled or ingested, the respiratory system is attacked and it only takes a few PPM (parts per million) to cause death. \u201cThis is known, this happens across the United States and it\u2019s when people get a hold of stuff they don\u2019t know how to use and they don\u2019t do enough research and figure out that water is bad for it,\u201d said Lieutenant Josh Whitney. \u201cAnd then with the moisture that we have in our air and the moisture that he applied to it, it was just a recipe for a bad situation.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Zach Gibson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump meets with House Speaker Paul Ryan at the U.S. Capitol for a meeting in November just after Election Day. Zach Gibson/Getty Images As the 115th Congress is sworn in Tuesday, Republicans will be poised to control Washington with a stronger hand than they have in a decade \u2014 with the Senate, House and the White House in GOP hands, once President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. This past November, Republicans held their congressional losses to a minimum, helped by an unexpectedly strong GOP wave behind Trump. After losing just two Senate seats, they'll hold a 52-48 edge (two independents caucus with Democrats. In the House, Republicans lost six seats, giving them a 241-194 majority. 'Dawn Of A New Unified Republican Government' Coming In 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted shortly after Election Day that the \"new unified Republican government\" would be \"focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people.\" And as NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis explained, there is precedent for a unified government pushing through sweeping changes early on: When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping \u2014 albeit politically polarizing \u2014 legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration \u2014 when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president \u2014 has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints. GOP congressional leaders and Trump agree on many things \u2014 tantamount among them their best chance ever to repeal and replace Obamacare, in addition to rolling back federal regulations and increasing infrastructure projects. But there are some looming showdowns between the incoming president and members of his own party on Capitol Hill \u2014 many of whom were less than supportive of Trump in the primaries and lukewarm on his prospects in the general election. Article continues after sponsorship Top Republicans have already signaled their break with Trump over alleged Russian cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U.S. elections. After President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against the country last week, Ryan called the response \"overdue\" but \"appropriate.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the sanctions were a \"a good initial step\" and reiterated his support for a congressional investigation into the supposed interference. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is planning a hearing for Thursday into the breach, with three top intelligence officials set to testify. Trump, however, has said the country should \"move on\" from the cyberattacks. During the campaign he repeatedly praised Russia and its president Vladimir Putin during the campaign, casting doubt that they were behind the intrusion. He even praised Putin as \"very smart!\" after his muted response to sanctions from the Obama administration. Trump has, however, acquiesced to meeting with U.S. intelligence regarding the cyber breaches this week. Deal Or Disrupt? Congressional Democrats Weigh 2017 Choices Congress is prepared to get a jumpstart on confirming Trump's cabinet nominees as well, with hearings on some top appointees beginning next week. But many of his most important picks are controversial, particularly Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. The Exxon Mobil CEO's ties to Russia and Putin have already raised concern, and he's sure to be pressed about the new sanctions as well. Is Sessions, Trump's Attorney General Pick, Trying to Paper Over His Record? Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions's nomination for attorney general could be contentious too. While sitting members typically receive deference from their peers, Democrats will draw attention to Sessions's past failure to get confirmation as a federal judge after he had allegedly made racist remarks in the past. Another looming fight will be when Trump makes his pick for the Supreme Court to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland languished last year as Republicans refused to take up his nomination. The process of repealing the Affordable Care Act is expected to get started this week as the Senate is expected to take up a budget measure to begin the process of dismantling President Obama's signature domestic achievement. But it won't come quickly. Without a replacement plan on the table, some Republicans are weary of moving too quickly to dismantle the healthcare law for fear it would roil insurance markets if no fix is ready to be implemented. Soon after the member of the 115th Congress are sworn in on Tuesday, their next task will be to officially re-elect Ryan as speaker. And while there's little drama expected for him to secure the votes he needs after being unanimously renominated by the GOP conference in November, there could still be defections once the voice vote is held on the House floor, particularly from hardline Trump supporters. Two years ago, then-beleaguered Speaker John Boehner had 25 member of his own party vote against him . When Boehner stepped down in October 2015, only nine other Republicans voted for someone other than Ryan. Ryan distanced himself from Trump just before Election Day after damaging audio emerged of Trump bragging about groping women. The two have since reconciled, but there have been signs of discord among the base. At a rally last month in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, the speaker was booed. And while Trump quieted the dissenters, he did caution that if Ryan ever opposed him their relationship might not be so rosy any longer. \"Honestly, he's like a fine wine: Every day goes by, I get to appreciate his genius more and more,\" Trump told the Wisconsin crowd on Dec. 13. \"Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that, OK?\" It may have been a joke, but speaks to the strain in the most powerful relationship in Washington.

Schaben / Los Angeles Times Protesters against the development of Newport Banning Ranch celebrate in September after the Coastal Commission rejected a large development project proposed for the property. Protesters against the development of Newport Banning Ranch celebrate in September after the Coastal Commission rejected a large development project proposed for the property. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Bradley Zint The California Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in San Francisco on a preservation group's lawsuit challenging the Newport Beach City Council's approval of a proposed development at Banning Ranch. The Banning Ranch Conservancy, which seeks to preserve the sprawling coastal property in West Newport as open space, is accusing the city of violating  its own general plan when, in 2012,\u00a0 the council approved \u00a0a large residential and commercial development for the area. The group contends the general plan prioritizes open space in West Newport and that city officials failed to work with the California Coastal Commission to prioritize sensitive habitat areas. The conservancy also says the project's environmental impact report was inadequate. At the time, developer Newport Banning Ranch sought to build 1,375 homes, a 75-room hotel and a commercial area on about 95 acres of the 401-acre property, which has been an active oil field since the 1940s. Newport Banning Ranch's plans were downgraded by September this year, when it looked to build 895 homes as well as the 75-room hotel, a 20-bed hostel and 45,100 square feet of retail space on 62 acres. The Coastal Commission\u00a0 rejected that plan , and in November the developer\u00a0 sued in Orange County Superior Court , challenging the denial and requesting damages of at least $490 million. The Banning Ranch Conservancy lawsuit was filed in Superior Court soon after the council's decision in 2012. The following year, a county judge ruled in the conservancy's favor. City officials challenged that ruling, which sent the matter to state appeals court. The conservancy then appealed to the state Supreme Court, which\u00a0 agreed to review the case . Banning Ranch Conservancy Executive Director Steve Ray said his group was always prepared for the lawsuit to reach the state's highest court. \"That was truly the only place where we could hope to win,\" Ray said. \"We built our case upon arguments that will resonate in the Supreme Court.\" He said the conservancy's ultimate plan is to acquire the property \u2014 whose market value is a matter of dispute \u2014 and manage it for public use. Newport Beach City Atty. Aaron Harp contended that the city did an \"exhaustive\" environmental analysis of the property and that the court should defer to the city to interpret its own general plan. A spokesman for Newport Banning Ranch declined to comment. Each side will receive 30 minutes  Wednesday to speak to the court's seven justices. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. It will be broadcast live on the court's website,\u00a0 courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm . Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) Investors that want to cover all the bases when it comes to market risk might want to consider\u00a0the very worst-case \u2013 and best-case \u2013 scenarios for stocks in 2017. Wall Street\u2019s predictions for the new year are out.\u00a0The \u201cbase case\u201d is for a gain of around 5% for the stock market in 2017.\u00a0But a deeper dive into stock strategists\u2019 2017 outlook reports unearthed\u00a0bearish scenarios that envision the U.S. stock market potentially declining between 10% and 30%. There\u2019s also a bullish vision that sees stocks streaking 20% higher in the new year. Year-end 2017 price targets for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index from strategists at 15 Wall Street firms see the large-cap stock gauge\u00a0climbing to 2363, on average. That\u00a0equates to a 5.5% gain from Friday\u2019s 2016 year-end close of 2239. This middling mid-single digit call is built on the premise that the economic recovery and corporate profit growth will gain speed, helped\u00a0by renewed investor optimism after\u00a0the election of Donald Trump and high expectations for the president elect\u2019s growth-friendly platform. Trump\u2019s call for lower corporate taxes, less regulation of businesses and sizable spending on infrastructure has spurred a positive upturn in investor sentiment. But the \u201cbear case\u201d \u2013 or worst-case scenario \u2013 laid out by a handful of strategists suggest the S&P 500 could end 2017 down as much as 10%, which adds up to a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Or perhaps plunge as much as 30%, which would put it\u00a0well into bear-market territory, defined as a 20%-plus drop. Trump, turmoil: The top 10 business stories of 2016 In its \u201cYear Ahead Report,\u201d UBS Wealth Management Americas, highlighted a key lesson from 2016: \u201cDon\u2019t confuse a base case with a done deal. The past year has been ignominious for base-case forecasts. Donald Trump won the U.S. election. The UK voted to leave the EU. And central banks were forced to ease policy more than previously thought necessary.\u201d Here\u2019s how the \"bear\" case and \"bull\" case of Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, differ from her \"base\" case of the S&P 500 finishing 2017 at 2300, or about 3% higher than 2016\u2019s close. Her base case is dependent on policymakers ability to \u201cdeliver growth next year.\u201d But if that doesn\u2019t happen, look out below, warns Subramanian. In her \u201cbear case,\u201d she won\u2019t rule out a drop to 1600 for the S&P 500, which equates to a selloff of nearly 30%, or what she calls a \u201ctypical bear market decline.\u201d If policy makers \u201ccannot deliver a pick-up in growth,\u201d Subramanian\u00a0wrote, investors could be disappointed. If the economic backdrop gets worse instead of better as forecasters expect, \u201cmarkets would likely begin to price in an imminent recession,\u201d she warns, adding that stimulus from the Trump administration could push out the next recession by 12 to 18 months. The stock decline in 2017 could rival the downdraft at the start of 2016, when the S&P 500 fell\u00a010.5%, or be \u201ceven more severe,\u201d she warns. In search of potential trouble, Subramanian\u00a0will be closely monitoring Trump\u2019s comments related to trade, House Republicans\u2019 comments on deficits and spending, as well as the health of credit markets. Stock pros: Own these stocks in 2017 In sharp contrast, Subramanian\u2019s \"bull case\" is built on the assumption that everything goes right. If that occurs, the S&P 500 can climb another 21% to 2700, she says. \u201cIt would not take much to see a year of broad-based healing with no major shock,\u201d Subramanian, outlining her best-case scenario, wrote. \u201cThe most vaunted growth catalyst is the possibility of a significant stimulus package from the Trump administration next year. Instead of trade wars, we may get across-the-board tax cuts, a repatriation (tax) holiday and infrastructure spending. This could be the catalyst for a traditional euphoria-driven end-of-bull-market rally that could generate 20%-plus returns.\u201d None of the other 14 strategists comes close to Subramanian\u2019s best-case call. But many warn the stock market can go down if reality doesn\u2019t match investors\u2019 high expectations. The \u201cdownside shock\u201d scenario outlined by investment firm Strategas Research Partners is built on\u00a0an economy that doesn\u2019t rebound, but instead falls into recession, causing corporate profit growth to fall shy of market expectations. This \u201cbear case,\u201d which the firm places 20% odds on, would cause the S&P 500 to retreat to around 1790, or 20% lower than current levels. Jonathan Glionna, U.S. equity strategy at Barclays, also offers up\u00a0a \u201cbear case.\u201d The S&P 500 could tumble to 2000 \u2013 a 11% drop \u2013 if the U.S. dollar strengthens and interest rates climb a lot higher, causing corporate profits\u00a0to be less robust. Those twin\u00a0headwinds could cause \u201cinvestors to reassess risky assets,\" he wrote in his report. Glionna, though, doesn\u2019t see a recession on the horizon, citing the strong labor market as a sign of U.S. economic vitality. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, sees the S&P 500 rising 5% in his base case for 2017. But he won\u2019t rule out a 15% fall to 1900 if corporate earnings growth stalls and Trump\u2019s fiscal spending plans don\u2019t come to fruition or if people question their feasibility. The risk is if \u201cthe economy and earnings momentum stall,\u201d says Belski. 17 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iX0jtx NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Bradford sheepishly acknowledged the applause for setting an NFL single-season accuracy record by completing 71.6 percent of his passes. Acquired from the Eagles in the preseason for first- and fourth-round draft picks after starter Teddy Bridgewater went down with an injury, Bradford made an immediate impact. The 8-8 Vikings didn't miss the playoffs because of Bradford. Good luck finding folks in Minnesota convinced the Vikings gave up too much. Sometimes gambles pay off in the NFL, and in Bradford's case, a season that started with a bold risk ended with a video tribute. You wonder what was going through Bears general manager Ryan Pace 's head as he watched from his seat in the press box. A Bears fan can hope the message resonated. It will take the same kind of daring creativity by Pace to address football's most important position in a defining offseason that began Monday. Pace can start by thinking big, pursuing a quarterback with Pro Bowl potential and treating the decision as if his job depends on it. It does, or at least it will dictate how we evaluate Pace next winter after his third season. The Bears have pressing needs at cornerback, safety and offensive tackle, but every potential upgrade will be enhanced if they get it right at quarterback, the player who affects everything about an organization. A team such as the Bears, with a quarterback tradition no franchise wants, needs unprecedented boldness to change course. Now that the Cubs have won the World Series, the Bears' search for a bona fide franchise quarterback represents Chicago's longest drought. Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. All three avenues appear open to Pace: the draft, free agency and a trade. Before choosing which path to follow, Pace must make the easiest call of the offseason: Move on from Jay Cutler . From a football perspective, the Bears could argue that bringing back Cutler for a ninth season offers the sturdiest bridge to a quarterback drafted to be his successor. In reality, football reasons alone cannot influence every move by NFL teams. If the Bears tried selling Cutler as their 2017 starter to a fan base already fed up enough to ignore the team, Soldier Field's empty-seat epidemic would start spreading by October. Thank Cutler for being a tough son of a gun who dealt with more abuse than he often deserved and wish him well on whatever team he will start next. But he is in the way in Chicago. It must be someone else's time to take snaps. Whose? That depends on which of the three methods Pace selects to find the answer. He can begin by exploring the trade availability of Jimmy Garoppolo, the Patriots backup expected to be on the market with Tom Brady looking as young as ever. And if Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels becomes a head coach again, his new team likely will pursue a Garoppolo deal as aggressively as the Bears should. Speculation suggests trade discussions with the Patriots will open with teams offering first- and fourth-round draft picks \u2014 the price the Vikings paid for Bradford. Given the iffy quarterbacks in the 2017 draft, Pace could justify sacrificing the picks for a quarterback of the future who's ready now. Jimmy Garoppolo Acquiring New England Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo might be an option for the Bears.\u00a0 Acquiring New England Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo might be an option for the Bears.\u00a0 (Elise Amendola / AP) A football executive can talk himself out of anything in a conservative league. Or the NFL's youngest general manager can commit to a deal that will define his tenure and put his team in position to compete for a playoff spot again sooner rather than later. Garoppolo has only two NFL starts in three seasons, and becoming a No. 1 quarterback might expose him as the next Brock Osweiler . But what if it reveals Garoppolo as one of the league's best young quarterbacks who learned well from a legend? Too much is made of the Arlington Heights native's local ties and his Eastern Illinois connection to Pace; he could be a West Coast kid who went to college in the South and be worthy of the Bears' pursuit because of talent and intangibles. If the Bears swing and miss on Garoppolo by the time free agency begins March 7, they can explore other veteran options. But unless the Redskins unexpectedly allow Kirk Cousins to hit the market, no free-agent possibilities make more sense than a potential draft pick. Mike Glennon ? Case Keenum ? Exactly. If Cousins remains a Redskin and a Garoppolo trade falls through, the Bears will head into the April 27-29 draft in the dangerous position of drafting for need with the No. 3 pick. Or, put more accurately, overdrafting for need. In that case, the Bears should consider re-signing Brian Hoyer to be the 2017 transitional starter for the rookie-to-be-named-later taken third. The next few months will determine how high Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer, North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky and Clemson's Deshaun Watson \u2014 in alphabetical order only, at this point \u2014 deserve to go. Drafting a quarterback in the first round represents the safest way for Pace to address the longtime problem. That doesn't necessarily make it the smartest for a GM who not only must be fixated on the position this offseason, but also must do what so many of his predecessors didn't: Fix it. ",

The Bears are done embarrassing themselves this season \u2014 John Fox \u2019s \u201ctry hard\u201d clown act capped the embarrassment with a 38-10 loss Sunday in Minnesota \u2014 which means they now can become relevant. To become relevant beyond next season\u2019s opener, however, they will need a new quarterback. They also... (Steve Rosenbloom) \u201cJonathan Allen, the defensive lineman from Alabama, isn\u2019t really truly an edge guy for the Bears. Is he J.J. Watt ? No, he\u2019s not. Is he going to be an edge rusher in a 3-4? No, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s really a good 3-4 defensive end. They\u2019d be thrilled to have him but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s No. 3. I think they need a cornerback but I think they draft the quarterback first and in the second round I think they are still going to get a quality cornerback. \u201cIf I was the general manager and I knew that my ass was on the line next year with the head coach, what do we truly need? Jay Cutler hasn\u2019t worked. Let\u2019s get rid of him. Matt Barkley is a good little backup. They need a good quarterback. They\u2019re not going to wait until the third round to take one. They can\u2019t. \u201cThe LSU safety Jamal Adams? He\u2019s a good player. But how much of an impact can he be? He\u2019s a safety. How many Troy Polamalus do you know? This kid is a really good player. But I think there will be two really quality corners left for the Bears at the top of the second round. \u201cThe first guy has gotta be a sexy pick. It\u2019s gotta be a pass rusher. It\u2019s gotta be a big-time corner but I don\u2019t think there is a big-time corner that\u2019s going No. 3. There\u2019s probably not a pass rusher that is going No. 3. Tim Williams, the kid from Alabama, he\u2019s got a lot of baggage. He\u2019s gonna tumble a little bit. \u201cThe other thing they can do if they take a quarterback early, maybe they can buy a little more time with the understanding he\u2019s going to struggle a little at first like rookie quarterbacks tend to do. They\u2019ve got to take a quarterback. You said you were looking for five names. Five names really isn\u2019t what it\u2019s about.\u201d 4. The Bears will likely find out in the next week or so if they have a chance to coach one of the teams in the Senior Bowl later this month in Mobile, Ala. The Browns , who will own the No. 1 overall pick, will almost certainly be offered one of the slots. The 49ers , who pick No. 2, will not be in play if they blow up their power structure and fire the general manager and head coach, as has been speculated. That would make the Bears the logical next pick but nothing is decided at this point. The team could turn down the chance. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never done it in 27 years,\u201d coach John Fox said when I asked if he\u2019d considered the possibility. \u201cI really can\u2019t comment other than you get a chance to watch guys and work with the guys almost like you have them in your training camp. So, I see the benefits but I really can\u2019t speak too much to that because I haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d It\u2019s hardly a foolproof draft aid though. The Jaguars staff coached at the Senior Bowl in 2014 when it had Derek Carr and Jimmy Garoppolo on its roster. Jacksonville turned around and used the No. 3 pick in the draft that year on Blake Bortles , one of the reasons that coaching staff has been fired. So stay tuned on this situation. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like there will be a Carr on either Senior Bowl roster this year.\u00a0 5. Any other year and Jordan Howard\u2019s 1,313-yard rookie season probably isn\u2019t checking in at No. 5 in the season-ending 10 Thoughts but, well, it\u2019s been that kind of year. Howard\u2019s 135-yard effort vaulted him to No. 2 in the league for the season. While Howard has no shot at NFL offensive rookie of the year honors with the Cowboys \u2019 Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott having huge seasons, Howard would be a good bet most other seasons.\u00a0 Photos of Bears running back Jordan Howard. Howard finished averaging 5.2 yards per game, the best by a primary Bears\u2019 running back since Walter Payton averaged 5.5 in his 1,852-yard season of 1977. That\u2019s what was really impressive. For some perspective on Howard, I turned to tight end Logan Paulsen , a seven-year veteran who has made a living in the NFL primarily blocking for running backs. I thought he had some really interesting stuff to say that\u2019s worth taking a look at. My question was simple: Does Howard remind him of any other backs? \u201cNot particularly,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very unique running style. He\u2019s got amazing vision and he\u2019s kind of got a sense how the run should hit. It\u2019s very unique, very special. He\u2019s got great acceleration. Not super top end (speed) but his zero to 10 is good and that helps him hit the hole real hard. I\u2019m trying to think if there is anyone that comes to mind. \u201cI would compare him to Alfred (Morris), but I think Jordan\u2019s vision is way better. They run hard. They kind of run physically. But he sees the cut way better, understands the scheme way better. I\u2019m trying to think of big backs but he\u2019s got a little more (stuff) to him than like Eddie George, for example. He\u2019s a unique fella. \u201cI got here late (signed Sept. 4) so I saw him and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a fifth-round draft pick.\u2019 His demeanor is so quiet. He is not very boisterous. And seemingly he\u2019s just average in all areas but then once he gets the ball in his hands and he\u2019s behind the line, the cuts that he sees are next level. One that comes to mind for me is at Indianapolis. I got short-necked on the edge, you know, and the lane was collapsing. Most backs, they see that, and they kind of abort the front-side read and they try to just cram it backside. He stuck it front side, he crammed it between me and the tackle and I swear to god the thing was about this big (holds up hands about 18 inches apart) and he got a 5-yard gain. There is a maturity there and an understanding to what we\u2019re trying to do in the run game that very few backs have. It takes a special guy. Obviously, he had the big run that game (57 yards). It was blocked really well. To me, it\u2019s that run I described to you, that\u2019s what makes Jordan special.\u201d Photos of all the touchdowns the Bears have scored this season. 6. Congratulations to former Bears linebacker Tim Shaw , whose book \u201cBlitz Your Life: Stories from an NFL and ALS Warrior\u201d is being released Tuesday. The book isn\u2019t about Shaw\u2019s life story going from setting a single-season prep rushing record in Michigan to Penn State and then to the NFL as one of the best special teams players in the league. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in April 2014 and he\u2019s seeking to share some life lessons he\u2019s picked up as he tackles the debilitating disease at full speed. He\u2019s traveling to Israel this coming Sunday to undergo stem-cell treatment and is planning to visit South Africa in March to check off a bucket list item by visiting Victoria Falls. Shaw was at Soldier Field when the Bears hosted the Titans in November and was made a consultant for lack of a better term by Tennessee coach Mike Mularkey this season. Shaw would complete scouting reports for the special teams unit and meet with the players on a regular basis. \u201cI always thought I would write a book,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked to write. But really I was waiting for that superstar moment or that championship win or that MVP situation, right? I thought, \u2018Man, I better be ready to have a book when that moment comes.\u2019 Really, I found myself in a situation where what I am going through is bigger than anything I ever could have imagined and no, it\u2019s not what I wanted, but it is an opportunity to impact lives. So for me that was the motivation, to reach as many people as I can with the message. \u201cThe book is about knowing who you are, embracing who you are and with that pursuing a life of purpose, becoming your best self and living a life that means something. That means eliminating the things that aren\u2019t important and emphasizing and focusing on the things that are the upmost importance.\u201d Shaw can still walk and while his speech his slowed, he\u2019s easy to understand. Those are obviously huge changes in his life and factors that are forcing him to adjust as he battles the disease. But the physical challenges are not the first things that he focuses on. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very obvious change in me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most obvious change I\u2019ve seen is my lack of time for things that are insignificant. Anything from complaining about something minute or even just wasting time. I just don\u2019t have any tolerance for it, the things that are just not of significance. I have made a big shift of everything I do, I want to matter. I want it to be something. I want it to be important. Also, embracing who I am. I have had to ask myself some really tough questions about who I am? What I am doing and why? It\u2019s forced me to say alright, \u2018Take away football. Take away money. Take away your body. Take away your voice. Who are you?\u2019 It is a really difficult question to ask yourself and I think when you do that, you have the freedom to be yourself and the freedom to improve and the freedom to be real with people. Those are huge, huge things that have changed in my life.\u201d ",

USC's sideline appeared out of it, but now is jumping up and down - getting the Trojans' fans\u00a0back into the game.

Ronald Jones II rushed for 13 yards in three carries and Justin Davis rushed for 10 yards in two carries.

Sam Darnold's pass was intended for Deontay Burnett, but fell incomplete. USC is slowly starting to unravel, unable to move the ball on offense and now they have false started twice in the punt formation. Darnold attempted three passes, all three fell incomplete. Darreus Rogers was able to draw pass interference on a play, about the only\u00a0highlight of the Trojans' offense so far in the third quarter. USC injury update: Cornerback Iman Marshall has been ruled out of the game because of vertigo.

    "text": "Season over for Bears: Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery & more on frustrating year Kevin White: 'Didn't think I would be out this year' Bears wide receiver Kevin White speaks on Jan. 2, 2017. (Rich Campbell/Chicago Tribune) Bears wide receiver Kevin White speaks on Jan. 2, 2017. (Rich Campbell/Chicago Tribune) Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A day after finishing a 3-13 season with a 28-point road loss to the Vikings , the Bears held their final team meetings at Halas Hall on Monday. Players then cleaned out their lockers and headed into the offseason, vowing to turn the page and vocalizing their hopes for a more successful 2017. Here are the biggest highlights from Monday\u2019s player interviews. Photos of the Chicago Bears' first-round draft pick in 2013. On his recovery from surgery to repair a broken right ankle I'm good. I have a good support system. First time really being out like this. Initially I was like, \u2018Ooh, I kind of like the break.' I don't have to hit anything. And then it\u2019s a week into it, and you\u2019re going stir crazy and you realize how important the team is to your health, mentally and emotionally. We have a great group of guys, regardless of record. The men in this room are guys that I love and that I really do enjoy playing with. And I\u2019m hoping this will be the same group of guys that can get it turned around. On a second layer to his recovery because of his upcoming shoulder surgery This is my first time with surgery, really or anything like anesthesia, so that sucked. I did not like that. Lost a bunch of weight (down to 280 pounds). Now I know this shoulder (surgery) will be a lot less invasive, and also it won\u2019t be something that I\u2019m walking on or trying to walk on. So being able to walk here in the next few weeks will be nice, and then to training and just trying to build the tank. On if the team can do anything to prevent such a rash of injuries in the future I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year. I\u2019m going to look like the Christmas Story kid. It\u2019ll be summer months, I\u2019ll be in like three North Face (jackets). But, yeah, honestly, it\u2019s football. It\u2019s a tortured existence from a physical standpoint. You\u2019re never going to be healthy. Nobody\u2019s healthy. Nobody\u2019s 100 percent. You show up to camp 100 percent \u2014 you do the conditioning test, you\u2019re at 98 percent, and then you try to hover in the 80s to 90s the whole year. So when you get guys who are getting dinged, guys who are on scooters, casts, surgical procedures, it takes a toll. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not able to be around as much as I\u2019d like to. A lot of those guys aren\u2019t able to be around as much as they\u2019d like to. But there\u2019s a plan in place to get healthy. And hopefully we\u2019ll get the better luck of the die next year. On what is his greatest source of optimism about the Bears' future I don\u2019t necessarily know if I would say it\u2019s the greatest source of optimism, but I just know what this city is like when the Bears win. And I had a taste of it my rookie year, and I sniffed the playoffs and we lost by a close margin there. I want to get back to that. I want to go to the playoffs. I want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. A frickin\u2019 playoff game in Chicago \u2014 can you imagine that? Right now I know it\u2019s not something that\u2019s realistic, being 3-13 and we\u2019re in the offseason. But these are things than when I lay my head on the pillow at night I think about and it keeps me up pretty late. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to get me through this process, because I know I\u2019ll be able to run out that tunnel again. Receiver Kevin White Photos of the Bears wide receiver Kevin White, the No. 7 overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. On missing most of his second season with a broken left leg after missing his entire rookie season with a stress fracture in the leg It\u2019s frustrating. Didn\u2019t think I would be out this year, obviously. Did everything I could in the offseason. Stayed here, trained, worked my butt off, did everything I thought I could. It\u2019s just unfortunate, but it\u2019s the name of the game. Just got to fight back and stay patient and mentally stay tough. On whether he\u2019s been given assurance that his left leg won\u2019t be a chronic problem for him to deal with Oh yeah. I\u2019ll be just fine. Just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back. After that, I\u2019ll be just fine. Receiver Alshon Jeffery Photos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. On whether he stood behind his assertion Sunday that the Bears would win the Super Bowl next season Damn right. On whether the Bears have enough talent and depth to join mentioned alongside the Patriots We\u2019re the Chicago Bears. We\u2019re just like them. The only difference is just a few plays here and there. We went to New England and practiced (in August). They know. If you were there and watched the practices, they know. Unfortunately, in New England they\u2019re doing a great job. I give them all the credit. Coach Belichick\u2019s is doing a great job and Tom Brady is a hell of a quarterback. Outside linebacker Leonard Floyd Photos of the Bears' first-round pick in 2016. On suffering his second concussion in a five-week span in Week 16 This time I had headaches, like a migraine every couple minutes. Then it has started going away and I\u2019m back to normal. \u2026 I\u2019m not worried about it. I know once I get my technique right, I\u2019ll be all right. Linebacker Jerrell Freeman Vikings 38, Bears 10: What's next for the Bears after a discouraging season? Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. See more videos On the uncertainty the team faces in the aftermath of a 3-13 season This is the NFL . Change is going to come. That's just what it is. You have to be ready for it, be able to roll with it and whatever happens, happens. You\u2019ve just got to roll with it. That's just part of the NFL. On how the Bears can get things rolling in the right direction when they reconvene in April for the team\u2019s offseason strength and conditioning program Go to work. Yeah. That\u2019s the only way you can do this man. You can\u2019t go buy it at a store. Ya know? You can\u2019t. So you just have to go out there and go to work man. You have to have everybody on the same page and let\u2019s go. Photos of Bears quarterback Matt Barkley. On determining where he will play next season That\u2019ll come with time. But I definitely want to be here, definitely want to be with this staff, these players. There\u2019s definitely something special brewing here. Hopefully I can be a part of that. On what he learned during his opportunity to start I think the more looks you can see on defense, the more ingrained in your head certain plays become. The more you get within an offense, the more that terminology \u2014 those words \u2014 come in your head. I think just the fact that I can play. I can hang in this league. I did a lot of great things. ",

    "text": "'Bathroom Bill' Fight Brewing In Texas 'Bathroom Bill' Fight Brewing In Texas Embed Embed The dome of the Texas State Capital. Eric Gay/AP hide caption toggle caption The dome of the Texas State Capital. Eric Gay/AP Texas could soon follow in the footsteps of Indiana and North Carolina and pass its own \"bathroom bill\" in the upcoming legislative session. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has made passage of such a bill, which could require transgender Texans to use the restroom which corresponds to the gender on their birth certificate, a priority. The proposal threatens to split the Texas Republican Party, which controls all three branches of government in Austin. Proponents include the lieutenant governor and the Senate he leads, while the Texas House of Representatives is more sympathetic to the state's business community. The politically powerful chamber of commerce and the Texas Association of Business both strongly oppose any bathroom bill. North Carolina's bathroom bill nullified legislation passed by the city of Charlotte that expanded protections to LGBT North Carolinians. The state's bathroom bill also prohibited transgender people from using public restrooms that align with their gender identity. It provoked a widespread backlash from businesses, entertainers, sports organizations and the movie industry. The NBA pulled its All-Star Game out of North Carolina, the NCAA moved March Madness regional games out of the state, and PayPal and Deutsche Bank suspended planned expansions there. Forbes estimated that North Carolina lost more than $600 million in the six months after Gov. Pat McCrory signed the legislation into a law. McCrory was subsequently defeated in his bid for re-election in November by Democrat Roy Cooper, who made the bathroom bill a cornerstone of his campaign. Article continues after sponsorship None of these economic and political ramifications have deterred the Texas lieutenant governor. In fact, when the North Carolina legislature failed an attempt to reverse itself and pass legislation that would have nullified its bathroom bill just before Christmas, Patrick sent a note applauding the collapse of the effort. \"Legislation to protect women's privacy and business is essential to assure that sexual predators ... will not be able to freely enter women's restrooms, locker rooms or showers ... \" Patrick's note said. However, many of the Texas GOP's most lucrative donors have indicated they're going to the mat to stop bathroom legislation from passing in Texas. The Texas Association of Business held a press conference last month to announce results of a study, commissioned by the TAB and conducted by researchers at St. Edwards University in Austin, which estimated a Lone Star bathroom bill could cost the state upwards of $8 billion in economic impact and 100,000 jobs. \"The message from the Texas business community is loud and clear,\" Chris Wallace, president of the TAB, said in front of the Texas Capitol. \"Protecting Texas from billions of dollars in losses is simple: Don't pass unnecessary laws that discriminate against Texans and our visitors.\" While Texas's lieutenant governor is hot for a bathroom bill, his counterpart in the Texas House, Speaker Joe Strauss, is not \"This isn't the most urgent concern of mine,\" Strauss said. Strauss is expected to be the business community's political backstop, and he's got the clout in the House to ensure that any bathroom legislation languishes and dies in committee. Not only would that please many influential donors, it would spare Republican House members from having to make a politically tricky vote. And where is Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on the subject? He's currently sitting atop the fence. Abbott says a wait-and-see approach is prudent until an actual bill is produced and the details \u2014 and political and economic ramifications \u2014 can be carefully scrutinized. ",

The fire department said the case appears to be an \"accidental poisoning with no criminal intent.\" The victims were found after the fire department responded to a medical call around 5 a.m. today, the fire department said. Besides the four fatalities, several people were hospitalized, the fire department said. Family members told the fire department the pesticide contained the chemical aluminum phosphide, officials said. \"At some point, a family member tried washing the chemical from underneath the house with water,\" the fire department said. \"When this chemical comes in contact with water, it creates Phosphine gas, which is highly poisonous and can cause pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.\" The fire department said it's unclear how long the family was exposed. 0 Shares ",

Steph Solis , USA TODAY 7:03 p.m. EST January 2, 2017 521 Shares President-elect Donald Trump responded to North Korea's latest nuclear threat delivered in a New Year's Day speech. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) North Korea kicked off 2017 with Kim Jong Un suggesting the country is nearly ready to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. But President-elect Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem convinced, saying \u201cit won\u2019t happen.\u201d North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Trump responded to Kim's annual New Year's address on Sunday, in which he said that plans for launching a missile have\u00a0\u201creached the final stage,\" though he did not explicitly say it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. The test would come a year after\u00a0testing what the North claims was its first hydrogen bomb. During his speech, Kim said he would bolster his country's military capabilities unless the U.S. stopped\u00a0war games with South Korea. He stopped short of threatening a war with the South, arguing that the country had to avoid another Korean war. Instead, he said, the country should focus on building its economy under a five-year plan announced in May. South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said in a statement that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Kim\u2019s threat to proceed with a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile and strengthen North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapon capabilities. Trump has said in the past that he would work with China to \u201cclose down\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, but that strategy may have changed. During the general election he said it was up to China to deal with the threat North Korea posed in the region. China, North Korea's biggest ally, signed on to international sanctions imposed by the\u00a0United Nations Security Council\u00a0in response to\u00a0North\u00a0Korea's nuclear weapons tests, but one expert told USA TODAY it could walk away from them. Trump followed up with a swipe at China and its relationship with North Korea. China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! \u2014 Donald J.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Top House Democrats gave more clues Monday about how they\u2019ll fight GOP efforts to repeal ObamaCare, sharing enrollment figures and stories about Americans saved by the health care law, ahead of President Obama\u2019s visit Wednesday. Obama makes the trip to Capitol Hill in his final weeks of office and as the Republican-controlled Congress plans to start repealing ObamaCare the day GOP President-elect Donald Trump takes office. \u201cWhatever the circumstance, health wise you are financially better off\u201d with ObamaCare, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Monday on a conference call with reporters. She was joined on the call by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and other top Democrats on key committees to tout ObamaCare\u2019s successes in reducing Americans\u2019 health costs and increasing their access to better care -- while sending warning shots about the perils of dismantling the 2010 law. Pelosi and Hoyer argued that at least 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance, in part subsidized by the federal government, and chided Republicans for having no immediate plan to replace the law, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnderstand, repeal and delay is an act of cowardice,\u201d said Pelosi, D-Calif. Said Hoyer: \u201cRepublicans\u2019 repeal and delay plan is code for repeal without an alternative. \u2026 The truth is they have no alternative to replace it. \u2026 Their plan is to turn back the clock, make Americans unhealthy again, perhaps.\u201d In a sign of things to come, the lawmakers talked about Americans who were financially saved by ObamaCare, include a man who developed heart problems upon starting his own business and a woman who needed the insurance while helping put her husband through college. Obama will hold a closed-door meeting with congressional Democrats about his signature plan, created to lower health care costs for all Americans by trying to cut down on emergency care and other uninsured medical expenses. However, insurance premiums continue to increase for many on ObamaCare, in large part the result of fewer-than-expected healthy people enrolling and insurance companies dropping out. Pelosi spoke by phone last week with fellow House Democrats about plans to defend ObamaCare and raised concerns about Republicans\u2019 plans to change entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. She encouraged members to hold events to talk with voters about the kind of statistics and anecdotes discussed Monday. Also on Wednesday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence will rally with House Republicans about their plans to dismantle ObamaCare, a GOP leadership aide told Fox News on Monday. With Trump coming in as president, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to begin the repeal effort this week through a process known as budget reconciliation. Democrats now have little chance of stopping the process with Obama heading out of office. But Republicans, after years of putting repeal legislation on Obama\u2019s desk, must now come up with a better, substitute plan. They acknowledge needing two to perhaps four years to complete the process. Trump and fellow Republicans say they want to keep the good parts of ObamaCare, like allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 plan. But Democrats are already warning about potential chaos in the health care system if the law is repealed and not immediately replaced. Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and Joseph Weber contributed to this report. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Mike Emanuel currently serves as chief congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined FNC in 1997 as a Los Angeles-based correspondent. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare , that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved \u2014 the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. \u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. \u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201d The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats \u2014 including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, President-elect Trump\u2019s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he\u2019s sworn in,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating middle-class families and the economy.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many business-related, that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. \u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201d In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster . But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him \u2014 want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party\u2019s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. \u201cThis is no time for hubris,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou have to perform.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline:  G.O.P.

GALLAGHER Jan 2, 2017, 12:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH 12 Killings in Chicago Over Christmas Weekend 0 Shares Email A long and violent year in Chicago ended with 762 homicides, police say. That's more than twice the number in New York City, where police said 335 were killed. Last year marked Chicago's worst homicide rate in two decades, according to The Associated Press. The deceased were among 4,331 shooting victims during the year, accounting for 17.5 percent. The stories of violence are unrelenting: Nykea Aldridge, a mother of four, was shot dead in August after being caught in crossfire while pushing her baby in a stroller on Chicago's South Side. In November, the 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis , D-Ill., was shot dead over a pair of gym shoes. 'Spiraling Out of Control' ABC News contributor John Cohen, a law enforcement and homeland security expert whose roles have included counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, described the violence in Chicago as \"spiraling out of control.\" Beyond Chicago, he said, \u201ca growing number of major cities are receiving a significant increase in robberies, homicides and aggravated assaults.\u201d He cited three factors he believes may be behind the uptick in violence: 1. An increase in gang activity and violent behavior by career criminals. 2. An increase in the availability of illegal guns, coupled with an increase in criminals' willingness to use them. 3. And an increase in the reluctance by law enforcement to engage in proactive, violence prevention policies. Such hesitancy, Cohen said, is because \"officers of various ranks are worried they will respond to a split-second decision and end up being the next person blasted all over the media and will lose their job.\" Officers respond to their calls for service and do what they can, Cohen said, but they are \"hesitant to be proactive\" and \"target violent criminals.\" Criminals sense any hesitancy, Cohen said, and believe they are less likely to be stopped. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told the AP recently that officers have become more careful, partly because they're concerned about viral videos. Johnson added at a news conference last week that police officers are not the reason for the heightened violence in Chicago; he said over 8,000 guns were recovered in 2016 and all those encounters put cops at risk. Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images A member of the Chicago Police Department collects bullet casings at the scene of a shooting near the intersection of South Morgan Street and West 97th Street in Chicago on July 3, 2016. How Violence in Chicago Compares to Other Cities 'Empowered' Gang Members There is no simple explanation for why the violence is so extreme, Johnson told reporters last week, but he pointed to the prevalence of gang activity. He also noted that the \"the anti-police rhetoric\" in Chicago and across the country \"has emboldened and actually empowered these gang members to do what they do.\" Gang members may believe community residents will take their side instead of the police's, he added. Johnson said the violence in Chicago is mostly on the city's south and west sides, in areas with a history of gang conflicts. Of the 12 killings in Chicago over Christmas weekend, he said, 90 percent of the victims had gang affiliations, criminal histories and were pre-identified by the department's \"strategic subject algorithm\" as being a potential offender or victim of gun violence. The majority of the 27 shootings Christmas weekend were \"targeted attacks\" by gangs against potential rival gang members at holiday gatherings, Johnson said. Cohen, the ABC News contributor, said the concentration of violence in specific neighborhoods can be explained by social issues, like a lack of education or employment, which he said can create a feeling of hopelessness for young people and may contribute to why they gravitate toward the violent gang lifestyle. Gangs not only provide income, Cohen said, but give young people a familial connection and sense of protection. \"If we don't get a handle on this problem,\" Cohen said, \"law enforcement officials that I've been speaking to are saying ... we'll see continuing increases.\" Scott Olson/Getty Images Police investigate the scene of a quadruple homicide on the city's Southside, Dec. 17, 2016 in Chicago. Targeting Gang Violence Cohen suggested several steps for Chicago to get a handle on the gang violence: First, he said, the police must identify and aggressively target violent gang members and other violent repeat offenders. \"The overwhelming majority of violent crime is committed by people who have engaged in violent criminal activity,\" he said. Second, police \"have to work to prevent illegal guns from getting into the hands of people who cannot legally possess them,\" Cohen said. \"There's nobody on either side of the gun-control issue who thinks career repeat offenders ... should be able to possess a gun,\" he said. \"And there are policing strategies that are directly focused on preventing stolen weapons from falling into the hands of violent gang members and repeat violent offenders. \"Third, you have to address the underlying issues,\" Cohen said. Citing Los Angeles\u2019 efforts in the 1980s and early-1990s, Cohen said that city successfully worked to address underlying issues in neighborhoods that contributed to a sense of hopelessness. As in Chicago now, L.A. crime then was spiraling out of control, driven by violent gang activity, he said. First, L.A. police initiated dramatic uniformed and undercover police presences; Cohen said he and other law enforcement officers zeroed in on South Central Los Angeles communities to find the most violent, repeat offenders and target them with federal prosecution. Also, authorities in L.A. worked with local government and community groups to address some of the underlying issues, like poor education opportunities, Cohen added. The aggressive enforcement, coupled with addressing the underlying issues, brought significant decreases in gang activity, and violent crime more broadly, in South Central Los Angeles, he said. Without addressing the underlying issues, Cohen said, \"there will be a revolving door\" of people who will engage in violent behavior. Joshua Lott/Getty Images Sheila Jones looks to the sky during a vigil for her daughter who was killed as she walked through her apartment complex July 27, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. The Community-Police Relationship Cohen also cited trust between communities and police as something that\u2019s missing nowadays in cities including Chicago, where he said law enforcement officers need to engage proactively with residents, understand what's important to communities and work with them. Cohen complimented New York City's police officers, saying they go to community meetings and ask what issues are important to the community, which \"changes the dynamic\" of the conversation. In return, people are willing to talk to officers about problems, he said, which creates personal relationships. A Call for Legislative Change Johnson, the Chicago police superintendent who called the level of violence in his city \"unacceptable,\" is pushing for a legislative change to help curb the \"reckless gun culture\" in Chicago. Johnson said he hopes a new law will give judges autonomy to sentence repeat gun offenders to the middle- or high-end of the range, because he says repeat offenders are not willing to \"play by society's rules.\" \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that we hold repeat gun offenders accountable for their actions,\" he told reporters Dec. 26, adding that the city must change the narrative so offenders don\u2019t want to pick up a gun. Johnson hopes the legislation will give cops \"a fighting chance\" to hold offenders accountable to begin to change the narrative in the city. \"We all have a vested interest in reducing this gun violence,\" he said. \"It's not OK and it's not normal. When I go home and my neighbors see me, they are constantly asking what can we do to reduce this gun violence? \"We know that the long-term solutions [are] to invest in these impoverished areas, provide more jobs, better education,\" Johnson said, adding, \"The urgent solution right now is for state legislatures to help us with this gun bill. \"If you pick up a gun and shoot somebody you should go to prison, period,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t get a pass from me.\" 0 Shares ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Ed O'Keefe January 1 Follow @edatpost Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) boards an elevator after speaking to reporters at Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 17. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Democratic senators plan to aggressively target eight of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees in the coming weeks and are pushing to stretch their confirmation votes into March \u2014 an unprecedented break with Senate tradition. Such delays would upend Republican hopes of quickly holding hearings and confirming most of Trump\u2019s top picks on Inauguration Day. But Democrats, hamstrung by their minority status, are determined to slow-walk Trump\u2019s picks unless they start disclosing reams of personal financial data they\u2019ve withheld so far, according to senior aides. Despite early vows to cooperate with Trump and his new government, Democrats have been troubled by a lack of personal disclosure by Cabinet choices that they say mirrors Trump\u2019s refusal to disclose personal tax information during the presidential campaign. Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s pick to serve as secretary of state, angered Democrats when he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he stood ready to provide only \u201ctax return information\u201d for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means it\u2019s possible Tillerson isn\u2019t willing to provide complete tax returns \u2014 a break with past nominees. Other Trump nominees have just barely begun the process of undergoing required ethics reviews. President-elect Trump is nominating Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. The Washington Post's Anne Gearan explains what Tillerson brings to the table and why Congress could still reject him. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) A majority of Americans opposed Trump\u2019s refusal to disclose tax returns during the campaign, and Democrats believe they can revive the issue this year by casting congressional Republicans as supporting Trump\u2019s penchant for secrecy. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Trump of trying to seat a \u201crigged Cabinet\u201d of nominees who \u201chave made billions off the industries they\u2019d be tasked with regulating.\u201d \u201cAny attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist,\u201d Schumer added in a statement to The Washington Post confirming his caucus\u2019s plans. \u201cIf Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d Schumer has told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that Democrats will home in especially on Tillerson; Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), his pick for attorney general; Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget; and Betsy DeVos, selected to serve as education secretary. There\u2019s also Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and oversee changes to Obamacare, who is expected to be attacked by Democrats for his support for privatizing Medicare. Andrew Puzder, a restaurant executive set to serve as labor secretary, will face scrutiny for past comments on the minimum wage, among other policies. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner set to serve as treasury secretary, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, will also be the focus of Democratic attacks, aides said. President-elect Donald Trump is nominating fast-food executive Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik,Danielle Kunitz,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) Absent from the Democratic hit list are retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whom Trump has nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations; and John Kelly, a former Marine general and Trump\u2019s selection to lead the Department of Homeland Security, signaling that all three should expect little trouble from Democrats. Senate confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin next week, when the Judiciary Committee is set to hold two days of hearings with Sessions, and the Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a one-day, two-part hearing with Tillerson. But Schumer has told McConnell that he wants at least two days of hearings for each of these eight nominees, including at least one panel made up of witnesses that can speak to the pick\u2019s past record, aides said. At each hearing, members of the committee would get at least 10 minutes to ask questions, with no limits on multiple rounds of questioning, if requested. Democrats also want hearings for each of these eight nominees to be held on separate weeks, with no more than two Cabinet picks sitting for a hearing in the same week. That would mean that Tillerson\u2019s and Mattis\u2019s hearings could happen in the same week, but not the hearings for Price and Mulvaney, aides said. That\u2019s already not set to happen and Republicans have scoffed at Schumer\u2019s proposal, noting that the New York senator went along in 2009 when the Senate unanimously confirmed seven of President Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees on Inauguration Day and five more later that week. \u201cIt\u2019s curious that they\u2019d [Democrats] object to treating the incoming president\u2019s nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness with which the Senate acted on President Obama\u2019s nominees,\u201d Antonia Ferrier, a McConnell spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cOur committees and chairmen are fully capable of reviewing the incoming Cabinet nominations with the same rules and procedures as the same committees did with President Obama\u2019s nominations.\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). (Gareth Smit for The Washington Post) The \u201cunprecedented\u201d personal wealth of Trump\u2019s nominees warrants the delays, one senior Democratic aide said. One other potential stumbling block: Nominees are required to obtain certification from the Office of Government Ethics before a confirmation vote, something most Obama-era picks had achieved before their confirmation hearings. So far, Democrats say, most Trump picks haven\u2019t done so. \u201cIf they want to get confirmed by Inauguration Day, that timeline doesn\u2019t work,\u201d the aide said. \u201cObviously if you\u2019re worth billions, it takes a lot longer.\u201d powerpost ",

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Construction continues on the stands on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in preparation for the inaugural parade on Jan. 20. Alex Brandon/AP The organizers of President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural parade released a list of the groups who have accepted invitations to perform. Included on the list of 40 groups was the marching band from Alabama's oldest private, historically black liberal arts college, Talladega College. While officials from the college have not yet addressed the performance publicly, the band's expected participation has sparked debate on social media websites. (NPR's calls and messages to Talladega and to the chairman of the college's board went unanswered.) One user on bandhead.org wrote, \"It's a Presidential Inauguration, a high profile event. It's a great experience for the band.\" Another posted, \"All exposure isn't good exposure.\" Talladega's participation comes after other marching bands, including the band from Howard, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., did not apply to perform. Washington, D.C., high school bands are also not participating. Though Howard's band director John Newson told NBC4 that Howard's \"band had too few members and was facing budgetary constraints,\" he implied other considerations may have contributed to the decision. NBC4 reported : [Newson] said he suspects that many band directors' and school administrators' political beliefs played into whether they applied to participate in the parade. \"I think everybody knows why and no one wants to say and lose their job,\" Newson said. Article continues after sponsorship Nikky Finney, who graduated from Talladega in 1979 and is now a poet and chair in creative writing and southern studies at the University of South Carolina, condemned the band's participation in the inaugural parade. She said: The news that Talladega College has forgotten its steady and proud 150 years of history, by making the decision to not stand in solidarity with other clear-eyed and courageous people, academic institutions, and organizations, protesting the inauguration of one of the most antagonistic, hatred-spewing, unrepentant racists, has simply and unequivocally broken my heart today. Historical Black colleges are duty bound to have and keep a moral center and be of great moral consciousness while also teaching its students lessons about life that they will need going forward, mainly, that just because a billionaire \u2014 who cares nothing about their 150 years of American existence \u2014 invites them to a fancy, gold-plated, dress-up party, they have the moral right and responsibility to say \"no thank you,\" especially when the blood, sweat, and tears and bodies, of black, brown, and native people are stuffed in the envelope alongside the RSVP. This should have been a teachable moment for the President of Talladega College instead it has become a moment of divisiveness and shame. Bags of money and the promise of opportunity have always been waved in front of the faces and lives of struggling human beings, who have historically been relegated to the first-fired and the last-hired slots of life. It has been used to separate us before. It has now been used to separate us again. Other performers, including Elton John and Celine Dion, have turned down invitations to participate in inauguration ceremonies as well. Several others have said they wouldn't perfom either. The BBC reported that Grammy-winner John Legend said, \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate. We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\" On Monday, British singer Rebecca Ferguson said she was invited to sing at the inauguration. She said she would accept if she could sing \"Stange Fruit,\" the lyrics of which describe the lynchings of black people in the the U.S. Originally a poem written by Abel Meeropol, the protest song includes the line: \"Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.\" NPR's email to to the Presidential Inaugural Committee has not yet been returned.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were helping search for David Puckett on Monday by going door-to-door within 2.5 miles of his home. Bloodhounds are also searching for him.\u00a0 Police say foul play isn\u2019t suspected, but they\u2019ve asked for help to find David as quickly as possible partly because of coming cold weather. His mother says he was only wearing a light jacket. On Sunday night, she issued a tearful appeal for people to help find him. Previous searches aided by a bloodhound and a helicopter didn\u2019t turn up any clues. Puckett, a student at Dartmouth Elementary School, has a slight learning disability. He wandered off from school once, and police are investigating this case under the assumption that he wandered off from home, CBS Denver reported.\u00a0 On Monday afternoon, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert in the case, something that was delayed initially part because there was no immediate evidence that there was an abduction. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously very concerned. We\u2019re all cold standing here bundled up, so the weather and the amount of time is increasingly concerning to us and that is why the CBI has issued this Amber Alert for us today,\u201d Aurora police spokeswoman Crystal McCoy said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
