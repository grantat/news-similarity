    "text": "Los Angeles Times staff While the great majority of the marchers were female, men turned out in considerable numbers as well. Jacob Osterman, 24, traveled from Boston with a group of friends to take part. \u201cI love and care about the women in my life, and this is a way to show that,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen are part of humanity, like all of us. How can anyone not understand that?\u201d Bits of overheard conversation reflected long journeys: \u201c\u2026 at 3 a.m. yesterday, no, wait, it was the day before \u2026\u201d or \u201c\u2026 and that was before we even got on the road!\u201d Creature comforts were hard to come by. Long lines stretched out of coffee shops and fast-food joints close to the gathering point on the National Mall. One woman asked her friend, only half jokingly, \u201cAre we going to have to rent a room to get a bathroom?\u201d\u00a0 The atmosphere was simultaneously lighthearted \u2014\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m wearing my pink hat, so of course you\u2019ll be able to find me!\u201d one woman joked to her companion \u2014\u00a0and somber, as many pondered what lay ahead. \u201cPeople are really frightened about losing their health insurance,\u201d said Gretchen Stanford, from Alexandria, Va., just across the river from the District of Columbia.\u00a0\u201cAnd frightened about lots of other things.\u201d A contingent of young women and girls in hijabs waved to passers-by as they headed to the rally site, making their way under a highway overpass. Fifteen-year-old Rudy, wearing a white headscarf, was too shy to give her full name, but said with a smile: \u201cI want to be seen.\u201d The turnout for the march was a show of force that gave signs of exceeding the attendance of the presidential inauguration a day earlier. Washington Metro trains that had been lightly used Friday were jammed so full of protesters with signs and pink hats on Saturday that crowds on platforms had to wait for more trains. Outside the Capitol building, a constant stream of thousands of cheering women emerging from Metro stops headed for the march\u2019s starting location. Actress America Ferrera got the rally off to a rousing start, invoking her birth in Los Angeles to Honduran parents. \u201cIt\u2019s been a heart-rending time to be both a woman and an immigrant. Our dignity, our character, our rights have been under attack,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cBut the president is not America. We are America.\u201d Gloria Steinem, a grande dame of the feminist movement, scorned the notion of male patriarchy, declaring, \u201cNo more asking Daddy!\u201d Actress Scarlett Johansson , for her part, mounted a passionate defense of Planned Parenthood, threatened with de-funding under the new administration. Headline performers in Washington included Janelle Monae, Samantha Ronson, the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin Carpenter.\u00a0 Many of the marchers were non-celebrities who simply said they wanted to share a moment of history. Michelle Pierson of Van Nuys and Nicole Myers of Woodland Hills talked their husbands into caring for their respective children so the two women could spend the week protesting in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWe had to do something to deal with our frustration, our sadness, our rage,\u201d\u00a0said Pierson, 38, a stay-at-home mom. Myers added that she had a 10-year-old son. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think someone could speak like that and be president,\u201d\u00a0said the 40-year-old, who owns a picture-framing shop. Some marchers said they were worried about scenes of unrest associated with inaugural commemorations Friday. Small groups smashed windows and set fires to protest against Trump, and there were some tense Inauguration Day exchanges between Trump backers and opponents. \u201cWhatever happens, we have to keep it peaceful,\u201d said Leahn Murray, a 33-year-old emergency medical technician from Buffalo, N.Y., who was stenciling a sign reading \u201cResistance Is Built On Hope.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t use violence to make our point,\u201d she said,\u00a0\u201cbecause the whole point is that people need to be safe.\u201d Caption Recap: Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0Several hundred thousand people from across the country descended on Washington Saturday to protest Donald Trump just hours into his presidency, donning bright pink hats and carrying a dizzying array of political signs \u2013 in a celebrity-studded march that put the nation\u2019s lingering divisions on full display despite the 45th president\u2019s appeal a day earlier for unity. The protesters, most of whom were women, were largely peaceful by comparison with the scattered bands of rioters who wreaked havoc on parts of D.C. during Friday\u2019s inauguration. This crowd was far larger and more organized. But the march grew more chaotic as the day went on and protesters moved from the National Mall into the streets. And despite indications from some organizers last week that the demonstration was not defined as \u201canti-Trump,\u201d it was in every respect a march against the new president -- kicking off as he attended a National Prayer Service after waking up in the White House for the first time. \u201cA platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday,\u201d actress America\u00a0Ferrera told the crowd Saturday morning on the National Mall. \u201cBut the president is not America. We are America.\u201d Other celebrities including Madonna and Michael Moore stirred up the crowd, with Madonna making perhaps the most inflammatory comments.\u00a0In profanity-laced remarks, the singer said she had \u201cthought an awful lot about blowing up the White House\u201d but knows \u201cthis won\u2019t change anything.\u201d\u00a0 While called the Women's March on Washington, the protest attracted families of men, women and children mostly sporting pro-women and anti-Trump messages.\u00a0Hundreds of \u201csister marches\u201d were held in other cities across the U.S. and internationally.\u00a0 \u201cOf course this is an anti-Trump march,\u201d a local ambassador for the D.C. march, who declined to give his name, said as he directed the crowds toward the rally. \u201cSure, of course it\u2019s for rights, but it\u2019s really against Trump.\u201d Another protester called Trump a \u201cterrible president,\u201d though he has only had the keys to the Oval Office for one day.\u00a0 SLIDESHOW : WOMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON In his inaugural address Friday, Trump spoke in stark terms about America's problems but also called for a \"new national pride\" to heal divisions. Saturday's march showed protesters united -- only in opposition to the new president, on the grounds where just 24 hours earlier, Trump supporters cheered their candidate\u2019s ascension to power.\u00a0 Women wearing \u201cpussy-hats\u201d -- hand-knit pointy-eared pink winter headgear -- held posters with derogatory messages and phrases bashing the president and filled the National Mall.\u00a0 Officials estimated a crowd of 500,000 people, which is more than double what march organizers had predicted. One D.C. official told the Associated Press that the massive turnout also forced organizers to revise plans to march on the White House, and instead head to the nearby ellipse.\u00a0 Children at times held political messages alongside their parents. One family pushed their toddler son through the crowds in a stroller, wearing a sign that read \u201cWho will have a bigger tantrum? Trump or me?\u201d The signs touched on a range of other issues, including statements against controversial oil pipelines, drone warfare, voter ID laws and more. The march, while mostly peaceful, did see isolated incidents, with some women vandalizing portable restrooms designated for the inauguration ceremonies by bashing the locks off with bricks, and some screaming in the faces of a group of people holding signs with Christian messages. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not here against Trump, but we\u2019re not here for him either,\u201d one of the sign-holders said. \u201cWe just want to share that God demonstrated his love towards everyone, regardless of what you believe in.\u201d March organizers also had uninvited the group \u201cNew Wave Feminists,\u201d which initially co-sponsored the event, after finding out that the group held a pro-life stance. \u201cIt\u2019s a very specific type of diversity, which does not include everyone,\u201d Founder and President of New Wave Feminists Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Saturday morning. She said despite the lack of invitation, her group still planned to march. \u201cAny time women come together, exciting things happen \u2013 so we definitely wanted to be there with the pro-life contingent.\u201d The movement spread far beyond Washington, as more than 600 \u201csister marches\u201d were planned spanning as far abroad as Myanmar and Australia. In Prague, hundreds gathered in freezing weather; in Copenhagen and Sydney, thousands marched. The D.C. march attracted celebrity participants who took a lead role in pumping up the crowd -- like Ashley Judd, who spoke at a\u00a0morning rally, and Ferrera, who led the artist contingent scheduling appearances and performances from singers Cher and Katy Perry, comedian Amy Schumer, and actresses Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Debra Messing and Patricia Arquette.\u00a0 A day after the inaugural ceremonies, though, Trump supporters were still in town and keeping a presence. Overlooking the National Mall on Saturday were members of the pro-Trump group Bikers for Trump. \u201cI admire a group of like-minded people coming together to march and to demonstrate,\u201d founder Chris Cox said. \u201cBut there are a lot of children out there and a lot of the signs are certainly inappropriate \u2013 I think maybe they should be a little more sensitive to some of their members.\u201d Cox said his group, whose message is to support Trump\u2019s agenda regarding Islamic extremism, support for veterans, and illegal immigration, had several speakers scheduled, but was running late due to the congestion from the Women\u2019s March. The list included bishops and two women whose children were killed by illegal immigrants. Cox condemned the violence that broke out a day earlier. \u201cThey say one thing, and preach and act on another and we don\u2019t condone violence,\u201d Cox told said of his group. \u201cWe\u2019re the blue-collar, working guy, and we have a lot to lose \u2013 we\u2019re not looking for a fight, but hey, we\u2019re not ones to back down from one either.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "A century of women marching on the Mall How the Women\u2019s March compares to other women-led rallies on the Mall May 2000 Comments The Women\u2019s March on Washington drew an estimated crowd of 500,000 to the Mall. The event is the latest in a tradition of civil dissent on the Mall, where women have organized rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues for over a century. Crowd size is one way to measure event impact, but crowd estimates are difficult to pin down and can vary widely. Usually, organizer estimates will be larger, while National Park Service and police estimates are smaller. (The National Park Service stopped issuing event estimates in 1995 after controversy surrounding its numbers.) Here we compare ten notable women\u2019s marches since 1913 using the best estimates available. Estimated attendance color key: 1,000 Media estimate 5,000 Historical estimate The day before President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration, around 5,000 women marched on Washington for women\u2019s suffrage. These suffragists were mocked, tripped and even violently attacked by bystanders. But the attacks didn\u2019t stop them from continuing to march. The event would go on to inspire many more marches over the next few years. There were divisions within the movement, though. African American women, including renowned activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, were asked to march in a separate section from their states\u2019 white delegations. Wells-Barnett was among those who refused to oblige. Suffragists march along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the U.S. Capitol in 1913. (Bain Collection/Library of Congress) January 15, 1968 Organizer(s): Jeannette Rankin; various women's groups Issue(s): Vietnam War Estimated attendance: 5,000 Historical estimate In 1968, 87-year-old Jeannette Rankin led a coalition of women\u2019s groups in a protest against the Vietnam War. Rankin was the first women elected to Congress in 1916 and was a fierce advocate for pacifism, women\u2019s rights and social welfare. The 1968 protest was named in her honor. Members of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade hold a banner protesting the Vietnam War. (AP Photo) August 26, 1970 Women\u2019s Strike for Equality Organizer(s): Betty Friedan; National Organization for Women (NOW) Issue(s): Women\u2019s rights Estimated attendance: 1,000 Media estimate Officially sponsored by the National Organization for Women (NOW), the Women\u2019s Strike for Equality was a nationwide protest with marches in multiples cities. The strike focused on women\u2019s rights, including workplace equality and reproductive rights. Betty Friedan, author of \u201cThe Feminine Mystique,\u201d helped plan the protest. The event took place on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the 19th Amendment, which granted women\u2019s suffrage. Protesters march down Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street in New York City, one of the cities where the Women\u2019s Strike for Equality took place.

Wade legalized abortion nationally, pro-life activists participated in the first March for Life to protest the Supreme Court decision. Since then, the rally has been held annually on or around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade in late Jan. The event has grown throughout the years. The first march drew a few thousand protestors, while more recent marches have seen consistent crowds estimated to be in the tens to hundreds of thousands.

White) July 9, 1978 March for the Equal Rights Amendment Organizer(s): NOW Issue(s): Women\u2019s rights; Equal Rights Amendment Estimated attendance: 100,000 Media The ultimately doomed Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 in an attempt to guarantee equal rights for women. It was passed by Congress in 1973 but still required ratification by two-thirds of the states within a seven-year time limit. Conservative activists such as Phyllis Schlafly, a lawyer who argued that the ERA would upend traditional gender roles, began a concerted campaign against the amendment. Less than a year before the seven-year ratification time limit, the NOW organized the March for the Equal Rights Amendment to persuade legislators to extend the deadline beyond March 29, 1979. Congress did approve an extension of the time limit to 1982. No other states ratified the amendment, however. In the end, 35 total states ratified the ERA \u2014 three short of the 38 required for the proposed amendment to become law. To this day, there is still no constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women. Leading supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment march in Washington.

(AP Photo/Dennis Cook) October 11, 1987 Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights Organizer(s): Various LGBT groups, leaders and activists Issue(s): LGBT rights; AIDS research and education Estimated attendance: 200,000 U.S. Park Police estimate 300,000 Organizer The first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights took place in 1979. Its initial planning was plagued by infighting, but the march\u2019s ultimate success paved the way for this second march. For the second march, organizers, leaders and activists joined together at a National Planning Conference in 1986. A steering committee was put in place, with delegates mandating 25 percent people of color and 50 percent women. The rising awareness of gay people of color and the AIDS epidemic also heavily influenced the planning process and became prominent themes during the protest. Participants of the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights carry a banner as they parade in front of the White House.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 21, 2017 6:22 PM EST WASHINGTON -- Wearing pink, pointy-eared \u201cpussyhats\u201d to mock the new president , hundreds of thousands of women massed in the nation\u2019s capital and cities around the globe Saturday to send Donald Trump an emphatic message that they won\u2019t let his agenda go unchallenged over the next four years. As night fell on the East Coast, thousands of protesters from the Women\u2019s March on Washington were still marching through the city\u2019s streets in opposition to President Donald Trump. Police officers stationed near the Ellipse south of the White House are chatting and joking with protesters. Some protesters chanted, \u201cWelcome to your first day, we will never go away.\u201d Others were chanting about democracy and women\u2019s rights, or holding protest signs. Many of the protesters were waiting out a logjam of people trying to exit the area. Transportation officials had earlier warned there would be delays as the hundreds of thousands of protesters tried to take public transportation out of the city after the march formally ended.\u00a0 America Ferrera speaks at Women's March on Washington Transportation officials in Washington say Saturday is already the fifth busiest Saturday in the subway system\u2019s history.\u00a0 By 4 p.m. Saturday, Metro tweeted that it has recorded more than 597,000 trips on the system and seen heavy crowds entering at all downtown stations. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel says the system usually sees about 620,000 trips on a normal weekday and it\u2019s many times busier than a usual Saturday. Stessel says the ridership numbers are on track to ultimately top the system\u2019s busiest Saturday of all time, the day of the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear hosted by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert in 2010. More than 825,000 trips were taken that day.\u00a0 The women brandished signs with messages such as \u201cWomen won\u2019t back down\u201d and \u201cLess fear more love\u201d and decried Mr. Trump\u2019s stand on such issues as abortion, health care, diversity and climate change. Their message reverberated at demonstrations around the globe, from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles to Paris, Berlin, London, Prague, Sydney and beyond.\u00a0 \u201cI feel very optimistic even though it\u2019s a miserable moment,\u201d said Madeline Schwartzman of New York City, who brought her twin 13-year-old daughters to the Washington rally. \u201cI feel power.\u201d \u201cWe march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war,\u201d actress America Ferrera told the Washington crowd. \u201cOur dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. But the president is not America. ... We are America and we are here to stay.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 Madonna , who spoke at the event, said it took \u201cthis horrific moment\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration as president to wake up the United States. The pop singer used several obscenities during a speech at the Women\u2019s March on Washington to emphasize her opposition to Mr. Trump. Madonna at Women's March: \"I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House\" She said Saturday\u2019s march means \u201cthat we are far from the end\u201d and it is the start of a revolution to fight for the right to be free and equal. She also said like-minded Americans need to join together to make it \u201cthrough this darkness\u201d and show that \u201cwe are not afraid, that we are not alone.\u201d There were early signs that the crowds in Washington could top those that gathered for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday. City officials said organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington had more than doubled their turnout estimate to 500,000 as crowds began swelling and subways into the city became clogged with participants.\u00a0 Figures from transportation officials in Washington also suggested more people may be on the National Mall for the women\u2019s march than came for the inauguration.\u00a0 On crowd size, one organizer told CBS News\u2019 Nicole Sganga that at least 500,000 were in attendance but the official said she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were closer to a million. As of 11 a.m. Saturday, 275,000 people had taken trips on the city\u2019s subway system.\u00a0 On Inauguration Day, 193,000 trips had been taken as of that time, and the rail system opened an hour earlier that day, at 4 a.m.\u00a0 Women\u2019s March on Washington leave their signs by the U.S. Capitol building, where Mr. Trump had his inauguration ceremony Friday. Close Nicole Sganga/CBS News In the afternoon, women\u2019s march participants left their signs and posters on the barricade facing the west front of the Capitol building, where Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony took place. It wasn\u2019t just a Washington phenomenon and it wasn\u2019t just women: More than 600 \u201csister marches\u201d were planned across the country and around the world, and plenty of men were part of the tableau, too. Organizers estimated 3 million would march worldwide. As the rally alongside the National Mall took shape, Mr. Trump opened his first full day as president by attending a prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, a tradition for the day after inauguration. He later got a view of the protesters from the window of his limo.\u00a0 President Trump, family attend National Prayer Service His motorcade was on its way back to the White House from the prayer service when he passed several prominent groups of protesters. As he crossed one intersection, cars started honking loudly. Some protesters held up signs that likened women\u2019s rights to human rights. It was a nod to a famous speech that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gave in China as first lady.\u00a0 Other signs read \u201cWe stand with Planned Parenthood.\u201d\u00a0 Two tweets posted on early Saturday afternoon from the @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS Twitter accounts said, \u201cI am honored to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!\u201d Neither of the tweets mentioned the march. Mr. Trump later spoke at the CIA\u2019s headquarters. \u00a0 I am honored to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2017 On the streets of Washington, feminist leader Gloria Steinem described the worldwide mobilization as \u201cthe upside of the downside: This is an outpouring of energy and democracy like I have never seen in my very long life.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSometimes we must put our bodies where our beliefs are,\u201d she told the Washington crowd, labeling Mr. Trump an \u201cimpossible president.\u201d\u00a0 Clinton, who lost to Mr. Trump, took to Twitter to thank the participants. \u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch,\u201d Clinton tweeted. \u201cImportant as ever. I truly believe we\u2019re always Stronger Together.\u201d Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch . Important as ever. I truly believe we're always Stronger Together. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 21, 2017 In Washington, a massive turnout affected plans to march. So many people packed the original route along the south side of the National Mall that organizers couldn\u2019t lead a formal trek toward White House. Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said on Independence Avenue, \u201cThe crowd stretches so far that there\u2019s no room left to march.\u201d Instead, march organizers directed the crowd to take a new route to meet up at the Ellipse, a grassy area between the Washington Monument and the White House. Retired teacher Linda Lastella, 69, who came to Washington from Metuchen, New Jersey, said she had never marched before but felt the need to speak out when \u201cmany nations are experiencing this same kind of pullback and hateful, hateful attitudes.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt just seemed like we needed to make a very firm stand of where we were,\u201d she said. Joy Rodriguez, of Miami, arrived with her husband, William, and their two daughters, ages 12 and 10. \u201cI want to make sure their rights are not infringed on in these years coming up,\u201d Joy Rodriguez said. \u00a0\u00a0 Rose Wurm, 64, a retired medical secretary from Bedford, Pennsylvania, boarded a Washington-bound bus in Hagerstown, Maryland, at 7 a.m. carrying two signs: one asking Mr. Trump to stop tweeting, and one asking him to fix, not trash, the Obamacare health law. \u201cThere are parts of it that do need change. It\u2019s something new, something unique that\u2019s not going to be perfect right out of the gate,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Many arrived wearing hand-knit \u201cpussyhats\u201d -- a message of female empowerment aimed squarely at Mr.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s crude boast about grabbing women\u2019s genitals . \u00a0\u00a0 The march attracted significant support from celebrities. Ferrera led the artists\u2019 contingent, and speakers included Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd. The promised performance lineup included Janelle Monae, Maxwell, Samantha Ronson, the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Cher, Katy Perry and Julianne Moore all were expected to attend.\u00a0 Filmmaker Michael Moore spoke at the march, saying he was there \u201cto vow to end the Trump carnage.\u201d He was riffing on a phrase from Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address, in which the president said he would stop the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Michael Moore speaks at Women's March on Washington Moore urged attendees to call their members of Congress every day to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and said those concerned about Mr. Trump should join organizations like Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and environmental groups. He said joined Planned Parenthood on Saturday morning. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said best thing the federal government led by Mr. Trump can do is \u201cleave us alone.\u201d Bowser said she was speaking at the women\u2019s march on behalf of all female elected officials, and that women are more harshly and unfairly criticized at every level of government. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Marlita Gogan, who came to Washington from Houston for the inauguration, said police advised her family not to wear their \u201cMake America Great Again Hats\u201d as they walked through crowds of protesters while playing tourist on Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s very oppressive,\u201d she said of the march atmosphere. \u201cThey can have their day, but I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\u00a0 A protester takes part in the Women\u2019s March on London, as they walk from the American Embassy to Trafalgar Square, in central London, Britain Jan. 21, 2017.&nbsp; Close REUTERS/Neil Hall Rallies were held elsewhere in the U.S., and worldwide. At one in Concord, New Hampshire, author Jodi Picoult said: \u201cWe in New Hampshire are not in the habit of going in reverse. We have the backs of those who are less fortunate - who may be struggling for health care, for environmental rights, for racial equality, for a fair wage, for justice.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In Chicago, so many people turned out for a women\u2019s march there that organizers canceled their plans to march through the city\u2019s downtown, and instead planned to extend the ongoing rally on the city\u2019s lakefront. But the tens of thousands of people who turned out spilled into the city\u2019s downtown streets anyway. After the event concluded in Grant Park, people began flooding nearby streets, chanting and waving signs protesting Mr. Trump. In Paris, thousands marched in the Eiffel Tower neighborhood in a joyful atmosphere, singing and carrying posters reading: \u201cWe have our eyes on you Mr. Trump\u201d and \u201cWith our sisters in Washington.\u201d\u00a0 In Prague, hundreds gathered in Wenceslas Square in freezing weather, waving portraits of Mr. Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and holding banners that read \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d \u2018\u2019Kindness\u201d and \u201cLove.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe are worried about the way some politicians talk, especially during the American elections,\u201d said organizer Johanna Nejedlova.\u00a0 In Copenhagen, Denmark, march organizer Lesley-Ann Brown said: \u201cNationalist, racist and misogynistic trends are growing worldwide and threaten the most marginalized groups in our societies including women, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, the LGBT community and people with disabilities.\u201d In Sydney, thousands of Australians marched in solidarity in Hyde Park. One organizer said hatred, bigotry and racism are not only America\u2019s problems. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters in the German capital carried on signs as they rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in solidarity with the Women\u2019s March in Washington.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Trump, you are no Berliner,\u201d signs said.\u00a0 Other signs included slogans such as \u201cNo to sexism,\u201d \u2018\u2019Women\u2019s rights are human rights,\u201d and \u201cOur bodies, our minds, our power.\u201d One of the protesters is Katie Berdett, an American living in Berlin. She says she fears the loss of women\u2019s rights under Mr. Trump and \u201cfor the democracy of our country.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBut at the same time I\u2019m hopeful because there are so many people standing up and rising up and taking part in these demonstrations,\u201d she said.\u00a0 President John F. Kennedy gave a famous speech in Berlin in 1963 when he said he considered himself \u201ca Berliner\u201d -- a remark that helped keep up morale in the Western part of the then-divided city.\u00a0 People gather in front of the U.S. Embassy on Pariser Platz beside Brandenburg Gate in solidarity with women\u2019s march in Washington and many other marches in several countries, in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 21, 2017.&nbsp; Close REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke The\u00a0 Women\u2019s March on Washington \u00a0was conceived in the late hours of election night, and\u00a0 it all began \u00a0with a frustrated Facebook post by Hawaii grandmother Teresa Shook. \u201cWhat if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse?\u201d she wrote on her wall. \u00a0 A few hours later, a Facebook event page was created. More and more began clicking the link. As it turns out, Shook was not the only disgruntled voter searching for a new cause.\u00a0 Read more: Meet the women of the Women\u2019s March on Washington Hundreds of groups quickly joined the cause, pushing a wide range of causes, including abortion rights, gun control, climate change and immigrant rights. \u00a0\u00a0 The website of the Women\u2019s March on Washington describes it as \u201ca grassroots effort comprised of dozens of independent coordinators at the state level.\u201d Four national co-chairs helmed the effort and a national coordinating committee worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to pull it together, the website says. info A protester wearing a bra and with a message written on her chest can be seen during the first of hundreds of womens\u2019 marches organized around the world in a show of disapproval of U.S. President Donald Trump in Sydney, Australia, Jan. 21, 2017.&nbsp; Close AAP/Dan Himbrechts/via REUTERS March organizers said women are \u201churting and scared\u201d as the new president takes office and want a greater voice for women in political life.\u00a0 \u201cIn the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore,\u201d their mission statement says. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 While the march organizers\u2019 \u201cmission and vision\u201d statement never mentions Mr. Trump and stresses broad themes, including the message that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights,\u201d the unifying factor among those turning out appeared to be a loathing for the new president and dismay that so much of the country voted for him. The rallies were a peaceful counterpoint to the window-smashing unrest that unfolded on Friday when self-described anarchists tried to disrupt the inauguration. Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against demonstrators. More than 200 people were arrested. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Erin Hooley/Chicago Tribune) Hundreds of thousands of people march through the streets during the Women's March on Chicago Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017, in Chicago. (Erin Hooley/Chicago Tribune) Duaa Eldeib and Marwa Eltagouri Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune The women of Chicago would not be stopped. A quarter million demonstrators poured into downtown on Saturday, so many that organizers of the Women's March on Chicago told the throngs that the event would only be a rally because there wasn't room to march. But people marched anyway. \"Michigan Avenue is flooded with marchers,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhamer told the crowd gathered at Jackson and Columbus drives a little before 11 a.m. \"Wabash is flooded with marchers. State Street is flooded with marchers. People are still waiting for trains in Oak Park . We called, and you came.\" So what was supposed to be a pre-march rally, with a lineup of more than 30 speakers, turned into the main event. City officials would echo organizers decision a short later, saying there would no longer be a \"pedestrian component\" to the march, and that Grant Parkhad reached capacity. \"There is no safe way to march,\" Scholhamer told the Tribune. \"We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here.\" (Perry Stein, Steve Hendrix, Abigail Hauslohner) But white-haired grandmothers and bearded and burly fathers, mothers with infants held close to their chests and teenagers in pink knitted hats marched anyway. They shut down parts of the Loop, splintering off in every direction. They raised their signs above their shoulders and chanted, \"This is what democracy looks like,\" and \"No Trump . No KKK. No fascist USA.\" Lee Hart, who took the train in from Evanston with her wife and twin boys, was among many who said she had not heard the announcement calling off the marching, but when informed by a reporter, she continued to make her way down Jackson. \"You can't say you're stopping the march,\" she said. \"It's too powerful.\" Chicago's march was one of hundreds that took place globally in solidarity with the Women's March on Washington. Planned for the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration, the demonstrations aimed to draw attention to women's rights, as well as a myriad of other issues including civil rights, immigration and racial justice. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators on Saturday packed the streets of several cities, from New York to Los Angeles and Paris to Sydney. Organizers initially estimated that the Chicago march would draw 22,000, but by week's end it had jumped to 50,000. An estimated 250,000 people gathered to rally\u00a0in downtown Chicago as a sister event\u00a0to the National Women's March taking place in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, 2017. Similar to Chicago, the Washington turnout was so large that the original march route alongside the National Mall was impassable. Protesters headed toward the White House using several different streets, resulting in a chaotic scene that clogged downtown Washington. Officials estimate the crowd in Washington could be more than half a million people. The march appeared to have attracted more people than Trump's inauguration on Friday, based on figures from transportation officials. While some people who remained at Chicago's rally said they were disappointed at the change of plans, Corey Escue said she was unfazed because it meant more people could witness history and have their voices heard. Nancy Bishop, a 77-year-old grandmother from Glenview, who used a walker, said she never planned to march. For her, it was about being counted. \"Marching for me is really an oxymoron now,\" she said. \"When you gather like this, it makes you more likely to actively participate in our democracy.\" Marikah Davin, 27, serendipitously ran into demonstrators marching through the Loop upon getting off the Blue Line at Jackson with her friends. They joined the crowd without ever making it to the rally, and marched with them through the Loop. Read the story \"We voted, but we still feel a lot of anger and worry,\" Davin, of the Ukrainian Village neighborhood, said as she held up her sign, which read \"Love trumps Trump.\" \"I didn't realize how warm and loving (this march) would be,\" she said. Throughout the day, demonstrators stopped to read and admire the hundreds of signs that floated above the crowds. They were diverse and abundant, with messages that read, \"I will not go quietly into the 1950s\" and \"Proud my daughter fights like a girl.\" Some demonstrators carried tasseled banners, while others held cardboard diagrams of vaginas. Nine-year-old Josie Schenk enlisted help from her brother and sister when she colored a sign that read, \"Your generation will build a wall. (Ours) will knock it down!\" Her mother, Kate Schenk, said she was initially disappointed that she couldn't make it Washington for the march, but that feeling vanished after she marched alongside her family and the massive crowd in Chicago. \"This is so much better,\" Kate Schenk said. (Kim Geiger and Katherine Skiba) The unseasonably warm weather seemed to fuel excitement. The sequins sewn into some women's pink \"pussy hats,\" which have become a symbol of the movement, glistened in the sun. Husband and wife Robin Harris and Mark Michaels, who are both retired and live in Arlington Heights, held hands as they walked. Harris remarked at how many times she heard \"thank you\" and \"excuse me\" throughout the day. \"Everyone is so positive,\" she said. City officials, who would not comment on the crowd estimates, said in a statement that the rally and \"spontaneous march\" were largely \"peaceful,\" with only limited disruption. Before the rally officially kicked off, 39-year-old Mary Hurtt began leading the thousands of women behind her in a chant. \"Women of Chicago!\" she cried, asking the crowd to repeat her words. \"Fired up! Ready to go!\" The rally began with light-hearted music but quickly moved into difficult discussions on racism, homophobia, xenophobia and gun violence. Samantha Marie Ware, a Chicago cast member of 'Hamilton,' became emotional on stage recalling how she, as a black woman, once felt as though she couldn't accomplish her goals because of her race. She encouraged the women before her to stand up. Chicago women head to Women's March on Washington for bachelorette party Rachel Ellison, 32, is heading to Washington, D.C., from Chicago on Jan. 19, 2017, to celebrate her\u00a0bachelorette party with friends during the Women's March on Washington. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Rachel Ellison, 32, is heading to Washington, D.C., from Chicago on Jan. 19, 2017, to celebrate her\u00a0bachelorette party with friends during the Women's March on Washington. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"We must equip ourselves with the wisdom of MLK, that the time is always right to do right,\" she said. \"We must stand up for fear and speak up when we hear prejudices against our brothers or sisters. We must and will hold those in power accountable.\" Also addressing the crowd was Cleo Pendleton, the mother of Hadiya, whose shooting death nearly four years ago made her a national symbol for the city's struggle with violence. Pendleton talked to the crowd about how women's rights \u2014 and mother's rights \u2014 speaks to the core of Chicago's gun violence problem. \"We are here because we are women. Because we have rights. And we do not \u2014 do not \u2014 agree with this administration's perspective on guns. Yes, are you entitled to the second amendment? Absolutely,\" she said. \"But (what about) my basic human right to build my family and for my family to survive?\" As the speakers took turns on stage, thousands of demonstrators fanned out, spilling on to the side streets, where they kept marching. A man played the \"Star Spangled Banner\" on his saxophone. Demonstrators took to the streets in Washington, D.C., other American cities and also\u00a0around the world as part of marches calling for equality and inclusion for women. By early afternoon, throngs of marchers had descended on Federal Plaza; some continued to cluster around the downtown into the evening.

    "text": "President Donald Trump speaks at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Va., on Saturday. Mandel Ngan /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption President Donald Trump speaks at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Va., on Saturday. Mandel Ngan /AFP/Getty Images On his first full day in the White House, President Trump went to the CIA presumably to try and offer an olive branch to members of the intelligence community he often maligned over their conclusions that Russia had conspired to influence the U.S. elections. Instead, he falsely denied that he had ever criticized the agency, falsely inflated the crowd size at his inauguration on Friday, attacked the media and told intelligence officers gathered to, \"Trust me. I'm like a smart person.\" It was a rambling speech that was reminiscent of many of his campaign rallies. But Trump did begin by praising the work that CIA officers do and the danger they put themselves in every day, saying they would be instrumental in \"making us safe\" and \"making us winners again.\" He made the speech in front of a wall of 117 stars representing those in the agency who had lost their lives in service. He called the memorial \"very, very special\" and said he had enjoyed touring the building prior to the speech. Article continues after sponsorship \"There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump,\" the president boasted, referring to himself in the third person. CIA Concludes Russian Interference Aimed To Elect Trump He said that the agency sometimes hadn't gotten the backing they deserved from the White House, and promised that \"you're going to get so much backing, maybe you're going to say, 'please don't give us so much backing'\" \u2014 adapting a line he said many times during the campaign. He ended his remarks by telling those gathered that, \"I love you. I respect you. There's nobody I respect more. You're going to do a fantastic job. We're going to start winning again, and you're going to lead the charge\" in helping combat ISIS. He praised his pick of Rep. Michael Pompeo, R-Kan., to lead the CIA, who is slated to get a confirmation vote by the full Senate on Monday. Trump called Pompeo a \"total star\" and a \"gem\" and said he may have been his most important Cabinet pick. Referencing his \"running war with the media\" and calling them \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth\" \u2014 a line which got laughs and applause from the crowd of CIA officers \u2014 he claimed that the press had misreported what he's said in the past. \"They sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community,\" Trump said. \"And I just wanted to let you know, the reason you're the No. 1 stop, it is exactly the opposite, and they understand that.\" In the wake of the intelligence community's findings that Russia engaged in cyberattacks intended to influence the elections in favor of Trump, he's accused them of leaking information to the press, likening it to \"Nazi Germany.\" He's repeatedly cast doubt on their findings, and after a Washington Post story in December reported the CIA conclusions, he said in a statement that, \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Are Trump And U.S. Intelligence Community Headed For A Showdown? But Trump continued bashing the media, launching into a tirade claiming that the crowd sizes during his inauguration yesterday were being misrepresented. \"We had a massive field of people. You saw that. Packed,\" he said. \"I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, they show an empty field. I said, wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, it looked like a million, a million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.\" \"It went all the way back to the Washington Monument,\" Trump claimed. There are no official crowd estimates available for Friday's inauguration; the National Park Service stopped doing so after inaccurate estimations of the Million Man March in 1995. But according to aerial photos and multiple NPR reporters on the ground, the crowd was nowhere near the Washington Monument . The mall area near the monument was sparsely populated, and Trump didn't offer any verification for where the 1 million to 1.5 million estimate came from, or for knocking down one news report's estimate that there were only 250,000 people in attendance. Trump also claimed that the rain should have scared people away, \"But God looked down, and He said, 'We're not going to let it rain on your speech,'\" and that, though he \"got hit by a couple of drops\" when he started his speech that the rain \"stopped immediately ...and then it became really sunny.\" In fact, neither of those claims is true, and it was raining during Trump's speech and remained overcast and cloudy. Trump also touted his electoral win, saying that he had tremendous support from the military and said he would \"guarantee a big portion\" of people at his CIA speech voted for him. In fact, the military and the intelligence community are two separate entities. Several CIA veterans tell NPR they're unconvinced that the speech can undo months of bitter relations. \"CIA's employees are professionals and will serve the First Customer to the best of their ability, but they certainly aren't fools,\" said former CIA analyst Aki Peritz. \"They've all heard the hostile rhetoric directed at them from Donald Trump... and one prepared kumbaya speech isn't going to change the real concerns CIA's workforce \u2014 from the 7th floor to the greenest trainee \u2014 have with their new boss.\" Paul Pillar, the CIA's former top analyst for the Middle East, seconds that view. He says his former colleagues will welcome the gesture of a Presidential visit, \"but a single visit and a few nice words will not outweigh prior public disparagement. Unwarranted accusations about leaking and comparisons to Nazis are not the sort of attack that is easily forgotten.\" \"Much depends on whether Mr. Pompeo sees and performs his role as the White House's envoy and overlord, or instead as the leader of the agency with everything leadership implies, regarding identifying with the institution,\" Pillar said. \"All that remains to be seen.\" ",

    "text": "View slideshow Updated at 4 p.m. ET The National Mall has flooded with pink, as demonstrators descend on the nation's capital Saturday for the Women's March on Washington. Just one day after President Trump's inauguration, marchers from across the country have gathered in the city to protest his agenda and support for women's rights. Women's March On Washington Goes Worldwide: Snapshots From Around The Globe The event opened with a rally, to be followed by the march proper \u2014 which had a path laid out from a starting position near the U.S. Capitol to its endpoint near the Washington Monument. The city's metro system reported 275,000 rides as of 11 a.m. According to metro officials that's eight times more than a normal Saturday. Reuters adds that the number is also \"82,000 more than the 193,000 rides reported at the same point on Friday,\" the day of Trump's inauguration. \u2014 Lauren Gambino (@LGamGam) January 21, 2017 In fact, the number of marchers swelled to the point of prompting reports there would be no space for a formal procession \u2014 a claim rebutted by organizers Saturday afternoon in a statement. \"We are marching,\" reads the statement. \"We are marching straight ahead toward the Washington Monument to the ellipse of the White House.\" The event grew from humble origins \u2014 a simple Facebook invitation after Election Day \u2014 to the much more massive demonstration seen Saturday. By the time marchers hit the streets, the Women's March on Washington developed a broad platform of progressive political positions, a slate of celebrity performers and a series of sister marches planned across the world \u2014 on all seven continents. For protester Amy Jackson, though, the matter was simple: She just wanted to \"make her voice heard,\" she tells NPR's Marisa Penaloza. Jackson, who traveled to D.C. from Chocowinity, N.C., to be part of the march, said, \"It was very important to be here today.\" The Scene On The Ground Among the crowd that gathered for the rally outside the National Museum of the American Indian, NPR's Sarah McCammon reported signs supporting a wide array of causes \u2014 from women's rights and LGBTQ rights, to Black Lives Matter and excoriations of xenophobia. One thing seemed to be almost universal, though: The pink knitted caps known as \"pussyhats\" among the marchers, in protest of Trump's past comments about women. (Left to right) Melissa Breen, Laura Jamison, Sandy Cuza and Kathryn Wehrmann chat while sporting matching pink hats in support of the march. Becky Harlan/NPR hide caption toggle caption Becky Harlan/NPR Popular as they may have been, the pussyhats were not the only costume worn by marchers. Others wore their causes on their sleeves, dressing in attire to call attention to issues like Native rights and environmental fears. Article continues after sponsorship In video Sarah recorded a block or two from the main rally, it appears there were marchers in a menagerie of outfits. Credit: Sarah McCammon/NPR Meanwhile, at a nearby metro station, NPR's Pam Fessler reported the mood among the demonstrators has been more festive than protests Friday. Most of the demonstrators are women, Pam says, but some men have joined the march, as well \u2014 including one man carrying a sign reading: \"This is what a feminist looks like.\" From the main rally stage, musicians and speakers addressed the crowd in an event that lasted some five hours \u2014 more than two hours longer than anticipated. The reason for that overflow was partly its smattering of surprise guests. Beyond the planned performances and speeches from figures like Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Gloria Steinem, others including Madonna and Alicia Keys took the stage. ",

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Pence and Karen Pence continued a long inaugural tradition Saturday morning, attending a prayer service that was notable for the diversity of faith participants. While most who led prayers and offered readings at the service at the Washington National Cathedral were overwhelmingly evangelical , the long list of participants also included leaders from the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faiths. The service opened with a Navajo blessing. The inaugural prayer service is a tradition that began with President George Washington and was revived in 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt, continuing ever since. While Trump's team had reportedly asked there be no sermon \u2014 a break with past services \u2014 the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, who's the dean of the Cathedral, was pointed in his prayer by asking God to \"break down the walls that separate us.\" With President Trump in attendance, Dean of Washington National Cathedral prays for God to break down walls, take away arrogance pic.twitter.com/tigM6aikbd \u2014 CNN Religion (@CNNbelief) January 21, 2017 On Friday in a pre-inaugural service at St. John's Church , First Baptist Dallas Pastor Robert Jeffress \u2014 a vocal supporter of Trump throughout his campaign \u2014 preached a sermon that compared Trump to Nehemiah, who had worked to rebuild the crumbling walls around Jerusalem, much like the border wall Trump has proposed. Article continues after sponsorship \"You see, God is not against building walls!\" Jeffress said. Many of the prayers at Saturday's service asked God to provide wisdom and protection for President Trump and the country. A rabbi recited a reading in Hebrew while an imam delivered a prayer in Arabic. Sajid Tarar, a Trump supporter who also prayed at the Republican National Convention, read from the Quran. Trump has stirred up opposition among both faith groups. During the campaign, he proposed a ban on Muslims coming into the country and has talked about a need for surveillance at mosques in order to stop terrorism. And Trump's support among the so-called \"alt-right\" movement of white nationalists has alarmed many in the Jewish community. Several of the songs were patriotic ones, including \"My Country 'Tis Of Thee\" and \"America the Beautiful,\" and a choir from Liberty University, whose president Jerry Falwell Jr. was also a vocal Trump supporter, sang \"We've Come This Far By Faith.\" President Trump's children and their families were also in attendance, including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a new White House adviser to Trump. The couple and their children are Orthodox Jews. Notable participants included Alveda King, an anti-abortion activist who is the niece of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of evangelist Billy Graham whose father Franklin Graham prayed during the inauguration ceremony.

A crushing polite crowd, well prepared with healthy snacks and tissues. A crowd so sprawling, it nearly covered the march route end-to-end. It was mighty and powerful. Best of all, there were men there. Thousands of them. Some wore the pink pussyhats. Some were just there to condemn President Trump. \u201cI just hate him. I am totally against Donald Trump,\u201d one guy told me, when I asked why he\u2019d come to the Women\u2019s March . \u201cThe women are fine, they\u2019re strong.\u201d No worries, dude. We\u2019ll take you. We\u2019re all going in the same direction, anyhow. Come along. And that\u2019s the key. Bart Goodell from Skaneateles, N.Y., marches down Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women's March on Washington. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post) \u201cWe are all the same,\u201d said 8-year-old Asa Bergander\u2019s sign. He gets it. When I asked him why he came to the march, he said, \u201cGirls don\u2019t get as much money as boys when they do the same work.\u201d Asa for president! Because boys and men who think like Asa are crucial for the next step in our long unfinished fight for equal rights, equal pay and equal opportunity. It\u2019s time for all men to stand with us in the boardroom and listen when we talk, to stand with us in the kitchen and help us run the house, to stand with us when we ask for a raise and consider what\u2019s fair, to stand with us when we are assaulted and believe what we say.

And in most cases, we can do all this while raising kids. Skills and stamina aren\u2019t the argument anymore. So what\u2019s standing in the way of true equality? Hearts. Men\u2019s hearts. We need you, men. We need you to see the sexism and discrimination. And lots of you already do. \u201cI\u2019m here because this affects all of us,\u201d said Fred Lado, a neuroscientist who came to the Women\u2019s March from New York. Women, he said, absolutely face \u201csystemic biases.\u201d And men need to stand up for women\u2019s rights the same way white people need to stand up for the rights of African Americans. Black Lives Matter. Feminism. It\u2019s all human rights, Lado said. That kind of Spock logic was strong with the science men. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of civil rights,\u201d said Paul Mason, 50, an aerospace engineer from Bowie. He came with his daughter, Chelsea, because he wants a future of equal opportunity for her and worried the new administration will not ensure that for her. The dads were awesome. \u201cI believe in equality for all people, and if that happens, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m losing anything,\u201d said Tim Murch, 42, a special-education supervisor in Emmaus, Pa. And you can totally get why all these Gen-X dads are doing this. Because what dad of a young child didn\u2019t blanch at our new president\u2019s brag on grabbing women by the genitals or boast about how hot his daughter is and how he\u2019d be dating her if they weren\u2019t related. Why else were men there? Is it because they believe that the women at their offices should be paid and promoted the same way they are? That women should get to make their own decisions about their bodies? That men should share equally in raising kids and caring for homes? Does that make all these guys closet feminists? It\u2019s complicated. Many of the men I talked to struggled a bit when I asked whether they were feminists. Which is weird, because it\u2019s like seeing white folks at a rally to end racism struggle with whether they consider themselves civil rights activists. \u201cWhat is the definition of the word?\u201d one guy asked. Another man leaned over and whispered in my ear: \u201cI\u2019m a lesbian trapped in a man\u2019s body.\u201d \u201cUm, I guess,\u201d another guy shrugged. Even Californian Kern Beare, 61, who has been on a month-long journey across the country with his son, talking to people and posting the interactions on his PoptheBubble blog, wrestled with the question. \u201cHmm,\u201d he hummed. He said he believes in feminine leadership styles of listening, cooperation and collaboration. And says that Trump doesn\u2019t have those qualities. But he wasn\u2019t totally into calling himself a feminist. Hmm. Then I found Albert Andersen. He\u2019s a 56-year-old welder from West Virginia. He wore a sturdy leather jacket and stood alone. \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of EVIL is for good (wo)men to do NOTHING,\u201d said his simple sign, written on brown cardboard in black ink. He voted for Hillary Clinton. He answered in short, two- and three-word bursts. \u201cAre you a feminist?\u201d I asked. \u201cLook,\u201d he drawled, leaning in close. \u201cI believe in equal rights. That\u2019s what this is about \u2014 equal rights.\u201d Amen, brother. And thank you for being there. Twitter: @petulad Read more Petula Dvorak: ",

Sean Spicer in his first briefing since the inauguration also warned the media that \"we're going to hold the press accountable\" and said Trump doesn't need the press. \"As long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement he will take his message directly to the American people, where his focus will always be,\" Spicer said. Related: Women's March Brings Flood of Pink Hats, Fiery Rhetoric to Washington Spicer, who did not take questions from reporters, spent much of his statement condemning a photo and the reporting around it showing big gaps in the crowds on the National Mall on Inauguration Day. He said white floor coverings to protect the grass \"had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\" He claimed the tweeted photo was \"intentionally framed\" to be misleading.

The size of the crowd Friday is unclear because the National Park Service, which controls the mall, no longer releases official estimates of crowd sizes. \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\" Spicer said. The Park Service said the coverings are translucent decking to protect the National Mall turf, part of a five-year, $40 million project that was completed in 2016. Related: Trump Visits CIA, Says 'I Am So Behind You' Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, suggested in a Tweet that the strong push back against the crowd size reporting was coming from the top. \"This is called a statement you're told to make by the President. And you know the President is watching,\" Fleischer said on Twitter. In a Saturday visit to the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump also complained about reports on the crowd size and called the media \"dishonest.\" He was criticized by some for the remarks. Former CIA Director John Brennan through a spokesman called the speech, given in front of a memorial wall honoring agency employees who died in the line of service, \"a despicable display of self-aggrandizement.\" \"Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,\" Nick Shapiro, former deputy chief of staff under Brennan said. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, attacked Trump's public remarks during his CIA visit for giving \"little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment\" of staffers who have lost their lives on the job. Spicer said Trump \"delivered them a powerful and important message: He told them he has their back, and they were grateful for that.\" An official press briefing will be held Monday. Spicer also said Trump has spoken with Canadian prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who will visit on Oct. 31. British Prime Minister Theresa May will also visit the White House, Spicer said. Phil Helsel ",

Ben Steinberger Demonstrators gather in Los Angeles for a sister-march to the Women's March in Washington, DC, Jan. 21, 2017. Ben Steinberger David Stonier of Montreal said he was marching for his daughter but also had a personal motive, albeit facetious. Holland carried a sign that read \"Canadian and Single\" \u2014 the dual-citizen was ready to make a liberal's fantasy about moving north a reality. So far though, he had received a few kisses, but no marriage proposals. A popular sign among older women in the crowd read, \"I can't believe I'm still marching for this.\" \u2014 crawford (@VivalaEmiliaa) January 21, 2017 \"I'm 70 years old and I should not have to still be marching for my rights,\" said Madeline Disarm of D.C. \"Right now I feel like we're going backwards.\" Popular signs included: \"Impeach and Replace,\" flipping the Republicans' slogan to \"Repeal and Replace\" Obamacare, and \"I'm with Her\" with numerous arrows pointing outward. Others proclaimed \"Hate Won't Make Us Great\" and \"We Are the Resistance\" with a picture of the Star Wars character Princess Leia.

Fifty-nine-year-old Donna Robinson, who is wheelchair bound but enthusiastic, earned cheers by wielding only a sweet potato. \"This here is our president,\" she said. \"He's rough on the outside. But if you heat him up, he turns to mush ...

The rally featured speeches from women's rights activist Gloria Steinem, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, Madonna, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson and director Michael Moore among others. A group of largely women senators and other politicians took the stage together at one point, including Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, Claire McCaskill, D-MO, and newly elected senators Kamala Harris, D-CA, and Tammy Duckworth, D-IL, who addressed the group as did Rep. Maxine Waters, D-CA. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-FL, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, were also on stage. With the timing and sheer number of people involved, it comes as little surprise that there are various causes attached to the march, which was largely billed as a demonstration in support of women's rights and civil rights but for many has clear political undertones connected to the inauguration of Donald Trump.

By comparison, 193,000 trips had been taken by the same time on Friday ahead of the inauguration. \"Fired up, ready to go\": Participants in Women's March on Washington display signs as they file down Metro escalator https://t.co/nUo6MDKiOl pic.twitter.com/Xh1ZdV38sU \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 21, 2017 Steinem thanked the crowd for showing up, declaring, \"We have people power and we will use it.\" \"Thank you for understanding that sometimes we have to put our bodies where our beliefs are. Sometimes pressing send is not enough,\" she said to the crowd, many of whom wore bright pink knitted hats. John Minchillo/AP Photo Gloria Steinem, center right, greets protesters at the barricades before speaking at the Women's March on Washington during the first full day of Donald Trump's presidency, Jan. 21, 2017 in Washington. Steinem suggested that the size and energy of the gathering was a positive outgrowth of Trump's election and inauguration. \"This is the upside of the downside. This is an outpouring of energy and true democracy like I have never seen in my very long life. It is wide in age, it is deep in diversity,\" Steinem said. She praised \"our great leaders\" Barack and Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton \"who told the whole world that women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights,\" quoting Clinton's speech at a United Nations conference in 1995. Steinem then turned her focus to President Trump. The new president's \"Twitter finger must not become a trigger finger,\" she said. ",

Standing in front of a memorial for fallen CIA agents, Trump assured intelligence officials, \"I am so behind you.\" He made no mention of his repeated criticism of the intelligence agencies following the election, including his public challenges of their high-confidence assessment that Russia meddled in the White House race to help him win. \"There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and CIA than Donald Trump,\" he said, blaming any suggestion of a \"feud\" on the media. Trump's decision to travel to CIA headquarters so quickly after taking office was seen as an attempt at a fresh start with the intelligence agencies he will now rely on for guidance as he makes weighty national security decisions. Following his private meeting with top CIA leaders, Trump said the U.S. had been \"restrained\" in its efforts to combat terrorism, calling the threat \"a level of evil we haven't seen.\" Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents\u00a0of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him\u00a0while comparing the tactic\u00a0to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine\u00a0trust between the next commander in chief... President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents\u00a0of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him\u00a0while comparing the tactic\u00a0to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine\u00a0trust between the next commander in chief... (Noah Bierman and Brian Bennett) Trump's visit to the CIA took place as throngs of women, many of them wearing bright pink, pointy-eared hats, descended on the nation's capital and other cities around the world for marches organized to push back against the new president. Hundreds of protesters lined the motorcade route as Trump sped back to the White House, many screaming and chanting at the president. The president appeared to be focused on settling scores with the media. He defensively touted the crowd size for his swearing-in ceremony, inaccurately claiming that the throngs on the National Mall stretched \"all the way back to the Washington Monument.\" Photos and video clearly showed the crowd stopping well short of the landmark. Trump is a voracious consumer of news and highly sensitive to criticism. As a candidate, he repeatedly disparaged the media and individual journalists to the delight of his supporters, and his appearance at the CIA underscored that he would continue to do so as president. He slammed a Time magazine reporter for incorrectly reporting Friday that Trump had moved a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. out of the Oval Office. But Trump followed with a misstatement of his own, saying the reporter had not corrected the mistake. In fact, the item was quickly retracted. High-level CIA brass stood largely silent during Trump's remarks, though some of the roughly 400 other officers in attendance cheered on the president during his remarks. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed Trump for using his CIA visit to squabble over media coverage. ",

Participants began gathering at Pershing Square as early as 8 a.m., and by 9:30\u00a0protesters had overwhelmed the square and filled surrounding streets. Metro trains into downtown L.A. were jammed with people headed to the march. The exact size of the protest was difficult to measure. Women\u2019s march organizers put the number at 750,000. The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that \u201cwell past\u201d 100,000 people attended\u00a0but did not provide a more precise number. One law enforcement source said officials found it difficult to measure the size because the demonstrators ended up marching down multiple streets. Officials said it appeared to be the largest since a massive 2006 immigration march downtown. The LAPD estimated that march drew 500,000, but organizers insisted the number was higher. Veteran activist\u00a0Jorge Rodriguez, 64, who helped organize the 2006  demonstration, said he thought\u00a0Saturday\u2019s march appeared to be as large as the immigration event if not bigger. Regardless, police said no arrests had been made and that officers were  reopening streets as the crowds began to thin out. The crowd was too large to be accommodated by the planned Hill Street march route. Demonstrators jammed the surrounding streets of Olive, Broadway and Grand Avenue,  chanting \"Love Trumps hate\" as they made their way toward City Hall. \u201cThere is a sea of humanity everywhere,\u201d said Los Angeles police Capt. Andrew Neiman. Aerial footage of the march taken near Grand Park showed an astounding scene, with streets clogged with demonstrators as far as the eye could see, spilling out across the Civic Center.\u00a0 The immense crowd was punctuated by bright pink splashes from hats, scarves, jackets and signs in the traditionally feminine color that has now become a symbol of defiance. Some reported that being in a large crowd of like-minded people was an antidote to the depression they felt on Friday when Donald Trump was inaugurated as president. The march has helped them transform despair into action, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a revival of the \u201960s, and I\u2019m going to be a part of it,\u201d said Anna Vastano, 57, a retired social worker. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit back and in 20 years have my grandchildren say, why didn\u2019t I do something.\u201d Vastano\u2019s daughter, Alexandra, said this was her first time at a political protest. The experience, she said, has inspired her to donate money to Planned Parenthood in the name of Vice President Mike Pence, who opposes abortion rights. Alexandra Vastano, 25, who works in health insurance and has a master\u2019s degree in public health, was already thinking about going to law school. Now, she said, studying for the entrance exam has become a high priority because of her determination to fight Trump\u2019s agenda. A group of five friends, most in their early 30s, said they had never joined a protest until Saturday. They said that for them, the march will be the first step toward\u00a0taking action instead of just expressing themselves on Facebook. Sarah Onheiber, 33, an animator, said that as a working mother\u00a0she doesn\u2019t have much time to volunteer, but she now plans to donate money to causes she believes in. She is inspired by her daughter, who is almost 3. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her not having the same rights I have,\u201d she said. Despite the size of the crowd, officials said the event was proceeding in an orderly fashion and that no major problems were reported. The march began at 10 a.m. under sunny skies and was scheduled to wrap up by 4 p.m. Organizers have emphasized that the march is not simply a protest against the new Trump administration. \u201cWe stand together in solidarity for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families \u2014 recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our country,\u201d the organizers said in their mission statement. \u201cIn the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.\u201d \u00a0 Organizers  released a long list of Hollywood heavyweights scheduled to attend, including Natalie Portman, Kerry Washington and Barbra Streisand. The march was led by an all-female motorcycle group called\u00a0the East Side Moto Babes. The engines of the bikes roared along with the cheering crowd. At the head of the march was singer Miley Cyrus . The crowd chanted,\u00a0\"This is what democracy looks like\u201d\u00a0and \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump got to go.\u201d After Metro reported early Saturday that several of its subway and commuter rail stations \u2014 including those in Orange County \u2014\u00a0were jammed and, in some cases, overwhelmed with passengers trying to get to the downtown L.A. march, the transportation authority announced it was adding trains on some of its lines. Many were crowded to capacity, as were stations along the Expo, Blue, Red and Gold lines. Some inner-city bus lines also were packed. Erica Zeitlin said she caught the Expo Line in Santa Monica, but it took nearly an hour before there was a train available with enough space to accommodate more passengers.\u00a0 \u201cMetro could have put on 10\u00a0times as many trains, and they\u2019d be busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe platforms are packed.\u201d The rail lines were so packed that some Culver City passengers said they had to travel west to Santa Monica before they were able to board a downtown-bound train. Expo Line passenger Angela Duffy said the Culver City station was so packed that she decided to walk to the Palms station. But that station also was crowded, so her group headed to the Santa Monica station. \u201cIt is worth doing it to stand with my fellow women in solidarity,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cChange needs to happen. \u2026 If I just sat at home because I didn\u2019t want to get into the crowds, I would not be standing up for what I believe in.\u201d Brenda Tullo stayed up late crocheting one of the hats for her daughter, Allison, then rose before the sun came up to drive to downtown L.A. from San Bernardino. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the women who came before me, who gave me the privilege to do everything I do today,\u201d said Allison Tullo, 24, who works at a coffee shop. Her aunt and grandmother went to a different women\u2019s march in Ventura. ",

Mere minutes after the news broke that the Colts had fired the general manager, McAfee tweeted \"Thank God.\" The tweet would have been a bit cryptic\u00a0had he not followed it up with: \" 'Unwarranted Arrogance' just ran into a brick wall called karma.\" And after local radio personality Dan Dakich\u00a0tweeted , \"So funny.. the Punter,\" McAfee responded with\u00a0\"All Pro punter\" please and thank you.. also someone who has seen your best friend treat humans absolutely horrendously for 5 years.\" IndyStar Colts Insider Stephen Holder later added , \"I am not taking a position here.

The march also attracted significant support from celebrities, with actresses Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd and singers Alicia Keys and Madonna speaking to the crowd. Performers included Janelle Mona\u00e9, Maxwell and the Indigo Girls. Dr. Trinka Coster, a retired Army colonel, said she was marching because she wants all Americans to get the same \"socialized medicine\" that soldiers and veterans get. \"I'm just glad I retired in July,\" she said of Trump's elevation to commander in chief. Gallery: Pride and Fury: Supporters and Protesters at Trump Inauguration Romaine Mills-Teque, who is African-American, rode down from Boston with her daughter, Brianna. \"I didn't think I'd have to do this for my daughter because my mother and grandmother marched fought for civil rights and women rights for me,\" she said. \"But I will continue to do it until the right is wronged.\" \"It's the most powerful experience I think I've ever had in my life,\" she said, surrounded by thousands of like-minded women. Roschelle Weeks had a similar sentiment. \"I'll remember this. I'll make sure my grandbabies hear about this,\" she said as she nudged her daughter with a laugh. Many marching said they haven't been politically involved in the past, but the nature of this election awakened their civic activism. They said they're concerned about the gender pay gap, access to Planned Parenthood and health care services, and equal rights. \"It made me realize that the things I thought were enough to focus on, which I had been focusing on my life to that point ... were not enough at all,\" said Traci Feit Love, an attorney who started the Lawyers for Good Government Group after the November election.

Now and the future.\" She recognized that Trump might not listen to their message, but added, \"I'm hoping some of the other Republicans might.\" Mark Dunham, of Beacon, New York, held a sign with his wife, Kary, that read, \"Human rights = women's rights.\" The pair cheered on as filmmaker Michael Moore, an outspoken critic of Trump's policies, spoke to the crowd and said the \"old guard of the Democratic Party has to go.\" Mark Dunham, 60, and wife Kary, 50, of Beacon, New York, at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017. Corky Siemaszko \"I think it's awesome,\" Kary Dunham, 50, said of the many men also in attendance. \"I didn't doubt there would be so many men. They're not all crazy, misogynist pigs.\" Rose Wurm of Hagerstown, Maryland, said she was determined to show her support in person. The 64-year-old retired medical secretary from Bedford, Pennsylvania, carried two signs. One asked Trump to stop tweeting and the other asked him to fix former President Barack Obama's health care law, rather than get rid of it. Wurm was riding one of the roughly 1,800 buses that had registered to park in Washington on Saturday \u2014 translating to nearly 100,000 people coming for the march just by bus. One company had buses coming from more than 200 cities in 26 states. At New York City's Penn Station, about 200 to 300 women gathered before dawn to board an Amtrak train to the capital. \"If you think we were nasty before, just you wait,\" read one handmade sign, alluding to Trump sniping at rival Hillary Clinton as a \"nasty woman\" during a presidential debate .

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 21, 2017 5:54 PM EST Top Democrats are turning out Saturday for the Women\u2019s Marches across the country -- including liberal icon Elizabeth Warren, who fired up a crowd in Boston. \u201cYesterday, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. That sight is now burned into my eyes forever,\u201d Warren told the crowd, which the Boston mayor\u2019s office estimated was reached many as 150,000 people. \u201cAnd I hope the same is true for you \u2014 because we will not forget. We do not want to forget. We will use that vision to make sure that we fight harder, we fight tougher, and we fight more passionately than ever \u2014 not just for the people whom Donald Trump supports, but for all of America.\u201d \u201cWe can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back. Me? I\u2019m here to fight back,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cWe come here to stand shoulder to shoulder to make clear: We are here, we will not be silent, we will not play dead, we will fight for what we believe in.\u201d The Boston march was just one of dozens across the country and around the world Saturday to protest after the inauguration of President Donald Trump . What started with an event in the nation\u2019s capital, the Women\u2019s March on Washington , quickly grew to include other cities across the country and worldwide. Women's March, in Washington and around the world \u201cWe\u2019re here today because of the power of women -- the power of women to come up with good ideas, like this rally,\u201d she said. \u201cThe power of women to organize, like this rally. And the power of women to make sure that as our country enters a new political era that the voices of the people will be heard.\u201d Like other speakers in D.C. and across the country, Warren stressed the importance of tolerance and equality. Watch Aja Monet recite poetry \u201cWe believe that sexism, racism, homophobia, and bigotry have no place in this country,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBlack lives matter; diversity makes our country stronger. We believe that equal means equal and that\u2019s true in the workplace, it\u2019s true in marriage, it\u2019s true every place.\u201d She spoke about Republicans\u2019 plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act , the new president\u2019s stance on climate change and his \u201cbuild a wall\u201d hard-line stance on immigration. \u201cTrump and the Republicans promise to make America worse,\u201d she said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Trump moves to ease intel community tensions with CIA visit Published January 21, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Trump visited the CIA on Saturday in a conciliatory bid to end a feud with the intelligence community -- a dispute he suggested was overblown by the media -- while making clear one of his top priorities will be to destroy the \u201cevil\u201d Islamic State terror network. \u201cWe have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. Radical Islamic terrorism, it has to be eradicated,\u201d said Trump, on his first full day in the White House and his first official agency stop of his presidency. \u201cThis is evil. \u2026 We\u2019re going to end it.\u201d Trump\u2019s trip across the Potomac River to the agency\u2019s headquarters in northern Virginia follows a tumultuous past couple of months in which the U.S. intelligence community has suggested Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 campaign was meant to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The CIA, FBI and other agencies in the so-called U.S. intelligence community recently issued a report that stated Putin and Russia meddled in the race, though it found no evidence of vote tampering. However, Trump last week suggested outgoing CIA Director John Brennan may have leaked an unofficial dossier on him containing embarrassing and highly suspect allegations, and compared the situation to living in \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d John Brennan has denied such accusations and said Trump lacks \u201ca full understanding\u201d of Russian capabilities and the actions the country is taking in the world. \u201cNobody feels stronger about the intelligence community than Donald Trump,\u201d the president said Saturday to loud applause. \u201cI love you. I respect you. There\u2019s nobody whom I respect more. We are going to start winning again.\" Trump suggested the news media, which he has repeatedly argued are dishonest and have treated him unfairly, overplayed his concerns about intelligence officials. He also accused the media of mischaracterizing the size of his inauguration crowds.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to do great things,\u201d said Trump, who also tried to reassure the roughly 400 agency employees who assembled at the headquarters that his pick to run the agency now, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, would advance the CIA and its mission as the country\u2019s top spy agency.\u00a0 Before joining Congress, Pompeo was first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served in the Army and graduated from Harvard Law School. \u201cEverything he\u2019s done is a home run,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople like him. People respect him. You are going to be getting a total star.\" Trump said during his winning campaign that President Obama didn\u2019t do enough to destroy ISIS, the upstart terror group that emerged in the chaos of the Middle East and has since claimed responsibility for dozens of terror attacks over the past several years that have killed hundreds. Trump began his first full day in the White House by attending the traditional, post-inauguration National Prayer Service. The roughly one-hour, interfaith service at the Washington National Cathedral included the National Anthem and a Muslim prayer. \u201cHold fast that which is good,\u201d said Bishop Mariann Budde, of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. \u201cMake no peace with oppression. Strengthen the weak. \u2026 Honor all people.\" Advertisement ",

(Jan. 21) AP President Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., on Jan. 21, 2017. (Photo: Olivier Douliery, Pool/European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON \u2014 No one will support the intelligence community more than he will, President Trump told a crowd at CIA headquarters Saturday, while he also attacked the news media for reporting that he had a \"feud\" with intelligence agencies. While at the CIA, Trump also blasted media coverage of his inauguration\u00a0on Friday \u2014\u00a0a protest angrily echoed later by press secretary Sean Spicer , who accused reporters of deliberate \"false reporting\" of attendance and interest in Trump's swearing-in. While Trump has clashed with intelligence officials in recent weeks over investigations into Russian election activity, the new president told intelligence agency employees that \"you're going to get so much backing\" from his administration. Describing the CIA as a\u00a0key\u00a0to victory over Islamic State-style terrorists,\u00a0Trump also talked politics during his visit, telling employees that\u00a0he got the most votes in last year's election from members of the military, law enforcement\u00a0and intelligence communities, and \"probably almost\u00a0everybody in this room voted for me\" in the election, \"We're all on the same wavelength, folks,\" Trump said while standing at a memorial wall honoring CIA agents who have given their lives in service to the nation. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive for the National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral on Jan. 21, 2017, in Washington. \u00a0(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Trump's CIA trip \u2014 his first official visit as chief executive \u2014 came hours after he attended a National Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral, nearly 24 hours after being sworn in as the nation's 45th president. Meanwhile, thousands marched in the streets of Washington and other cities across the globe to protest his presidency and even challenge its legitimacy. In other second-day developments: \u2022 The White House announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet with Trump in Washington late next week. \u2022 \u00a0Spicer said Trump will meet with Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Jan. 31\u00a0and that the two leaders spoke by phone about trade, immigration, security\u00a0and other issues. \u2022 Trump also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a partner along with Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump has vowed to change. \u2022\u00a0Trump repeated a campaign line that the United States\u00a0should have \"kept\"' Iraq's oil after the 2003 invasion, saying that might have blocked the rise of the Islamic State. He added: \"Maybe we'll have another chance.\" The president again suggested he opposed the Iraq war, though interviews at the time indicated otherwise. \u2022\u00a0The Trump Department of Justice said the president is within his rights to hire son-in-law Jared Kushner as a White House adviser ; a Justice\u00a0memorandum said a nepotism law passed by Congress does not apply to the executive branch. \u2022 \u00a0Trump again took to social media, tweeting that \"I am honored to\u00a0serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!\" Trump's visit to CIA headquarters in Virginia resembled something of a peace mission. During the transition between election and inauguration, leaders of the intelligence community\u00a0said Russia engineered the hacking\u00a0in an effort to help Trump, while Trump and supporters said other countries could have been involved. He also claimed the intelligence community leaked damaging information on him, including allegations out of Russia. (Trump later acknowledged that Russia was behind the hacking\u00a0but that it didn't affect the counting of votes.) In his appearance before CIA employees, Trump blamed the media for what he called false reporting of a \"feud\" with intelligence, saying that \"I have a running war\u00a0with the media; they are among the most dishonest human beings on earth.\" He also attacked media coverage of parts of his Inauguration Day, saying media outlets played down the size of the crowd he drew .

The incident started a few blocks away from Trump Tower in the first block of West Kinzie Street about 11 p.m. when the officer told Matthew J. Jennings he was not allowed to walk in the street and asked him to move to the sidewalk, according to a police report. Jennings, 22, then pushed the officer off his bicycle, causing the officer to fall and hit the ground and suffer minor bruising to his left leg, according to court documents, which said the bike's rear derailler was damaged.\u00a0 Jennings tried to run away but another officer placed him under arrest. When Jennings got to the 18th District station to be processed he said of the bike officer: \u201cI didn\u2019t push him; he ran into me,\u2019\u2019 the report said. At the station, officers ran his name and found Jennings, of the 5500 block of North St. Louis Avenue, was also wanted on a warrant for an unrelated domestic battery. Jennings, who was charged with battery and criminal damage to property, both of which are misdemeanors, appeared before Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil who set a $10,000 bail at the Leighton Criminal Court Building. Jennings, whose mugshot shows a bandage under his right eye, suffered that injury earlier in the day, before his arrest, the police report said. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Jan. 25 in Branch 34. Jennings\u2019 attorney could not immediately be reached. ",

The high security section of the facility where high-risk inmates that included Mafia boss John Gotti and several close associates of Osama bin Laden spent their time awaiting trial, will now house accused Mexican drug lord and escape artist Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \u00a0(AP2009) NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0In the heart of bustling lower Manhattan sits one of the country's most secure federal lockups \u2014 and the new home of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. Guzman, who pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges he ran one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking operations, can expect to be kept in a special unit inside the drab 12-story Metropolitan Correctional Center, where such other high-profile, high-risk inmates as Gambino crime family boss John Gotti and several former close associates of Osama bin Laden awaited trial. \"It's got extra security above and beyond what you would have in a restricted housing area,\" second only to the super-maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, said Catherine Linaweaver, who served as the lockup's warden for 15 months before retiring in 2014. \"There is no other unit in the Bureau of Prisons like the high-security unit in New York.\" Expand / Contract In this photo provided U.S. law enforcement, authorities escort Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, center, from a plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. The infamous drug kingpin who twice escaped from maximum-security prisons in Mexico was extradited at the request of the U.S. to face drug trafficking and other charges, and landed in New York late Thursday, a federal law enforcement official said. (U.S. law enforcement via AP) 'EL CHAPO' GUZMAN FACES LIFE IN PRISON; NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED To authorities, it's a setting befitting a man who twice escaped from maximum-security Mexican prisons. Federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that \"it is difficult to imagine another person with a greater risk of fleeing prosecution\" than Guzman. The jail is sandwiched between federal prosecutors' offices and two federal courthouses and is protected by steel barricades that can stop a 7 1/2-ton truck. Cameras capable of reading a newspaper a block away are trained on the area. Inmates can be transported to court through corridors linked to both courthouses, though Guzman will be ferried to and from court in Brooklyn, a potentially risky job for the U.S. Marshals Service. In the 10th-floor Special Housing Unit, known by its acronym, the SHU, pronounced like \"the shoe,\" around a dozen prisoners spend 23 hours a day in 20-by-12-foot cells, prohibited from communicating with one another. Meals are eaten in cells, and exercise is in a recreation area specifically for these inmates. FEMALE INMATES IN NY JAIL WELCOME 'EL CHAPO' BY WILDLY CHANTING HIS NAME To reduce the risk that a wealthy inmate such as Guzman might try to corrupt jail staff, the number of jailers who have access to him will likely be limited and each will undergo extra screenings by top jail officials, Linaweaver said. The special unit's strict confinement drew criticism in 2011 from the human rights group Amnesty International, which expressed concern that the sparse cells, exercise restrictions and isolation \"amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\" The jail saw an audacious escape attempt in 1982, when two armed people in a hijacked sightseeing helicopter tried to pluck an inmate off a roof. Four years earlier, three prisoners broke out by cutting through window bars. Security there was tightened significantly after Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, described as a right-hand man to bin Laden and awaiting trial in a terrorism case, used a sharpened comb to stab a guard on Nov. 1, 2000. Salim, who later apologized for the stabbing, is serving a life sentence. Guzman's case doesn't mark the first time federal authorities have grappled with how to hang onto a member of his Sinaloa drug cartel. Authorities expressed concern that the cartel might attempt to break a son of one of Guzman's cartel partners out of a federal lockup in Chicago in 2011. Of particular concern in that case: A fenced rooftop recreation center officials feared could make a defendant susceptible to sniper fire. The son was moved to a more secure facility.

    "text": "Nepotism Laws Don't Apply to Jared Kushner Appointment, DOJ Says By Melina Delkic Jan 21, 2017, 4:14 PM ET 0 Shares Star J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo President Donald Trump is joined by the Congressional leadership and his family as he formally signs his cabinet nominations into law, in the President's Room of the Senate, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. From left are Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., Donald Trump Jr., Vice President Mike Pence, Jared Kushner, Karen Pence, Ivanka Trump, Barron Trump, Melania Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 0 Shares Email Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, has been approved to work in the Trump administration as an unpaid adviser, the Justice Department announced on Saturday. The early morning memo said that Kushner's appointment would not violate federal anti-nepotism laws, despite concerns about ethical gray areas. \u201cWe conclude that section 3110 [of the U.S. Code] does not bar this appointment,\u201d according to the 14-page memo from the Justice Department. \"We believe that the President\u2019s special hiring authority in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a) permits him to make appointments to the White House Office that the anti-nepotism statute might otherwise forbid.\" Public officials cannot appoint, employ or advocate for family members for roles in their administrations. The laws, however, apply specifically to government agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security or the Treasury. Kushner\u2019s role as an adviser within the White House would not fall into this category. Application of the Anti-Nepotism Statute to a Presidential Appointment in the White House Office According to Josh Chafetz, a professor at Cornell Law School and an expert in constitutional law and legislative procedure, the White House is not regulated in the same way as other administrative agencies. \u201cThe bigger issue for the administration is not so much about the technical bounds of these nepotism laws, but it just looks bad,\u201d Chafetz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything legal that can be done in terms of the appointment. It just looks like there\u2019s a pattern of cronyism that has emerged, especially in conjunction with the cabinet appointments.\u201d The anti-nepotism laws were originally passed in response to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general. They later prevented President Jimmy Carter from hiring his son as a White House intern during his administration. For presidential advisers without explicit roles, there are no legal restrictions. When family members serve specific roles, however, it becomes more complicated. Hillary Clinton, for example, famously went to D.C. Circuit Court in 1993 for her appointment to President Bill Clinton\u2019s Task Force on National Health Care Reform. The court ruled that the White House and the Executive Office of the President were not subject to the anti-nepotism laws because they were not technically agencies. Kushner, who has an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion, will forgo a salary in his new role. He is subject, however, to conflict of interest laws that do not apply to the president. Kushner owns the New York Observer as well as investment fund Kushner Companies, and has promised to resign and cut ties with his business empire. He will \"divest substantial assets\" by selling them or placing them into trusts held by family members, and \"abide by federal rules requiring impartiality,\" according to a statement released by Jamie Gorelick, his attorney and partner at law firm WilmerHale. The president has previously expressed interest in having his son-in-law work on issues involving the Middle East, praising him as a \"tremendous asset.\" Already working within his new role, Kushner was photographed in the oval office Friday night as Trump signed the first executive order of his presidency. \"He has been incredibly successful, in both business and now politics,\" the president said of Kushner in a release earlier this month announcing the new role. \"He will be an invaluable member of my team.\" ",

Caption The protest march, a rejoinder to the inauguration of President Trump, was the largest D.C. rally in years. Jan. 21, 2017 With U.S. Capitol in the background, a crowd fills the streets on Washington during the Women\u2019s March. Oliver Contreras/for The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Perry Stein , Steve Hendrix and Abigail Hauslohner By Perry Stein , Steve Hendrix and Abigail Hauslohner January 21 at 8:20 PM Follow perrystein Follow @SBHendrix Follow @ahauslohner More than a million people gathered in Washington and in cities around the country and the world Saturday to mount a roaring rejoinder to the inauguration of President Trump. What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecedented international rebuke of a new president that packed cities large and small \u2014 from London to Los Angeles, Paris to Park City, Utah, Miami to Melbourne, Australia. The organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200,000, said Saturday that as many as a half-million people participated. Many in the nation\u2019s capital and other cities said they were inspired to join because of Trump\u2019s divisive campaign and his disparagement of women, minorities and immigrants. In signs and shouts, they mocked what they characterized as Trump\u2019s lewd language and sexist demeanor. The marches provided a balm for those eager to immerse themselves in a like-minded sea of citizens who shared their anxiety and disappointment after Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic bid for the presidency ended in defeat. \u201cWe just want to make sure that we\u2019re heard,\u201d said Mona Osuchukwu, 27, a D.C. native at the Washington march with her 3-year-old daughter, Chioma. \u201cI want her to know that she has a voice. No matter what anyone tells her, especially as a black woman in America.\u201d (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) [ Women\u2019s March events underway across the country ] The Washington demonstration was amplified by gatherings around the world, with march organizers listing more than 670 planned events, including Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Mexico City, Berlin and Yellowknife in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, where the temperature was 6 degrees below zero. In Chicago, the demonstration was overwhelmed by its own size, after 150,000 demonstrators swamped downtown blocks. It forced officials to curtail their planned march, although thousand of protesters still paraded around the Loop. In Boston, police estimated a gathering of 125,000. In Los Angeles, officials temporarily closed some side streets to accommodate the crowds. \u201cWe are doing our best to facilitate because they are squeezing into every street right now,\u201d said Capt. Andrew Neiman of the Los Angeles Police Department. There were also huge gatherings in New York, Miami, Denver and Seattle. In Juneau, Alaska, one man marveled that the crowd was the biggest he had ever seen on the state Capitol\u2019s steps. In Philadelphia, marchers filled city bridges. In Lexington, Ky., they shut down streets. In New Orleans, participants played brass instruments. The fear \u2014 and anger \u2014 at Trump\u2019s rise to the most powerful position in the United States reverberated at renowned protest sites around the globe, from the Trocadero in Paris to Trafalgar Square in London. (The Washington Post) Marina Knight, a 43-year-old executive assistant, and her 9-year-old daughter were two of the tens of thousands marching in London. \u201cThis is her first march,\u201d Knight said, referring to her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we felt it was vital to march. I feel the rights we take for granted could go backward, and we owe it to our daughters and the next generation to fix this somehow.\u201d In the United States, the crowds marched in weather ranging from balmy to snowy. But common to every gathering was fiery rhetoric, pink knit hats, and repeated references to the boast that offended so many women: Trump\u2019s infamous taped comments about groping female genitals. Among the thousands of signs that marchers dumped at the end of the day in front of the Trump International Hotel, just blocks from his new home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.: \u201cP---y Power\u201d and \u201cThis P---y Bites Back.\u201d Protesters got as close as they could to the presidential mansion, crowding metal barriers less than a block away as police and Secret Service personnel watching closely. Demonstrators came to Washington from around the country, sometimes sleeping on the couches of people they had never met. As of 4 p.m. Saturday, Metro had recorded more than 597,000 trips, a weekend ridership record. By comparison, as of 4 p.m. on Inauguration Day, there were 368,000 trips. The city issued about 1,800 bus parking permits for the march, and Amtrak added extra trains in and out of Union Station. The huge crowd delighted iconic feminist Gloria Steinem, 82, who was among the first speakers. \u201cThis is the upside of the downside,\u201d she exulted. \u201cThis is an outpouring of democracy like I\u2019ve never seen in my very long life.\u201d Clinton did not attend the march but tweeted her gratitude: \u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch. Important as ever. I truly believe we\u2019re always stronger together.\u201d [ Live updates: The Women\u2019s March on Washington ] The size of the gathering proved challenging. The audio from sound system failed to reach everyone in the massive crowd, and far more portable toilets were needed. When the port-a-potties behind the stage broke down, security instructed women to use cups and ushered them into a box truck for privacy. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to shake anyone\u2019s hand,\u201d one woman joked. Though the marchers were mostly female and white, men and people of color also joined the throngs. John Fischer, a 34-year-old locksmith from Grand Rapids, Mich., drove more than nine hours with his wife, Kara Eagle. I\u2019m here to support my wife,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, women impact your life, and there\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t have the same rights as men.\u201d Cynthia English, a 61-year-old Jamaican American living in Florida, said she wanted the new president to know that women will be fighting during his presidency to ensure that the country and laws treat them equally. She was with her daughter and marching for her two granddaughters in the hope that no future president feels comfortable making lewd comments about women. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen to them 20 years from now, so I am making my mark now,\u201d said English, who wondered, \u201cWhy are we the ones that bring people into this world, and we are treated the worst? We should be treated with respect.\u201d The crowd was buoyant, even joyous. Many held up signs \u2014 \u201cI Am Very Upset!\u201d and \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d and \u201cBridges Not Walls\u201d \u2014 while others took videos of the moment on their cellphones. Every few minutes, a rolling roar swept over them. D.C. police said they had made no march-related arrests, compared with more than 200 Friday when protesters created chaos in downtown Washington. [ Protesters vowed to shut down the city. Police vowed to protect the inauguration. ] March organizers briefly considered suspending the formal march to the Ellipse out of concern that the crowd had grown too large to safely navigate the route to the White House. But speakers soon told the marchers to set out. Lorraine LaHuta, 66, who came to the march from New York City, said at times she wasn\u2019t sure where to go, but it never felt chaotic. \u201cIt was organized disorganization that worked very well,\u201d she said. Judith Snyder-Wagner, a 67-year-old former fundraising consultant, came because she sensed a shift in the rural, blue-collar community near Canton, Ohio, where she lives with her wife, Joy. A neighbor mowed a piece of grass along their property line and put up a Trump sign facing their home. Someone recently drove through the neighborhood flying a Confederate flag. \u201cWe\u2019ve been afraid,\u201d she said, her voice quavering. She was limping up the sidewalk on Independence Avenue. She has had both her knee and hip replaced, and she held a cane in one hand and a poster in the other. \u201cWe just feel like we\u2019re going to lose our civil rights.\u201d The couple boarded a bus at 1 a.m. Saturday in Ohio and would head home less than 24 hours later. \u201cWe needed to feel inspired,\u201d Joy Snyder-Wagner said, looking around. \u201cAnd we do.\u201d Trump\u2019s election was the wake-up call that progressives needed, said Erin Edlow, 28, the membership director of the Virginia Beach Young Democrats. She was in town with her sister to demonstrate her support for the rights of immigrants and of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \u201cDemocracy is not a spectator sport,\u201d she said. The march turned into a star-studded event, with celebrities such as Madonna, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd making appearances. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) introduced herself as a proud \u201cchick mayor\u201d and implored the Republican majority in Congress to stop meddling in the District\u2019s local lawmaking. Activist filmmaker Michael Moore ripped a copy of The Washington Post in half, noting the headline \u201cTrump takes power\u201d and declaring \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Actress America Ferrera declared that \u201cour new president is waging a war\u201d on the values that define the country with \u201ca credo of hate fear and suspicion of one another.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a heart-rending time to be both a woman and an immigrant,\u201d said Ferrera, whose parents are from Honduras. \u201cOur dignity, our character, our rights have been under attack.\u201d \u201cBut the president is not America,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are America.\u201d As the march grew in prominence, it highlighted long-existing racial and political rifts in the feminist movement. The initial organizers of the march were white women \u2014 a group that narrowly voted for Trump in November \u2014 although they quickly handed its leadership over to a diverse group of veteran organizers from New York. They have embraced an imperiled liberal agenda, in sharp contrast to much of what Trump laid out for his presidency. The march platform called for ending violence against women, workers\u2019 rights, reproductive rights, environmental justice, immigrant rights and more. But a group of women who oppose abortion also came, beseeching the larger march to recognize their variety of feminism. Whether to include the conservative viewpoint sparked controversy in the days before the march. Antiabortion activists said they were excluded. Siobhan Rooney, 32, drove from Philadelphia this morning to march for women\u2019s rights. For her, that includes the rights of their unborn children. [ Is there a place for women opposed to abortion at the Women\u2019s March? ] \u201cWe are in the same page on so many issues. It\u2019s just this one issue,\u201d she said. Teresa Shook , who is in her 60s, was on hand to marvel at what emerged from her original proposal for a march in a November post on Facebook. The grandmother of four from outside of Hono\u00adlulu accepted hug and after hug as the crowd surged around her. \u201cThis is the woman who came up with the idea for today\u2019s march,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThank you!\u201d shouted another. \u201cI\u2019m so blown away,\u201d Shook said.

A second day of demonstra... \u201cIt looked honestly, it looked like a million-and-a-half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to Washington Monument,\u201d Mr. Trump added. He took umbrage at some media coverage that suggested much lower numbers. \u201cI get this network and it showed an empty field,\u201d he marveled. \u201cAnd it said we drew 250,000 people, now that\u2019s not bad but it\u2019s a lie.\u201d \u00a0Mr. Trump claimed \u201cthe 20-block area all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed.\u201d Media coverage of the inauguration crowds relied on aerial photos of the two addresses from the opposite end of the National Mall to draw comparisons, with President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration apparently drawing much denser crowds. Spicer made no reference of aerial photos in the briefing, using instead two photographs from behind the Capitol, an angle from which the disparity is not as clear.\u00a0 Speaking to CBSN after Spicer\u2019s statement, CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett said: \u201cIt is quite clear that this administration will make whatever representations it wants to on its impression and interpretation of the news and drive that right back at the news media if it thinks it is being unfair or inflicting damage on the image this White House wants to display.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this where it was so intense, so harsh and passionate right off the beginning,\u201d said Garrett. \u201cSo much of it was about what the media got wrong from the interpretation of this White House and a declaration that this antagonism is going to continue because this president feels duty-bound, on behalf of this movement that Sean Spicer spoke about, to speak beyond the media and criticize it whenever he is justified in doing so.\u201d A combination of photos taken at the National Mall shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (L) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009, in Washington, DC, U.S.\u00a0 REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (L), Stelios Varias TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTSWJVI On Friday evening, the National Park Service was ordered by the Interior Department to cease tweeting after a staffer retweeted a reporter\u2019s comment on the sparser crowds that appeared to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.

(Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared in the White House briefing room Saturday to deliver a short and combative statement accusing the news media of \"deliberately false reporting\" by\u00a0misrepresenting inaugural crowd sizes and artwork in the Oval Office. Spicer walked away from the podium as reporters asked \u2014 and then shouted \u2014 questions about the women's marches without answering questions. \"Before I get to the news of the day, I think I\u2019d like to discuss some of the coverage of the last 24 hours,\" Spicer told reporters. \"Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting.\" The new press secretary complained of two issues: \u25ba A tweet by a Time Magazine reporter saying that Trump had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, replacing it with one of Winston Churchill. But the King bust was simply relocated to another spot in the office. The reporter quickly corrected the error, but the inaccurate information was also distributed to other reporters via a pool report. \"This was irresponsible and reckless,\" Spicer said. \u25ba Crowd estimates of the inaugural. Spicer said photographs were deliberately selected to make the crowds look smaller than they are \u2014 in part because ground coverings used for the first time\u00a0to protect the grass made the empty spots look emptier, he said.\u00a0(Similar ground cover was used on the Mall during President Obama's 2013 inauguration, which was more heavily attended.) \"No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put those out,\" he said. \"This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period, both in person and around the globe,\" he said. \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.\" The tone of the statement was noted immediately by observers, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans. \"This is called a statement you're told to make by the president,\" tweeted Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's first press secretary. \"And you know the president is watching.\" \"It is embarrassing, as an American, to watch this briefing by Sean Spicer from the podium at the White House,\" tweeted conservative commentary William Kristol, a leader of the conservative \"Never Trump\" movement. \"Not the RNC. The White House.\" This is called a statement you're told to make by the President.  And you know the President is watching. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 21, 2017 It is embarrassing, as an American, to watch this briefing by Sean Spicer from the podium at the White House. Not the RNC. The White House. \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 21, 2017 Spicer spoke as photos of tweets and inaugural crowds appeared on two monitors behind him. He said Trump was warmly received at CIA headquarters during a visit Saturday.\u00a0\"It's a shame that the president\u00a0did not have a CIA director to be there when he visited, because\u00a0Democrats are\u00a0playing politics\u00a0with national security and delaying his confirmation,\" he said. \"That's what you guys should be writing about today.\" It was Spicer's second appearance at the White House podium as press secretary, following an announcement of an executive order Friday night. Spicer also made a number of other announcements Saturday: President Trump will swear in White House aides on Sunday, when they will receive briefings on ethics and the handling of classified information, Spicer said.\u00a0British Prime Minister Theresa May will visit the White House on\u00a0Friday. Trump had spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a-Nieto, with a visit with the Mexican leader scheduled for Jan. 31 to talk ab out trade, immigration and security. It was unclear whether the visit would be in Washington or Mexico City, and the White House did not immediately clarify. Read more: ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic Yet women did not protest \u2014 or vote \u2014 as a bloc. About 53 percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit polls, and many said his demeaning comments about women mattered less to them than their belief that he had the independence, temperament and business experience to bring about change, restore well-paying jobs and protect America\u2019s borders. The marches came a day after confrontations between anti-Trump protesters and the police led to more than 200 arrests in Washington. But Saturday\u2019s demonstrations were peaceful, and counterprotests were few. In St. Paul, one man was arrested after marchers reported he had \u201csprayed irritants\u201d into the crowd, the police said. By midafternoon, the target of the protests had not said anything about the marchers, verbally or on Twitter. Though the Washington march ended within sight of the White House, and some demonstrators passed by his recently-opened hotel, Mr. Trump did not cross paths with the crowd. After attending the inauguration on Friday, Mrs. Clinton was not seen at the march, which had strong echoes of her campaign appearances, including some of the same celebrities, performers and slogans. She did, however, acknowledge the moment on Twitter. \u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch,\u201d she wrote. \u201cImportant as ever. I truly believe we\u2019re always Stronger Together.\u201d Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch . Important as ever. I truly believe we're always Stronger Together. \u2014         Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) Jan. 21, 2017 The marches captured the potential and the perils for the progressive movement \u2014 whether it can frame its message to appeal to new generations and whether it can translate protests into action locally and nationally.

Credit Gregor Fischer/DPA, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Plans for Saturday\u2019s march in Washington began as Facebook posts just after the election by a retired lawyer in Hawaii and a fashion designer in New York, both of whom are white and had no experience organizing protests. Soon, protests flooded the feeds urging them to diversify. In the end, a triumvirate of African-American, Latina and Muslim women assumed leadership . Advertisement Continue reading the main story The march\u2019s initial struggles echoed broader debates in the movement about whether the courting of new demographic groups alienated the white working-class voters who had carried Mr. Trump to victory, or whether white women had betrayed gender solidarity by voting for him. Yet on Saturday, these tensions did not deter a multiracial, multigenerational turnout at the marches. Mothers marched with daughters and granddaughters; whole families, including husbands and sons, marched arm in arm. One extended family that gathered in Washington was inspired by its 100-year-old matriarch, Sylvia Fein, who at the last minute decided that it would be too physically daunting for her to march. \u201cI\u2019ve been voting for president since F.D.R. and I don\u2019t remember ever feeling this way about a person,\u201d said Ms. Fein, a retired accountant and painter in Philadelphia. Photo In a sly allusion to crude remarks made by Mr. Trump about sexual assault, many marchers wore hats sporting cat ears. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Her grandniece, Mikhael Tara Garver, 37, who traveled to the march from Brooklyn, recalled how her family had reacted after the election: \u201cWe were all calling my great-aunts, because we all knew how important Hillary was to them and how important surviving to see that moment was for them.\u201d Another family came from Baltimore, sisters, daughters and in-laws alike. \u201cWe have to get away from fear,\u201d said Lureen Grace Wiggins, 49. Her daughter, Eden, 17, was exhilarated by the size of the crowd: \u201cWhen you\u2019re out here and people see you, they know you care.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The march was rich in historical allusions \u2014 most deliberately, the 1963 march led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But it echoed many other marches as well, including those in the 1970s that brought hundreds of thousands of women to the streets championing an Equal Rights Amendment that was ultimately defeated, and those from the late 1990s on for abortion rights, culminating in a 2004 March for Women\u2019s Lives that organizers said drew more than one million to the capital. Saturday\u2019s march happened to come just six days before quite a different one: the annual March for Life by opponents of abortion. But perhaps the most apt analogy, said Ellen Fitzgerald, the author of \u201cThe Highest Glass Ceiling,\u201d was to the 1913 suffragists\u2019 march on Washington, timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson. Led by the renowned suffragist Alice Paul, it featured a lawyer, Inez Milholland, riding a white horse down Pennsylvania Avenue, 24 floats, nine marching bands and even luminaries like Helen Keller. The women were hooted, jeered and roughed up by the police, generating congressional hearings and public sympathy. They won the vote seven years later. Faye Wattleton, the former president of Planned Parenthood, said that women had always had to regroup, even after they thought battles were won. \u201cThis is not new,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to go back to the battlefield and re-fight the wars against women.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Farah Stockman from Washington, Julie Turkewitz from Denver, Jess Bidgood from Boston, Emma G. Fitzsimmons from New York, Mitch Smith from Chicago, Christina Capecchi from St. Paul and Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles.
