Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson speaks during a news conference Thursday on the charges filed against the four individuals suspected in the kidnapping and beating of a disabled man that was captured in a Facebook video. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) John Kass Contact Reporter There's a lot to unpack from Chicago's latest racial outrage, the Facebook Torture Case, and it's ugly, so let's get to it. You know the news. Four African-Americans were charged Thursday with hate crimes in the alleged kidnapping and torture of a bound, white and mentally disabled young man. Police said they beat him, forced him to drink toilet water, jabbed at him with a knife and cut his scalp, shouting \"F---white people!\" and \"F--- [ Donald] Trump !\" and laughing while smoking blunts and streaming it all live on Facebook. I watched some, not all of that video, the way they brutalized that young man, the terror in his eyes, hearing their laughter. And I realized these were human beings, amusing themselves with the pain of a mentally disabled man. There are many words for this, but irredeemable is the one that comes to mind. Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos And when Chicago's top cop talked of it, he said something worth considering again. \"It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that,\" said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson . \"It still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't. I'm not going to say it shocked me, but it was sickening.\" Johnson's been a cop in Chicago for decades, so he's seen worse. We haven't, but he and other police have. With City Hall pushing body cameras for all police, I figure the rest of us should soon be able to see what cops see, at the crime scene, with all the brutality that we try to shield ourselves from. Because cops work in that world where people do such things to each other. Where criminals laugh and inflict pain, on babies, old people, anyone. Most of the rest of us haven't been to that place and we'd be psychologically damaged if we did. There are other elements of this heater case that should be acknowledged, like the politics of this thing. It's crawling with politics now. ",

Producer Arnon Milchan accepts the Film Tribute Award at the 26th Annual Gotham Independent Film Awards on Nov. 28. (Evan Agostini / Invision) Joshua Mitnick Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, long connected to Israel\u2019s political elite, has emerged as\u00a0among the\u00a0wealthy individuals whose gift-giving to\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under review as part of a corruption investigation. The prime minister is under criminal investigation on suspicion of\u00a0improperly accepting gifts. Police are looking into\u00a0whether Milchan provided Netanyahu with a steady supply of expensive Cuban cigars going back several years, according to reports this week\u00a0in Haaretz newspaper and Israel\u2019s Channel 2 News Television.\u00a0 The cumulative value of Milchan\u2019s cigar gifts to Netanyahu was estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of Israeli shekels, according to the reports.\u00a0Milchan also reportedly provided bottles of Champagne for Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara. Israeli police have declined to discuss Milchan\u2019s involvement in the ongoing criminal investigation, the details of which have not been made public.\u00a0 Netanyahu was interrogated by Israeli police Thursday evening for several hours in regards to\u00a0two separate criminal cases. It was the second time in three days that the prime minister was questioned by police in the graft investigation. Details regarding the second case are unknown to the public. The prime minister\u2019s personal lawyer Friday did not\u00a0deny that Netanyahu had accepted cigars from Milchan, but said there was nothing criminal in doing so. \u201cAny reasonable person knows that there is nothing remotely criminal involved when a close friend gives his friend a gift of cigars,\u201d\u00a0Jacob Weinroth told reporters.\u00a0 Earlier in the week, the prime minister dismissed the police investigation. \u00a0\u201cThere won\u2019t be anything because there isn\u2019t anything,\u201d\u00a0he said. Still, the investigation has directed a spotlight on Milchan, 72, a Tel Aviv-born tycoon whose business interests at one point reportedly\u00a0included 30 companies in 17 countries. He has long wielded influence in politics in the country and abroad, and worked in industries including agribusiness, plastics and weapons. He is considered one of the movie business\u2019 most influential producers,\u00a0yet has remained an elusive figure in Hollywood, and though\u00a0he\u2019s a jet-setting entrepreneur known for his charm,\u00a0he rarely gives interviews to press outlets. Nonetheless, he has earned respect and admiration\u00a0from Hollywood A-listers and studio chiefs. Over his long career, he has made movies\u00a0with the likes of Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone.\u00a0 \u00a0Milchan\u2019s movie credits include \u201cPretty Woman\u201d and \u201cJFK,\u201d as well as recent Oscar winners \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cLook in the dictionary under Renaissance man,\u201d said then-20th Century Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos in a documentary for Israeli\u00a0Channel 2 TV. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a picture of Arnon \u2014\u00a0or you should.\u201d\u00a0 Milchan\u2019s ties to Israeli elite predate his Hollywood successes. As an Israeli businessmen in the 1960s, he befriended Shimon Peres, at the time an up-and-coming politician who played a central role in building Israel\u2019s military-industrial complex. Peres eventually served as prime minister and president of Israel. Milchan worked with\u00a0Israel\u2019s defense establishment to help in weapons procurement and assisted in building up the country\u2019s secret nuclear program.\u00a0In a 2013 interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 2 investigation show \u201cUvda,\u201d he spoke about his past career as a weapons dealer and a participant in covert operations for Israel.\u00a0During the program he described himself as a \u201cJames Bond\u201d for Israel.\u00a0 In addition to Netanyahu and Peres, Milchan counted former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert among his friends. The entertainment executive is listed in the Israeli phone directory as having a residence steps from the Mediterranean coast in the central Israel town of Beit Yanai. A spokesperson for Milchan\u2019s entertainment company, New Regency Productions, declined to comment on the reports of his gift giving. Milchan supplied cigars based on the specifications given by Netanyahu, according to a\u00a0report on Israel\u2019s Channel 2 news Thursday. The cigars cost up to $55 each, and the prime minister might smoke as much as $5,000 worth of cigars a month, according to the report. A statement this week from the office of Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, said a six-month corruption probe into the prime minister\u2019s dealings had been recently upgraded to a criminal investigation. During the course of the probe, Israeli investigators ruled out allegations about improprieties with election financing and funding of the prime minister\u2019s trips abroad. Though the investigation hasn\u2019t undermined his support within his Likud Party or within the coalition\u00a0government, opposition lawmaker Erel Margalit has said the shadow of the criminal investigation will taint the integrity of Netanyahu\u2019s decision-making as prime minister. \u00a0The police inquiry has prompted speculation by political analysts that an indictment could force Netanyahu to resign. Netanyahu is the second consecutive Israeli prime minister to face a criminal police investigation while in office. Olmert was forced to resign from the Israeli premiership in 2008 amid corruption charges, paving the way for the parliamentary elections that led to Netanyahu\u2019s return to power in 2009. Olmert in February began serving a 19-month\u00a0jail term after being convicted\u00a0in 2014\u00a0of\u00a0bribery and obstruction of justice. \u00a0 Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan,\u201d Mr. Trump said during an eight-minute telephone conversation. \u201cThey are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it\u2019s a witch hunt. They just focus on this.\u201d In fact, Mr. Trump won more counties than any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan, according to a PolitiFact analysis citing data from the Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections. The president-elect also noted the news this week, first reported by BuzzFeed News, that the D.N.C. had refused to give the F.B.I. access to its computer servers after it was hacked. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe D.N.C. wouldn\u2019t let them see the servers,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHow can you be sure about hacking when you can\u2019t even get to the servers?\u201d The D.N.C. has previously said that the law enforcement agency had not asked to examine the computers. A senior law enforcement official said the F.B.I. had repeatedly emphasized to the D.N.C. the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data. The F.B.I. was rebuffed and had to rely upon a third party \u2014 a computer security firm brought in by the D.N.C. \u2014 for information. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Mr. Trump also said that the hacking of emails from the D.N.C. and top campaign officials for Mrs. Clinton had revealed that she received advance notice of debate questions and \u201cmany, many other things that were horrible.\u201d \u201cHow come nobody complains about that?\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to a tip that a CNN commentator and Clinton supporter, Donna Brazile, gave to Mr. Podesta ahead of a Democratic Party presidential debate in Flint, Mich. Mr. Trump said he was looking forward to his meeting Friday afternoon about the hacking with Mr. Clapper; James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and other intelligence officials. He said that Mr. Clapper \u201cwrote me a beautiful letter a few weeks ago wishing me the best.\u201d But he said that \u201ca lot of mistakes were made\u201d by the intelligence community in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying that \u201cweapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time.\u201d In a later post on Twitter, Mr. Trump also expressed his frustration that details about an intelligence report on the Russia hacking were reported by news organizations late Thursday afternoon. The Washington Post, NBC and other organizations quoted unnamed officials who said the report documented intercepts showing Russian officials celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory. I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 6, 2017 In the earlier interview, the president-elect said that he was eager to work with the intelligence community as president, and he praised the people he selected to lead the intelligence agencies, in particular Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, who is his pick to lead the C.I.A. He said that Mr. Pompeo was \u201cfirst in his class\u201d at West Point. \u201cWe have great people going into those slots,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cI expect to have a very, very good relationship with them.\u201d Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington.

President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Hershey, Pa., on Dec. 15. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an intelligence operation against the U.S. presidential campaign and ultimately sought to help Donald Trump win the White House , according to a new U.S. intelligence report released Friday, shortly after the president-elect appeared to dismiss its key findings. Putin both \u201caspired to help\u201d Trump in November and to \u201charm\u201d Trump\u2019s rival, Democratic nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with leaks of pilfered emails and other covert activities, the report concludes in a dramatic expansion of official U.S. accusations against the Kremlin. The report depicts the Russian operation as unprecedented, saying that an aggressive mix of digital thefts and leaks, fake news and propaganda represented \u201ca significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort\u201d against a U.S. election campaign. Moscow\u2019s goals \u201cwere to undermine public faith in the U.S.\u00a0democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,\u201d the report states. \u201cWe further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d They \u201caspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton,\u201d the report adds. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies found no evidence that hackers tampered with actual voting or with counting ballots on election day. But in a startling new assertion, it says Russian intelligence \u201cobtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards,\u201d adding that Russian spies began collecting information on equipment used in U.S. elections in early 2014. The 14 pages released offer a largely circumstantial case rather than hard evidence of Putin\u2019s direct involvement, and mostly focus on Russian propaganda efforts. But the full report remains classified, and the public portion does not include the specific intelligence. Still, the rare release of a major intelligence assessment marks a sharp escalation in what has become a bare-knuckle fight between Trump and the U.S. intelligence community, backed by President Obama, over the president-elect\u2019s repeated derision of their understanding of Russia\u2019s role. Intelligence officials had planned to declassify the key findings next week after briefing members of Congress. But the declassified summary was rushed out Friday afternoon shortly after Trump had been briefed on the full report \u2014 and had made clear he was not convinced. In a statement, Trump conflated the Russian cyberattacks with those of other countries and individuals, and said the hacking had \u201cabsolutely no effect\u201d on the election. \u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\u201d Trump said after he was briefed by four U.S. intelligence chiefs at his office in New York. Earlier Friday, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump had called the focus on election-related hacking a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss in November. The growing dispute has become a sore point for Trump\u2019s transition team and a worry for Republicans on Capitol Hill who are convinced that Moscow had a\u00a0malign role and fear Trump\u2019s presidency will get off to a shaky start. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) acknowledged the predicament Friday, noting that Russia \u201cclearly tried to meddle in our political system.\u201d But he warned that Democrats might try to use the intelligence report to undermine Trump\u2019s mandate in the White House. \u201cWe cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect\u2019s victory,\u201d Ryan said. Democrats were quick to respond. \u201cI\u2019m appalled the Russian government took the extreme step of interfering with our presidential election, particularly with the goal of tilting the playing field to increase one candidate\u2019s chance of winning,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u00a0 \u201cThe President-Elect\u2019s statement that the Russian hacking had \u2018absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election\u2019 is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement. The report, which Obama had requested, is a joint product of the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency . The three agencies said they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d in the findings except for the assessment that Putin had aspired to help Trump\u2019s chances. The NSA said it had \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d in that finding. In addition to stealing and dumping embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign, Russian intelligence officials also used state-funded broadcasts and\u00a0third-party intermediaries, and paid social media \u201ctrolls\u201d to spread false information and disparage Clinton, the report says. When it appeared that Clinton was likely to win, according to the report, Moscow \u201cfocused more on undercutting [her] legitimacy and crippling her presidency from the start.\u201d Putin \u201cholds a grudge\u201d against Clinton, it noted, adding, \u201cHe has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012.\u201d Officials working for the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, used an online persona known as Guccifer 2.0 and the\u00a0website DCLeaks.com to release emails, as well as to relay them to WikiLeaks. Earlier this week, Trump retweeted denials by Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of Wikileaks, that it had gotten the emails from the Russian government or its operatives. Read the U.S. intelligence report on Russian hacking Open link Trump was briefed on the evidence for more than an hour in a face-to-face meeting with Director of National Intelligence James R.\u00a0 Clapper , CIA Director\u00a0 John Brennan , FBI Director\u00a0 James B. Comey \u00a0and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command. Soon after, Trump issued a statement that called the meeting \u201cconstructive\u201d and said he had\u00a0\u201ctremendous respect\u201d for those serving in the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies.\u00a0 That marked a shift from the mocking tweets he had\u00a0issued in recent weeks, using language so demoralizing that Clapper publicly noted at a Senate hearing on Thursday that there was a difference between healthy skepticism and \u201cdisparagement.\u201d Trump said the U.S. needed\u00a0to\u00a0\u201caggressively combat and stop\u201d cyberattacks, and said he\u00a0would order a team to create a plan within the first three months of taking office. In addition, Trump said hackers tried but failed to infiltrate Republican National Committee\u00a0computers. The RNC had \u201cstrong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful,\" Trump said. He was joined at the briefing by members of his national security team: Rep. Mike\u00a0Pompeo (R-Kan.), Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director;\u00a0Reince Priebus, who will be White House chief of staff;\u00a0Michael T. Flynn, who will be national security advisor;\u00a0K.T. McFarland, his pick for deputy national security advisor;\u00a0and Tom Bossert, whom Trump has chosen for his homeland security advisor.\u00a0 Last Friday, the White House cited the intelligence when they expelled 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives, closed two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland, and expanded sanctions on Moscow.

While the report accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, it found that the material sent to WikiLeaks did not contain \u201cany evident forgeries.\u201d The claim that the emails may have been doctored or forged was raised by DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile in October, when she was criticized for an email that surfaced in hacked messages from Podesta\u2019s account. The report also concluded that Moscow chose WikiLeaks to distribute the information \u201cbecause of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity.\u201d While the report does not specifically mention Podesta\u2019s emails, it does say Russian intelligence agencies relayed material to WikiLeaks \u201cfrom the DNC and senior Democratic officials.\u201d Podesta was the most prominent Democratic official to be subject to a cyberattack during the campaign. The Brazile email passed on a question to campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri about the death penalty, under the subject line: \u201cFrom time to time I get questions in advance.\u201d The exchange came right before a March town hall hosted by CNN and TV One, where a similar question was asked. Yet Brazile denied receiving questions from CNN, and implies that the emails released were doctored. \"I have seen so many doctored emails. I have seen things that come from me at 2 in the morning that I don't even send,\u201d she told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, adding, \"I will not sit here and be persecuted, because your information is totally false.\u201d Brazile stood down in October as a CNN contributor over the revelation. She released a statement Friday criticizing Trump over his past statements disputing Russian involvement in the cyberattacks. \"For the first time ever, President-elect Donald Trump is not disputing the fact that Russia was behind the targeted attack on the DNC and the Clinton campaign,\u201d she said.

The carnage occurred in the baggage claim area at Terminal 2, which was evacuated. As the gunman opened fire, people turned and ran, witnesses said. Taimy Alvarez/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP Photo A shooting victim arrives at Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Jan. 6, 2017. Joe Raedle/Getty Images People take cover outside Terminal 2 of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport after a shooting took place near the baggage claim on January 6, 2017 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Based on identification found on the suspected shooter, police believe he is a man named Esteban Santiago, according to law enforcement officials, though officials said they were checking to see if the ID card was legitimate. Santiago was formerly a combat engineer with the Alaska Army National Guard and left in August, said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. When he was discharged, he was ranked E3, or a Private First Class. The alleged shooter flew from Anchorage, Alaska, to Minneapolis before landing in Fort Lauderdale, senior officials said. He boarded the Anchorage flight last night, the officials said. He checked his gun into his baggage, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News. TSA regulations allow guns to be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that can not be easily accessed. The traveler is required to declare the firearm or ammunition to the airline at the ticket counter and should be the only person to retain the key or combination to the lock. NorthJersey.com A man identified as Esteban Santiago is seen in a photo from 2016. Santiago worked for a security company called Signal 88 in Anchorage, the source said. In November, he showed up to the FBI's field office in Anchorage, where he espoused conspiracy theories, including one claim the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos, the source said. When the FBI interviewed him, Santiago appeared incoherent at times, the source said. Investigators suspected that mental health issues may be at play, and they referred Santiago to local law enforcement for a mental health evaluation, the source said. A spokeswoman for the Anchorage Police Department referred all questions about Santiago to the FBI. Members of Santiago's family in New Jersey are being interviewed by the FBI, two law enforcement officials briefed on the probe told ABC News. The FBI confirmed that agents are on site in Union City, New Jersey, but would not provide details on the investigation. Sources told ABC News that Santiago had received mental health treatment after the encounter with the FBI. A person who answered the phone for Signal 88 said the company has no comment and is \"currently under the advisement of federal authorities.\" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a press conference this afternoon that at this point it appears likely the suspected gunman acted alone. The sheriff also said that the investigation is ongoing and that the scene is considered \"fluid\" and \"active.\" He added that reports of a second incident at the airport were later dismissed. Authorities received a call around 12:55 p.m. about shots fired, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter. ABC News/ Google A shooting incident at Ft.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6.5 million per mile to build a single-layer fence, with an additional $4.2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. \u201cThe chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee\u2019s new chairman. If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed. Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,\u201d she said in an email on Friday. At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, Mr. Trump vowed that America\u2019s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, believe me \u2014 100 percent \u2014 they don\u2019t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall.\u201d In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall. \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he wrote early Friday . Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it. In an appearance on the CNN program \u201cNew Day,\u201d Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. \u201cOf course, we have to pay the bills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the wall.\u201d But he also expressed confidence that Mr. Trump would be able to negotiate reimbursement from the Mexican government over time. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kellyanne Conway, who will serve as a counselor to Mr. Trump in the White House, said he would keep the promises he made on the campaign trail. \u201cThe president-elect has said many times that he will build a wall and Mexico will pay for it,\u201d she said. As a candidate, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States. His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall \u2014 that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars. Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project. \u201cIf President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U.S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N.I.H. to find cures for cancer,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall. \u201cI think that\u2019s a heavy sell,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a tough sell for them.\u201d Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

    "text": "Obama Says He'd Back 'Obamacare' Repeal if GOP Has Better Plan By josh lederman and catherine lucey, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 6, 2017, 1:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump on 'Obamacare,' Election Hacking 0 Shares Email Putting pressure on Republicans, President Barack Obama pledged Friday to publicly support repealing \"Obamacare\" if Republicans come up with something better, but cast doubt on the GOP's ability to develop a viable alternative. As Republicans prepare to gut his biggest legislative achievement, Obama implored his opponents not to pursue a two-step approach where the Affordable Care Act is repealed first and replaced after \u2014 perhaps years later. He sought to lay the groundwork for Democrats to pile on Republicans for taking health care away from millions of people if the replacement never materializes. \"I am saying to every Republican right now: If you, in fact, can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what 'Obamacare' is doing, I will publicly support repealing 'Obamacare' and replacing it with your plan,\" Obama said in a live-streamed interview with online news site Vox. \"But I want to see it first.\" Obama appeared to be betting on the possibility that Republicans won't be able to unify behind an \"Obamacare\" replacement \u2014 or that if they do, it won't be one that will pass muster for Democrats. Though Republicans are in agreement that the law should be repealed and replaced, they're at odds over what the replacement should look like, and particularly over how to pay for popular elements they hope to preserve, including coverage for pre-existing conditions and the ability for parents to keep children on their plans until age 26. Most alarming to Obama and Democrats is the possibility of no replacement at all, given the fact that Republicans have been unable to settle on their own health care vision in the nearly seven years since the Affordable Care Act became law. Hoping to give themselves more time while also fulfilling campaign pledges to quickly abolish the law, Republicans are discussing a repeal that wouldn't take effect for 18 months or longer, during which they'd ostensibly agree on a replacement. \"What you don't want is a situation where they make a promise they can't keep,\" Obama said. \"I've worked on this a long time. If we had had a better way to do this, we would have done it. It would have been in my interest to do it, because I knew I was going to be judged on whether or not it worked.\" The president argued he had no \"pride of authorship\" over the law that colloquially bears his name, adding that it wasn't he who dubbed it \"Obamacare.\" He tried to dispel the notion he was trying to prevent a repeal in hopes of preserving his legacy. \"They can call it whatever they want,\" Obama said. \"They can call it Trumpcare or McConnellcare or Ryancare,\" Obama said, referring to President-elect Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan . \"If it actually works, I will be the first one to say, 'Great.'\" Signed into law in 2010, Obama's overhaul has extended insurance coverage to 20 million more people and brought the uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent, reshaping the $3 trillion-per-year health system in the process. Still, the law has failed to win broad public approval, amid persistent concerns about rising premium rates through the insurance marketplaces the law created. Republicans have set a goal to offer \"universal access,\" but their replacement may cover fewer people than Obama's overhaul. A key GOP focus is to do away with the individual mandate requirement that all Americans have insurance or pay a fine. Absent that requirement, insurers have warned it's not financially viable to force them to accept people regardless of pre-existing health issues. In his final days in office, Obama has been ramping up a public push to pressure Republicans over their repeal plans and unite Democrats behind a strategy to try to protect the law. He traveled Wednesday to Capitol Hill to strategize with Democratic lawmakers, and penned an opinion piece published Friday in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. In the article, Obama said the uncertainty of a repeal with no replacement could lead insurance companies to bail on the health care marketplaces during the phase-out years, leaving millions without insurance. He said it would set up a \"cliff\" with harmful consequences if lawmakers fail to approve a replacement in time. Yet Trump's team has said repeal is the first order of business, and leaders in Congress hope to deliver a bill voiding much of the law by late February. Although Ryan said this week that lawmakers will vote on a replacement this year as well, it's unclear how Republicans could move that quickly to replace a law that took more than a year to craft. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Lucey reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

The 18-hole golf course in Dubai bearing Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name exemplifies the questions surrounding his international business interests. Evan Vucci, AP Email Last Updated Jan 7, 2017 1:13 AM EST Top intelligence officials briefed President-elect Donald Trump Friday on Russia\u2019s hacking efforts to interfere with the U.S. election.\u00a0 Following the briefing at Trump Tower in New York, Mr. Trump released a statement on what he called a \u201cconstructive meeting and conversation\u201d saying that the cyberattacks had \u201cno effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 The president-elect said there were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but they were unsuccessful in breaching the organization. He vowed to \u201caggressively combat and stop cyberattacks\u201d as president and expressed confidence in the intelligence community.\u00a0 \u201cI had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But on Friday night, Mr. Trump tweeted that \u201cgross negligence\u201d by the DNC allowed the hacking to happen. \u00a0 Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t explicitly say whether he\u2019s convinced that Russia was behind the cyberattacks against the election. The officials who briefed him were Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey. They\u2019re preparing to point to multiple motives for Moscow\u2019s alleged meddling in their classified report, which will be presented to the public in an unclassified version. Earlier Friday, the intelligence chiefs briefed senior lawmakers Friday morning, and they briefed President Obama on Thursday. ",

    "text": "Kerry Says Mexico Won't Pay for Wall and Not to Do Diplomacy by Tweet By JUSTIN FISHEL Jan 6, 2017, 2:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Kerry: Mexico Will Not 'Pony Up and Pay' for Wall 0 Shares Email Disputing the feasibility of one of President-elect Donald Trump 's best-known campaign promises, outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry said today he doesn't think Mexico will pay for a border wall. \"They\u2019re not going to voluntarily pony up and pay for something they disagree with,\" Kerry told ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an interview at the Department of State. Trump said repeatedly during his campaign that he wanted to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and that Mexico would pay for it. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto has said the country would not do so. Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on \" Good Morning America \" today that Trump is working with Republicans in Congress to appropriate funding to build the wall and that the administration will find a way, \"whether it's through higher tariffs or a direct check,\" to get Mexico to reimburse the U.S. for the costs. Showdown at Trump Tower as President-Elect Set to Receive Intel Briefing Trump tweeted this morning that the media are dishonest for failing to report that Mexico will pay for wall at a later date. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 Kerry also commented on Trump's discussion of policy on Twitter, telling Raddatz that he doesn't think the social media platform is an appropriate forum for discussing U.S. foreign policy. \"I don't make announcements of foreign policy by tweet, Twitter. I don't think that, you know, 140 characters allows you to adequately deal with the complexity of many of the choices that we make,\" Kerry said. He said he doesn't want to engage in back-and-forth with Trump and his team on the issue but hopes that they decide to \"move to a different way of communicating.\" Trump tweets almost daily on topics as mundane as reality television and as serious and geopolitically sensitive as tensions between China and Taiwan. After Trump won the election, he rattled diplomats and broke with U.S. policy by accepting a phone call from the president of Taiwan \u2014 which led to a formal protest by the Chinese government . Beijing claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has tread carefully by recognizing China's policy while maintaining separate relations with Taiwan. Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 0 Shares ",

The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) It didn't take long for the emails to arrive, as I expected. \"Chicago hate crime today against Trump !\" said one. \"Let's see your column justify that one.\" He was writing about the big news of the day, the \"Facebook torture case,\" as some called it. The case involved the kidnapping and torture \u2014 streamed live on Facebook \u2014 of a white teenager with special needs, allegedly by two 18-year-old black men and two black sisters, 18 and 24. The four suspects were each charged Thursday with aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and a hate crime. One of the men also was charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, while the two sisters were charged with residential burglary, police said. Justify? Why would I want to \"justify\" such barbaric bullying? Why would I want to excuse the barbarism that compelled the young people in that video to laugh lustily as they drank alcohol, smoked blunts, cut out a piece of their victim's scalp and forced him to drink from a toilet bowl? I have no sympathy for the young idiots who can be heard spouting racial epithets and obscene remarks about President-elect Donald Trump and \"white people\" in general. They could not have produced a more effective video insult to hard-working, law-abiding black Americans if they tried. Four people have been charged with a hate crime in an attack on a man\u00a0with mental disabilities. The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. In that vein, I brace myself whenever a high-profile violent crime is committed by an African-American. I know I'm going to hear from a certain grouchy subset of trolls, energized in part by the notion that black people are getting away with too much or only getting ahead at the expense of white people. As my Southern-born mother used to say, bless their hearts. You can't lift yourself up, she would say, by keeping somebody else down. Yet, once race enters a crime story, especially a brutally vicious crime like this one that crosses racial lines, so does an ugly brand of racial politics. Shortly after the Facebook video spread on social media, for example, it was followed by social media comments \u2014 unsupported, it turned out \u2014 that the attackers belonged to the well-known anti-police-brutality movement known as Black Lives Matter . The problem with that allegation is that Chicago police said there was no evidence to back it up and DeRay Mckesson, a leading Black Lives Matter organizer, said such violent acts never have been the organization's intention. Yet the hashtag #BLMKidnapping continued to trend on Twitter, helped along by Glenn Beck , Twitter activists and some other voices for conventional conservatism and the \"alt-right,\" a snazzy new-wave label for old-school white supremacy. After all, the more attention they put on Black Lives Matter, deserved or not, the less attention goes to the police conduct issues that the protest movement is trying to raise \u2014 ostensibly not to bash police but to improve policing. Unfortunately, there are many ways to profit by feeding public anger, fears, resentments and suspicions. You can even win elections sometimes. You can see evidence of today's racial divide in polls like the one taken in late November by YouGov and the liberal Huffington Post. It found that a commanding 84 percent of Hillary Clinton voters thought black people face \"a lot of discrimination\" in the United States today, compared with 22 percent of Trump voters. With such stark differences in political attitudes, it is no wonder that a July Washington Post/ABC News poll found 63 percent of adults said race relations are in bad shape, up from 48 in a Pew Research survey last spring. Scene of Facebook Live attack Police say an apartment on Chicago's West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Police say an apartment on Chicago's West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) See more videos We would be making a mistake if we try to blame all of that on Barack Obama, the outgoing president told Jay Levine from Chicago's CBS affiliate in a White House interview. It is not that racial tensions have gotten worse, he said, but smartphones and the internet bring the ugliest episodes of different communities to a wider audience than ever before. \"I think the overall trajectory of race relations in this country is actually very positive,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean that all racial problems have gone away. It means that we have the capacity to get better.\" Sure, he's protecting his legacy, but he's got a point. Unfortunately too many people don't seem to want us to get better. They'd rather complain.

(Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune) Assistant State's Attorney Erin Antonietti recounts some of the events in an attack on a special needs teen that was broadcast on Facebook Live and resulted in hate crime charges being leveled against the attackers. (Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune) Steve Schmadeke , William Lee and Robert McCoppin Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A Cook County judge ordered no bail Friday for four people accused of broadcasting a live Facebook video of their alleged attack on a mentally disabled teen. \"I'm looking at each of you and wondering where was the sense of decency that each of you should have had?\" Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil said. \"I don't see it.\" On hearing the no-bail ruling, a relative of the victim clapped and loudly said, \"Yes!\" A short time later, Priscilla Covington , a grandmother of two sisters charged in the attack, hustled past a throng of media outside the Leighton Criminal Court Building, telling reporters, \"I didn't raise them that way.\" The racially charged video shows the four -- who are all African-American \u2014 cutting the white victim's scalp with a knife, punching and kicking him and laughing as they repeatedly forced his head into a toilet. For the first time, authorities alleged that one of the four, Jordan Hill , who knew the victim from attending the same alternative school in Aurora, first beat the victim in the back of a van after he became angry that the victim's mother was contacting him by Facebook about her son's whereabouts. Prosecutors said Hill demanded $300 from the victim's mother if she wanted her son back. Read the story It wasn't until later that the live Facebook video captured the four slapping, beating, cutting and stabbing the victim as he was bound and gagged in an apartment on Chicago's West Side, authorities alleged. Charged in the attack were Hill, 18, of Carpentersville; Tesfaye Cooper , 18, of Chicago; and sisters Brittany Covington, 18, and Tanishia Covington , 24, who lived in the apartment in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street where the bulk of the assault allegedly took place. The four were each charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to police and prosecutors. Hill also was charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, while both Covingtons were charged with residential burglary, police said. Prosecutors revealed in court that the 18-year-old victim, who lives with his parents in suburban Streamwood, has schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Four people have been charged with a hate crime in an attack on a man\u00a0with mental disabilities. The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. Meanwhile, the victim's brother-in-law said Friday that the teen has been \"struggling\" to recover after his ordeal but is safe with his family. A man who runs a Reddit site called Uplifting News started a Go Fund ME page for the victim that had raised more than $42,000 Friday from in excess of 1,500 donors, according to the fundraising web site. Razor Sheldon, of San Francisco, said he does not know the family but wanted to focus on helping the victim rather than seeking vengeance against the perpetrators. On his fundraising web page, Sheldon called the crime \"horrific\" and wrote of the victim: \"Let's prove to him that there is far more good in this world than the evil he experienced.\" Boyd said he spoke with Sheldon and Go Fund Me to verify the legitimacy of the fund and said a family member had set up another Go Fund Me campaign. He said the family is grateful for the outpouring of support but added: \"We're not asking anyone for anything. We're a little overwhelmed. We don't want to take advantage of anybody.\" Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man.

The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos Prosecutors said the victim's mother dropped him off at a McDonald's in Streamwood on Dec. 31 to meet a friend. He later asked to spend the night at the friend's place both that night and the next. But by Monday, communication from the teen stopped. Later that same day, however, the victim's brother found out on Facebook that his brother was with Hill. The mother reached out to Hill on Facebook to say she wanted her son to return home, prosecutors said. Angered by the mother's Facebook contacts, Hill, who by then had stolen a van and bought and smoked marijuana with the teen, beat the victim in the back of the van, prosecutors said. Shortly after the two arrived at the sisters' third-floor West Side apartment, Hill started to harass the victim, slapping him, prosecutors said. Armed with a knife, Hill was joined by Cooper in ordering the teen to face the wall in a corner, screaming at him and forcing him to kiss the floor and say, \"I love black people,\" prosecutors said. By Tuesday, Brittany Covington began posting the abuse live on Facebook, prosecutors said. She smoked what appeaed to be a blunt \u2014 a cigar emptied and stuffed with marijuana \u2014 while narrating some of the action. ",

Record) WOODLAND PARK, N.J. \u2014 The alleged gunman who authorities say killed at least five people at the Fort Lauderdale airport Friday was an Army veteran who was born in New Jersey and a recent father who began to have problems about a month ago when a relative said he began to see things and \u201clost his mind.\u201d A federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed the suspect\u2019s name and date of birth as Esteban Santiago, born March 16, 1990. Santiago was arrested after a shooting spree that began around noon at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and left five people dead and eight people wounded, according to law enforcement officials. Santiago had served with the National Guard in Iraq and became a father in September, said his aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, who lives in Union City. She said that another member of her family had told her that he was the suspect in the Fort Lauderdale shooting. She said that her nephew had been living in Alaska, where he was able to obtain a job in security. She showed reporters a photo of Santiago at a hospital holding his newborn son in September. Staff at Providence Hospital in Anchorage confirmed that the photo was taken in their\u00a0hospital. 5 dead, 8 injured in shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport Santiago wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cDisturbed\u201d in the photo. Ruiz said that Santiago, whose mother lives in Puerto Rico, appeared happy after the birth of his son but that something happened to him about one month ago. \u201cLike a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,\u201d she said \u201cHe said he saw things.\u201d She said that he was hospitalized for two weeks, but she did not have details about his condition. Ruiz spoke to reporters at her home Friday afternoon before FBI agents showed up at her door and local authorities closed off the street near her home. \"I don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d she said during the interview. The shooting broke out around noon next to the baggage claim area at Terminal 2, which serves Delta Airlines. Witnesses said the gunman fired randomly at people gathered near a baggage carousel, reloading several times. One passenger, Mark Lea, told MSNBC the man was \"just randomly shooting people\" with a 9mm pistol without saying a word to anyone. After emptying about 3 magazines of bullets, the shooter then got down on the ground spread-eagled and waited for police to arrive. Maria Ruiz, aunt of 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, the Florida shooting suspect, talks to reporters in her apartment in Union City. \u00a0(Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com) Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., had initially identified the gunman as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago and said he was carrying a military identification card. Maria Cede\u00f1o, a Broward County resident who had just gotten off of a Delta flight from Atlanta, told The Record that she took refuge in a Terminal 2 bathroom, where she said two armed female officers from the Sheriff\u2019s\u00a0Office carrying guns and flashlights were looking around. She said FBI agents were also in the airport. \u201cThe most impactful thing is to see members of the sheriff walking around with guns and checking the bathroom right now,\u201d\u00a0Cede\u00f1o said.

She said outside the bathroom she could see people sitting along the wall on their mobile devices. Cede\u00f1o said she had heard from her daughter, who was keeping her abreast of the news, that a person from her flight may have been one of the victims of the shooting. Cede\u00f1o said she was on her way to baggage claim, but fortunately made a stop in the restroom. \u201cI could have been there in that moment,\u201d Cede\u00f1o said. ",

In 2015, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump's national security advisor, attended RT's 10th anniversary dinner in Moscow and sat at a table with Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid by RT, though he has declined to say how much. RT, the report says, collaborated with WikiLeaks as part of a Russian propaganda effort designed to discredit the United States. \"The Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\" the report says. RT's editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, he report says. \"Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become `the only Russian media company' to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to `new leaks of secret information.' RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.\" At another point, the report says, \"We assess with high confidence that the GRU (Russia's military intelligence arm) relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.\" The unclassified report does not identify who transmitted the information or how. A senior official with direct knowledge, however, told NBC News Thursday that the U.S. has identified the Russian actors who turned over stolen Democratic material to WikiLeaks. The unclassified report was released shortly after Trump was briefed behind closed doors by the heads of the major intelligence agencies. After the briefing, Trump released a statement in which he called his meeting and conversation \"constructive\" and said he had \"tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women\" of the intelligence community. Related: Trump, Intel Agencies Can't Even Agree What Day It Is He did not, however, explicitly embrace the findings of the intelligence agencies that the top levels of the Russian government interfered in the election with the hopes of hurting Hillary Clinton and, ultimately, helping him. He referred to Russia as one among several countries that might have tried to hack into the national infrastructure, but emphasized that no effect on the outcome of the election had been demonstrated. The unclassified report laid out a series of \"key judgments\" about Russian interfering and hacking that goes back as far as 2008, and goes beyond political organizations. Related: US Has Id'ed Russians Who Gave Hacked Emails to WikiLeaks Russian Celebrations A senior U.S. intelligence official with direct knowledge confirmed to NBC News that the classified version of this report, which was briefed to President-elect Trump Thursday, says that U.S. intelligence picked up senior Russian officials celebrating and congratulating one another over Donald Trump's win. The source described the intelligence about the celebration as a minor part of the overall intelligence picture. \"Highly classified intercepts illustrate Russian government planning and direction of a multifaceted campaign by Moscow to undermine the integrity of the American political system,\" the official said.

Charles Sykes/AP hide caption toggle caption Om Puri at the New York premiere of The Hundred-Foot Journey on Aug. 4, 2014. Charles Sykes/AP Prolific Indian actor Om Puri, who for decades appeared in films all over the world, has died at age 66 in Mumbai. Reports say Puri suffered a heart attack at his home early on Friday. Puri had roles in more than 300 movies in his career, NPR's Rose Friedman reports for our Newscast unit. Rose says he began acting in Indian art house cinema in the 1970s and soon branched into British and American films, including Gandhi in 1982 and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007. He appeared in the 2013 film The Reluctant Fundamentalist, in which he played a father struggling to pass on a sense of empathy to his Wall Street-employed son. Most recently, he starred alongside Helen Mirren in The Hundred-Foot Journey, a 2015 film about a displaced Indian family that settles in a French village and opens a restaurant. Puri was a crossover star, as evidenced by the breadth of people mourning his death. The BBC reported that even media in Pakistan, with whom India's relationship is often tense, are celebrating his life and career. The BBC wrote, \"[Puri] had recently spoken out against the ban imposed by India on Pakistani actors working in Bollywood films, following tensions over Kashmir,\" telling an Indian TV channel, \"Pakistani artists are not terrorists.\" Article continues after sponsorship In 2004, Puri received an honorary Order of the British Empire, an award established by King George V and given to individuals who have made distinguished contributions in their field. In 1990, he was awarded the Padma Shri , one of India's highest civilian honors, the Guardian wrote. Puri's professional life was wildly successful, but his personal life had been turbulent in recent years. He separated from his wife, Nandita, after she wrote his biography in 2009, called Unlikely Hero: Om Puri . The book revealed explicit details about his sexual forays as a young man. Puri is survived by Nandita, whom he married in 1993, and their son. Less than a month before his death, Puri took to Twitter to reflect on his life and career: I have no regrets at all. I have done quite well for myself. I didn't have a conventional face, but I have done well, and I am proud of it. ",

Mikhail Klimentyev/AP hide caption toggle caption Mikhail Klimentyev/AP Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during his annual televised New Year's message in the Kremlin in Moscow. Mikhail Klimentyev/AP Updated 5:30 p.m. ET The intelligence report on Russia's interference in the U.S. elections concludes that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an \"influence campaign\" that aimed to help President-elect Donald Trump. \"Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,\" the public version of the report from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency states. \"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" This is the first time the U.S. government has leveled these accusations directly at Putin, as NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports . \"It's obviously a big deal to level that kind of charge at the head of state of a foreign country,\" she says. The report does not weigh in on whether this \"influence campaign\" changed the outcome of the U.S. election. Here are some of the report's key findings: Putin and the Russian Government \"aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\" The report states that Putin's motivation to discredit Clinton was at least partially personal. It says he \"publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.\" Russian intelligence \"conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election, including targets associated with both major US political parties.\" This included primary campaigns, think tanks and lobbying groups. The report asserts with \"high confidence\" that Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate \"relayed material it acquired from the [Democratic National Committee] and senior Democratic officials to Wikileaks.\" \"Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards.\" Taken together, these efforts \"represented a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations aimed at US elections.\" Article continues after sponsorship You can read the public version of the report here: On Oct. 7, the U.S. first formally accused Russia of hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee and other U.S. political organizations. \"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\" the joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Since then, intelligence officials have doubled down and expanded upon the accusations. \"We stand more resolutely on that statement,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, as NPR's Brian Naylor reported . Intelligence Chiefs 'Stand More Resolutely' Behind Finding Of Russia Election Hacking In December, the FBI threw its weight behind the CIA's assessment, as NPR's Carrie Johnson reported : \"The entire intelligence community, in fact, is now in alignment that the hacks were partly motivated to try and install Trump as president.\" President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed the assessment. Earlier Friday afternoon, he received a briefing on the intelligence report from Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey at Trump Tower in New York. In a statement, Trump called the meeting \"constructive\" and added that he has \"tremendous respect\" for the work of the intelligence community. He did not specifically blame Russia, saying it was one of a number of countries including China that are \"consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our government institutions, businesses and organizations.\" Trump also stated that the hacks had \"absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\" Remember, the report specifically states that it did not \"make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.\" It did say that the Department of Homeland Security \"assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.\" Prior to today's briefing, Trump told The New York Times he believes the continued attention on the cyberattacks is politically motivated. \"They got beaten very badly in the election. I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan,\" Trump told the Times. \"They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it's a witch hunt. They just focus on this.\" The White House announced sanctions against Russia last month in response to the cyberattacks. ",

The suspected gunman appeared to be shooting randomly into a crowd in a lower floor of Terminal 2 as panicked travelers took cover behind chairs \u2014 and he only stopped when his bullets ran out, according to witnesses. Multiple senior law enforcement sources identified the suspect as New Jersey born Esteban Santiago, 26, and said he had a military ID on him. The military said he had served in the Puerto Rico National Guard and was deployed to Iraq for 10 months. \"We still have people fighting for their lives in the hospital,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. Law enforcement officials told NBC News they believe Santiago flew Delta from Anchorage, Alaska and caught a connecting Delta flight from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Fort Lauderdale, where he picked up his firearm at baggage claim and began the shooting spree. Federal guidelines allow for passengers to check unloaded guns in a locked case, and also allows for ammunition to be placed in checked baggage. An injured woman is taken into Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after a shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Jan. 6, 2017. Taimy Alvarez / South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP The Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport, located about 25 miles north of Miami, tweeted the shooting occurred at a baggage claim inside Terminal 2 around 12:55 p.m. ET. \"At first we thought it was firecrackers,\" said witness Mark Lea, 53. \"Everyone started screaming and running.\" Broward Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference the shooter was apprehended without incident, no law enforcement officers fired any shots. Federal authorities declined to give details about the shooter or his weapon, and said he was being interviewed to determine a motive. Federal law enforcement officials told NBC News that Santiago was undergoing treatment for mental health problems, complaining that he was hearing voices. A few months ago, he walked into the FBI's office in Anchorage, claiming that the CIA was forcing him to join ISIS, the officials said. Officials say local police were called, and he went voluntarily to a mental health facility for treatment. Lea said the shooter made his way through baggage claim with what looked like a 9 mm firearm and emptied his entire magazine. \"People were trying to run,\" he said. \"Once he finished shooting, he walked down by Door 2, threw his gun on the ground, and laid down on the ground, spread-eagle, until the first officer came \u2014 which was probably a minute later,\" Lea told MSNBC. \"He was not shot at all, was not wounded.\" Play ",

The full length video of a press conference held at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport on the latest information about the shooting there early Friday afternoon. Laura King , Nina Agrawal , Del Quentin Wilber and Alexandra Zavis Contact Reporters The young Iraq war veteran suspected of fatally shooting five people and wounding eight others at Fort Lauderdale\u2019s international airport Friday had become mentally agitated in recent weeks, family members said, despite his happiness over the birth of a son less than four months ago.\u00a0 Esteban Santiago , 26, was in custody following the attack, being questioned by local and federal law enforcement. Eyewitnesses described an eerily calm assailant who fired bursts from a semiautomatic handgun at fellow airline passengers as they clustered around a baggage carousel \u2013 and then just as calmly\u00a0tossed his weapon away and positioned himself spread-eagle on the ground, waiting for police to arrest him.\u00a0\u00a0 The country\u2019s largest mass shooting of the new year threw the busy Florida airport into chaos, with thousands of travelers and airport staff fleeing onto walkways and the tarmac as emergency responders and law enforcement officers, many\u00a0heavily armed and in tactical gear, rushed to the scene. In addition to the eight people hurt in the shooting , 37 others were injured in the chaotic aftermath, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had grounded flights around the country destined for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, but some flights that were landing when the shooting broke out shortly before 1 p.m. were stranded for hours on the tarmac with passengers aboard. Hundreds more people were trapped as security forces swept the airport. As the attack unfolded, the Transportation Safety Administration said on Twitter that there was an active shooter in the airport\u00a0and urged people inside to shelter in place. Later, television video\u00a0showed long lines of people trudging with their luggage away from the terminals or milling around outside, with most vehicles still blocked from entering the closed airport. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was following the \u201chorrific events\u201d at the airport \u2013 briefed by Republican Florida Gov.\u00a0 Rick Scott , who said he had phoned Trump rather than calling President Obama . The White House said Obama was briefed about the attack by staff. The trajectory of Santiago\u2019s life had taken him from balmy Puerto Rico to snowy Anchorage. Along the way, many troubling signs emerged. Authorities at Los Angeles International Airport said Friday they are beefing up security in the wake of a mass shooting at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cAirport Police are deploying additional resources into our terminals and an increased presence in the Central Terminal Area,\u201d LAX officials... Authorities at Los Angeles International Airport said Friday they are beefing up security in the wake of a mass shooting at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cAirport Police are deploying additional resources into our terminals and an increased presence in the Central Terminal Area,\u201d LAX officials... (Shelby Grad) A federal law enforcement official said Santiago boarded a Delta Air Lines flight in Anchorage and flew to Fort Lauderdale by way of Minneapolis. Authorities are investigating whether he got into a dispute with another passenger on the Anchorage-to-Minneapolis leg of the flight, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. After getting off the plane, the gunman retrieved his baggage and went to the bathroom, where he pulled out the gun, the official said. Unloaded firearms can be legally checked in baggage in a secure container\u00a0if declared, according to TSA regulations. Law enforcement authorities said the suspect was taken into custody without any additional shots being fired, and no other suspects have been identified. Authorities said the motive was unknown. But worrying details of the suspect\u2019s life in Alaska were beginning to emerge. George L. Piro, the special agent in charge at the FBI\u2019s Miami field office, reported that Santiago had walked into the agency\u2019s Anchorage field office in November. \u201cAt that time, he clearly stated that he did not intend to harm anyone,\u201d Piro told reporters. But the FBI agents who spoke to him were concerned about his \u201cerratic behavior\u201d and turned him over to local law enforcement, which in turn took him to a medical facility for evaluation. A federal law enforcement source said Santiago  in his visit to the FBI had complained of being forced to fight for the militant group Islamic State. He reported that his mind was being controlled by a U.S. spy agency. In January, he was arrested and charged with assault in an incident involving his girlfriend. According to the court complaint, police said he had been yelling at her through a locked bathroom door, then busted through the door, pulling it out of its frame. He then began striking her and strangling her, the woman told police, though they observed no apparent injuries. The prosecutor dismissed the case in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Santiago was formerly a member of the Alaska Army National Guard and left the organization for \"unsatisfactory performance\" in August 2016, a National Guard spokeswoman confirmed to the Sun-Sentinel newspaper in Florida. His rank at the time was private first class. \"He is no longer a member of our organization,\" said Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, who said she could not elaborate on the reason for his discharge. \"Information on disciplinary actions [is] not releasable,'' she said. A combat engineer, Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. He was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. In Union City, N.J., an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, told reporters that Santiago had been happy upon the birth of his son, but that she and family members had feared his mental state was deteriorating. She showed reporters a photo of him wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cDisturbed.\u201d \u201cLike a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,\u201d she said, according to the website NorthJersey.com. \u201cHe said he saw things.\u201d Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters the incident appeared to have been limited to the lower-level baggage claim area of Terminal 2, and there was no evidence to support earlier, unconfirmed reports of gunshots in another terminal. \u201cThere\u2019s no confirmation of any kind of gunshots anywhere at any time other than this horrific, horrific incident,\u201d Israel said. The FBI joined the investigation but said the probe was in its early stages. The suspect will face federal charges and will most likely make his first court appearance in Broward County on Monday, Piro said. He did not specify the charges, and declined to speculate about a motive, saying it was too early in the investigation. Agents have not ruled anything out, including the possibility of terrorism, he said. \"It is a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation.\" Hours after the shooting, most vehicles were still blocked from entering the closed airport, and authorities said it wasn\u2019t scheduled to open until 5 a.m. Saturday. BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

See more videos For some of those caught up in the attack, Friday was to have been the start of a voyage on one of the many cruises that depart Fort Lauderdale. Mark Lea, a 53-year-old financial adviser, had just arrived on a flight from Minnesota with his wife to catch a cruise to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. The couple collected their luggage and were about to leave the terminal when they heard three quick bursts of what they thought were firecrackers. They quickly realized, however, that a gunman had opened fire about 100 yards away. \u201cAt that point, people started frantically screaming and yelling and running for the exits,\u201d Lea said by telephone from the airport. \u201cPeople were kind of tripping over each other.\u201d He helped his wife to safety, then went back to aid others. He described the shooter as \u201cvery calm, very quiet, no emotions.\u201d The gunman, who was dressed in jeans and a blue polo shirt, was carrying what appeared to Lea to be a 9 mm handgun. He fired off a few dozen rounds near the luggage carousels, then dropped his gun to the ground and lay spread-eagle on the floor, waiting for sheriff\u2019s deputies to apprehend him, Lea said. \u201cThis whole thing took place in about 45 seconds and he was done,\u201d said Lea. Hours later, the couple was still waiting at the airport with other passengers to retrieve their luggage from the scene.\u00a0 Authorities moved passengers upstairs to the ticketing area to wait while they secured the crime scene. Travelers described huddling inside a restaurant in Terminal 2, using tables for cover, after the gunfire erupted\u00a0or ducking behind parked cars when they saw people running out the doors. Others told of surreal scenes that suddenly punctuated the tedium of a routine wait at the airport. Bruce Wagner, 55, and his husband were on their way to New York after an 11-day Caribbean cruise. They were sitting at their gate when they suddenly saw people running and screaming. The crowd stampeded for the exits, he said \u2013 but there was no way out except for the jetways for boarding planes. Alarms blared, and security officials struggled to open emergency exits leading down to the tarmac. \u201cEverybody just plowed through them, packed like sardines, shoving and pushing and screaming,\u201d Wagner said by phone, with alarms still screeching in the background. Some of those who ran outside stayed close to the terminals, but others fled as far as the runways. Authorities say a lone shooter opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale international airport, killing \"multiple\" people and wounding several others\u00a0before he was taken into custody. Finally passengers were let back inside, where people\u2019s bags and outerwear were strewn everywhere, and iPads were left still plugged in for charging in the melee. Only moments later, an apparently false alarm sent people fleeing again. \u201cIt was totally inept as far as security or any kind of safety,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt seems like nobody\u2019s had any experience or training.\u201d Josh Marsh, 24, described airline staff just one terminal over from the attack scene as being unaware of the shooting \u2013 even after he showed an agent social media reports of the shooting. \u201cNothing happened for a good 20 minutes,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cNo lockdown, no announcements, no nothing.\u201d Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was one of those caught up in the incident, tweeting that shots had been fired and \u201ceveryone was running.\u201d Shooting location at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport @latimesgraphics Shooting location at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Shooting location at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (@latimesgraphics) The Fort Lauderdale airport, about 25 miles north of Miami, is a major travel hub, with more than 70,000 people passing through daily, according to the airport. Security was stepped up at the larger Miami airport in the wake of the shooting. For some, the attack shattered a workday routine. Jayce Sisley, who lives in Fort Lauderdale and works as a flight attendant, said he was heading to the airport for work when worried friends and family began texting him about the shooting. His employer told him flights were still departing\u00a0and asked him to report for duty, but the pathway was blocked by emergency vehicles, he said, with officers waving off arriving cars. Panic spread rapidly. A traveler identified only as Ben told CBS\u2019 Miami affiliate that he was boarding a shuttle outside the terminal when he saw \u201ceveryone in a big pack just running as far as possible away from the shots.\u201d Sun-Sentinel coverage of the Florida airport shooting Open link \u201cIt was a scene of ambulances and police cars, trucks, all kinds of people with automatic weapons blocking all the exits,\u201d Sisley said. As he headed back from the airport, emergency vehicles roared past him, sirens blaring, he said. That\u2019s when the magnitude of the situation hit him. Even though he had received training for these types of incidents, Sisley said, it all\u00a0seemed unreal. \u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m worried.\u201d Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

(Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, Pool/Sputnik/European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The Director of National Intelligence released a 25-page declassified version of its report into alleged Russian hacking during the election campaign, concluding that the intent of the operation was to help get Donald Trump elected president. \"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\" said the report, which was the work of the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency. \"Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" The intelligence community first concluded in October that Russia was behind the hacking of emails belonging to Clinton campaign aides and the Democratic National Committee, alleging that Russia was attempting to interfere with the Democratic process\u00a0\u2014 but stopping short of suggesting that Russia was seeking any particular outcome. President Obama requested the\u00a0fuller report last month after Democratic members of Congress alleged that Russia's interference was one-sided, and had the intent of getting Trump elected. Friday's report noted that Putin and other Kremlin officials often praised Trump, who they saw as more Russia-friendly on issues like Syria and Ukraine. The report also said Moscow also saw the election of Trump \"as a way to achieve an international counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\" The report did not assess what impact the hacking had on the outcome of the presidential election, but made clear that the agencies did not believe any vote-counting systems were breached. The declassified version offers little new public evidence, and the document argued that revealing the full extent of intelligence on the hacking could jeopardize sources and methods. Indeed, much of the report is based on public press reports.\u00a0A seven-page annex to the report highlights the role that a Russian-owned television network, RT America, had in spreading Russian propaganda during the campaign. \"RT America TV, a Kremlin-financed channel operated from within the United States, has substantially expanded its repertoire of programming that highlights criticism of alleged US shortcomings in democracy and civil liberties,\" the report said. \"RT's criticism of the US election was the latest facet of its broader and longer-standing anti-US messaging likely aimed at undermining viewers' trust in US democratic procedures and undercutting US criticism of Russia's political system.\" Obama received the report Thursday, and Trump was briefed on the classified version on Friday . In a statement, Trump conceded that Russia and China \"are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee.\" He said hackers also attempted to break into Republican National Committee systems but were unsuccessful. Trump also insisted that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\" That remains a point of contention. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's conclusion that the Russian hacking had no effect \"is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense.\" \"It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying \u2013 which is true \u2013 it is another\u00a0 thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,\" said Schiff, who was breifed on the report with members of Congress Friday morning.\u00a0\"These conclusions are well-supported by the evidence and the report should put to rest any uncertainty as to Russian responsibility for this unprecedented interference in our internal affairs.\" 469 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 76 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i1ImvX NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

On his Twitter account, he said the shooter arrived in Fort Lauderdale aboard a flight with a gun in a checked bag. \"He claimed\u00a0his bag and took the gun from baggage and went into the bathroom to load it. Came out shooting people in baggage claim,\" LaMarca tweeted. A federal law enforcement official, who is not authorized to comment publicly on the case, identified the suspect as 26-year-old\u00a0Esteban Santiago.\u00a0Sen. Bill Nelson,\u00a0a Florida Democrat, said earlier that the gunman was carrying a military ID in that name. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale early Friday aboard a Delta flight that originated Thursday in Anchorage and passed through Minneapolis, the federal official said Friday. The official said the suspect apparently retrieved a handgun from his checked luggage and loaded it before launching an indiscriminate assault. In November, the suspect appeared unannounced in the FBI offices in Anchorage, complaining that the Islamic State had gained control of his mind and the terror group was urging him to fight on its behalf,the official said. The FBI conducted a background check, learning of his military record, which included service in Iraq, but found no connection to terror groups. Determining that the man apparently needed psychiatric care, the FBI alerted local law enforcement and turned him over to their custody for a medical referral.\u00a0It is not clear whether Santiago received treatment following that incident. Esteban Santiago pictured in the hospital with his newborn son in September 2016. \u00a0(Photo: (Photo: Keldy Ortiz/NorthJersey.com)) The official said Santiago worked in Anchorage in a security-related job and has a girlfriend and a child there. Santiago's aunt, Maria Ruiz, who lives in Union City, N.J., said her nephew is an Army veteran who served two years in Iraq and came back acting strangely. However, she said that he \u201cwas happy with the kid\u201d after the birth of his child last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d she said during an interview at her home Friday afternoon. Sheriff Israel\u00a0said authorities had not established a motive for the shooting and that it was too early to declare it a terrorist act. \"At this point, it looks like he acted alone,\" Israel told reporters. He called the shootings a \"horrific, horrific act.\" Florida suspect's aunt: \u2018I don't know why this happened\u2019 The melee, which erupted\u00a0around 1 p.m. EST, brought air traffic to a standstill at the heavily traveled airport. Some incoming flights were halted on the tarmac and were likely to be sent to another city without allowing\u00a0passengers to disembark, according to airport director Mark Gale. The\u00a0shooter, described\u00a0as slender, about 5-foot-7 and wearing a\u00a0blue T-shirt, did not say a word during the incident, calmly opening fire as he strolled\u00a0among passengers at a\u00a0baggage carousel in Terminal 2, which services Delta flights. Mark Lea, a witness among the passengers,\u00a0told\u00a0MSNBC the gunman was \"just randomly shooting people\" with a 9 mm pistol and only stopped after\u00a0emptying\u00a0about 3 magazines of bullets. \"He wasn't targeting anyone\u00a0particular,\" he\u00a0said. I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 Another witness,\u00a0John Schicher, told MSNBC the shooter appeared to be wearing a blue Star Wars T-shirt. A shooting victim arrives at Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., following a shooting at the Ft. Lauderdale International Airport Friday. \u00a0(Photo: Taimy Alvarez, AP) The shooting sent people scrambling\u00a0onto the tarmac, some carrying luggage. Others cowered behind cars. Video posted on Instagram appeared to show several people wounded in the baggage claim area of the terminal. One person appeared to be lying in a pool of blood with a head wound. Paramedics could also be seen treating a bleeding victim outside the airport. Hundreds of people stood on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called the shooting a \"senseless act of evil\" and added that he called\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump to keep him informed about the case. Early word on the incident came from a tweet by Ari Fleischer, former White House spokesman for President George W. Bush.\u00a0\"I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport,\" Fleischer tweeted. \"Shots have been fired.

    "text": "Trump tells Obama's ambassadors to leave by Inauguration Day By Jennifer G. Hickey Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is not allowing for any diplomatic dawdling. His transition team has issued a directive that all ambassadors appointed by President Obama must leave their posts by Inauguration Day, a source confirmed Friday. While it is standard for politically appointed ambassadors to step aside at the end of a presidential term, an individual with knowledge of the foreign service told\u00a0 FoxNews.com \u00a0that Trump\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to consider individual cases or exigencies\u201d appears to represent a break with protocol -- though the Obama administration appears to have done something similar.\u00a0 \u201c[The directive] in itself is not that significant. But it is more unyielding than in the past,\u201d he said. The New York Times \u00a0first reported that a State Department cable was sent to all ambassadors on Dec. 23 informing them they have to vacate their posts by Jan. 20 \u201cwithout exceptions.\u201d Ronald E. Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, told the Times that he could not \u201crecollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just, \u2018Everybody out of the pool immediately.\u2019\u201d However, Obama\u2019s transition team sent out similar guidance -- eight years ago -- telling ambassadors appointed by President George W. Bush they had to leave their posts by Inauguration Day. The Washington Post reported in December 2008 that ambassadors would not be permitted to stay on and that \u201cthe sweeping nature of the directive suggests that Obama has little interest in retaining any of Bush's ambassadorial appointees.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team has already named Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as ambassador to China and bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman to fill that role in Israel.\u00a0 Political appointees for ambassadorships under any administration are often well-connected donors or other officials who do not come from the career foreign service side. But despite the prospect of imminent vacancies at posts around the world, U.S. embassies are likely to retain leadership as deputies fill in for the short term.\u00a0 \u201cThe number twos are career foreign service officers and more than capable of stepping into the roles,\u201d said the source who spoke with FoxNews.com.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

It and ammunition must be disclosed to the airline prior to checking.\u00a0 Since Sept. 11, 2001, airports have seen a dramatic increase in security. But many parts of the terminals, like check-in and baggage claim, are outside secured areas and remain vulnerable soft targets.\u00a0 Many parts of airport terminals, like check-in and baggage claim, are outside secured areas and remain vulnerable soft targets.\u00a0 Close CBS Evening News Ron Hosko is a former assistant director of the FBI.\u00a0 \u201cOne of the great challenges of a soft target is, it\u2019s like squeezing a balloon,\u201d Hosko said. \u201cAnd where I tighten up my security in one place the balloon expands somewhere else and presents itself as another soft target.\u201d\u00a0 And he says securing areas like baggage claim in every airport would be a multi-billion dollar investment.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to put it in that broader perspective. You\u2019re more likely to die in a car accident on your way home than to be in a terrorist strike at a U.S. airport.\u201d\u00a0 Immediately after the shooting, airports across the country increased security. That included airports in the New York City area, Miami and Los Angeles. The LAX police chief said they\u2019re going to look at lessons learned from Fort Lauderdale to see what kind of changes they can make in L.A. to make the airport safer.\u00a0 CBS News was told that during the shooting, some passengers were told the safest place to be was on their airplane, and they stayed on the planes for hours.

    "text": "CBS/AP January 6, 2017, 1:19 PM Fort Lauderdale airport shooting leaves at least 5 dead Email Last Updated Jan 6, 2017 7:15 PM EST FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A gunman opened fire in the baggage claim area at the Fort Lauderdale airport Friday, killing five people and wounding eight before being taken into custody in an attack that sent panicked passengers running out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, authorities said. The gunman was identified as Esteban Santiago-Ruiz , 26, who had active-duty military identification on him and was born in New Jersey, law enforcement sources told CBS News. Esteban Santiago Law enforcement sources Federal law enforcement officials told CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues that Santiago-Ruiz had gotten in an argument on one leg of his flight from Alaska to Florida, and the second leg of the trip was on a Delta flight.\u00a0 The motive remains under investigation. Law enforcement officials said there is no immediate link to terrorism. FBI sources told CBS News\u2019 Pat Milton that they ran a full database check on Santiago-Ruiz, and they found no connection to terror groups. They are currently investigating the argument, sources said.\u00a0 In Nov. 2016, Santiago-Ruiz walked into an FBI office in Anchorage and claimed he was being forced to fight for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), law enforcement sources told CBS News. He also said his mind was being controlled by the CIA to watch ISIS videos, sources said. He was sent to a psychiatric hospital after police were called, sources said.\u00a0 He was also investigated as part of a child porn investigation in either 2011 or 2012, law enforcement sources told CBS News. Three weapons and a computer were seized, but no charges were filed, sources said.\u00a0 Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said it was unclear whether the military ID was the gunman\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a motive at this point,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThis could well be someone who is mentally deranged, or in fact it could be someone who had a much more sinister motive that we have to worry about every day, and that is terrorism. We can\u2019t conclude that.\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott gave a press conference at 5:15 p.m. ET and said he had reached out to President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \u201cThis is a senseless act of evil,\u201d Scott said.\u00a0 President Obama was briefed by his homeland security adviser, the White House said. In a statement from the White House, Mr. Obama \u201cextended his sincere condolence\u201d to the victims.\u00a0 A witness, Mark Lea, told CBSN the shooter appeared to be in his mid-twenties, and described it as \u201crandom shooting.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cJust shooting people that were ducked behind, underneath the chairs ... people were yelling, screaming, frantically trying to get out of any door they could, or hide under chairs, luggage to do anything they could to get out of the line of fire.\u201d Lea said the shooter was \u201ccalm as can be ... he just walked in and started shooting. He wasn\u2019t frantic, he wasn\u2019t psychotic.\u201d\u00a0 Lea said he was 50 feet away from the gunman, who was carrying a 9-mm weapon. Lea estimated that the suspect shot about 24 rounds.\u00a0 Lea said that after firing the shots, the gunman walked out of \u201cdoor 2\u201d and \u201clay spread-eagle on the floor and waited for law enforcement to arrive.\u201d\u00a0 Fort Lauderdale airport shooting witness Mark Lea recounts what he saw to CBSN, as police continue sweeping the airport terminals. He told CBS Minnesota that \u201cpeople started yelling and screaming running for any exit they could.\u201d \u201cIt sounded at first like firecrackers, and then we figured out what actually was going on. There was actually a shooter,\u201d \u00a0Lea told CBS Minnesota.\u00a0 Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport Police and Fire Department chief Jesse Davis told CBS News that Santiago-Ruiz checked in at that airport at 5:23 p.m., and said he checked a firearm into his baggage. Nothing about the check-in aroused suspicion, Davis said.\u00a0 Scores of travelers were seen milling about on the tarmac near the Delta Airlines terminal after a deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood I... \u201cAfter he claimed his bag, he went into the bathroom and loaded the gun and started shooting. We don\u2019t know why,\u201d LaMarca said. It is legal for airline passengers to carry guns and ammunition as long as the firearms are put in a checked bag - not in a carry-on - and are unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Guns must be declared to the airline at check-in. Air Canada said that it had no record of the suspect as a passenger or of checked guns on its flights to Fort Lauderdale. Delta did not comment if the suspect took one of their flights, but issued a statement to CBS News that the airline is cooperating with the investigation.\u00a0 \u201cSpecially trained Delta Care Team members have been activated and are traveling to Fort Lauderdale to assist families and friends of customers and employees who may have been impacted by the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport,\u201d Delta wrote in a statement.\u00a0 A man with a bleeding wound sits on a curb during a shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Jan. 6, 2017. Courtesy Maxwill Solutions The attack took place at Terminal 2, which serves Delta Air Lines and Air Canada. Israel said five people were killed and eight were wounded. Their condition was not disclosed. He said the gunman was arrested unharmed, with no law enforcement officers firing any shots, and was being questioned by the FBI. The sheriff urged people to not call 911 for information about the shooting. Facebook enabled its safety check feature so users could report their status on the social media platform. Please don't tie up 911. Call-takers have no info. If you must call, dial our non-emergency number: 954-764-4357. \u2014 Broward Sheriff (@browardsheriff) January 6, 2017 The airport suspended operations as law enforcement authorities rushed to the scene and emergency medical workers treated at least one bleeding victim on the tarmac. People spilled onto the tarmac, some carrying luggage, and some ran from both Terminals 1 and 2, hiding behind cars or anything else they could find to shield themselves. Video posted on Instagram appeared to show several people wounded in the baggage claim area of the terminal. One person appeared to be lying in a pool of blood with a head wound.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Paramedics could also be seen treating a bleeding victim outside the airport. Hundreds of people stood on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. Flights already in the air and headed for the airport were delayed or diverted, and those that had yet to take off for Fort Lauderdale were held on the ground. Nearly an hour after the sheriff\u2019s office said a suspect was in custody, people started running across the tarmac,\u00a0 CBS Miami station WFOR-TV reports . Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters there was no confirmation of any additional shooting. \u201cAt this point it looks like he acted alone,\u201d Israel said. John Schilcher told Fox News said he came up to the baggage claim and heard the first gunshot as he picked up his bag off a carousel. \u201cThe person next to me fell to the ground and then I started hearing other pops. And as this happened, other people started falling and you could hear it and smell it, and people on either side of me were going down and I just dropped to the ground,\u201d said Schilcher, who was there with his wife and mother-in-law. \u201cThe firing just went on and on,\u201d he said. He said the gunman emptied his weapon and reloaded, and \u201cit was eerily quiet.\u201d \u201cI was down on the floor, when we finally looked up there was a policeman standing over me,\u201d Schilcher said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I assumed it was safe.\u201d Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tweeted that he was at the airport when shots were fired and \u201ceveryone is running.\u201d I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Lauderdale shooting suspect made confused visit to FBI, said US intelligence forced him to watch ISIS videos Published               January 06, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Travelers and airport workers are evacuated out of the terminal after airport shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida, U.S., January 6, 2017.   REUTERS/Andrew Innerarity - RTX2XT74 Estaban Santiago, the 26-year-old airline passenger accused of shooting up a baggage claim area at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood airport Friday, leaving five dead and eight injured, visited the FBI Anchorage field office and told officers he was being forced to watch ISIS videos, law enforcement sources told Fox News. The visit took place last November. The sources said Santiago told agents that US intelligence had infiltrated his mind and were forcing him to watch ISIS propaganda videos. In addition, the sources told Fox that Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent during that interview, clearly indicating he was suffering from some kind of mental condition. After the contact with Santiago, the FBI called local authorities who took custody of him and brought him to a local hospital for a welfare check. Law enforcement walk outside a terminal after a shooter opened fire at a baggage carousel at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S., January 6, 2017.   REUTERS/Zachary Fagenson - RTX2XTJ5 His brother said he had been receiving psychological treatment recently, according to the Associated Press. The sources also said the November interaction with Santiago prompted the FBI to open an investigation on him that led to interviews with family members, database checks and an interagency review. The sources told Fox that the FBI found no connections to foreign terror organizations. However, he has had a series of run-ins with the law in recent years. Almost exactly a year ago, he was charged with fourth-degree assault and damage of property in Anchorage, Alaska where he lived from 2014 to 2016. One of the charges was dismissed by the local prosecutor two months later, according to records found by Foxnews.com. Details surrounding the incident were not immediately clear but authorities in Anchorage told\u00a0 the Daily Beast \u00a0it was\u00a0related to domestic violence. The case was resolved after Santiago agreed to enter an agreement of deferred prosecution. The charges were dismissed by the state prosecutor in exchange for completion of requirements. Other records show that Santiago was evicted from his apartment in February 2015 for non-payment of $435 in rent. Santiago also has a record for minor traffic infractions, including driving with a broken taillight and another incident in which he was found driving without insurance. Santiago was born in New Jersey and his family was originally from Puerto Rico--where he served in the Puerto Rico National Guard. He was in the Army Reserves prior to serving in the Alaska Army National Guard. According to reports, he was honorably discharged four months ago from his last post at Fort Greely, Arkansas, and his military rank at that time was E3 (Private First Class). He also has a concealed carry permit and had checked in his weapon prior to boarding. Santiago\u2019s aunt, who lives in Hudson County, New Jersey, spoke with a reporters from local newspaper The Record of North Jersey on Friday evening. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d Maria Ruiz said to reporters at her home in Union City as FBI agents arrived. The distraught relative said that Santiago had served two years in Iraq and started acting strangely when he returned. He also became a father in the past year and she told reporters that he \u201cwas happy with the kid.\u201d It was early Friday afternoon when the mayhem first broke out at Fort Lauderdale airport. Five people were shot dead after Santiago allegedly opened fire at a baggage claim area in Terminal Two. Witness and investigators said the suspect shot some of his victims in the head without saying a word. In the ensuing panic, the TSA received two separate, unconfirmed reports of a separate active shooter, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told Fox News. However, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Friday afternoon there was no indication any additional shots were fired. Broward County Commissioner Chip La Marca posted on Facebook that Santiago was a \u201cpassenger on a Canadian flight with a checked gun. He claimed his bag and took the gun from baggage and went into the bathroom to load it. Came out shooting people in baggage claim. There were 13 total shot, 5 dead, 8 transported to hospital.\u201d Witnesses at the shooting scene told Fox News that the shooter was a slender man with dark hair, likely in his 30s and wearing a Star Wars t-shirt. It is believed that he boarded a plane in Anchorage last night and flew overnight to Fort Lauderdale. Santiago was taken into custody without incident and was unhurt. Law enforcement never fired any shots, Israel said. \"This scene is considered fluid and active.\" The sheriff said it was not clear why he chose to open fire. \"It was very surreal,\" John Schlicher, a witness, told Fox News. \"He did not say a word. \"He was shooting people that were down on the ground, too.\" Fox News' Matthew Dean contributed to this report Advertisement ",

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 American intelligence officials have concluded that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin , personally \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\u201d and turned from seeking to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Hillary Clinton to developing \u201ca clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d The conclusions were part of a declassified intelligence report, ordered by President Obama , that was released on Friday. Its main determinations were described to Mr. Trump by the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials earlier in the day, and he responded by acknowledging, for the first time, that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee \u2019s computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had no effect on the election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin, at some point last year, decided to aid his candidacy. The report, a damning and surprisingly detailed account of Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine the American electoral system and Mrs. Clinton in particular, went on to assess that Mr. Putin had \u201caspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\u201d The report described a broad campaign that included covert operations, including cyberactivities and \u201ctrolling\u201d on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia\u2019s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining \u201caccess to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,\u201d it concluded \u2014 as officials have publicly \u2014 that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8.
