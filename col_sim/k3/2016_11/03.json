    "text": "By David Nakamura November 2 at 11:46 AM Follow @davidnakamura President Obama addressed the FBI's announcement of new emails linked to Hillary Clinton, saying \"I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don't operate on innuendo and we don't operate on incomplete information and we don't operate on leaks.\" (Reuters) President Obama briefly addressed the FBI's reopened investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices for the first time, saying in an interview posted Wednesday that the agency does not \u201coperate on innuendo\" and emphasizing that there is no evidence that the Democratic presidential nominee violated the law. \u201cI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo, and we don't operate on incomplete information, and we don't operate on leaks,\u201d Obama said in the interview with NowThis News, which was filmed Tuesday. \u201cWe operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations, was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable.\u201d [ After another release of documents, FBI finds itself caught in a partisan fray ] The president's remarks came several days after FBI Director James B. Comey's surprise announcement Friday that agents would review thousands of emails potentially connected to Clinton that were discovered as part of a separate inquiry into former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is married to a high-ranking Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. President Obama breaks silence on Comey for first time -- \"We don't operate on innuendo\" ... Here's what he said: https://t.co/zEp13uqCrR \u2014 Jason Morrell (@CNNJason) November 2, 2016 \"I've made a very deliberate effort to make sure that I don't look like I'm meddling in what are supposed to be independent processes for making these assessments,\" Obama said. Of Clinton, he added: \"Setting aside the particulars of this case, I know that she is somebody who has always looked out for the interests of America and the American people first.\" Obama had not mentioned the case during recent appearances at Clinton campaign rallies in Florida and Ohio. This week, press secretary Josh Earnest said the White House would neither \u201cdefend nor criticize\u201d Comey's actions. Earnest also referred to the FBI chief as a man of integrity and good character. But Comey's disclosure, made in a notice to Congress that leaked to reporters, has prompted strong\u00a0criticism of the FBI from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers who have questioned whether Comey violated Justice Department policies by making a decision so close to Election Day that risked shaking up a political campaign. Speaking to reporters Oct. 31., White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama believes FBI Director James Comey is a man of integrity and is not trying to influence the U.S. presidential election by announcing scrutiny of additional emails linked to Democrat Hillary Clinton's private server. (Reuters) \u201cThe president doesn't believe that [Comey] is\u00a0secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party,\u201d Earnest told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cHe's in a tough spot, and he's the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions in administrations led by presidents in both parties.\u201d Aboard Air Force One on Obama's trip to a Clinton rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday, another White House spokesman insisted that \"nothing changed\" on the White House view of Comey despite Obama's remarks in the interview. The president does \"take seriously the longstanding norms and customs\" that have historically limited what law enforcement can say about a pending investigation, the spokesman, Eric Schultz, said. \"You will see the president went out of his way to say he wasn't going to comment on any specific investigation,\" he added. Though the race between Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump already had been narrowing, according to public polls, Clinton has lost more of her lead since Comey's announcement; polls on Wednesday showed the two candidates in a dead heat nationally. A new Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll finds Trump now holds an edge on which candidate is honest and trustworthy, while 59 percent disapproved of Clinton's handling of her email on a personal server while serving as secretary of state. In July, Comey said the FBI's investigation into 30,000 State Department emails that passed through Clinton's private server found that 110 contained classified information at the time she sent or received them, and a \"very small number\" included markings as such. He called Clinton and her aides \"extremely careless\" in their use of email, and suggested that hostile foreign governments could have gained access to them. But he recommended against criminal prosecution, saying there was no evidence that Clinton and her team had intentionally mishandled the information. Obama's interview with NowThis was scheduled as part of a final week campaign blitz as the president seeks to help Clinton by boosting Democratic voter turnout among young people and other groups that heavily supported his victories in 2008 and 2012. politics ",

    "text": "Streets clear as Cubs fans rush to find prime spots to watch Game 7 Photo of Cubs fans during\u00a0the World Series games.\u00a0 Tony Briscoe , John Keilman and Dan Hinkel Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Chicago ground to a halt Wednesday as the Cubs took the field for a winner-take-all Game 7 and a chance to make history. Throughout the city and suburbs, fans gathered in bars, community centers and neighbor's homes to see if a 108-year-dream would finally come true \u2014 or if they would find themselves, once again, waiting for next year. And with the region's attention fully focused on the North Side, malls emptied, streets cleared and restaurants closed early. Less than an hour before the first pitch, Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg \u2014 arguably the highest high temple of consumerism in the northwest suburbs \u2014 was virtually a ghost town. A few bands of teens stalked the promenades, and small knots of people meandered from store to store, but it was not a usual Wednesday night. \"This is so slow,\" guest service representative Luis Maldonado said. \"I'm sure it's the Cubs game.\" Cubs fans Game 7 Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune Four Dominican Sisters, who teach at St. Ignatius, borrow a \"W\" flag from two boys Wednesday and ask them to take their picture by Wrigley Field. Four Dominican Sisters, who teach at St. Ignatius, borrow a \"W\" flag from two boys Wednesday and ask them to take their picture by Wrigley Field. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) To be sure, the city has been enthralled with the Cubs for the past month as the team fought through 17 playoff games and gave its fan base countless thrills along with the occasional scare. Watch parties popped up in the most unlikely places: people's backyards, liquor stores and even on the South Side, where an enmity toward the North Side is a birthright. The West Pullman neighborhood on Chicago's South Side is White Sox territory, but the Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center mounted a massive screen in a meeting room where Cubs fans could gather. Only a few were there at the start of the game, but Dexter Fowler's leadoff home run quickly drew a crowd. \"All right, we got a home run already? Yes! Yes! Tee off! Tee off!\" said Darryl Wren, an IT specialist. Wren, wearing a personalized pinstriped jersey, said a Cubs victory would provide a big lift to both sides of town. \"It would be fantastic,\" he said. \"I think most of America is rooting for the Cubs and rightfully so. This would be pretty big. I'd put this up with the 1985 Bears.\" Game 7. World Series . \"I said I wanted to see the Cubs win the World Series before the good Lord takes me, so here I am with my grandson and my son,\" Tom Brown, 84, said as he rested beneath the Progressive Field marquee near the home plate gate. \"If we win, I can go... This is happening, Cubs fans. Game 7. World Series . \"I said I wanted to see the Cubs win the World Series before the good Lord takes me, so here I am with my grandson and my son,\" Tom Brown, 84, said as he rested beneath the Progressive Field marquee near the home plate gate. \"If we win, I can go... (Patrick M. O'Connell) Back on the North Side, Cubs fans flocked to Wrigleyville to watch the game despite pouring rain, flashes of lightning and the team playing in Cleveland. Among the jubilant masses was Jim Griffin, who drove 81/2 hours from Memphis, Tenn., to watch the game with family members at Smoke Show, a neighborhood restaurant. A World Series title, Griffin said, would validate a lifetime of long suffering fandom. All those times when they were not in it, those games in July or August when they absolutely had no chance. \"I just had to be here with my friends and family, to be as close to the game as possible,\" he said. \"You can feel the energy and not even the rain is going to stop it.\" Over at Wrigley Field , Cecile Blot stood with a piece of blue chalk in her hand and tears in her eyes. She had joined hundreds of other fans in writing messages on the brick wall on the east side of the park. Her contribution: her father's name next to a heart. A lifelong Cubs fan, her father had died earlier this year and she flew in Wednesday morning from Washington, D.C., to make sure he was part of the celebration he didn't live long enough to see. \"It's kind of bittersweet,\" Blot said. \"He would have been really happy. The Cubs are playing so well, he would have been so excited.\" In Logan Square, clusters of people in Cubs gear smoked outside Whirlaway Lounge in a light rain while others posted up on stools at the bar to guarantee themselves prime real estate after 7 p.m. The bar is a popular spot to watch sports and an oasis of old-time tavern style in a neighborhood increasingly populated by $12 cocktails and farm-to-table restaurants.

(Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune) Fans outside Wrigley Field describe their varying stress levels before Game 7 of the World Series on Nov. 2, 2016. (Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune) Owner Maria Jaimes and her son, Sergio, poured drinks in their blue Cubs jerseys. The mother, who lives in an apartment adjoining the bar her family has owned since 1980, predicted a Cubs win \u2014 \"of course.\" Her son was an usher at Wrigley Field in the 1990s, and her father played baseball in her native Mexico. Jaimes, who came to the United States in 1974, said that her bar will turn to other sports pursuits after Wednesday night. But she wanted a victory. \"I will be so happy it will last me the entire year,\" she said. Chicago Tribune's Matt Walberg, Grace Wong and Stacy St. Clair contributed. ",

Donald Trump speaks in Charlotte on Oct. 26, 2016. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) My fellow Americans, early in my campaign for the Republican nomination for president, I was asked by a reporter whether I had ever felt the need to ask for God\u2019s forgiveness . I responded by saying I didn\u2019t think I ever had. That was a stupid thing for anyone to say \u2014 but especially me! I\u2019ve now concluded I not only need to seek God\u2019s forgiveness for many things, I also need to ask for forgiveness from so many others. But let me start with God. I\u2019ve said that his book \u2014 the Bible \u2014 is the greatest book I\u2019ve ever read; yet I\u2019ve largely ignored what it teaches us about pride. God hates pride. The New Testament says, \u201cGod opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble \u201d (James 4:6). Without a doubt, my life has been marked more by pride than by humility. I have come to the realization that everything I have or have accomplished is because of God \u2014 for it is he who blesses us with intelligence, health and the ability to make wealth. Today, I publicly confess my pride and ask for God\u2019s forgiveness. I also confess that I have, far too often, used language better associated with a construction site than with the White House \u2014 or any house. I am not proud of much of the language I have used, and I apologize to Americans everywhere \u2014 especially to young people who should be able to look up to anyone running for president. I commit to no longer speak in a way that would diminish the dignity that the office of president rightly merits. America deserves better. Next, I want to apologize to reporter Serge Kovaleski for publicly mocking your physical disability. I showed tremendous disrespect to you and the millions of Americans living with a disability of one kind or another. I wish I could take it back and hope you will forgive me. I\u2019m sorry. Sen. John\u00a0McCain, I\u2019m sorry for disparaging your service to our country by mocking your capture. I was wrong and offer no excuse for it. I know I\u2019m late, but I\u2019m asking you to forgive me. What you sacrificed for our nation and my freedom is beyond heroic,\u00a0and I salute you, sir! The GOP may not survive the Trump takeover: Max Boot Megyn Kelly, I apologize for calling you names and mistreating you; please forgive me. I realize that you, along with thousands of men and women who choose to be reporters, are just trying to do your job. In putting myself forward to run for president, I should have been more respectful of you and all those trying to provide the public with information and insight on this important campaign. I\u2019m sorry I mistreated you; I\u2019m sorry I have repeatedly called the press such ugly names. I have been to parts of the world that don\u2019t have a free press, and I am thankful for our system. I also recognize I was blessed with hundreds of millions of dollars of media attention I didn\u2019t have to pay for, so I certainly should not protest every story I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m sorry I treated Jeb Bush so poorly during the primaries. Jeb, you and your family have an admirable record of public service to our nation, and I apologize for calling you names and not showing you the respect you deserve. Please forgive me \u2014 you would have been a fine president. I\u2019m sorry for things I said about most of my Republican primary opponents \u2014 Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and others. Just because politics is a contact sport is no excuse for behaving the way I have far too often. These men and women might\u00a0have been political adversaries \u2014 but they are also people, people who sacrificed much to seek the same office I now seek, and all people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. I don\u2019t deserve their forgiveness, but I\u2019m humbly asking for it. Mitt Romney, I now know just how hard it is to run for president \u2014 and you did it twice! Please forgive me for calling you a loser and a choke artist \u2014 two labels many will no doubt place on me, should I be unsuccessful on Election Day. You, sir, exemplify class, dignity, character, integrity and faith. You are a national model of a good husband, father and grandfather. Frankly, I\u2019m sorry we aren\u2019t all working for your re-election this year! Then, I want to apologize to the people of Mexico for painting an entire nation with the kind of broad-brush stereotype that has no place in political discourse \u2014 or modern life, for that matter. I\u2019m sorry, and win or lose, I hope to earn your respect and trust. That anyone from Mexico \u2014 or any other country \u2014 would risk everything to seek the kind of opportunity and freedom this land has to offer is a tribute to America, and those who pursue it should not be disparaged. From now on, I will discuss and debate policy without ascribing negative labels or cheap stereotypes to those most affected by it. I must also apologize to the loving parents of a slain Muslim-American soldier. Just because Khizr and Ghazala Khan \u00a0appeared at the Democratic convention in support of my opponent does not mean they are not deserving of my utmost respect and appreciation for their son\u2019s sacrifice to protect the freedoms I enjoy every day. Mr. and Mrs. Khan, I take my hat off to you, and all of our Gold Star families \u2014 regardless of political affiliation \u2014 and respectfully ask for your forgiveness. It\u2019s past time to apologize for demeaning women as I clearly have by talking about them as objects to be exploited for personal pleasure. This behavior should not be dismissed as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d It is vulgar and reprehensible, and has no place in public or private life. I\u2019m ashamed and I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t expect forgiveness for this one, but I\u2019ll ask anyway. I owe Alicia Machado a public apology as well; please forgive me for judging any woman by her physical appearance or weight, rather than by her inner spirit and heart. I\u2019m sorry, Alicia. Right message, horribly wrong messenger: Linda Killian Throughout this campaign many of my surrogates, staff members and supporters have tried to explain my hurtful words and often mean-spirited behavior by saying things like, \u201cHe\u2019s not a trained politician; he\u2019s not politically correct; he just says what\u2019s on his mind.\u201d Or, \u201cHe\u2019s a counter puncher; he just hits back when someone hits him first.\u201d None of us would accept these excuses from our children or co-workers, and you should not accept them from or on behalf of me. So, I also want to apologize to all of these folks who have sacrificed personal reputation and credibility in their efforts to make excuses for behavior of mine that was simply inexcusable. While much of my own behavior and speech have\u00a0had many defenders, I must be honest \u2014 it simply has no defense. I especially apologize to the many evangelical leaders who defended and promoted me against their own moral and biblical convictions and beliefs about character, for I have no doubt cost you much moral authority in future elections. Secretary Hillary Clinton, I want to apologize for calling you names and inciting hatred toward you and your husband. Our political differences are many, but you have given your life to public service, and that is still a noble calling. If I win, I will want your help. If you win, you can count on my support. America deserves our cooperation. My candidacy for this nomination was launched, and succeeded, in response to deep-seated anger from people across this land \u2014 people who believe their government has been taken from them and no longer serves and protects them. I was upset when many of these people supporting me were referred to as deplorables\u00a0\u2014 yet I recognize now, I am the one who has been deplorable. I\u2019m sorry! POLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0 look at race, justice, media I realize that the best way to make America great again is to appeal to our collective better angels, not to our shrillest tones and most divisive words. For nearly 70 years I\u2019ve been blessed far beyond anything I could have imagined, and certainly beyond anything I deserve. I want to now give back and serve the country that has provided so much opportunity and blessing for me. I want to serve in a way befitting of the office I seek in the land that is still the greatest on earth. Finally, I fully expect many people to be skeptical of these apologies and appeals for forgiveness \u2014 after all, I\u2019m trailing nationally in the final weeks of a presidential campaign. I understand such skepticism and have no doubt my sincerity will be questioned across this country. Believe me, I am well aware that my own actions in the days and weeks ahead will have to prove my sincerity, and I intend to work hard to earn the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019ll let you be the judge. This much I know \u2014 win or lose, apologizing and asking forgiveness is the right thing to do and I\u2019ll be better for it. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless America. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Molly Hennessy-Fiske Contact Reporter Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Iraqi city of Mosul streamed Wednesday into this village on the city\u2019s eastern edge: Men with beards and women in veils, walking along the main road toting children and suitcases. \u201cWe told civilians to stay in their homes,\u201d Iraqi special forces Lt. Col. Ali Hussein Fadil said as his Humvee passed the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see them walking like this. They are potential dangers for us.\u201d Troops have encountered suicide bombers in recent days as young as 10 years old. \u201cWhen kids are approaching us, we are trying to move them back and not get close,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust those people.\u201d Iraqi civilians flee Mosul area, white flags flying As Iraqis flee the Mosul area, they and the Iraqi military fear Islamic State fighters may have put on civilian clothing and joined the flood. (Molly Hennessy-Fiske / Los Angeles Times) As Iraqis flee the Mosul area, they and the Iraqi military fear Islamic State fighters may have put on civilian clothing and joined the flood. (Molly Hennessy-Fiske / Los Angeles Times) See more videos Iraqi government forces took a brief pause Wednesday in their 2-week-old offensive to retake Mosul from Islamic State , working to clear jihadi fighters from these outlying suburbs and to handle the flood of civilians who are fleeing Iraq\u2019s second-largest city. Meanwhile, Shiite Muslim forces who entered the fight last week reported they had gained control of a main highway linking Mosul to Islamic State\u2019s other main stronghold in Raqqah, Syria \u2014 a move they said will enable them to cut a main supply line to Islamic State forces in the city. More than 18,000 people have been displaced from their homes since the Mosul offensive started on Oct. 17, according to the United Nations, and humanitarian agencies are preparing for an even greater flood as the fighting in the city escalates. Aid workers \u201care now bracing ... for the worst. The lives of 1.2 million civilians are in grave danger, and the future of all of Iraq is now in the balance,\" said Wolfgang Gressmann, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq. Hussein\u2019s battalion has taken over a half dozen villages, but Gogjali was the first area that was inhabited, and soldiers were preparing for the possibility that some of those leaving  could be Islamic State fighters disguised as civilians. (Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Laura King) The Iraqi commander advised his soldiers to deal fairly with residents as they cleared and secured the area, but also to be suspicious. The risk would only increase the closer they crept to \u00a0Mosul\u2019s urban core. Fleeing Islamic State fighters shot at departing civilians as they left and took with them as hostages a half dozen of those who had relatives in the security forces, residents\u00a0and soldiers said. Iraqi forces killed eight of the militants, who attacked with suicide car bombs and mortars. A 14-year-old girl was killed when her house was hit by a mortar strike. Two other children were injured: a 9-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. As a day of clouds gave way to clearer skies, U.S. coalition planes resumed flying  and airstrikes boomed on the horizon. Elsewhere in town, smaller booms sounded as Iraqi soldiers defused mines. Hussein passed houses displaying white flags signaling their surrender. Residents emerged carrying tea for the soldiers. Children waved. Others just looked on, wide-eyed. A soldier asked one resident why he hadn\u2019t shaved. He said they still didn\u2019t have electricity. Hussein was looking for Islamic State fighters. He had found one of their cellphones, and had a list of names. \u201cIf I give you a name, can you help?\u201d the commander asked a small group of men standing in the dirt road. Awat Suleiman, 55, nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready to help,\u201d he said. But when Hussein said he was looking for a local Islamic State fighter named Omar Abdel Salem, the man clammed up. \u201cI don\u2019t know him,\u201d he said, stone-faced. The rest of the crowd stood silent. Hussein smiled ruefully as he walked away, shaking his head. \u201cAlways they are saying they don\u2019t know them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still afraid that the army will withdraw and ISIS will come again.\u201d Pentagon fears killing civilians from the air as battle for Mosul intensifies \u00bb He walked to a local cement plant where his troops had fought Islamic State militants the day before, and pointed in the rubble to a body of a militant they had killed. The bearded man was unarmed and shirtless, wearing blue shorts and Nike sandals. He had fled after confronting the Iraqi special forces and was shot in the face. \u201cHe removed his ISIS uniform and was trying to dress as a civilian,\u201d Hussein said. The fighter was not alone in attempting to blend in with fleeing civilians. At a red house that had served as an Islamic State base, Hussein pointed to several brown uniforms discarded on the patio. Some civilians here have been helpful, showing soldiers where militants were hiding and where they had placed mines so they could be defused, said Sgt. Maj. Hattab Bashir Rashid. Hussein found one of the explosives in the doorway of the home of a known Islamic State fighter. Rashid, 37, said he has five children at home in nearby Dohuk and cannot help but think of his own family when he sees those fleeing the escalating fight in Mosul. \u201cTo liberate families is our duty. We can\u2019t do more than this,\u201d he said as his Humvee passed the fleeing crowds of civilians. \u201cAfter us, intelligence groups will come and do screenings. Those who committed crimes will be judged and go to prison. Others we will welcome.\u201d ",

    "text": "The polls might seem wild right now, but this election is closing a lot like the last one did A polling place in San Jose Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press Outside the Santa Clara County registrar of voters office last month. Outside the Santa Clara County registrar of voters office last month. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) David Lauter Contact Reporter Charles Franklin is hardly a household name, but for a few minutes Wednesday, the full spotlight of the 2016 presidential campaign focused on the veteran pollster and political scientist as he unveiled the latest results from his closely followed poll of Wisconsin voters. When he announced the verdict: Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump 46%-40% \u2014\u00a0almost identical to the margin the poll had found in early October \u2014 sighs of relief from Democratic activists could be heard from Brooklyn to Santa Monica.\u00a0 For Democrats , who, as a tribe, seem more inclined to election-season\u00a0night terrors than their Republican foes, these are anxious days. After the final presidential debate last month, they had begun to pinch themselves and talk of landslides. No more. In recent days, once high-flying polls for Clinton have come back to earth. Indeed, in an ironic\u00a0\u2014\u00a0yet, in hindsight, predictable \u2014 fashion, the 2016 campaign, after all the controversy and twists, is ending in a familiar way, almost identical to the last days of the race four years ago. The Democratic nominee is moving down the final stretch with a small lead while the Republican scrambles to find a way to flip blue states. That scenario is testimony to the tremendous pull that partisanship exerts over presidential elections, almost regardless of the specifics of the candidates. In a closely divided country, it means yet another contest that will leave many voters feeling whiplash. Even though far fewer polls have been conducted this year than in the last election, social media has made them more available and ubiquitous than ever. News headlines highlight the variations from one survey to the next \u2014 the inevitable product of the laws of probability \u2014\u00a0driving many voters to distraction as they check Twitter for the latest bulletin. But interviews with leading pollsters in both parties Wednesday found widespread agreement on several points: Although Trump seems all but certain to perform better with blue-collar\u00a0white voters than Mitt Romney did four years ago, those gains are being offset by losses among suburban, college-educated voters, especially women. The lineup of states may shift slightly from 2012 \u2014\u00a0Clinton may win North Carolina, which President Obama lost, but lose Ohio, which Obama carried \u2014\u00a0but Trump, so far, has not been able to break the Democrats\u2019 hold on the states they need for an\u00a0electoral majority.\u00a0 Last Friday\u2019s news from FBI Director James B. Comey that agents would\u00a0be examining additional emails that may be related to Clinton has had a small, but mostly transient, influence on the race. And Clinton holds\u00a0a lead roughly similar to Obama\u2019s 4-point margin of victory from four years ago. How to get to 270 electoral votes \u00bb Some polls, of course, continue to show a path to victory for Trump. A tracking poll by ABC and the Washington Post , which last week showed Clinton holding a double-digit lead, now finds her and Trump tied at\u00a046%. And the USC/Los Angeles Times \u201cDaybreak\u201d tracking poll , which has consistently shown a better result for Trump than most other surveys, gave him a 5-point lead, 47.8% to 42.4%. In both parties, however, experienced pollsters don\u2019t see the race that way. Neil Newhouse, who served as Romney\u2019s\u00a0chief pollster four years ago, said Comey\u2019s news \u201cput the brakes\u201d on what was starting to look like a runaway victory for Clinton, but that she was still ahead by 2 to 4 percentage points. \u201cHillary is still likely to win,\u201d Newhouse said, even if that means \u201climping across the finish line.\u201d\u00a0 On the Democratic side, Anna Greenberg, whose firm polls for many of the party\u2019s Senate and congressional candidates, called the race \u201cpretty stable.\u201d \u201cThere has been narrowing, which was to be expected. Trump was always going to consolidate more Republicans, and I don't think Clinton was ever going to win by 10 to 12 points\u201d \u2014\u00a0as some surveys had shown in the days after the final presidential debate Oct. 19 \u2014\u00a0she said. The big impact of a tighter race, she and Republican pollsters said, could be to improve the chances of Republicans in down-ballot races by encouraging GOP turnout. Indeed,\u00a0 the Wisconsin poll, released by Marquette University Law School , found that the Senate race between Republican incumbent Ron Johnson and former Sen. Russ Feingold had narrowed to a near tie. Other Senate races, such as those in North Carolina, Indiana and Missouri, also appear headed to extremely close finishes, with control of the chamber up for grabs .\u00a0 ",

White House officials later played down Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks about the F.B.I. and insisted he had not meant to criticize Mr. Comey. \u201cThe president went out of his way to say he wouldn\u2019t comment on any particular investigations,\u201d Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, told reporters on Air Force One while Mr. Obama was en route to North Carolina to campaign for Mrs. Clinton. Photo Hillary Clinton with members of her staff aboard her campaign plane en route to Las Vegas on Wednesday. President Obama lauded Mrs. Clinton in Chapel Hill. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Mr. Schultz characterized Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks as mirroring those made in recent days by the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, who had said that while the White House would not criticize Mr. Comey\u2019s decision to update Congress on the status of a continuing investigation, Mr. Obama believed that rules intended to keep such investigations confidential were good ones and should be followed. Much is unknown about the newly discovered emails, including why they were on Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop in the first place. Ms. Abedin, through her lawyers, has adamantly denied using that laptop. One theory of how the emails ended up there, according to several of the people, is that they may have been inadvertently backed up or downloaded onto an older computer and then transferred from the older computer to the laptop\u2019s hard drive when the older computer was replaced. Mr. Obama, affecting a bit of the local accent, repeatedly said he had come to do \u201cbidness,\u201d name-dropped the Tar Heels basketball team, and could barely contain his laughter as he described some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more provocative remarks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he also directed the millennials in the audience to pay attention as he described the ugly history of the struggle for black voting rights and North Carolina\u2019s more recent effort to make it harder to cast a ballot. Alluding to a 100-year-old black woman and lifelong resident of the state whose voting eligibility was recently questioned, Mr. Obama said North Carolinians would be complicit in what he called \u201cvoter suppression\u201d if they did not show up at the polls. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote you\u2019ve done the work of those who would suppress your vote without them having to lift a finger,\u201d the president warned. He referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated allegations of voting fraud in \u201ccertain areas,\u201d making it clear that he thinks the Republican was talking about black communities. \u201cWhere are those \u2018certain areas\u2019 he\u2019s talking about?\u201d Mr. Obama asked with a knowing tone. Mr. Obama left little doubt about the implications in the state Mrs. Clinton has the best chance to turn from red to blue.\u201cIf Hillary wins North Carolina,\u201d he said, \u201cshe wins.\u201d In North Carolina, which Mr. Obama narrowly lost in 2012, early voting rates among African-Americans and young voters have so far been below the level of four years ago. Democrats have seen improvements in these numbers in recent days as more early voting locations have opened up and they were able to drive out African-American voters at \u201csouls to the polls\u201d events last weekend. On Thursday, Mr. Obama is to campaign in Miami and Jacksonville, two of Florida\u2019s most heavily African-American cities. He is scheduled to return to North Carolina on Friday, when he will appear in Charlotte and Fayetteville, both with sizable black populations, before going back to Orlando on Saturday for the final day of early voting in Florida.

Except on Mondays. Inola High School on a Monday CBS News The school district, outside of Tulsa, has lost $400,000 in state funding over the past year. \u201cNot in my worst dream did I ever figure I would be taking my district to a four-day school week,\u201d said Dr. Kent Holbrook, the superintendent. Dr. Kent Holbrook CBS News The choice was cut teachers or switch to four days with longer hours. \u201cWhen I started weighing out, what\u2019s going to do more damage to these students? Is it going to be put 30, 35 first-graders in a class, or change the hours in a week? The decision was actually pretty easy,\u201d Holbrook said. Lawmakers blame a 70 percent drop in oil and gas prices since 2014. This year the state faced a $1.3 billion deficit and cut $34 million in education funding. But critics say that\u2019s in part due to years of giving tax breaks to oil companies; Rates as low as one percent during the boom, while the going rate in North Dakota was 11.5 percent. Nearly one-third of Oklahoma\u2019s school districts, in mostly poor, rural areas, have had to shorten the school week. \u201cKnowing we don\u2019t have enough money to keep the lights on and the buses running \u2026 it\u2019s just an outrage,\u201d said Audra Cornett, who has two children in Inola schools and is also a teacher. Audra Cornett CBS News \u201cTheir whole future depends on the quality of education that they received at these young ages,\u201d Cornett said. \u201cI don\u2019t see them being ready in the way we had been able to prepare them before.\u201d To help out other parents, she opened a learning center, where for $20, they can send their children on Mondays -- until the time when that will be a school day again. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Kim / Chicago Tribune Cubs fan and UFC fighter Clay Guida shows off his tickets Wednesday for Game 7 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. Cubs fan and UFC fighter Clay Guida shows off his tickets Wednesday for Game 7 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Game 7. World Series . \"I said I wanted to see the Cubs win the World Series before the good Lord takes me, so here I am with my grandson and my son,\" Tom Brown, 84, said as he rested beneath the Progressive Field marquee near the home plate gate. \"If we win, I can go to the Maker in peace.\" The Brown clan was among the thousands of Cubs fans who made the trip to northeast Ohio for Wednesday night's game against the Indians , ramping up for a day many have been dreaming about for a lifetime. \"I'm incredibly excited. I'm extremely happy to be here,\" Brown said, wearing a blue Cubs floppy hat and pinstriped jersey, as the corner of Ontario Street and Carnegie Avenue hummed with the chatter of baseball fans. Fans in Cleveland before Game 7 Fans gather on East 4th Street in Cleveland before World Series Game 7 Fans gather on East 4th Street in Cleveland before World Series Game 7 See more videos Brown, who grew up in the Chicago suburbs and now lives in Lincoln, Neb., shelled out $8,000 for the three tickets. He and his son, Jeffrey, and grandson Patrick left the Kansas City, Mo., area at 3 a.m. Tuesday, boarded a flight to Detroit, rented a car and stayed the night in Toledo, Ohio, before heading to Cleveland. It was worth it, they said. \"I decided I don't really have the money, but we're going,\" Tom Brown said. \"I sold a little stock.\" With the excitement level rising with each tick of the clock at the iconic Tower City Center, aglow in red and blue spotlights, fans made their way to the ballpark. In one of the plazas between a busy East 4th Street and the stadium, Indians fans mobbed actor Charlie Sheen as he exited a black SUV, on his way to a rally to pump up the local fans. Sheen played fictional Indians pitcher Ricky Vaughn, nicknamed \"Wild Thing,\" in the baseball movie \"Major League.\" Sheen had been angling to throw out a ceremonial first pitch before one of the Series games in Cleveland, but the Indians selected former stars, including Jim Thome for Game 7. That didn't stop Sheen from high-fiving surprised Tribe fans, then giving an expletive-filled speech to the crowd. \"It's the wrong night to be from Chi-Town!\" Sheen said. He criticized the Indians for bypassing him, then said it was going to be Cleveland's night on the field. Tom Brown Cubs fan Tom Brown on Game 7 of the World Series. (Patrick O'Connell / Chicago Tribune) Cubs fan Tom Brown on Game 7 of the World Series. (Patrick O'Connell / Chicago Tribune) See more videos The plaza beyond the left-field gate was a popular gathering spot for fans, many who didn't have tickets to the game but wanted to soak in the moment. Ryan Koehneke, 41, of St. Charles, drove to Cleveland on Tuesday and was searching for a ticket on the street after attending Game 6. A few moments before, someone nearby beat him to a pair of standing-room tickets. \"We're hoping for a miracle, man,\" Koehneke said. \"We're hoping for magic.\" As Corey Kluber delivered the first pitch, Indians and Cubs fans stood and cheered. Cubs fans made their presence known early, erupting from the box seats to the nosebleeds when Dexter Fowler led off the game with a home run. Cubs fans appeared to make up close to half of the fans in the stands. This was an unprecedented moment not to be missed for loyal Cubs fans. \"I lived at Wrigley Field as a kid,\" Tom Brown said. In the 1940s, he'd buy a bleacher ticket for 25 cents. He said he once got in trouble for skipping school to attend a Cubs home opener. As a baseball-crazed teenager, he scurried for the latest editions of the newspapers, scouring the box scores and memorizing player statistics. His favorite Cubs are Ernie Banks and Phil Cavarretta \u2014 \"He was a hell of a first baseman.\" He said he's been a die-hard fan for 72 years. Photo of Cubs fans during\u00a0the World Series games.\u00a0 Most Cubs fans were not alive the last time the team won the National League pennant, in 1945, let alone when the team won its last championship in 1908, facts not lost on the waves of fans who headed to the ballpark, giddy anticipation apparent on their faces. Indians fans have been long-suffering as well, the team's last title coming in 1948. \"As far as the game tonight, let the best team win,\" Brown said. \"If the Cubs lose, what's the phrase, 'Wait 'til next year?' I've waited for them for 72 years. I'll wait a few more.\" poconnell@chicagotribune.com ",

(Photo: ESO/A. McLeod) Breathtaking new images dubbed \"pillars of destruction\" from\u00a0the Carina Nebula were released Wednesday by the European Southern Observatory. The spires and pillars are actually vast clouds of dust and gas within a hub of star formation\u00a0some 7,500 light years from Earth, ESO said.\u00a0The massive stars within the star formation region slowly destroy the pillars\u00a0from which they are born. The pictures rank right up with the Hubble Space Telescope's famous Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula, the Associated Press reported. The phenomena\u00a0were observed by a team led by astronomer\u00a0 Anna McLeod \u00a0via the Very Large Telescope in Chile. These composite image shows several pillars within the Carina Nebula which were observed and studied with the MUSE instrument, mounted on ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope. \u00a0(Photo: ESO/A. McLeod) This craggy fantasy mountaintop enshrouded by wispy clouds looks like a bizarre landscape. But it is indeed a pillar of gas and dust, three light-years tall, which is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars. \u00a0(Photo: ESO/A.

The Cubs last won the World Series in 1908. SLIDESHOW: Chicago Cubs Celebrate World Series Championship Game 7 got off to a good start for the Cubs: Dexter Fowler started off the Cubs strong with a lead-off home run at the top of the first inning, which many long-suffering Cubs fans took as a sign of more good things to come in Game 7 of the World Series. The game included a 17-minute rain delay before the 10th inning. The Cubs halted the longest title drought in baseball, becoming the first club to overcome a 3-1 Series deficit since the 1985 Kansas City Royals. The team led the majors with 103 wins this season. Among those who were happy about the Cubs' win was Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was raised in a Chicago suburb.

Bollea's case against Gawker was bankrolled by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, whom Gawker outed as gay back in 2007, as David reported. He added that \"Thiel acknowledged he had subsidized other lawsuits against Gawker and would do so indefinitely.\" Denton explained the decision to settle: \"Yes, we were confident the appeals court would reduce or eliminate the runaway Florida judgment against Gawker, the writer of the Hogan story and myself personally.

The Valley billionaire, famously relentless, had committed publicly to support Hulk Hogan beyond the appeal and ' until his final victory .' Gawker's nemesis was not going away.\" \"As with any negotiation for resolution, all parties have agreed it is time to move on,\" Bollea's lawyer David Houston said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

Got it At a rally in Miami, Nov. 2, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he believes his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton is \"very unstable.\" The crowd followed with cheers of, \"Lock her up.\" (The Washington Post) By Jenna Johnson , Abby Phillip and Sean Sullivan November 2 at 3:33 PM Follow @wpjenna Follow @abbydphillip Follow @WaPoSean MIAMI \u2014 Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton \u201cvery unstable\u201d at a rally in Miami on Wednesday afternoon, a campaign event in which he went hard on the attack against the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cShe\u2019s got bad judgment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPersonally, I think she\u2019s a very unstable person.\u201d He did not substantiate his claim. The Republican nominee, without presenting specific evidence, also said Clinton \u201cprobably\u201d received a heads-up about questions in her debates against him. He pointed to the revelation by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks that Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chair, provided Democratic primary debate questions to Clinton\u2019s campaign. Trump also noted other unflattering releases by WikiLeaks and predicted that more damaging ones might be on the way. He also mentioned the FBI\u2019s revived investigation into Clinton\u2019s email practices at the State Department. \u201cDid you hear about this little event?\u201d Trump said. At a Miami rally, Nov. 2, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed reporters including \"Katy\" aren't properly covering support for his campaign. The target of his finger pointing was NBC News reporter Katy Tur. (The Washington Post) Trump told the crowd to vote with urgency and \u201cpretend we\u2019re slightly behind,\u201d though some recent Florida polls do show him trailing Clinton. He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to blow this.\u201d At one point, Trump appeared to single out NBC News reporter Katy Tur for criticism, as he has done before. \u201cWe have massive crowds. There\u2019s something happening. They\u2019re not reporting it. Katy, you\u2019re not reporting it, Katy. There\u2019s something happening, Katy. There\u2019s something happening, Katy,\u201d Trump said. As animosity against the media has grown at recent Trump rallies, his has added a larger buffer zone and more security between reporters and the crowds. But at the Miami rally, there was no buffer, and screaming supporters were just inches away from reporters. One man near the press pen continued screaming menacing things at \u201cKaty\u201d as the rally continued. Meanwhile, President Obama expressed concern in a radio interview broadcast Wednesday morning that too few African Americans are voting this time around, and he pressed black voters to turn out for Clinton to protect the policies he has implemented. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you right now, because we track \u2014 we\u2019ve got early voting, we\u2019ve got all kinds of metrics to see what\u2019s going on. And right now the Latino vote is up, overall vote is up, but the African American vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be,\u201d Obama said on \u201cThe Tom Joyner Morning Show,\u201d a syndicated program with many African American listeners. Obama framed the election as not only a race between Clinton and Trump but one in which his record is on the line. At a rally in Dade City, Fla., Nov. 1, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton deplored how Republican rival Donald Trump has treated women like Alicia Machado. \"We cannot hide from this,\" Clinton said. (Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post; Video: The Washington Post) \u201cI need everybody to understand that everything we\u2019ve done is dependent on being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in,\u201d the president said. [ Obama worries black vote \u2018is not as solid as it needs to be\u2019 ] To shore up support among black voters, Clinton released a new radio ad Wednesday, titled \u201cDisrespect,\u201d that says Trump \u201copenly mocks the African American community.\u201d The ad will air in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, the Clinton campaign said. Obama also briefly addressed for the first time the FBI\u2019s reopened investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails, saying in an interview with NowThis News posted Wednesday that the agency does not \u201coperate on innuendo\u201d and emphasizing that there is no evidence that the Democratic presidential nominee had violated the law. Trump\u2019s midday rally in Miami was the first of three he planned to hold in Florida on Wednesday. Clinton, who focused on Florida on Tuesday, was to campaign in Nevada and Arizona. The Clinton campaign announced Wednesday that it is doubling its Arizona advertising investment to $1\u00a0million for the final week of the campaign. A Democratic nominee for president has not won Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996, but polls show a competitive contest there. The deadly shootings of two police officers in central Iowa prompted two of Hillary Clinton\u2019s top surrogates to cancel a Wednesday campaign event in the region. Bill Clinton and vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine would no longer hold a get-out-the-vote event in Des Moines, Clinton\u2019s campaign announced in the morning. The officers were shot in their squad cars in Des Moines and Urbandale. Authorities took a suspect into custody Wednesday morning. In Miami, Trump called the shootings a \u201cterrible tragedy.\u201d He said that \u201can attack on our police is an attack on all of us.\u201d [ Iowa police capture suspect after \u2018ambush-style\u2019 killings of two officers ] Trump\u2019s children were fanning out across key battlegrounds to campaign on his behalf on Wednesday. Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump and Eric Trump were covering Colorado, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. At his rally, Trump criticized both Bill and Hillary Clinton, saying, \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. Haven\u2019t we just been through a lot with the Clintons? Right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can\u2019t practice law, he doesn\u2019t have the right to practice law. Didn\u2019t we just go through this?\u201d As Trump spoke, a man in the crowd kept screaming, \u201cHe\u2019s a rapist!\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal R. Labrador (R-Idaho) was an introductory speaker at Trump\u2019s rally. Trump seldom has Republican lawmakers appear in states other than their own. Speaking for 3\u00bd minutes, Labrador did not mention Trump\u2019s name once. \u201cI\u2019m here because what we need to do in this election is we need to elect somebody that can believe and does believe in the American Dream,\u201d Labrador said, then telling the crowd about how he grew up in Puerto Rico and ended up being a Republican. Later he added, \u201cI need you to do everything you can for the next seven days to make America great again.\u201d As the crowd waited in the hot sun for Trump to arrive, a local GOP official also spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans up and down the ticket \u2014 but the crowd was distracted by a woman wearing a jail jumpsuit and a Clinton mask who posed for photo after photo. For the second rally in a row, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus addressed Trump\u2019s crowd, saying in Miami that while Trump is \u201cnot politically correct,\u201d he doesn\u2019t lie like Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle for freedom,\u201d Priebus said, \u201cand Donald Trump will fight for our freedom.\u201d Sullivan reported from Washington.

Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima November 2 at 8:01 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @nakashimae Senior FBI officials were informed about the discovery of new emails potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server at least two weeks before Director James B. Comey notified Congress, according to federal officials familiar with the investigation. The officials said that Comey was told that there were new emails before he received a formal briefing last Thursday, although the precise timing is unclear. The information goes beyond the details provided in the letter that Comey sent to lawmakers last week declaring that he was restarting the inquiry into whether Clinton mishandled classified material during her tenure as secretary of state. He wrote in the Friday letter that \u201cthe investigative team briefed me yesterday\u201d about the additional emails. The people familiar with the investigation said that senior officials had been informed weeks earlier that a computer belonging to former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) contained emails potentially pertinent to the Clinton investigation. Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin, shared the computer with her husband, from whom she is now separated. Comey did not notify Congress as soon as he learned about the emails because officials wanted additional information before proceeding, the officials said. Even after Comey received the desired information, major questions still remain \u2014 for instance, how many emails are related to Clinton or contain classified information. Since notifying Congress, Comey has drawn intense criticism from lawmakers in both parties as well as prominent former law enforcement officials for publicizing the investigation so close to the election when so little was known. It is unclear what FBI agents have learned since discovering the emails in early October. But officials say they gained enough information from the email metadata to take the next step, seeking a warrant to review the actual emails. That legal step prompted Comey\u2019s letter to Congress, which has made him a central figure during the stretch run of the presidential campaign. \u201cHe needed to make an informed decision, knowing that once he made that decision, he was taking it to another level,\u201d an official with knowledge of the decision-making process said. Law enforcement officials on Oct.\u00a03 seized the computer belonging to Weiner, who was under investigation for allegedly sending suggestive online messages to a teenage girl. As they examined his computer, investigators quickly stumbled on emails tied to Abedin. She and Weiner separated in August. Abedin, like Clinton, used an email address that was routed through Clinton\u2019s private server. Soon after the investigators found the new trove of thousands of emails, they notified the separate team of FBI agents in Washington that worked on the probe into Clinton\u2019s private email server, officials said. Comey said in July that the investigation was complete and that he would recommend to prosecutors that no charges be brought. After the agents on the Clinton case were notified in early October about the newly discovered emails, they in turn told FBI leaders about them. At that point, the leaders did not believe they had enough information to make a decision about what to do next, officials said. At a rally in at Kent State University, Oct. 31, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the FBI investigation into emails that might be connected to her private email server. She said \"by all means, they should look at\" emails on a computer owned by Anthony Weiner, the husband of her top aide, Huma Abedin. (The Washington Post) The senior FBI officials instructed the agents to do everything they could within legal limits to determine the relevance of the new emails, one official said. That review, including a closer examination of the email metadata, was an attempt to figure out the scope and volume of what the agents had found. An FBI spokesman declined to comment. In notifying lawmakers on Friday about the new investigative steps, Comey said he had been \u201cbriefed\u201d about the newly discovered emails a day earlier but did not mention that he had first heard about them before that. The news media has widely reported that Comey was first told about the emails last week. A formal briefing for Comey with the investigative team was held Oct.\u00a027 at FBI headquarters. At that point, Comey was given a complete presentation of everything the team knew about the trove. \u201cIt was a combination of assessments by the investigative team as to what it might be,\u201d the official said. Much was unknown about the contents and relevance of the thousands of emails. How many were to or from Clinton? Did any contain classified information? How many were duplicates of material the FBI had already reviewed? Was any of this significant to the Clinton email investigation that had been completed? \u201cAt that point, there was no way for Comey to know if the [Clinton investigators] had already seen the emails before or if they were new, old or different,\u201d an official said. \u201cAll of that was just unknown.\u201d But Comey and others felt there was enough information at that point to pursue a warrant, which would permit the investigators on the Clinton case to read the emails, officials said. They could not read them without legal permission because the emails had been discovered in the separate criminal probe involving Weiner. When Comey and the officials decided to seek a warrant, they knew that would involve more people, both at the FBI and the Justice Department. Comey was concerned that the explosive information that they had to renew the Clinton investigation would leak out. \u201cIt could not be done in secret,\u201d an official with knowledge of the investigation said. \u201cIt\u2019s a volatile subject and a major topic in the presidential campaign.\u201d But the overriding factor in Comey\u2019s decision was that he felt he had to tell Congress what he was doing because he had testified under oath this past summer and \u201ctold Congress and the world\u201d that the Clinton email investigation was complete, and now that was no longer true, an official said. Then, Comey had to figure out what to say to lawmakers, when he knew so little. He wanted the letter to be accurate and \u201ccircumspect,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe wanted it to be carefully, thoughtfully done and say no more than his investigators knew,\u201d the official said. After the formal briefing, staffers in Comey\u2019s office contacted senior officials at the Justice Department to notify them about the director\u2019s decision. The next day, Comey sent his letter. Two officials familiar with the case said it is unclear whether investigators will be able to conclude their review of the new emails before the election. President Obama addressed the controversy in an interview posted Wednesday by NowThisNews, saying, \u201cI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don\u2019t operate on innuendo, and we don\u2019t operate on incomplete information, and we don\u2019t operate on leaks.\u201d \u201cWhen this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn\u2019t anything there that was prosecutable,\u201d Obama said.

Puskar/AP Updated at 1 a.m. ET The Chicago Cubs, ending a championship drought that has lasted 108 years, beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. They did it the hard way, too, coming back from a 3-1 game deficit, winning three straight games, including the last two on the road in Cleveland. And it took ten innings to win it all in Game 7. The Cubs are the first team since the 1985 Kansas City Royals to claw back from a 3-1 deficit in the World Series. They won 103 games during the regular season.

Phillip/AP The Cubs took the lead early in the first inning and seemed in control of the game before almost letting this one get away. They were leading 6-3 when their hard-throwing closer Aroldis Chapman blew a save opportunity by giving up three runs in the eighth inning, two coming from a dramatic home run by the Indians' Rajai Davis that tied the score at 6-6. In the top of the rain-delayed tenth inning, the Cubs' Kyle Schwarber opened the frame with a single and was replaced by pinch runner Albert Almora Jr., who took second base on a sacrifice fly by Kris Bryant that almost left the park. Anthony Rizzo was intentionally walked. Ben Zobrist doubled to score Almora and then pinch-hitter Miguel Montero singled to score Rizzo. The game stood at 8-6.

Phillip/AP The Chicago Cubs' Dexter Fowler reacts after hitting a home run during the first inning of Game 7 of the World Series against the Cleveland Indians Wednesday in Cleveland. David J. Phillip/AP In the bottom of the tenth, the Indians threatened again. Cubs reliever Carl Edwards Jr. got two outs from the Indians before walking Brandon Guyer, who stole second base. That brought up Davis, the hero of the Indians' eighth inning. He promptly singled, scoring Guyer. With the score at 8-7, Cubs reliever Mike Montgomery induced Michael Martinez to ground out. Article continues after sponsorship The last time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series was 1908 back when Theodore Roosevelt was president. By losing in extra innings in Game 7, the Indians fell short of their goal: to win Cleveland's first championship since 1948. The game had no shortage of stomach-tightening moments for both teams and their fans. The Cubs struck quickly with a solo home run to center field by lead-off hitter Dexter Fowler, off Indians starter Corey Kluber in the first inning. Schwarber followed with a single, but Kluber then retired eight straight Cubs hitters over the first three innings. Schwarber collected his second single of the game but he was thrown out trying to stretch out a double to end the top half of the third inning. The Indians tied the score at 1-1 when Coco Crisp led off the bottom of the third inning with a double to left, took third on a sacrifice bunt by Roberto Perez and scored on a single to right field by Carlos Santana. An error by Cubs second baseman Javier Baez put another runner on base. But the Indians failed to capitalize on what might have been a big inning. The Cubs regained the lead in the top of the fourth inning, scoring two runs. Kris Bryant led off with a single and Rizzo was hit by a pitch. A sacrifice fly by Addison Russell scored Bryant, then a double by Willson Contreras brought in the Cubs' second run of the frame. The Indians went down quietly in the bottom of the fourth inning. Chicago got two more runs in the fifth inning on a solo homer by Baez on the first pitch he saw from the Indians' Kluber. The Indians brought in their ace reliever Andrew Miller. Two outs later, Bryant walked and scored on a base hit by Rizzo. Chicago led the game 5-1. The Indians came back with two runs in the fifth. Cubs manager Joe Maddon pulled his starter Kyle Hendricks in the bottom of the fifth with two outs after he walked the Indians' Santana. Hendricks left the game surrendering only one run and scattering four hits. The Cubs' Jon Lester, typically a starter, came in to relieve. A throwing error by catcher David Ross put runners at second and third. They both scored on a wild pitch by Lester, cutting the Indians' deficit to two runs, 5-3. Ross reclaimed one of those runs with a solo home run to center off the Indians' Miller in the top of the sixth inning, extending Chicago's lead 6-3. Chicago stayed in command until the improbable bottom of the eighth. They were never behind in this game. Correction Nov. 2, 2016 ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A special team of analysts has been activated to sort and sift through the cache of newly discovered emails that kick-started the dormant Hillary Clinton email probe, two intelligence sources confirmed to Fox News. The sources say the multi-agency task force was re-engaged over the weekend, with analysts working overlapping shifts covering 16 hours a day to identify new classified material. The objective is to gain more clarity on the records recovered from ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer -- to assess if intelligence sources and methods were compromised and to inform FBI Director James Comey in case he faces more pressure for answers on the state of the investigation. Comey\u2019s announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing newly discovered emails in the Clinton case \u2013 discovered during the separate sexting probe of the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin \u2013 drew criticism from Clinton allies who accused him of meddling in the election. The White House, though, has defended Comey. His investigators are proceeding despite the controversy surrounding Friday\u2019s announcement. Sources told Fox News that as of Tuesday afternoon, agents were using computer software to exploit the relevant\u00a0emails from Weiner's laptop. This process is being undertaken by members of the FBI's Computer Analysis and Response Team, or CART. The program being used was developed by FBI forensic computer experts. The program knocks out duplicates from the cache and, with Sunday\u2019s warrant, investigators will then be able to read the email content. The first step is relatively quick. \u201cYou can process a very large set of emails that eliminate duplicates, eliminate redundancies and really focus your attention on the documents in those emails that are new,\u201d said former Justice Department official Thomas Dupree. If new records are identified, a second phase kicks in during which investigators will physically review the emails, then farm them out to the intelligence agencies for final classification. The Donald Trump campaign asserts that highly sensitive documents are on the computer. \u201cThey have probably discovered \u2026 classified information in this 650,000,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a Trump surrogate. The FBI is not commenting. The Justice Department sent a letter to Capitol Hill pledging every available resource to expedite the review before Election Day. Karen Dunn, representing Abedin, told reporters that Abedin was surprised to learn her emails were on the computer. \"From the beginning, Ms. Abedin has complied fully and voluntarily with State Department and law enforcement requests, including sitting for hours-long interviews and providing her work-related and potentially work-related documents,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWhile the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative.\u201d And late Tuesday, the conservative group Judicial Watch released new Clinton emails, uncovered by the FBI in the first review, showing that in November 2010, Clinton\u2019s unsecured server was attacked 10 times in two days. The Secret Service was informed. The FBI director said in July there was no evidence of a breach, though it could not be ruled out. A government official also confirmed Tuesday that Comey and his boss Attorney General Loretta Lynch met for the first time since his decision to re-initiate the Clinton email investigation.

Especially from African Americans , who made up a quarter of the state\u2019s early voting electorate when he was on the ballot in 2012. The drama, humor and history as America chooses a president So Wednesday, the president and Clinton made the rounds again on predominately black radio stations \u201cTell my folks why you and why now,\u201d Leroy Jones asked Clinton on Art, Talk and Listen with Leroy Jones. \u00a0\u201cWell you know I believe in what I am doing,\u201d Clinton answered.\u00a0 While the FBI is combing through thousands of emails possibly related to Hillary Clinton's private email server, the Democratic presidential nomi... In battleground North Carolina, African American early voting rates are bouncing back from a slow start -- and after Republicans there imposed strict limits on the number of urban polling places during the first week of early voting In Chapel Hill, Obama issued this dire new warning about a Trump presidency: \u201cI hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders.\u201d\u00a0 The Latino vote will also be key for Clinton -- and those numbers are far better. In Florida, Latino early voting is up 139 percent from this point in 2012--driven in part by Trump\u2019s comments about Mexicans . \u201cI mean he starts out by insulting immigrants. He moves on to insult all Latinos,\u201d Clinton said in Florida. \u201cInsults African Americans, insults Muslims. Insults people with disabilities. Insults POWs. And insults women.\u00a0 I mean really.\u201d Obama came to Clinton\u2019s aid on another front today, criticizing the FBI director for telling Congress about new emails that may or may not be significant. In an interview with \u201cNow This News,\u201d the president said the FBI should not be spreading innuendo and incomplete information. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are targeting voters in the battleground state of Florida, with less than a week away from the election. CBSN po... Meanwhile, Trump is also making a push for Florida , CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reports.\u00a0 \u201cThe polls are all saying we are going to win Florida,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cDon\u2019t believe it. Don\u2019t believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we are slightly behind. We don\u2019t want to blow this.\u201d Trump is running like an underdog--even as new polls show the race in Florida is essentially tied. For a second day, he warned that a Hillary Clinton presidency could be mired in congressional and possibly criminal investigations. \u00a0\u201cIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. Haven\u2019t we just been through a lot with the Clintons? Right?\u201d Despite the public polling, Trump\u2019s team believes he has surged ahead here. It also believes it has drawn even in upper Midwest states like Michigan and Wisconsin. In Eau Claire on Tuesday night, Trump made a play for voters who cast early ballots for Hillary Clinton and are now suffering what he called buyer\u2019s remorse. \u201cA lot of stuff has come out since your vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo if you live here or in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Minnesota, those four places, you can change your vote to Donald Trump. We\u2019ll make America great again. Okay?\u201d ",

John L. Mone/AP hide caption toggle caption John L. Mone/AP A member of the Stutsman County SWAT team who declined to give his name nor to be identifiable by badge stands guard by an armored personnel carrier equipped with an LRAD, or long range acoustic device, while deployed to watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline. John L. Mone/AP President Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is examining possible alternative routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Protesters have been occupying land along the current pipeline route near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. A federal judge has ruled that work on the pipeline can go forward, but the Corps and two other agencies said work would not go forward in an area particularly sensitive to the tribe until a review was completed. \"We're monitoring this closely and I think, as a general rule, my view is that there's a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans,\" Obama said in an interview with the news organization Now This . The president continued: \"I think right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline in a way. So we're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans.\" Article continues after sponsorship \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) November 2, 2016 In a response to the president's statement, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, Dave Archambault II, said, \"We believe President Obama and his administration will do the right thing.\" Morton County Chairman Cody Schulz said that he did not agree with the president's decision to let the situation play out, saying in a statement: \"Rather than creating further uncertainty, the President should be sending us the support and resources necessary to enforce the law and protect people's right to peacefully protest.\" Police Evict Dakota Pipeline Protesters According to the Morton County Sheriff's Office Facebook page , protesters and law enforcement officers were in a standoff on Wednesday along a creek north of the main protest camp. Following the president's remarks, Vicki Granado, spokeswoman for the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, said in a statement, \"We are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\" The easement refers to permission from the Corps to begin construction on the portion of the pipeline that would cross under the Missouri River. It was not immediately clear what a rerouting plan might look like, or what might be involved in the Corps' considering such a plan. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters are specifically trying to block that section of pipeline because, they say, the route interrupts sacred sites and burial places . Tribe members are also concerned that if the pipeline ruptures, an oil spill could pollute drinking water, as The Two-Way has reported . In his statement, Archambault called on the Obama administration to stop all work on the pipeline until the Corps was finished \"examining this issue.\" As demonstrations continue, so have clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Last week, police arrested more than 100 people as officers evicted demonstrators from land owned by the pipeline company. As we reported, some of the officers were in riot gear, some were armed, and they arrived with soldiers driving trucks and military Humvees. They also deployed helicopters and an airplane to monitor from above. The Federal Aviation Administration is restricting flights over the area until at least Nov. 5. Last week, Archambault called on the Department of Justice to investigate what he called the \"overall militarization of law enforcement response\" in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Asked what he thought about the law enforcement response, Obama said Tuesday that it's a \"challenging situation.\" The president continued: \"I think that my general rule when I talk to governors and state and local officials, whenever they're dealing with protests \u2014 including, for example, during the 'Black Lives Matter' protests \u2014 is there's an obligation for protesters to be peaceful, and there's an obligation for authorities to show restraint. \"I want to make sure that, as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt.\" In an apparent effort to confuse police, more than 1 million people have tried to make it appear that they are protesting in North Dakota by \"checking in\" at the protest camp on Facebook . The Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a Facebook post Monday afternoon that it \"does not follow Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location.\" NPR's Jeff Brady also reported Wednesday that authorities have charged a protester, Red Fawn Fallis, with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer after she allegedly fired a pistol three times as she was being arrested last week. According to an officer who witnessed the event, police did not return fire against the woman. North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind said he was nearby and was surprised no one was injured. \"The only angle that gun could have been fired where there was no law enforcement is the angle it was fired. It wasn't because she was trying to aim away from law enforcement,\" he said. If Fallis is found guilty, Jeff says, she faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. ",

Kadzik likely was referencing a brief submitted on May 18 in which the State Department proposed releasing 55,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails in January 2016. Podesta forwarded Kadzik\u2019s message to a group of top Clinton aides \u2013 including Press Secretary Brian Fallon and adviser Cheryl Mills \u2013 with the cryptic comment: \u201cAdditional chances for mischief.\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump referenced the email during a rally in Miami on Wednesday. He said Kadzik was \u201cfeeding information to the Clinton campaign.\u201d \u201cThese are the people that want to run our country folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe spread of political agendas into the Justice Department \u2026 is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country.\" The relationship between Kadzik and Podesta goes back nearly two decades. When prosecutors were eyeing Podesta for his alleged role in trying to secure a job for then-Bill Clinton mistress Monica Lewinsky, Kadzik successfully represented Podesta. Later, Kadzik took a job lobbying for a presidential pardon for tax cheat Marc Rich. A congressional report indicated Kadzik got the job in part because of his rapport with Podesta. A Justice Department spokesman, though, downplayed the significance of Kadzik\u2019s 2015 email, saying it was \u201cabout public information\u201d and sent \u201cin his personal capacity, not during work hours.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t communicating via official channels because it wasn\u2019t official business,\u201d Kevin Lewis told FoxNews.com. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t emailing as \u2018Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik.\u2019\u201d Lewis, who would not characterize the substance of the email, said officials in the department do not typically provide campaign advice. \u201cIt is not department practice to provide any strategic guidance to any campaign,\u201d said Lewis, who did not answer when asked if Kadzik\u2019s behavior was acceptable to the Justice Department.\u00a0 Kadzik's \"heads up\" may have been of limited use to the Clinton campaign.\u00a0 Benjamin Mizer, a deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the Civil Division, did end up testifying before a House subcommittee hearing at 1 p.m. on May 19. However, it doesn\u2019t appear the email topic came up in his questioning. And it seems the Clinton camp already was well aware of the State Department FOIA case filing. On May 18, Fallon received a copy of the filing from someone inside the Justice Department and forwarded the document to Mills, Podesta and others. It\u2019s unknown who the original sender was because the person\u2019s name was stripped before Fallon forwarded the message. Lewis told FoxNews.com he also didn\u2019t know \u201cwho Brian spoke to.\u201d \u201cDOJ just filed a briefing saying the gov\u2019t proposes releasing HRC\u2019s cache of work-related emails in January 2016,\u201d Fallon wrote. Mills replied: \u201cget out!???\u201d Fallon gave another update to Clinton\u2019s most-trusted aide, Huma Abedin, on May 19. \u201cDOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,\u201d he wrote. Most of the 55,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over were eventually released, with redactions, by March 2016. The Clinton campaign disputed that Kadzik had alerted them to anything about the email release or the House hearing. \"Without authenticating the email itself, the idea the campaign wasn\u2019t aware of a public hearing and a public notice in real time is nonsense,\" Caplin told Fox News in an email.

Families Facing Sticker Shock Over 400 Percent Price Hike by Ben Popken The Carras, whose son Dorian has type-1 diabetes, read a book on the couch at their Texas home. NBC News Share advertisement Is insulin is the new EpiPen? In the last eight years, the average price per milliliter of insulin has skyrocketed by over 200 percent. But there's one major difference. If you can't get an EpiPen, there's a chance you might die. If your body doesn't have insulin, you certainly will die. \"It feels like they're holding my kid ransom,\" said Tiffany Cara, whose son has diabetes. Only three companies make insulin in the U.S. and each has steadily ratcheted up prices, sometimes in lockstep. Since 2004, the manufacturer list price for insulin, known as wholesale acquisition cost, is up by triple digits. Novo Nordisk's insulin Novolog is up 381 percent, Eli Lilly's Humalog is up 380 percent and Sanofi's Lantus is up 400 percent, according to data from Truven Health Analytics. That's sending some diabetic families into sticker shock. Play Diabetes Patients Struggle as Insulin Costs Soar 1:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161103061419if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/799519811736\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Six-year-old Dorian Carra loves to play outside his Texas home and dress up as a super hero. Specifically, Captain America, the World War II version. His mom says her outgoing boy has \"never met a stranger.\" But four years ago he couldn't stay awake. He was breathing oddly. His parents brought his rag doll body to the E.R. Doctors said his blood sugar levels had spiked to 965 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood. A normal range is 80 to 140. The diagnosis was type-1 diabetes. The prescription was insulin, every day, for the rest of his life. Recently those treatment costs doubled after the Carra's health insurance company switched to cover another brand. Even though the brands are clinically the same, the new medicine isn't available in the dosages he needs, so they have to stick with the more expensive kind. Tiffany Carra, a thirty-two-year-old stay-at-home mom, says it now costs them $1,880 a year for insulin and supplies. 6 million Americans rely on insulin Mostly Dorian keeps a brave face. He's able to set up his insulin supplies by himself. Sometimes his parents help him with the last step. Sometimes he cries. Sometimes he says he hates diabetes. But without insulin his cells can't absorb the sugar they need to make energy and he can go into a life-threatening diabetic coma. There an estimated 30 million Americans with diabetes. Most are what's known as type-2. Their body doesn't use insulin the right way and may end up with a prescription for it if lifestyle and diet changes aren't enough. But 10 percent of diabetics are type-1, like Dorian. Their immune system actually destroys the cells that release insulin, requiring a lifetime of daily treatment. The pricing buzzsaw faced by the Carras and the six million others who use insulin reflects a simple economic reality. \"Prices are set by the pharmaceutical companies at whatever the market will bear,\" Dr. Kesselheim, associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told NBC News. Just like with EpiPen , insulin list prices have been going up behind the scenes for years. Most patients had a relatively small copay so they didn't really see the price hikes except as part of gradually rising premiums. But since Obamacare went into effect in 2014, the number of employees enrolled in high-deductible plans has shot up 9 percentage points, according to a survey by the Kaiser family foundation , as employers have successfully steered their workers towards the plans. Even though those premiums are increasing at historic lows, the higher deductibles mean more Americans are getting directly exposed to the soaring prices \u2014 and paying for them out of pocket. Sometimes insulin drugmakers have played \"follow the leader\" with price hikes. Price increases for competing brands of insulin tend to occur at the same time and by the same amounts. NBC News When Eli Lilly raised the average wholesale price of the Humalog Dorian was taking by 10 percent in the 4th quarter of 2013, so did Novo Nordisk with its competing insulin Novolog. And when Novolog's prices went up by 8 percent in the third quarter of 2016, so did Humalog's. Between the 3rd quarters of 2008 and 2016, the drugs saw 16 separate price moves. Of them, 10 were by the same amount and at the same time. The others differed by a few percentage points, or were delayed by a quarter. Generic is no panacea Another major factor: there is currently no generic for insulin. And while Wal-Mart sells three different kinds of insulin for $25 a vial, these are older kinds that require the patient to follow strict snack and meal schedules. That's not as viable for families with diabetic children who prefer the flexibility of the newer - and more expensive -- generations of insulin. Dorian's insulin kit. Courtesy Tiffany Cara Another factor tamping down competition is that it's hard and hugely costly to make a \"generic\" (technically a \"biosimilar\") version of insulin. The drug is not just synthesized chemicals, it's actually made by cells. Insulin used to be drawn from the pancreases of slaughtered animals. Nowadays it's coaxed from tweaked yeast or bacteria. This December will be the first time that biosimilar insulin is set to hit the shelves, and others are in the works. The increased competition will offer much-needed, but modest, price relief. A typical generic offers 85 percent savings off the name brand. But biosimilar insulins are only projected to save 11-15 percent, according to an analysis by the nonprofit RAND research corporation . It can take $100 to $250 million for a drug company to develop and market a biosimilar drug, versus the $1 million to $4 million needed for a regular generic. The blame game There's plenty of blame for rising prices to go around with a complex health care machine responsible for getting a drug from the manufacturer to the patient. Drugmakers say pricing is multifaceted and driven up by middlemen. Novo Nordisk says it negotiates to increase access for its drugs and that most patients have co-pays that average between $1 to $1.40 per day. \"Price increases are necessary to support our mission to research and develop new medicines,\" the company said in a statement to NBC News. Eli Lilly, makers of Humolog, said in a statement that \"today's health care system works well for most people, but those enrolled in high-deductible insurance plans and managing chronic conditions face challenges in gaining reasonable access to treatments they need.\" In a statement, Sanofi said it hasn't raised prices for Lantus since 2014 \"because of efforts to remain included on formularies at a favorable tier which helps to reduce out of pocket costs to patients.\" All drug makers say they also offer co-pay assistance programs as well as assistance programs for those without insurance to help needy patients. They also point the finger at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for negotiating larger rebates for insurers, which they say forces them to raise prices. Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, one of the two largest PBMs in the country, said drug companies are responsible for setting the prices, and creating and managing the rebate program. He says they they pass along most of the rebate to insurers. Meanwhile, insurance carriers just say drug prices are out of control. \"Millions depend on insulin every day,\" said David Merritt, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plan. \"Every cost increase by a drug company makes it that much harder for patients to access the treatments they need. We need to solve this pricing crisis now.\" Price hike relief is on the way -- for payers. Shares of insulin maker Novo Nordisk and drug wholesaler McKesson fell by double digits last week on news that aggressive rebate negotiations are helping cut or flatten the prices insurers pay for insulin. But don't expect to see that get passed down to a lower premium or cheaper insulin, especially for those without insurance or facing a high deductible. \"Most people with insurance are paying a co-pay, and even when a price changes, we don't see much movement on the co-pay side,\" said Novo Nordisk's Inchausti. \"A patient exposed to list price is still going to be exposed to list price.\" Another shot at savings Ultimately, you should tell your doctor if you're having trouble paying for what you're prescribed. There may be a more affordable alternative, so check with your insurance company to see if you qualify for patient assistance programs, and comparison shop on sites like GoodRX. Big box stores like Costco and Wal-Mart may also offer additional savings. Even if you tell your doctor they may not know all the tricks. The Carras worked with drug comparison site Rx Savings Solutions and found two manufacturer coupons that cut the price back to the $150 they used to pay. Using them required that they start going to a different drugstore. A small price to pay but one that reflects the complex network of hidden agreements that governs who gets the best access to insulin and at what cost. \"The only way for consumers to save money is to advocate for themselves,\" said Michael Rea, founder and CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. \"You can manage cholesterol six different ways, and the difference can be $4 to $400. Consumers don't know that \u2014 and neither do their doctors.\" Ben Popken ",

The IRGC \u201cwill be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,\u201d according to the Iranian military commander, who said that these forces would operate with the goal of bolstering Iran\u2019s hardline regime and thwarting potential plots against the Islamic Republic. \u201cThe whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,\u201d Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran\u2019s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was\u00a0 quoted \u00a0as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC. The military leader\u2019s comments come as Iran is spending great amounts of money to upgrade its military hardware and bolster its presence throughout the Middle East and beyond. Iran intends\u00a0 to spend billions \u00a0to purchase U.S.-made planes that are likely to be converted for use in its air force. Congressional leaders and others suspect that Iran has used a large portion of the cash windfall it received as a result of last summer\u2019s nuclear agreement to upgrade its fighting capabilities war machine. \u201cThe IRGC is [the] strong guardian of the Islamic Republic,\u201d Abnoush was quoted as saying. \u201cThe Fedayeen of Velayat [fighting force] are under the order of Iran\u2019s Supreme leader. Defending and protecting the\u00a0Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.\u201d ",

The latest numbers from the CNN/ORC poll shows Trump taking a slight lead in Nevada, with 49 percent support from likely voters compared to Clinton's 43 percent. That marks an increase in his support since early October, when Clinton had 46 percent support and Trump had 44 percent in the state. In Arizona, Trump has 49 percent support and Clinton has 44 percent, though that is within the margin of error of polling. Clinton's support in Arizona has grown since the last poll, in which Trump was still leading by 7 points. Trump Rated More Honest; Contest Stays a Dead Heat (POLL) The results in Florida and Pennsylvania also came within the polling margin of error, with Clinton receiving 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent in Florida and Clinton receiving 48 percent to Trump's 44 percent in Pennsylvania. These four states are crucial to the electoral map and the candidates have been spending serious time and money to win over undecided voters there in recent days. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is down from his previous results in all four states, with his highest results coming in Arizona and Nevada, where he received five percentage points apiece. In a mid-August CNN/ORC poll, Johnson received 12 percent of the vote in Arizona. ABC News' Ryan Struyk contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Above, an AT&T store in New York City. (Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images) Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporter AT&T Inc.\u2019s hopes of completing its $85.4-billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. depends on convincing federal regulators that they should\u00a0allow one of the nation\u2019s telecommunications giants to become even bigger. Getting hit with a collusion lawsuit doesn\u2019t help make that case, particularly for a deal that already has drawn bipartisan criticism,\u00a0antitrust experts and consumer advocates said.\u00a0 The Department of Justice on Wednesday sued AT&T\u2019s DirecTV unit, alleging it was \u201cthe\u00a0ringleader\u201d in unlawful efforts to prevent widespread carriage of the SportsNet LA television channel owned by the Los Angeles Dodgers.\u00a0 Making matter worse for AT&T, the Justice Department is the same agency that must review the Time Warner deal to make sure it passes antitrust muster. \u201cAll things being equal, you don\u2019t want to be sued by the DOJ when you\u2019re trying to get a merger approved by the DOJ,\u201d said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at digital rights group Public Knowledge. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u00a0helps them.\u201d But how much it might hurt\u00a0AT&T\u2019s attempt to acquire Time Warner Inc. was unclear. Although the suit names DirecTV and AT&T, the unlawful activity took place before AT&T completed its purchase of the satellite provider in July 2015. Los Angeles Dodgers fans have missed Clayton Kershaw \u2019s brilliant pitches. They also never got to watch\u00a0Vin Scully\u2019s emotional final season and a dominant march\u00a0to the playoffs. \u00a0 Now,\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice says that baseball fans were shut out\u00a0because... For three seasons, thousands of frustrated Los Angeles Dodgers fans have missed Clayton Kershaw \u2019s brilliant pitches. They also never got to watch\u00a0Vin Scully\u2019s emotional final season and a dominant march\u00a0to the playoffs. \u00a0 Now,\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice says that baseball fans were shut out\u00a0because... (Meg James) AT&T was one of the pay-TV providers that the Justice Department said was part of the collusion. But the Time Warner deal is a\u00a0vertical integration\u00a0of companies that don\u2019t directly compete against one another instead of a horizontal merger with another pay-TV provider, which would raise additional collusion concerns. Time Warner spun off its Time Warner Cable unit in 2009. Charter Communications Inc.\u00a0bought Time Warner Cable last year and is renaming the service Spectrum. AT&T said the allegations regarding SportsNet LA shouldn\u2019t have any effect on regulatory approval of Time Warner. \u201cThis civil suit has nothing to do with our proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc.,\u201d said AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a Georgetown University law professor, said the Justice Department would review the deal on its own merits. But the collusion suit could have an impact \u201con the margins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt affects your judgment and your assessment if they have a track record of behaving anticompetitively,\u201d he said of Justice Department antitrust regulators. If the deal also must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission, which appears likely, the DirecTV suit could have a larger impact, Schwartzman said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at the broader effects on the marketplace,\u201d he said of the FCC. \u201cSomething like this underscores for the FCC some of the problems that are exacerbated if you increase AT&T\u2019s and Time Warner\u2019s collective clout in the marketplace.\u201d Concerns about increased media consolidation led the AT&T/Time Warner deal to get a frosty reception when it was announced last week. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said his administration would block the deal if he wins next week\u2019s election. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, said the merger raised \u201cquestions and concerns.\u201d\u00a0 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) called for a \u201crobust review.\u201d The panel\u2019s antitrust subcommittee has scheduled a hearing for Dec. 7. Opponents of AT&T\u2019s deal to buy Time Warner said the collusion suit was another reason for regulators to reject\u00a0the deal. \u201cAT&T and DirecTV had too much power over the pay-TV, Internet\u00a0and content markets even before their multibillion merger closed last year,\u201d said Matt Wood, policy director of Free Press, another digital rights group. Read the complaint against AT&T-DirecTV; Open link \u201cNow that they\u2019ve joined forces, the absolute last thing we need is approval of a deal to put these bad actors in control of Time Warner\u2019s video content empire,\u201d he said. Bergmayer said the collusion case \u201craises obvious concerns about whether AT&T would have the incentive and ability to harm consumers if it were permitted to acquire Time Warner.\u201d \u201cThe past behavior\u00a0of a company is relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying this by itself is the reason to block the merger. It\u2019s one more data point.\u201d Hours before the suit was announced, Public Knowledge, Free Press and 16 other digital rights, consumer advocacy and social justice organizations sent a letter to Clinton and Trump urging them to reject the deal because it would make AT&T too powerful. \u201cThere is little evidence that anyone \u2014 other than the executives and shareholders of the merging companies \u2014 benefits from these massive deals,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe recent history of media concentration is littered with broken promises and higher prices for customers.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the FBI would have to find to press charges against Hillary Clinton , Frank Gehry\u2019s controversial development is approved , two Des Moines officers were shot to death , and the Cubs push a game 7 of the World Series .

Trump, however, regained some support among white voters, particularly among white women, despite the nearly-month long spotlight on allegations of him engaging in lewd behavior with women. When it comes to non-white voters, however, Clinton dwarfs Trump, 83 percent to 9 percent.\u00a0 Clinton continues to dominate in areas that have historically predicted the winner of the statewide race. In Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, the former secretary of state leads Trump by a 62 to 29 percent margin. Most of Trump\u2019s overall improvement in Pennsylvania, however, is attributed to his gains in western portion of the state, where he has a 16 point lead over Clinton. And in an election that has seen record low favorability and approval ratings, Clinton\u2019s positive numbers have declined since last month while Trump\u2019s has ticked up. Monmouth University contacted 403 Pennsylvania residents via telephone from October 29 to November 1. The poll has a margin of error of 4.9 percent. A similar poll released by CNN and ORC International showed that Clinton leads Trump by the same margin--4 percent--among likely Keystone State voters. When it comes to important issues, the poll says, voters have more faith in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to handle foreign policy, terrorism, health care and trade with other countries than her Republican counterpart.\u00a0 Voters, however, believe that Trump would approach economy-related issues more appropriately. What\u2019s more, the poll revealed, voters rate Clinton and Trump equally when it comes to immigration-related issues. ",

Credit Ezra Shaw/Getty Images A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor\u2019s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor\u2019s foot may not have been on the bag. That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez. Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis\u2019s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop. David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders. Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs\u2019 worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs\u2019 fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I.

Credit Ken Blaze/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners. Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game. With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat. Victor Mather: It\u2019s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it. David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up. It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky. Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning Photo Chicago\u2019s Kyle Schwarber was tagged out by Cleveland\u2019s Francisco Lindor while trying to stretch a single into a double in the third inning. Credit Ken Blaze/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning. Victor Mather: Maybe you aren\u2019t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron. David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench. Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself Photo Cleveland\u2019s Jose Ramirez was picked off at first base by Chicago\u2019s Anthony Rizzo off a throw from pitcher Kyle Hendricks in the second inning. Credit Charles Leclaire/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it. Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks\u2019 ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis\u2019s speed. David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall\u2019s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out. The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs\u2019 batters getting warmed up in this weather. Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In Photo Cleveland\u2019s Lonnie Chisenhall made a catch on a fly ball hit by Chicago\u2019s Willson Contreras in the second inning. Credit Matt Slocum/Associated Press Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop. David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it\u2019s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even. Bottom of 1st: Indians Can\u2019t Match Cubs\u2019 Start Photo Cleveland\u2019s Mike Napoli broke his bat connecting on a pitch in the first inning. Credit David Richard/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Indians were not able to match the Cubs\u2019 strong start to the game. Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks\u2019s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning. Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs. David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \u201cMy bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\u201d he said. Too much info? Advertisement Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One Photo Chicago\u2019s Dexter Fowler celebrated his solo home run in the first inning. Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland\u2019s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series. After Fowler\u2019s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single. Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning. Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for. David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans. Here\u2019s What to Expect in Game 7 Photo A fan dressed as a goat wandered around outside Progressive Field in Cleveland before Game 7. Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press.. \u25a0 The Cubs\u2019 Kyle Hendricks will face off against Indians ace Corey Kluber. While Hendricks, who led the majors in earned run average, is no pushover, Kluber won Games 1 and 4 and will be attempting to become just the 13th pitcher to earn three victories in a single World Series . The last to do it was Randy Johnson with the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, but one of Johnson\u2019s wins came as a reliever. The last player to win three World Series starts was Mickey Lolich, who did it for the 1968 Detroit Tigers. \u25a0 The Cubs have struggled to hit through must of the series, but Kris Bryant, the team\u2019s best hitter, has found a groove. He homered in Game 5 and then went 4 for 5 with another home run in Game 6. The surge has helped all the hitters around him, as Cleveland finally has someone to fear. Should the Cubs win Game 7, Bryant would be a potential M.V.P. candidate. \u25a0 Outfield miscommunication was a huge issue for Cleveland in Game 6 , with a brutal misplay costing the Indians two runs in the first inning. It continued after the game with center fielder Tyler Naquin claiming both players called for the ball and right-fielder Lonnie Chisenhall saying neither did. Tonight, the Indians will start the veteran Rajai Davis, bringing some much-needed experience to the outfield. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u25a0 Both managers have extreme faith in their closers, but Francona appears to have a bullpen advantage in Game 7 as a result of not using Andrew Miller or Cody Allen in the Game 6 blowout. Desperate to stay alive at all costs in that game, Joe Maddon endured some criticism for letting closer Aroldis Chapman throw 20 pitches to get four outs in a game that was never close. He insisted after the game that it would not affect Chapman\u2019s availability tonight. \u25a0 Weather could be an issue. According to The Weather Channel, the chance of precipitation increases steadily throughout the game, going from 5 percent at 8 p.m. to 15 percent at 9 a.m., 25 percent at 10 p.m. and 55 percent at 11 p.m. As rain-shortened games are not permitted in the postseason, the game has to go all nine innings. Considering the slow the pace of play for much of the postseason, a rain delay is certainly possible. \u25a0 This is the first Game 7 since 2014, when the Giants beat the Royals in a taut encounter that featured a rare five-inning save by Madison Bumgarner. In 2011, the Cardinals rallied from a 2-0 first inning deficit to beat the Rangers, 6-2. Before that, you have to go back to 2002, when the Angels won their only World Series with a 4-1 win over the Giants. Cubs Fans Invade Cleveland Photo Kristin Cisek, left, and Mike Crittendon wrote messages on the wall outside Wrigley Field before Game 7. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times Once again, the weather in Cleveland is a summery 69 degrees and thousands of nervous baseball fans have been roaming the streets of downtown in anticipation of a historic Game 7. Progressive Field is overrun with Cubs fans. I spoke to a few who drove in today from Chicago and said that I-90 was saturated with vehicles full of Cubs fans making the five-and-a-half hour drive across Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. They said the rest stops were swarming with Cubs fans high-fiving one another. The scene is set, batting practice is over, and in only a few minutes the game of the century will begin. Someone\u2019s long, agonizing history will change within the next three or four hours, and someone else\u2019s will trudge on as it has for decades. ",

    "text": "MH370 Likely Spiraled Out of Control Into Indian Ocean, Report Suggests By Erin Dooley Nov 2, 2016, 2:56 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH MH370 Two Years Later: Here's What We Know About the Missing Plane 0 Shares Email MH370 , the Malaysia Airlines jet that mysteriously vanished in March 2014, likely accelerated on decent as it corkscrewed into the Indian Ocean -- indicating the plane probably wasn\u2019t configured for a controlled landing, a new report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau suggests. Though the jet\u2019s transponder and automated data systems were switched off early in the flight, rudimentary Satcom continued to ping. Investigators have assessed that data and believe it is \u201cconsistent with the aircraft being in a high and increasing rate of descent,\u201d according to the ATSB. Malaysia Airlines Mystery May Never Be Solved, Officials Say Additionally, analysis of debris that washed ashore indicates the Boeing 777\u2019s flaps were likely \u201cin the retracted position\u201d when the plane hit the water -- consistent with the ATSB\u2019s theory that the plane plunged in the sea seconds after running out of fuel. (A competing theory suggests someone in the cockpit may have deliberately attempted to ditch the jet by landing it on the surface of the ocean, a maneuver that normally would have included deploying the flaps.) All this data seems to suggest that authorities are searching in the right place -- as do the drift patterns of the debris. But despite scouring more than 110,000 square kilometers (about 42,471 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, investigators have yet to unearth the wreckage of the plane or the remains of its 239 occupants. The conundrum has Australian authorities wondering if there could possibly be something they\u2019ve missed, prompting them to release their data in the hopes that other analysts can identify an alternative scenario. ABC News' David Kerley contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

It happened in the '60s. It shouldn't happen in 2016.\" After a fire consumed Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, the words 'Vote Trump' were written along the side of the building in Greenville, Mississippi. Angie Quezada Greenville Police Chief Delando Wilson said investigators were \"possibly talking to a person of interest\" but had no suspects in custody or surveillance video of the fire, which appeared to have been deliberately set. \"It is a local person who lives in the area,\" Wilson told NBC News. He declined to identify the man or his race. Donald Trump's presidential campaign said Wednesday night that it was \"deeply saddened for the members of the Hopewell M.B. Church community and condemn[s] in the strongest terms this terrible act that has no place in our society.\" \"We are grateful that no one was hurt and we urge witnesses with any information to come forward and help bring justice to those who are responsible,\" the campaign said. Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, said in what appeared to be a personally signed tweet that \"this kind of hate has no place in America.\" The perpetrators who set the Hopewell M.B. Church in MS on fire must be brought to justice. This kind of hate has no place in America. -H \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 3, 2016 Pastor Carolyn Hudson said the 200-member church hadn't received any recent threats. \"Our church was a historic church that has been there for over 111 years,\" Hudson said. \"This has left our hearts broken, but we are strong together. ... Y'all continue to pray for us.\" A spokeswoman for Simmons, the mayor, told NBC News that the church hadn't been targeted before \u2014 \"not in recent years that I know of,\" she said. The FBI, meanwhile, confirmed that it was \"aware of the situation in Greenville.\" \"We are working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed,\" Brett Carr, an FBI spokesman, said in a statement. The fire was reported at 9:16 p.m. (10:16 p.m. ET) Tuesday, and when firefighters arrived they found the main sanctuary of the brick building engulfed in flames, Greenville Fire Chief Ruben Brown said. The Trump graffiti was found in big letters on an outside wall, he said. Investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the state fire marshal's were on the scene. Greenville is a mostly black city of 34,000 in the Mississippi Delta where Simmons said \"the racial climate is fairly good.\" He said the most recent racist incident happened on Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, when somebody spray-painted the N-word on the city's boat ramp. But Mississippi also has a sad history of African-American churches being targeted by vandals. \"The black church has always been a symbol of the black community,\" Simmons said. A GoFundMe page has been set up to collect money to repair the church. Corky Siemaszko ",
