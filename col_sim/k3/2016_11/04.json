    "text": "Email CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A man riding with a motorist who was fatally shot by a police officer while running away from a traffic stop testified Thursday that he doesn\u2019t know why his friend tried to flee. Former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, second from right, sits in the courtroom, Thursday, Nov. 3, 2016 in Charleston, S.C.\u00a0 Grace Beahm, AP \u201cThat\u2019s a question I would like to ask him. Unfortunately I can\u2019t. He was murdered,\u201d said Pierre Fulton, who worked with Walter Scott at a distribution warehouse, and was riding in the front passenger seat when Michael Slager, a North Charleston police officer, pulled them over for a broken tail light. A bystander\u2019s cellphone recording of Scott\u2019s death stunned the nation as the images spread on social media. Slager, who is white, faces 30 years to life if convicted of murdering Scott, who was black. He also faces separate federal charges including violations of Scott\u2019s civil rights. Fulton said Scott surrendered his driver\u2019s license and stepped out of the car. Slager then ordered Scott to get back in again, and he complied. Then, as the officer was checking the information, Scott bolted. \u201cThe next thing you know he was out the door,\u201d Fulton said. The gunshots rang out a short time later, he said. Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said Slager fired eight times after failing to subdue Scott with a stun gun; five of the shots hit Scott in the back and buttocks. The bystander\u2019s video showed Scott, 50, being felled from a distance. It did not capture the entirety of the encounter; nor did the dash cam video from Slager\u2019s cruiser, which recorded only the traffic stop itself. Jurors watched that dash cam video in court on Thursday. It shows Scott suddenly running from his car and out of view after Slager goes to his cruiser to check the license. North Charleston Police Sgt. Scott Hille, called by the prosecution to introduce the police video, was asked by the defense if it showed anything unprofessional in Slager\u2019s behavior in handling the stop. An undated photo shows Walter Scott. WCSC via Facebook Hille replied: \u201cNot that I can think of sir.\u201d Scott\u2019s family members and friends were the first to take the stand. His fiancee, Charlotte Jones, called him a \u201cloving and kind person.\u201d Neighbor Arthur Heyward, who had just sold Scott the car, called him \u201ca good friend and neighbor. We looked out for each other.\u201d Wilson told the jury of 11 whites and one black in her opening statement that even if Scott wrestled with Slager over the stun gun, that provocation did not justify being shot to death. \u201cIf Walter Scott had not resisted arrest, he wouldn\u2019t have been shot. He paid the extreme consequence for his conduct. He lost his life for his foolishness,\u201d she acknowledged. But she said Slager must be held accountable for \u201chis decision to go too far -- his decision to let his sense of authority get the better of him.\u201d Defense attorney Andy Savage countered that Slager \u201cearned a reputation of excellence\u201d in his five years with the North Charleston police, and he sought to pin responsibility on Scott. \u201cWhy did he choose not to respect the request to stay where he was? That\u2019s something that I hope you consider,\u201d Savage told the jurors. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Mr. Slager who was angry and full of animosity.\u201d The family has said Scott may have tried to flee because he was worried about having to go back to jail for missing child support payments. Savage called that \u201cpure speculation,\u201d and said there was no way Slager could have known Scott was unarmed. ",

In a blog post on Medium , Julie Lythcott-Haims wrote that she was a dorm mate with now Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel at Stanford in 1985-86. Lythcott-Haims wrote that Thiel told her that \"moral issues were irrelevant\" to the racist government's economy. As an African-American women, Lythcott-Haims wrote, she was taken aback that he would say this to her \"with no facial affect.\" She went on to say that Thiel made \"no effort to even acknowledge the pain the concept of apartheid could possibly raise for me, a Black women.\" Peter Thiel Stands Out In Silicon Valley For Support Of Donald Trump Lythcott-Haims says she brought up the incident because Thiel is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, who has faced charges of racism in both his past and in the way he has run his presidential campaign. Thiel spoke in support of Trump at this year's Republican National Convention and donated $1.25 million to the campaign. (Thiel has also been in the news for secretly backing a lawsuit against Gawker Media, which filed for bankruptcy after a $140 million verdict against it for posting a sex tape of former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The suit was recently settled for $31 million.) Lythcott-Haims says the apartheid incident stuck like a \"lump in my throat\" for 30 years. But when Thiel, who is now a very high-profile Silicon Valley investor, endorsed Trump \"I knew I shouldn't keep it to myself any longer,\" she wrote. Article continues after sponsorship Lythcott-Haims' account of Thiel's opinion about apartheid was backed up by Megan Maxwell, who also attended Stanford with Thiel. Maxwell, who is also an African-American, told NPR that in a separate incident Thiel also told her that \"morality and governments shouldn't be connected\" and that \"you shouldn't judge a government based on whether it fits your view of morality.\" In a statement, a spokesperson for Thiel said: \"Peter has never supported apartheid, but he can easily see how a conversation might be misremembered 30 years later.\" Both conversations did occur at a time when apartheid was a hot topic on American college campuses. Students were organizing protests over university investments in South Africa and there was debate over the best tactics to use for the country to end its racist system. Thiel was then and still is a Libertarian and if you were to give him the benefit of the doubt he may have been arguing that the U.S. should stay out of South African politics, which would be consistent with Libertarian philosophy. He initially made his fortune as an investor in PayPal and was part of what the tech world calls the \"PayPal\" mafia, a group of early employees and investors that includes Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and Space X, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Thiel's quirky personality is so famous among techies that there's a character spoof of him in the HBO show Silicon Valley. The character Peter Gregory is famously known to be a brilliant investor who has little awareness of the feelings of the people around him. Indeed, Maxwell said you have to wonder about someone who \"would imagine trying to defend apartheid to two black women in separate discussions. Did he have no sense of his audience? Did he just not care?\" Maxwell wondered. \"What is your world that it's OK for you to do this? I think that was the freakiest thing.\" Correction Nov. 3, 2016 ",

Grace Beahm/AP hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/AP Former North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager (second from left) in the courtroom in Charleston, S.C., on Thursday. Grace Beahm/AP Testimony in the trial of former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager opened Thursday with statements from both the prosecution and defense. Slager is accused of murdering Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, last year. For Many, S.C. Police Shooting Trial May Finally Offer A Turning Point In her opening statement , prosecutor Scarlett Wilson emphasized that Scott had been shot in the back multiple times after fleeing a traffic stop, and called his death an \"extreme consequence.\" Conversely, Slager's defense attorney, Andy Savage, reminded jurors that their consideration of the case must be \"governed by a presumption of innocence.\" Savage argued that it was Scott who provoked the shooting. \"It wasn't Mr. Slager who was angry and full of animosity,\" he said. Slager was fired after video of the encounter taken by a witness emerged. NPR's Debbie Elliott has reported on the video footage of the shooting: \"Video from Slager's dashcam shows the officer at the driver's window, asking for Scott's driver's license and questioning him about documents for the car. After Slager returns to his patrol car, Scott jumps out of the car and runs. Slager gives chase, and there's an off-camera confrontation. \"That's where a bystander video picks up . The bystander recorded the scene unfolding in an empty lot, and it's startling. Scott is running away from the officer when Slager opens fire. \"Slager said Scott had his Taser, but the bystander video that surfaced a few days after the shooting appears to contradict this story. Once it was public, the North Charleston Police Department fired the officer, and a grand jury indicted him for murder.\" Article continues after sponsorship Some Key Facts We've Learned About Police Shootings Over The Past Year The Charleston Post and Courier reported that the jury is made up of 11 white people and one black person from Charleston County. During jury selection, the defense blocked nine potential jurors, including seven minorities, according to The Associated Press. The population of Charleston County, where the trial is taking place, is made up of about 28 percent black people, according to the latest Census data . The newspaper reported that both sides in the case raised objections during the jury selection process: \"The jury [was finalized] after prosecutors dropped a legal challenge, alleging the defense's dismissal of seven minorities from the jury pool was racially motivated. \"The panel members were plucked at random from a pool of more than 100, all of whom knew about the killing, defense lawyer Andy Savage said in court after the group was selected. About 95 percent had seen the footage [of the shooting].\" The Post and Courier reported that Judge Clifton Newman denied a defense request to move the trial to a different county, where fewer people were familiar with the case. Slager faces a sentence up to life in prison if he is convicted, as NPR has reported . Slager is facing separate civil rights charges in federal court. The city of North Charleston approved a $6.5 million civil settlement with Scott's family in 2015, reported South Carolina Public Radio . ",

(Victoria Will/Invision/AP) Erik WempleThe Washington Post We knew that Megyn Kelly , the star anchor at Fox News , has alleged that now-ousted Fox News chief Roger Ailes sexually harassed her about a decade ago, before she became a host. Those allegations were among many \u2013 prompted by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson 's sexual harassment suit \u2013 that forced the ouster of Ailes from his post over the summer. As part of an inquiry by the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly came forward with her explosive story. What we didn't know were details. That's changing, thanks to leaks from Kelly's forthcoming book, \"Settle For More,\" whose official release date is Nov. 15. Radar Online is reporting that Kelly wrote in the book that she received word from her managing editor that she'd \"captured the attention of Mr. Ailes.\" She was called in to meet with Ailes at Fox News' Manhattan offices. Via Radar: \"Roger began pushing the limits,\" she alleges. \"There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger's office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me \u2013 veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the 'very sexy bras' I must have and how he'd like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\" ",

Devon Thomas, 22, is charged with stomping and beating his son, Tayveon Thomas, age 3, to death on Halloween, and attacking his fiancee, the boy's mother. (Chicago police photo /) Liam Ford Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A West Pullman man beat and stomped his 3-year-old son to death and knocked his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, the boy\u2019s mother, into a wall so hard when she tried to intervene that she delivered their baby prematurely, prosecutors said Thursday. Devon Thomas, 22, is charged with murder in the death Monday of Tayveon J. Thomas, and aggravated battery of a pregnant woman in the attack on the boy\u2019s mother, who had been eight months pregnant. He was ordered held without bail in a hearing midday Thursday in Cook County Bond Court before Judge Laura Marie Sullivan. Tayveon was pronounced dead \u00a0at Roseland Community Hospital on Monday at 1:15 p.m., after his father called 911 from the family\u2019s home in the 12200 block of South Green Street, prosecutors said. Thomas had punched Tayveon several times in front of his mother on Saturday, and when she tried to stop Thomas, he choked her until she started to lose consciousness, Assistant Cook County state\u2019s attorney Holly Grosshans said Thursday. On Sunday, Tayveon had a stomach ache and vomited, and his mother gave him a generic medication meant to treat an upset stomach, prosecutors said. At the family apartment on Monday, Thomas, who was wearing boots, punched Tayveon multiple times in the chest and torso, then stomped on his legs, arms and body, prosecutors said. Tayveon\u2019s mother walked into his room to bring him some medicine and saw Thomas punching and stomping on Tayveon. When she tried to get Thomas to stop, he slapped in the face, knocking her into a wall and causing her to fall to the floor, prosecutors said. Thomas then grabbed her by her ponytail and dragged her to the apartment\u2019s front room. The two argued in the front room until his mother went to Tayveon\u2019s room and found him lying unresponsive, face down on his bed, his body against the wall, prosecutors said. His mother began doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and chest compressions on Tayveon and called for Thomas, who called 911, prosecutors said. Thomas took over doing chest compressions on the boy until fire department paramedics arrived. Paramedics took Tayveon to Roseland, where he was pronounced dead. Within a few hours of Tayveon\u2019s death, his mother began to have contractions, and delivered her baby prematurely, prosecutors said. Thomas was arrested and made a videotaped statement to detectives, admitting he punched Tayveon in the chest four times and kicked him once in the stomach. Signs abuse on Tayveon included fresh cuts to his face and scalp, interior abdominal bleeding and right and left lung contusions, prosecutors said. He also had an old fracture to the left arm and scars from a previous burn on his body, including on his lower abdomen, lower back and buttocks. The Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office determined Tayveon died from multiple injuries due to child abuse in a homicide. Thomas\u2019 attorney said her client was engaged to be married to the victim\u2019s mother. ",

By Greg Miller and Adam Entous November 3 at 6:35 PM Follow @gregpmiller U.S. intelligence agencies do not see Russia as capable of using cyberespionage to alter the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, but they have warned that Moscow may continue meddling after the voting has ended to sow doubts about the legitimacy of the result, U.S. officials said. The assessment reflects widespread concern among U.S. spy agencies that a months-long campaign by Russia to rattle the mechanisms of American democracy will probably continue after polls close on one of the most polarizing races in recent history, extending and amplifying the political turbulence. U.S. security officials have not ruled out Russian-sponsored disruption on Election Day. In recent weeks, officials at the Department of Homeland Security have collected evidence of apparent Russian \u201cscanning\u201d of state-run databases and computer voting systems. \u201cWhether they were really trying hard to get in, it\u2019s not clear,\u201d a U.S. official said. Still, the decentralized nature of U.S. polling would make it extraordinarily difficult to subvert a nationwide race. Instead, U.S. officials said it is more likely that Russia would use hacking tools to expose or fabricate signs of vote-rigging, aiming to delegitimize an election outcome that Republican candidate Donald Trump has said he may refuse to accept if he does not win. \u201cI think it\u2019s correct to say the Russians don\u2019t think they can dictate the outcome,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. But even as votes are being tallied Tuesday, Schiff said, Russian intelligence services are likely to be \u201clooking through their troves of hacked documents and seeing what they can release.\u201d At the third and final presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Russian President Vladimir Putin would \"rather have a puppet as president.\" (The Washington Post) Whether Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevails, Schiff said, the United States \u201ccan expect a lot more of the same in terms of cyber-malevolence and influence\u201d from Moscow. U.S. officials said there is still time for last-minute disruptions, even if the overall election appears relatively secure. Several officials said they fear that even an isolated operation that forces a voting system offline could erode confidence. Schiff and others said they remain worried that Moscow could dump doctored documents over the weekend that appear to expose illegality by the Clinton or Trump campaigns \u2014 disclosures designed to create confusion among voters and be difficult to disprove before citizens cast their votes. No forgeries have so far been identified among the thousands of files that U.S. officials believe were stolen by Russia and essentially laundered to the U.S. public and media through the WikiLeaks website. The fact that Russia has so far refrained from altering documents or planting forgeries among the leaked emails is seen by some U.S. officials as potentially setting the stage for a more sinister plot. The media and public have come to see the WikiLeaks stockpiles as authentic, increasing the potential impact if Russia were to insert a deliberate but compelling falsehood. Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin has repeatedly denied any Russian involvement in the \u00adelection-related hacks. But those assertions have been dismissed by U.S. intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts, with some saying that Russia engaged in sloppy tradecraft or seemed not terribly concerned about covering its tracks. Anxiety about late-election vulnerabilities has factored into the Obama administration\u2019s reluctance so far to retaliate against Russia. The White House has opted against authorizing any countermeasures despite high confidence across U.S. spy agencies that Russia alone orchestrated the digital theft of thousands of sensitive documents posted online in recent months by WikiLeaks. The releases have included hacked files of the Democratic National Committee and emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, among others. 1 of 48 What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail View Photos The GOP presidential nominee is out on the trail ahead of the general election in November.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The White House has been weighing countermeasures for months but worried that retaliating before the election would give Moscow time to inflict more direct damage in the waning days of the campaign. \u201cEscalation in the cyber-realm can happen quickly,\u201d a senior U.S. official said. Those urging restraint say they believe the Russian threat would be diminished after Election Day. Officials said the White House is also reluctant to take decisions on an escalation that could have profound implications for the next president. U.S. officials said the options under consideration include kicking more suspected Russian intelligence officers out of the United States, imposing new economic sanctions against Russian entities tied to the alleged hacking and potentially launching cyberattacks on Russian computer systems. Obama used cyberweapons to hobble Iran\u2019s nuclear program early in his first term but has been reluctant to go down that road again, aides say. The administration\u2019s decision could depend on what the Russians do in the coming days. An election-disrupting attack would probably trigger a more aggressive U.S. response, according to officials. U.S. officials say the stakes have been made clear to Moscow. The election-related tensions are part of a broader escalation in the level of antagonism between the United States and its former Cold War adversary. The two countries are fighting a proxy war against each other in Syria, are competing for influence elsewhere in the Middle East and are at odds over Russian intervention in Ukraine. The hack of the DNC was blamed on Russia by cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials the moment it was publicly disclosed in June. The administration formally went public with its case last month , issuing a statement from Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson concluding that intrusions were authorized by \u201cRussia\u2019s senior most officials.\u201d Even so, there is still disagreement among some agencies and analysts over Moscow\u2019s objectives. The White House has maintained that it does not believe Russia\u2019s operations have been aimed at delivering an election win for Trump, who has praised Putin and argued there is no evidence of Russian involvement in the hacks \u2014 a position at odds with what he has been told in classified briefings. The operations could be a more general effort to embarrass the United States and disrupt democratic institutions. Clinton has said that Russia is seeking to ensure her defeat, a contention some U.S. intelligence officials say they believe is supported by the one-sided nature of the leaks. U.S. officials have speculated that Putin harbors personal animosity toward Clinton, believing that while serving as secretary of state she helped incite mass protests in Moscow that embarrassed the former KGB operative. Even if there are no further election-related disruptions and Clinton emerges victorious, some U.S. officials believe that Russia has already accomplished many of its goals. \u201cThey\u2019ve weakened Secretary Clinton by dumping information from her campaign manager and others,\u201d Schiff said. The leaks have exposed infighting between Clinton and her former Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, forced the resignation of the DNC chief and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 cast Russia and its capacity to inflict damage as an ominous figure looming over the 2016 campaign. \u201cThey enjoy being the subject of discussion in an American election,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt enhances their prestige in a bizarre way that they\u2019re considered a player. This is also their way of payback, and I think they are delighting in that.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "Report: Upcoming Megyn Kelly book details sexual harassment by Roger Ailes William Cummings , USA TODAY 10:43 a.m. EDT November 4, 2016 2.8k Shares x Share In a leaked excerpt of her new book, \"Settle for More,\" the Fox News host reportedly talks about her experiences with Roger Ailes. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Megyn Kelly is revealing the\u00a0details of \u00a0her alleged sexual harassment by her former Fox News boss, Roger Ailes, in her upcoming book,\u00a0Settle For More, according to Radar Online, which says it obtained a copy of the book. Ailes offered to advance Kelly's career \"in exchange for sexual favors\" and he implied he would not renew her contract when she refused his advances, Kelly writes, according to Radar . Ailes was ousted as the CEO of Fox News\u00a0\u2014 a position he had held since the network's launch\u00a0\u2014 after former Fox News broadcaster Gretchen Carlson sued him for sexual harassment and other women came forward with similar allegations. Fox later settled with Carlson for $20 million. Kelly writes that the inappropriate\u00a0behavior began when she was told by her managing editor that she had \"captured the attention of Mr. Ailes\" while she was working as a legal correspondent for the network's Washington bureau, Radar reports. Ailes summoned her to several meetings in his New York office, and \"began pushing the limits,\u201d Kelly wrote, according to Radar. \u201cThere was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger\u2019s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me \u2014 veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the \u2018very sexy bras\u2019 I must have and how he\u2019d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\u201d She wrote that she rejected every offer from Ailes to advance her career in exchange for sex, but in January of 2006, she wrote Ailes\u00a0\u201ccrossed a new line \u2014 trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.\u201d When she pushed him away, \u201che asked me an ominous question: \u2018When is your contract up?\u2019 And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.\u201d The harassment ended six months later when Kelly reported Ailes to a supervisor\u00a0\u2014 who is left unnamed in Radar's account and presumably in the book as well\u00a0\u2014 and Kelly kept quiet until Carlson sued Ailes for harassment, she wrote, according to Radar. \u201cCrossing him was a major risk,\u201d Radar says she wrote, \u201cbut what if \u2014 God forbid \u2014 he was still doing it to someone?\u201d Kelly then related her experience to Lachlan Murdoch, the co-chairman of Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, Radar reported. When Ailes tried to get Fox News employees and on-air personalities to defend him from Carlson's allegations, Kelly stayed quiet. \u201cI was approached several times, and several times I refused,\u201d she wrote, according to Radar. The book is slated to come out on Nov. 15. \u00a0She is in active talks to renew her contract with Fox News and is seeking $20 million a year, according to The Wall Street Journal. Posted!

    "text": "State Dept. Drops More Clinton Emails Days From Election By JUSTIN FISHEL Nov 3, 2016, 4:28 PM ET 0 Shares Play Carlos Barria/Reuters WATCH Clinton Notes Women Couldn't Vote the Last Time the Chicago Cubs Won the World Series 0 Shares Email The State Department published an additional 1,280 pages of official email belonging to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this afternoon as part of a court-ordered effort to produce some of her more recently discovered correspondence before the presidential election . The documents come from the nearly 15,000 emails the FBI recovered during its investigation into the Democratic nominee's handling of sensitive information on a controversial private email server. When We Might Know More on FBI's Renewed Investigation Into Clinton's Email Server The State Department said today \"a significant number are 'near duplicates' of documents previously provided by former Secretary Clinton\" which have already been released to the public. \"For instance, a 'near duplicate' would be substantively identical to previously released emails,but for a top email in the chain stating 'Please print,'\" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said in an emailed statement. Some 5,600 of the 15,000 emails turned up by the FBI have been deemed work-related, but it's not clear how many of them actually consist of new material. The State Department is under a court order to release another batch of these emails on Friday and the rest will come in monthly, post-election tranches. But Clinton's emails woes have moved far beyond this highly-controlled process of releasing official correspondence from her private server. For nearly a month now, her campaign has been faced with a daily onslaught of hacked emails belonging to her campaign chairman John Podesta, published by document-leaking website WikiLeaks. In addition, the FBI announced last Friday that it has new emails in its possession that may be relevant to its investigation into her handling of classified information on her private server -- essentially re-opening a case that everyone thought had been closed on July 5 -- not to mention throwing a huge wrench into the gears just days before the election. Ironically, one new email from 2010 offers a suggestion on how Clinton ought to respond to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange after he posted roughly 250,000 State Department cables online. \"We view this not as a 'clever game' of wiki leaks but rather as a 'criminal act' against the United States of America,\" the email said. \"He [presumably Assange] might think this is a clever game today -- but when he is prosecuted and if convicted, he will move from being a clever-cyber thief to a convicted criminal -- and will find out that's a whole different kind of game.\" Six years after that email was written, Julian Assange remains free, holed-up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, avoiding extradition to Sweden over a sex-crimes investigation. His site, WikiLeaks, has continued publishing private government and corporate documents it obtains. 0 Shares ",

Less conventional election prediction systems are also sending mixed signals about which presidential candidate will prevail on Nov. 8, making life tough for certainty-loving stock investors. Since U.K. pollsters got the Brexit vote\u00a0wrong back in June, causing a short bout of market hysteria after the surprise decision to exit the European Union, USA TODAY checked out\u00a0what less well-known prognostication systems are saying about the chances of Democrat and incumbent party candidate Hillary Clinton and\u00a0Republican challenger Donald Trump. For clues, we checked out predictions tied to the stock market, Americans\u2019 pocketbooks and the World Series. Market says Trump's a winner Barring a big stock rally heading into Tuesday\u2019s vote, the market is currently predicting a Trump win. The methodology used to tab Trump the winner is simple: when the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index does not post a gain in the three months leading up to Election Day, the incumbent party candidate normally loses. The market is down about 4% since early August, which bodes negatively for Clinton. The indicator, courtesy of Strategas Research Partners, basically says the candidate from the incumbent party benefits from the good vibes a rising stock market creates, but can be doomed by a lousy market. Since 1928 this indicator has correctly predicted\u00a0the next president 19 of 22 times. Says Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas: \"Stocks are now sending one of two messages. First, the probability of a Trump win is increasing. Stocks are down 4% since August 8th and that has not been a good sign for the incumbent party historically.\u201d Pocketbooks pick Clinton\u00a0 A peek inside Americans\u2019 pocketbooks, however, suggests Hillary Clinton will be the next president. The \u201cPocketbook Model,\u201d created by the Anderson Economic Group, predicts the\u00a0former secretary of state will win by 3 to 6 percentage points. The data-driven \u201cPocketbook Model\u201d ignores polls, debate performances, policy positions and candidates\u2019 personalities. It looks at just five variables: unemployment, wage growth, inflation, whether the nation is at war, and third-party candidates. Fitness band RIP? Fitbit fit to be tied \u201cAs divisive, surprising and objectionable as campaigns often are, in the end voters go with their pocketbook,\u201d says Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group. This model\u00a0starts with the assumption that most Americans generally reward the incumbent party with their vote when the economy is good, and punish them when it\u2019s not. Anderson says AEG\u2019s model has predicted the largest vote-getter in 22 of the past 25 elections, and every election since 1980. At the moment, pocketbook issues are trending higher, which favors Clinton. The nation\u2019s 5% unemployment rate is down from its peak of 10% in October 2009. Wages have risen five straight months and inflation remains tame. And then there's baseball ...\u00a0 The \u201cWorld Series Presidential Predictor\u201d gives the edge to Clinton. So Democrats can thank the Chicago Cubs. In the 1972 inaugural issue of The Baseball Research Journal, a study of World Series results between 1952 and 1968 found the Democratic candidate for president won the election every time a National League team won the World Series; the Republican candidate was victorious if an American League team became world champs. The Cubs hail from the National League, which signals a Clinton win. This baseball indicator, however, when stretched out to include presidential elections from 1908 thru 2012, is less illuminating, as its accuracy is just 55.6% (it's been right 15 of 27 times). ",

    "text": "Email WOODRUFF, S.C. -- A South Carolina woman who vanished more than two months ago was found alive Thursday morning inside a padlocked 30\u2019 by 15\u2019 metal container on a rural property, \u201cchained like a dog,\u201d a sheriff said. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright says deputies heard 30-year-old Kala Brown banging on the walls of the container as they served a search warrant at the nearly 100-acre Woodruff property related to the search for her and her boyfriend, Charlie Carver. Brown told investigators she had been held there against her will for two months. Carver, 32, remains missing. Todd Kohlhepp WSPA \u201cIt was pretty emotional, to say the least,\u201d Wright told reporters. \u201cWhen she was found, she was chained like a dog \u2013 she had a chain around her neck. It\u2019s only by God\u2019s grace we found that little girl alive.\u201d Wright says registered sex offender Todd Kohlhepp was also on the property Thursday morning, and he was arrested \u201cimmediately.\u201d He would likely be charged with kidnapping, Wright said, though more charges are possible. Kohlhepp, 45, has an address listed in Moore, and\u00a0 CBS affiliate WSPA reports he is listed as the owner of the Woodruff property. Brown also told investigators there may be four bodies on the property, but Wright says investigators aren\u2019t sure whether that\u2019s true. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t have a serial killer on our hands,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt very possibly could be what we have.\u201d Brown said she had been fed during her time in captivity, Wright said. She\u2019s being treated at a medical center and was in good condition. Charlie Carver WSPA Wright said investigative leads led them to the property. He wouldn\u2019t detail whether Brown told them any details about Carver\u2019s whereabouts. Carver and Brown were last heard from by family in friends in late August, WSPA reports. The missing case gained national attention after\u00a0 suspicious posts appeared on Carver\u2019s Facebook page that his family suspected were posted by someone else. The page was later taken down. On Thursday, Wright said \u201cit\u2019s super possible [Kohlhepp] was doing that to try and get people off his trail, but that\u2019s just a thought, I don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d The national sex offender registry lists a kidnapping count for Kohlhepp in Arizona in 1987. Spartanburg County Jail records don\u2019t list a charge. A lawyer for Kohlhepp couldn\u2019t immediately be located. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Why a Previously Proposed Route for the Dakota Access Pipeline Was Rejected By Catherine Thorbecke Nov 3, 2016, 4:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Timeline of Events Surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline 0 Shares Email President Obama said in an interview published this week that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was considering rerouting the Dakota Access Pipeline to accommodate the \"sacred lands of Native Americans,\" sparking speculation over the fate of the controversial crude oil pipeline. But it also prompted some to point out that the current path of the pipeline is actually a reroute itself, with critics calling this reroute an act of \"environmental racism.\" A previously proposed route for the 1,172-mile pipeline had it crossing the Missouri River north of Bismarck, North Dakota, according to a document filed as part of the permitting process . The eventual route that was decided on, and is currently in construction, moved the water crossing of the crude oil pipeline south of the North Dakota capital, to just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation. Dakota Access Standoff Unlikely to Reroute Pipeline Due to Major Hurdles, Some Experts Say \u201cThis pipeline was rerouted towards our tribal nations when other citizens of North Dakota rightfully rejected it in the interests of protecting their communities and water. We seek the same consideration as those citizens,\" Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said in a statement on Sunday. \"It\u2019s disappointing to see our state and federal officials advance their corporate, pro-Big Oil energy platform here in North Dakota at the expense of human health, safety and tribal sovereignty,\" Archambault added. Prominent activist Rev. Jesse Jackson , who joined protesters in North Dakota last week, called the reroute \"the ripest case of environmental racism I've seen in a long time.\" James MacPherson/AP Photo Protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline encampment sit on private property near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, owned by the pipeline developer, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, Oct. 26, 2016. The North Dakota Public Service Commission (PSC) refuted allegations of environmental racism, saying that the Bismarck route proposal was never submitted to the agency because permits for it were denied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during its environmental assessment. \u201cThe river crossing north of Bismarck was a proposed alternative considered by the [Dakota Access] company early in the routing process. This route was never included in the proposed route submitted to the PSC and therefore was never vetted or considered by us during our permitting process. It had been eliminated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their environmental assessment,\" North Dakota Public Service Commission Chair Julie Fedorchak said in statement on Oct. 27. \"The final permitted route follows an existing pipeline corridor that has been previously disturbed,\u201d added Fedorchak, who also serves as the \"pipeline siting portfolio holder,\" that is, the person in charge of permitting the pipeline route. Gene Pawlik, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, told ABC News today that \"the Army does not have a set timeframe to complete its ongoing review of previous DAPL permitting decisions. As part of this process, the Army is exploring a range of options that take into account concerns raised by the relevant stakeholders and will decide the best path to move forward.\" \"We cannot speculate on what the possible outcomes of the review might be,\" Pawlik added. In its environmental assessment, the Corps rejected the Bismarck route to protect wells that serve the municipal water supply, according to The Bismarck Tribune . The Bismarck route would also have been more than 10 miles longer and would have made it difficult to meet PSC requirements to keep the pipeline 500 feet or more away from homes, the Tribune reported. The current route of the pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe argues traverses culturally sacred sites and poses a risk to the reservation's water supply, was largely chosen because it runs along existing infrastructure such as railways and other pipelines, Dakota Access argued in its application to the PSC for permits. \"The most significant route revisions occurred early in the routing process and occurred primarily due to attempts to avoid tribal and federally owned lands, minimize environmental impacts, avoid environmentally sensitive areas, and maximize collocation,\" the company stated in its permit application. Josh Morgan/Reuters A log adorned with colorful decorations remains at a Dakota Access Pipeline protest encampment as construction work continues on the pipeline near the town of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, Oct. 30, 2016. However, President Obama's comments on a possible reroute come at a time when the pipeline is nearing completion, meaning there may be major hurdles to rerouting it now, according to some experts. \"For Dakota Access, time is money,\" Tyler Priest, a professor at the University of Iowa who served as a senior policy analyst for the President's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, told ABC News on Monday. \"They want to get this done as fast as they can.\" \"Most of it is already built, so I don't know if it would require pulling up pipeline,\" Priest said of a potential reroute. Afolabi Ogunnaike, a senior analyst at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie who specializes in North America's crude oil markets, told ABC News, \"one would imagine that a reroute is possible, but I don't know how well that would be received,\" adding that the pipeline is \"approaching 90 percent\" completion in areas other than the disputed 20-mile stretch in North Dakota. The movement to block the pipeline has garnered nationwide support, with hundreds of environmentalists and Native American groups camping out in demonstration near the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. A crowdfunding campaign set up for the protesters recently reached the $1 million mark. The fate of the controversial pipeline in its current route currently rests with the Army Corps of Engineers, which is reviewing the final easement that Dakota Access needs in order to construct beneath the Missouri River.

(Roger Morales/Chicago Tribune) A day in the life of Chicago, after 108 years of waiting, the Cubs won the 2016 World Series. (Roger Morales/Chicago Tribune) John Byrne Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The city will honor the World Series champion Chicago Cubs with a Friday \"parade to stand the test of time,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Thursday. The mayor, speaking shortly before noon at an unrelated event, said the parade will be held \"around this time.\" Specifics are being worked out \"as we speak,\" he said. He had no specifics on the route, telling reporters \"just stand somewhere in the middle of the city and you'll see it.\" \"I just talked to Tom Ricketts. I talked to him yesterday a couple times, I talked to him this morning again,\" Emanuel said when asked about the parade. \"I think all of us would just want 20 minutes of consistent sleep, then we're gonna \u2014 Here's the thing: we're going to have a parade in Chicago that will stand the test of time. It will be a parade that 108 years have waited for. It will be a parade and a celebration that all of Chicago for 108 years in their mind's eye, have been envisioning. We're going to make it a reality in the city of Chicago.\" Asked whether the Chicago River will be dyed blue, he said he would like to do that but wasn't certain if it would work. \"I want to do a lot of things,\" Emanuel said. The city had been planning to hold a parade Monday if the Cubs won Game 7, but the team asked to move it up to Friday, a City Hall source said. Baseball general managers will gather Monday in Scottsdale, Ariz. for four days of meetings. And many of the players have offseason homes in other cities and in countries in Latin America, and would prefer not to wait around until next week before getting out of town. Chicago Public Schools students won't have to play hooky to watch the parade \u2014 Friday already was scheduled day off. The mayor's comments came at an unrelated economic development announcement on the South Side. Wearing a Cubs championship hat that he said he grabbed on the field during the celebration in Cleveland, Emanuel repeatedly pleaded for understanding, noting he only got 11/2 hours of sleep after getting back to Chicago. Photos from Game 7 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland on Nov. 2, 2016. \"Where am I, and how did I get here?\" he joked at one point, adding that he forgot his kids' names at a parent-teacher conference at school Thursday.

USA TODAY Early voters enter the Center for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Nov. 3, 2016. (Photo: Gabe Hernandez, Corpus Christi Caller-Times) TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Wanda Williams-Jones and Scott Warmack did their civic duty Thursday \u2014\u00a0two foot soldiers in what is fast becoming a record-setting battle\u00a0of early votes cast in this year's race for the White House. The two voted for different presidential candidates but for the same reason: They had long since made up their minds, and they wanted to put the electoral cacophony behind them. \u201cI\u00a0wanted to get it over with,\u201d Williams-Jones, 52, said after casting her ballot at the Leon County Courthouse and affixing the iconic \u201cI voted\u201d sticker to her blouse.\u00a0\u201cMy mind won\u2019t quit racing, and I won\u2019t have to listen anymore now.\u201d \u201cI was done thinking about all of this,\u201d said Warmack, 51, an auto conversion shop owner in a Tallahassee suburb. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to get in my way of not voting on Election Day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to get in my way of not voting on Election Day,\" said Scott Warmack of Tallahassee, Fla. \u00a0(Photo: Brett Blackledge, USA TODAY Network) Americans who voted early Thursday, like some 34\u00a0million others before them, have their minds made up. They're done thinking about the FBI and Hillary Clinton's \"damn e-mails.\" Or Donald Trump's sexually charged Access Hollywood\u00a0tape. By Election Day, early voters could swell\u00a0to 50\u00a0million. \u201cPeople are so freaked out about the stakes in this election that they are doing whatever they can to make sure that their vote counts,\" said Doug Chapin, an elections expert at the University of Minnesota. Early voters interviewed Thursday by the USA TODAY Network from North Carolina to California indicated a similar desire to lock in their choices now, having seen and heard enough from the candidates, commentators and commercials. They also were eager to avoid long lines \u2014 and potential chaos \u2014 at the polls on Tuesday. President Trump or President Clinton? These key groups offer clues to Tuesday's outcome There were Clinton voters\u00a0convinced the former first lady, senator and secretary of State is\u00a0most qualified for the presidency. And in many cases,\u00a0they were eager to make history by electing the first female president. \"I did get a little choked up, I have to say,\" Cathi DuPuy of Columbus, Ohio, said after voting for Clinton. \"That felt amazing to me.\" There were Trump voters assured the New York developer would best manage the economy and reduce the federal budget deficit \u2014 including some who worried the election, as Trump claims,\u00a0could be rigged. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s talking about,\" said Jay Poage of Wichita County, Texas. \"A man, his mouth can get him in trouble occasionally. But Hillary is under investigation. She should be in jail right now. If you or I did what she did, we\u2019d be locked up already.\" And there were people fed up with both major-party candidates and looking for a third option, contributing to what has been a major increase over 2012 in the number of unaffiliated voters coming to the polls ahead of time. Some landed with Libertarian Gary Johnson . Others opted for a write-in candidate. \"I like that he is fiscally conservative, but progressive socially,\" Stuart Otto of Bellevue, Wis., said of Johnson, the former New Mexico governor. \"I think it's important in this day and age to have a nice combination of both.\" Choosing between Clinton and Trump, he said, would be like \"the lesser of two evils.\" Faced with vague threats of voter intimidation at the polls on\u00a0Tuesday, many were\u00a0going out of their way to vote early for the first time. Earlier this week, Google Trends reported\u00a0that searches for the question \u201cwhere do I vote early?\u201d had\u00a0reached an all-time high . In California, early voters were out in droves Thursday. A steady stream of voters lined up in the Riverside County registrar\u2019s office,\u00a0where teams of volunteers collected mail-in ballots and instructed voters on how to cast their ballot in writing or on electronic machines. California residents participate in early voting in Riverside County on Nov. 3, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Richard Lui, The Desert Sun) Theresa Roush, 55,\u00a0who turned over her ballot in person but would not say who received her vote, hailed early voting for allowing her to research the candidates and ballot measures at home,\u00a0rather than being put on the spot at the polls. First-time voters in Green Bay, Wis., found the process far easier than negotiating potentially long lines next week. \"It's just a time-constraint thing,\" said Joe Kiger, an 18-year-old student at De Pere High School who cast his first presidential vote for Trump. \"I figured next Tuesday would be really busy, especially since I have limited time after school because I have clubs and stuff.\" Various tallies kept by elections experts show early voting could surpass 2012 in popularity by the time Election Day arrives. The percentage of voters who cast ballots early rose from 30% in 2008 to 32% four years ago. That represented about 46 million mail and in-person early votes. This year, Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida who keeps the most up-to-date statistics, expects as many as 35% of the votes to be cast early \u2014 possibly approaching 50 million. \"They have made up their minds,\" McDonald said. \"They feel comfortable about casting their votes.\" Just in case they don't, President Obama added his voice to the effort during one of his many college campus events for Clinton on Thursday. The president urged\u00a04,500 mostly young people at Florida International University in Miami to vote early,\u00a0as a large banner\u00a0hanging over the crowd recommended. Obama campaigning like it's 2008 and reviving the old energy \"We're making this really simple for you.\u00a0I am telling you right now where you can go vote after this rally,\" Obama said, giving out the address of the nearest early voting center at the International Mall library in Doral, Fla. \"If you are just watching on television, or you're not from around here and you're trying to figure out, 'Well, where else could I vote,' then you go to IWillVote.com, and it will give you additional locations,\" the president said. Early voters stand in line in Corpus Christi, Texas. \u00a0(Photo: Gabe Hernandez, Corpus Christi Caller-Times) Among early voting trends seen by experts, and driven home by Thursday's voters: \u2022 Those studying early voting trends in states where voters must register by party say Clinton appears to be doing well in Colorado and Nevada, while Trump looks to be keeping things close in Florida and Ohio. \u2022\u00a0Changes in voting procedures approved by Republican-controlled state legislatures appear to be influencing the votes in some states\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly North Carolina, where a federal court ruled that it discriminated against African Americans. But while the black vote is down there compared to 2012, the number of women voting early has increased far more than the number of men, a factor which could help Clinton blunt her losses. \u2022\u00a0Last week's announcement by FBI Director James Comey that his agency is reviewing more e-mails possibly related to Clinton's use of a private server while secretary of State isn't having much\u00a0impact on early voters from North Carolina to Nevada. \"The preliminary evidence is little or no effect of Comey\u2019s letter depressing Democratic enthusiasm,\" McDonald said. \"I think it's a big non-event.\" \u2022\u00a0So far, African Americans are not turning out for Clinton in the numbers they did for Obama, the nation's first black president. In North Carolina, a key battleground state, black turnout was running 16% lower on Tuesday than on the same day in 2012, said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College. By Thursday morning, white turnout was outpacing black turnout, 35% to 34%. \"I'm not going to align myself with the Democratic Party every time they say 'jump,' \" Theo Noel said while voting early in Asheville, N.C. \"I wrote in somebody that I felt earned a write-in position.\" \u2022\u00a0Hispanic voters appear to be turning out in large numbers, which could help Clinton in the Southwest.\u00a0In Texas\u2019 15 most populous\u00a0counties, more than 3.6 million early and mail-in ballots were\u00a0cast as of Wednesday night, or 37.5% of all registered voters. Early voting has been particularly popular in areas that are heavily Latino. In El Paso on the Mexico border, more than 120,000 people have cast ballots, a 64% increase over 2012. \"I\u2019m very emotional, because this is the first time I vote,\" Clinton supporter Alicia Gonzalez\u00a0said. \"In 2007,\u00a0I became a citizen\u00a0but couldn\u2019t vote because I was working nights.\" \u2022\u00a0Voters are dissatisfied with all of their choices.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s a hot mess,\u201d said Elizabeth Popacostas, 22, a\u00a0University of Nevada-Reno student who voted for Clinton. \u201cI still feel like it\u2019s sort of a joke.\" Randy Mengel, a high school\u00a0history teacher in Asheville, N.C., toyed with voting for Green Party nominee Jill Stein even though she is not on the North Carolina ballot. But he wound up sticking with Clinton \u2014 in part because he rejects Trump's refusal to commit to honoring the results. \u201cI think one thing about Americans is no\u00a0matter how much we disagree, we do agree in the sacredness of the election,\" Mengel said. Royce Turner took part in early voting in West Des Moines, Iowa, on Nov. 3, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: William Petroski, The Des Moines Register) \u2022 Late developments in the campaign have moved a few voters, but not enough to call it a trend. One such voter was\u00a0Royce Turner, a lawyer from West Des Moines, Iowa, who voted at the Polk County Election Office. \u201cI kind of got persuaded with the most recent things that have been going on,\" Turner said. \"I was kind of thinking about Trump, but I am going with Hillary Clinton now. He just said too many things about minorities.\" Trump, who has trailed in the majority of battleground state polls throughout the campaign, has urged early Clinton voters to switch their votes in about a half dozen states where that's permitted. Among them are Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the types of Midwest states he needs to overcome his deficit. \"You can change your vote in six states. So\u00a0now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday. McDonald, for one, doesn't see that happening. \u201cPeople who have been paying attention\u00a0to this election, they have made their choice,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not something they\u2019re going to take back.\u201d Contributing: Gregory Korte in Florida; Eliza Collins in Washington, D.C.; John Moritz\u200b, Matt Woolbright, Sara Sanchez and Christopher Collins, USA TODAY Network-Texas;\u00a0Jessie Balmert, Cincinnati Enquirer; Shelby Le Duc and Todd McMahon,\u00a0USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin; Emily Patrick, Asheville (N.C.)

    "text": "advertisement Donald Trump holds the advantage in the reliably Republican states of Arizona and Texas five days until Election Day, but he's running neck and neck with Hillary Clinton in Georgia, according to a trio of new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls. In Arizona, where Clinton campaigned Wednesday night, Trump leads Clinton by five points among likely voters, 45 percent to 40 percent, while Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3 percent. Back in September, Trump was ahead by just two points in this four-way race, 40 percent to 38 percent. In a head-to-head matchup in Arizona, Trump's edge remains five points, 46 percent to 41 percent. In Georgia, however, Trump is ahead by just one point among likely voters, 45 percent to 44 percent, with Johnson at 8 percent. (Stein isn't on the ballot in the state.) In September, Trump was up two points, 44 percent to 42 percent. Trump's lead is an identical one point in a race without Johnson - Trump 47 percent, Clinton 46 percent. And in Texas , Trump's advantage over Clinton is nine points, 49 percent to 40 percent, with Johnson at 6 percent and Stein at 2 percent. But among the larger universe of registered voters, Trump's lead in the Lone Star State is just four points, 45 percent to 41 percent. (The poll finds a smaller percentage of Latino voters in Texas being likely voters than their makeup of all registered voters in the state.) Clinton's African-American performance is keeping it close in Georgia One of the biggest reasons why Georgia is more competitive than Arizona is due to the African-American vote in Georgia being a larger - and more lopsided - force than Latinos in Arizona. According to the poll, African Americans make up 29 percent of likely voters, and they're breaking for Clinton by a 91 percent to 6 percent margin. In Arizona, by contrast, Latinos make up 21 percent of likely voters, and they're supporting Clinton by a smaller 66 percent-to-26 percent clip. Play ",

By Mike DeBonis November 3 at 6:30 PM Follow @mikedebonis Travis Klinefelter of Dubuque, Iowa rouses the crowd before a rally for Donald J. Trump \u00a0on Oct. 28, 2016 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The crowd of a few thousand warmed up by chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d and waving signs of Women for Trump. (Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images) Senior Republican lawmakers are openly discussing the prospect of impeaching Hillary Clinton should she win the presidency, a stark indication that partisan warfare over her tenure as secretary of state will not end on Election Day. Chairmen of two congressional committees said in media interviews this week they believe Clinton committed impeachable offenses in setting up and using a private email server for official State Department business. And a third senior Republican, the chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, told The Washington Post he is personally convinced Clinton should be impeached for influence peddling involving her family foundation. He favors further congressional investigation into that matter. \u201cIt is my honest opinion that the Clinton Foundation represents potentially one of the greatest examples of political corruption in American history,\u201d said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who leads the Constitution and Civil Justice subcommittee. \u201cNow that perspective may be disproven, time will tell. But given that conviction on my part, I think all options are definitely on the table.\u201d The impeachment talk is the latest sign that Clinton will not be handed a clean slate \u2014 let alone an extended honeymoon \u2014 by Republican lawmakers should she win the presidency. It comes after months of accusations from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to his rival as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d before and after federal investigators announced they would not charge Clinton or her associates over the email matter. When some in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., started chanting \"Lock her up!\" about Hillary Clinton on Oct. 10, the Republican presidential nominee replied: \"Lock her up is right.\" (The Washington Post) Chants of \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d coursed through crowds at the Republican National Convention and at dozens of Trump rallies. The FBI\u2019s disclosure last week that it is examining potential new evidence in the email probe has offered new fuel for the attacks. [ Trump\u2019s un-American campaign: Unleashing the worst ] \u201cHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency, and if she were elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Pensacola, Fla. \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen. And in all fairness, we went through it with her husband. He was impeached. . . . Folks, do we want to go through this again?\u201d Republican lawmakers have aggressively questioned Clinton\u2019s State Department dealings for months, with a special committee impaneled to probe the handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks and separate probes of the department\u2019s personnel practices and handling of classified documents found on her private email server. Top GOP leaders have previously indicated they will aggressively investigate Clinton if she is elected president. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last month he considered a Clinton administration a \u201ctarget-rich environment\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ve got two years\u2019 worth of material already lined up\u201d for investigations. [ House Republicans are already prepping for \u2018years\u2019 of investigations ] Should they keep control of the House in the next Congress, Republicans could easily launch impeachment proceedings, with political will as the most significant obstacle. The House Judiciary Committee typically investigates charges of official wrongdoing and, if it finds them to be warranted, forwards articles of impeachment to the House floor. Articles approved by a majority of the House are then sent to the Senate for a trial, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction. Neither Chaffetz nor House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte (R-Va.) have called for Clinton\u2019s impeachment, but they have made clear they intend to continue probing her emails. In a joint letter sent Thursday, the two chairmen called on Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to preserve documents related to the email investigation, including the new evidence the FBI disclosed last week. Chaffetz and Goodlatte have also asked the federal investigators to probe whether Clinton committed perjury during 2015 testimony before the Benghazi panel. Democrats have warned voters in recent days of apparent GOP obstruction to come, citing the impeachment threats. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what evidence . . . they\u2019ll find something \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying already,\u201d President Obama said Wednesday during a campaign stop in Chapel Hill, N.C. \u201cHow does our democracy function like that?\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that impeaching Clinton for alleged actions that took place before the election \u201cwould be a brazen attempt to nullify the vote of the American people, outside our constitutional framework and destructive to the Framers\u2019 intent.\u201d The Clinton campaign declined to comment. But the senior Republicans say they are convinced Clinton has broken the law and are speculating that she could be criminally charged after she is elected. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News Tuesday the probe into Clinton\u2019s emails \u201cwill continue whether she wins or not.\u201d \u201cAssuming she wins and the investigation goes forward and it looks like an indictment is pending, at that point in time under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial,\u201d he said, warning of a possible \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d In a separate Fox News interview Thursday, McCaul accused Clinton of committing \u201ctreason\u201d in mishandling classified documents. FBI Director James B. Comey said in July there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Clinton or associates willingly broke federal laws but \u201cwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d [ FBI agents knew of emails in early October ] Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, told a Wisconsin newspaper Monday that Clinton could be impeached, citing federal laws against \u201cwillful concealment and destruction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,\u201d he told the Beloit Daily New s. \u201cI would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.\u201d Both McCaul and Johnson have political imperatives for taking a hard line on Clinton: Johnson is locked in a close race to keep his Senate seat and has moved recently to shore up his support among his Republican base. McCaul is said to be considering a possible Senate run against fellow Republican Ted Cruz in 2018. Former GOP congressman Tom Davis, who served on the House Oversight Committee during the first Clinton administration, warned lawmakers against overreach. \u201cThe news reports don\u2019t look good, but we\u2019re a long way\u201d from impeachment, he said. \u201cThere may absolutely be a place for this, I don\u2019t know, but when you jump the gun way ahead, you lose the credibility of your mission before you start. And that\u2019s my caution to both sides.\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a current member of the Oversight panel, called the impeachment talk \u201creprehensible, reckless and un-American\u201d and called it part of a two-decade GOP campaign to\u00a0undermine Democratic presidents. But he said the failure of the 1998 Bill Clinton impeachment and President Obama\u2019s current popularity shows that perpetual opposition isn\u2019t necessarily good politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a base, too, and for every action in politics there is a reaction,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cIf you want to fire up our base, keep on making statements like that.\u201d Other prominent Republicans stopped short this week of suggesting that impeachment should be in the offing. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called the talk \u201cpremature\u201d during an interview on a Texas radio station Tuesday. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been elected or sworn into office,\u201d he said, according to a CNN report on the interview. \u201cAnd unless there is some additional evidence that the FBI director and the Justice Department would take to a grand jury, then she is not likely to be convicted of a crime.\u201d Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), a former Judiciary Committee chairman who played a leading role in the 1998 Clinton impeachment, called talk of a Hillary Clinton impeachment \u201cspeculative\u201d in a Wisconsin radio interview Tuesday. But he said there would be a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d should she be indicted as president. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go through another Watergate,\u201d he said. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Overweight, tattooed, stoned? The Pentagon may still want you Pentagon W.J. Hennigan Contact Reporter The new U.S. military wants you --\u00a0even if you're overweight, covered in tats\u00a0and stoned on weed.\u00a0 The Pentagon is considering that recruiting pitch as it scrambles to keep up with America's changing social mores and strives to attract the tech-savvy talent it needs to fight future wars. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced a broad review of recruiting standards this week, saying he wants to ensure that rules are not \u201cunnecessarily restrictive\u201d on issues like fitness, tattoos, marijuana use and letting single parents enlist. \u201cWe're going to review and update these standards as appropriate,\u201d Carter said Tuesday in a speech to Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps cadets at the City College of New York. \u201cNow, some of these things we\u2019ll never be able to compromise on,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we will always have to maintain high standards. But at the same time, these benchmarks must be kept relevant for both today\u2019s force and tomorrow\u2019s, meaning we have to ensure they\u2019re not unnecessarily restrictive.\u201d The review reflects recognition, in part, that the all-volunteer military may rely less on ground infantry operations in the future\u00a0 and more on desk-bound analysts, robotics operators, software engineers and cyberwarriors. (John Spencer) It also reflects the fact that a growing number of states have legalized marijuana sales, even though the federal government has not, and that some branches of the military already have eased their tattoo bans. The recruitment review marks the latest step by the Obama administration to push the tradition-bound, male-dominated Pentagon onto a more modern footing. Over the last year, the Pentagon has opened combat positions to women, given gay and lesbian service members protection from discrimination\u00a0and lifted bans against transgender\u00a0men and women serving openly in the military. Some military leaders and outside critics say the Pentagon is moving too fast on these initiatives. And the next president is almost certain to pick a new secretary of Defense, so Carter\u2019s recruitment review may yet get sidelined. \u201cThe Pentagon is in a bind because there is a shrinking number of people that meet all their criteria, but there are certain standards that shouldn\u2019t be jettisoned just because we need recruits,\u201d said Phillip Carter, a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s a balance to be struck.\u201d For now, all the uniformed services are meeting their recruiting goals, and there is no plan to expand the current force, which totals 1,281,900 active-duty members and 801,200 in the reserves. But Secretary Carter wants more young people to consider joining who may\u00a0not meet current enlistment standards. The majority of those who now apply are rejected due to health, drug use and other problems. More Americans than ever before are overweight or obese, for example. Though no one suggests easing body-mass standards for active-duty soldiers, the Pentagon may allow portly, paunchy and potbellied recruits to enlist \u2014 and then whip them into shape in boot camp. \u201cSome of the fitness standards can be addressed in remedial fashion after recruiting,\u201d said Michael E. O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cI'm less happy about relaxing them definitively,\u00a0though there's a reasonable debate to be had even about that,\u201d he added. Under Pentagon rules, anyone who reports to a processing center\u00a0for boot camp and tests positive for illegal drug use is rejected. Some services go further, refusing to enlist anyone who admits to previous recreational drug use. That has created clear obstacles in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Washington, D.C., where recreational marijuana is now legal, and 20 other states that permit its medicinal use. (David Montero) California, Arizona, Nevada and six other states will consider ballot initiatives on Tuesday to legalize or decriminalize marijuana, potentially making pot legal in much of the country. Tattoos also are more common. Nearly half all Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s sport at least one tattoo, according to a poll conducted by Harris Interactive Inc. in February. Recruits are checked for tattoos at initial physicals, and each service has its own rules. Symbols such as swastikas or gang signs are explicitly forbidden. Face, neck and hand tattoos are largely barred as well. In April, the Navy announced it would allow sleeve-length\u00a0arm tattoos and, in some cases, tattoos on the hands and neck. Last year, the\u00a0Army\u00a0eliminated a rule that limited soldiers to four tattoos below the elbow or knee, each smaller than the wearer's extended hand. Easing tattoo restrictions will give recruiters more leeway to accept recruits for cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence and other fields that may attract hackers and others not traditionally drawn to military service.\u00a0 Carter has made a priority of trying to modernize the military. After taking office in 2015, he opened the Pentagon\u2019s first office in Silicon Valley to highlight his focus on finding cutting-edge military technology\u00a0and the people to develop and operate it. \u201cAs technology evolves, the military may need a different type of soldier for certain jobs,\u201d said Peter W. Singer, a fellow at the nonpartisan New America Foundation who studies the future of war. \u201cThe guy with a crew cut is not always the best for the job. Sometimes you need some weirdos on your team to get things done.\u201d The military likes to portray itself as a trailblazer on social issues, although the record is mixed. The armed forces were racially segregated until 1948, when\u00a0 President Truman signed an order requiring equality of treatment and opportunity in the military without regard to race. Discrimination persisted for decades afterward, however. Women were not allowed into the service academies until 1976 and were barred from flying on combat missions or serving on combat ships until the 1990s. The Pentagon ended its transgender ban in July after a one-year review. That was after the Departments of Justice and Education ordered schools that receive federal funding to ensure the civil rights of transgender students.

    "text": "Embed Embed Transcript For the first time in history, the financial markets seem to prefer the Democratic candidate for president over the Republican, and anything that lessens her chances of victory is likely to hurt asset prices, according to a paper written by Zitzewitz and Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. \"This election is going to be a very big deal economically. That's what we're finding,\" Zitzewitz said in an interview with NPR. The paper says a victory by Trump would have a much bigger impact on stock, energy and currency prices than previous elections. The Standard & Poor's 500 index, as well as British and Asian stock markets, would see a decline of 10 to 15 percent under Trump, the paper says. Oil prices would fall by $4 a barrel and the Mexican peso would lose 25 percent of its value, it says. Article continues after sponsorship The Stock Market Stumbles After Friday's Clinton Email News. Here's Why \"The market really cares. We have a 12 percent difference in the value of the S&P; under the two candidates. When we did this work on past elections we were getting results more like 2 percent. This election is very different in that regard. The economic stakes are quite high,\" Zitzewitz told NPR. As many market analysts have noted, Trump's tax policies and their impact on the deficit and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, as well as his attacks on trade, would make him an unknown commodity in the economy. \"I think that the market has sold off here because Donald Trump's prospects are improving,\" Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management said in an interview on CNBC this week. Economists Warn: Trump 'Promotes Magical Thinking And Conspiracy Theories' \"The market isn't saying, 'I like Hillary and I don't like Donald.' It's saying, 'I like certainty and I don't like uncertainty,' \" Doll said. Although Clinton is no favorite of Wall Street's, the markets at least have a sense of where she stands, Doll added. In their paper, Wolfers and Zitzewitz sought to quantify the market reaction to a Trump victory by looking at what happened during the first Clinton-Trump debate on Sept. 26 and correlating the results with data from the British betting exchange Betfair. As the evening wore on, Clinton appeared to be winning, and Betfair said her odds of winning rose. At the same time, stock futures and prices rose in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Asia and crude oil prices were also up, the paper says. Meanwhile the currencies of major U.S. trading partners such as Canada, Mexico and South Korea rose. How Did Trump's And Clinton's Economic Policy Speeches Compare? Nothing else was happening that evening that would explain the market reaction, the paper says. The markets also rose over the weekend of Oct. 7-9, after the release of the Access Hollywood video in which Trump bragged about touching women without their consent. The reverse happened last week after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress saying his agency had discovered new emails that might be related to Clinton. As CNBC noted , \"Bond yields have moved lower, and so have stocks, as the markets have begun to react to the possibility of a Trump victory in the last several days.\" NPR's Chris Arnold contributed to this report.

    "text": "'Self-recruited' Trump volunteers break mold for how campaigns are run By Tori Richards Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Alaska resident Mike Robbins putting up a sign in Anchorage, Alaska. \u00a0(Courtesy: Mike Robbins) Alaska can be an afterthought in presidential elections, a frigid electoral landscape that often sees the race decided before its polls even close. But this time, volunteers from the deep-red state with its three Electoral College votes started campaigning for Donald Trump long before the campaign kicked in staff members \u2013 and without the help of the state or national Republican Party. \u00a0 \u201cI woke up one day and said, \u2018I have to do something.\u2019 I was losing sleep over it,\u201d said Mike Robbins of Anchorage, who owns several radio stations. That was back in January. Robbins went on to hold fundraisers to buy shirts and signs, enlist hundreds of volunteers and wage a social media blitz on Trump\u2019s behalf. He became an alternate delegate for the national convention, blanketed Anchorage with Trump signs and bumper stickers and welcomed the campaign\u2019s Alaska director in August with a highly organized machine already in place. This scenario has played out in states across the country. Despite tensions between Republican leaders and Trump \u2013 and concerns that the GOP nominee\u2019s campaign lags Hillary Clinton\u2019s in raw organizational strength \u2013 one factor Trump has going for him is an army of volunteers who began boosting his ground game, in some cases, before the professionals got heavily involved. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 FoxNews.com talked to volunteers in five western states who were among\u00a0Trump\u2019s main source of on-the-ground support at a time when neither the Trump campaign nor the RNC had dedicated staff. This is in marked contrast to Clinton, who had early support from the Democratic National Committee and a huge volunteer network already in place due to highly organized state Democratic committees. \u200b\"We have 80 offices throughout the state that we activated last fall, all with volunteers ready to go,\" said Michael Soller, communications director for the California Democratic Committee. \u200b Five days before Election Day, Clinton still maintains the clear advantage in most assessments of the electoral map. A Democratic National Committee spokesman said field organizers are updating their robust voter file, an important election tool. \u201cWe don\u2019t take any vote for granted. We have a robust ground game focused on making sure all of our voters get to the polls, not just for Hillary Clinton but for Democrats up-and-down the ticket,\u201d the spokesman said.\u00a0 But voter enthusiasm is a factor \u2013 and the Trump campaign points to the energy of its supporters. \u00a0 \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019re running a grassroots movement,\u201d said Jessica Ditto, Trump\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cPeople are fired up about it. They feel like they are enlisted in the campaign.\u201d For the most part, Trump\u2019s campaign did not assign a paid staff member to organize volunteers in individual states until March or later. By then, many supporters were hosting their own fundraisers, call centers and speeches. \u201cWhen I was first hired in April and word got out, within 24 hours I had 1,000 emails -- how these folks found me and got to me, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tim Clark, California director of the Trump campaign. \u201cThe next day it was another 1,000 [emails] and it\u2019s been that way ever since. I\u2019m not recruiting volunteers because our volunteers are self-recruited.\u201d Clark says he was thankful to have a relatively easy job: pockets of Trump supporters already existed across the state, formed through Meetup and Facebook groups. He just stitched them together into a bigger statewide group. \u201cThey were already talking to each other online, putting up their own signs and training each other,\u201d he said. Across the West Over in southern Texas, Miriam Cepeda has been a one-woman Trump operation since March. Back then, everywhere she went people were supporting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump only really had a presence in Austin, Houston and Dallas. \u201cI appointed myself to take care of Rio Grande area,\u201d said Cepeda. \u201cNo one was speaking on behalf of his campaign or encouraging people [in south Texas]. I took the bull by the horns and ran with it.\u201d A 25-year-old graduate student, Cepeda crisscrossed cities across the Rio Grande Valley, marketing Trump until the campaign noticed her and made her an official part of its network.\u00a0 \u201cI posted signs, started a list of volunteers, sent out emails, located donors, started Facebook and Instagram pages,\u201d she said. In New Mexico, Cecilia DeBaca, 63, decided she wanted to support Trump when she heard him talk last year about the restrictions of political correctness. \u201cYou can\u2019t say Merry Christmas, can\u2019t sing Christmas carols,\u201d DeBaca said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything anymore.\u201d So she started talking to everyone she could about Trump \u2013 at Walmart, gas stations, grocery stores and the pharmacy. DeBaca also went to the Trump website and found out how to start making phone calls for the campaign. Then she contacted her local Republican Women chapter and led efforts to set up booths at public events to lead voter drives and engage bigger audiences. Undeterred that her state has been blue since President Obama took office, DeBaca said she has had almost a perfect record convincing strangers to vote Trump. She and her husband both became state and national delegates. Up the West Coast in the northern Seattle area, business strategy consultant Luis Valdes has \u201cput up signs, held fundraisers -- anything to help Mr. Trump.\u201d He started campaigning after the national convention. Back then, Valdes didn\u2019t see any Trump presence in the historically blue state. Valdes said he started going to festivals, events and job sites where he could talk to large groups of Hispanic voters. A refugee from Cuba, Valdes is now an American citizen and understands oppression. \u201cI explain, \u2018Don\u2019t try to make this country into the one you just left,\u2019\u201d Valdes said. Trump has been to Washington state three times, more than any other GOP candidate in recent history. While the state is still considered to favor Clinton heavily, Trump backers may have made some inroads. During a recent drive from Portland to Seattle, Trump signs dotted the freeway, Valdes recalled. \u201cRight now I\u2019m driving up I-5 and I just passed an overpass with about 15 people who were holding Trump Pence signs and waving flags,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong the whole way I only saw a few Hillary signs.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Fox News Electoral Scorecard: Key states tilting toward Trump after FBI's October surprise Published               November 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The FBI\u2019s October surprise appears to have improved Donald Trump\u2019s overall standing in the electoral map, with the latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard showing several states shifting in his favor since last week. The Fox News Decision Team announced updates to the scorecard Thursday afternoon, reflecting the following changes based on recent polling and other factors: New Hampshire moves from \u201clean Democrat\u201d to \u201ctoss-up\u201d Ohio moves from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Republican\u201d Indiana moves from \u201clean Republican\u201d to \u201csolid Republican\u201d Missouri moves from \u201clean Republican\u201d to \u201csolid Republican\u201d Despite the changes, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton maintains the clear advantage, and Trump\u2019s path to victory remains a tight one. But the latest ratings show Clinton\u2019s advantage diminishing. If Clinton were to win all the states leaning toward or solidly in the Democratic column, she\u2019d have 283 electoral votes \u2013 more than the 270 needed to win. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 If Trump were to win all the states leaning toward or solidly in the GOP column, he\u2019d be short at 192 electoral votes. But winning all the toss-up states would put him just 15 electoral votes shy of 270. One more win in North Carolina, Michigan or Pennsylvania could get him to victory. The updates and fresh polling comes in the wake of the FBI\u2019s decision Friday to revisit the Clinton email investigation after new messages were found on the laptop used by ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The Clinton campaign and its allies have downplayed the significance of the messages while questioning the FBI\u2019s announcement so close to Election Day. Trump, meanwhile, has seized on the news as well as other developments to press his case in the final stretch. Speaking Thursday in Jacksonville, Fla., he cited reporting by Fox News that an FBI investigation regarding the Clinton Foundation has become a \u201chigh priority.\u201d He also touted new polls in Ohio and elsewhere showing him ahead. Clinton and President Obama have, for their part, made an impassioned case to voters to not elect Trump. \u201cYou want a voice who\u2019s bragging about how being famous lets you get away with what would qualify as sexual assault, and calls women pigs, and dogs, and slobs?\u201d Obama warned voters Thursday in Miami. \u201cAnd when he pays attention to women, it\u2019s because he\u2019s grading them on a scale of one to ten. What kind of message are we sending if that\u2019s our voice?\u201d In the latest states to shift, Ohio is the most highly sought prize. Trump has been leading there for weeks and his recent national bounce moves the state back into his column.\u00a0Early ballot requests also suggest a Republican advantage. The Electoral Scorecard also recently moved Florida and Nevada from \u201clean Democrat\u201d into the \u201ctoss-up\u201d column as well, while North Carolina shifted from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Democrat.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Last Friday, when the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress about a renewed inquiry concerning Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, Mr. Trump seized on the chance to shift campaign\u2019s tenor and focus on the controversy over her handling of emails when she was secretary of state. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Times/CBS poll began hours after Mr. Comey\u2019s letter became public. Most voters who were contacted said they had heard about the development. More voters said they were aware of accusations that Mr. Trump had made unwanted sexual advances toward several women. Yet about six in 10 voters over all said the 11th-hour disclosures about each candidate would make no real difference in their votes. However, more people said the allegations about Mr. Trump were likely to negatively affect their votes than those who said the new email developments would discourage them from voting for Mrs. Clinton. Four in 10 likely voters said Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior toward women made them less likely to support him while fewer, one-third, said the newest development in the F.B.I. investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails had that effect. Also bolstering Mrs. Clinton, and the possibility of a third straight Democratic term in the White House, is President Obama\u2019s popularity. Fifty-two percent of registered voters approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing, an increase from earlier this year. While Mr. Obama\u2019s standing has increased, the campaign has taken a toll on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s image. Only 32 percent of voters say she is honest and trustworthy, and a quarter of Democrats and nearly six in 10 independents do not think she will be able to unite the country if she wins. \u201cThe campaign has gotten uglier and uglier,\u201d said Michael Pappas, a real estate broker in Knoxville, Tenn., who is a Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s been about mudslinging and attacking personalities instead of talking about issues, talking about how we can help our country move forward and succeed.\u201d Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

Hillary Clinton campaigns at Pitt Community College in Winterville, N.C. (Win McNamee / Getty Images) In the final days of the 2016 presidential race , Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign has a consistent theme: Donald Trump . There was a point at which Clinton \u2019s advisors had envisioned a more positive ending, but in the final days of a tight race, the Democratic nominee has backed away\u00a0from emphasizing\u00a0a sunny message of inclusiveness. Instead, she has dwelled repeatedly\u00a0on a vision of a dark future of America under her opponent.\u00a0 On Monday, the Democrats \u00a0launched their\u00a0version of Lyndon Johnson \u2019s \u201cDaisy\u201d ad from the 1964 campaign, an apocalyptic warning about the dire consequences of turning over America\u2019s nuclear arsenal to an untested and short-tempered leader \u2014 in this case Trump\u00a0instead of Barry Goldwater.

And Thursday, at a rally here, Clinton was introduced by\u00a0Mae Wiggins, whose application years ago\u00a0to rent an apartment at a development owned by the Trump family\u00a0was rejected \u2014 an incident that became\u00a0part of a racial discrimination case against Trump and his father. Trump, said Clinton,\u00a0has spent his entire campaign offering \"a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She cited the endorsement of Trump earlier this week\u00a0by the official newsletter of the Ku Klux Klan as proof those signals were\u00a0being heard\u00a0\"loudly and clearly.\" \"They said it's about preserving white identity, and they placed their faith and hope in him,\" she said, noting the endorsement was written under Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again.\u201d \"You have to ask,\" she added, \"do any of us have a place in Trump's America?\" David Lauter, Kyle Kim and Armand Emamdjomeh Trump, for his part, has displayed a\u00a0concerted effort in recent days to remain\u00a0disciplined, stick to his stump speech and not veer into the sort of perilous improvisations that often have sidetracked his campaign message. Speaking in a cavernous equestrian center in Jacksonville, Fla., he stayed with a script that combined promises of a muscular economic resurgence with an exaggerated recitation of controversies that have dogged Clinton. He alleged the FBI was \"investigating how Hillary Clinton put the office of secretary of State up for sale in a violation of federal law\" \u2014\u00a0an assertion that goes well beyond anything the bureau is known to be doing. And in an effort to appeal to voters' memories of scandals during President Bill Clinton's tenure, he lamented \"here we go again with Clinton \u2014 with the impeachment and the problems. She's likely to be under investigation for many, many years.\" By staying on message, Trump avoided overshadowing his wife, Melania , who made her first solo campaign speech since the Republican convention in July. The previous address drew unwanted attention after key passages turned out to be nearly identical to ones in a speech by Michelle Obama . In Thursday\u2019s speech, to a small rally in Berwyn, Pa., in the Philadelphia suburbs, Melania Trump said\u00a0she would devote her energy as first lady to reducing online bullying of children and promoting more civil discourse in American society. \u201cOur culture has become too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.\u201d Democrats were quick to say that her plea for civility clashed with her husband\u2019s campaign, which has been punctuated by insults directed at opponents and cries of \u201cLock her up\u201d aimed at Clinton.\u00a0 A similar dissonance came later in the speech as Trump, a Slovenian immigrant, recounted her personal story of success in America.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant, and let me tell you, no one values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me,\u201d she said. Her husband has argued for sharp new restrictions on legal immigration, a wall against illegal immigration and a ban on immigration from many majority-Muslim countries. He has also warned that many who enter the country will bring an added risk of crime and terrorism. Those positions are among the ones that Clinton has pointed to all week as she has\u00a0repeatedly called on supporters to imagine what America would look like under a President Trump. \u201cI would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else,\u201d she said at a rally earlier this week in Florida. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just talk about all the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is a consequential choice, so we\u2019ve got to talk about something that frankly is painful.\u201d The steely, if reluctant, focus on her rival\u2019s flaws rather than her strengths reflects difficult truths that have vexed Clinton throughout the race. She has had limited success in changing negative\u00a0voter perceptions of her, an effort that was complicated again last week by the FBI\u2019s eleventh-hour resuscitation of the email controversy that had dogged her over the summer. That difficulty, combined with Trump\u2019s unchallenged ability to dominate\u00a0public\u00a0attention, has caused\u00a0Clinton to accept as inevitable that her best path to victory involves keeping voters focused on her rival. Wednesday night in Arizona, a state where a surge of Latino voter registration has helped create an unexpectedly tight race,\u00a0Clinton warned that Trump\u2019s immigration policy would lead to him \u201cliterally sending law enforcement officers house to house, school to school, business to business\u201d to break up families. Her warnings included the possibility that Trump could appoint Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who has championed controversial immigration policies, as his secretary of Homeland Security \u201cto oversee the massive deportation force.\u201d \u201cSometimes, sometimes the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton aides deny that her focus on the negative has come in reaction to the FBI\u2019s announcement of the renewed scrutiny of her emails. And they insist that\u00a0Clinton will return to making a more affirmative case for her candidacy as election day grows closer. On Thursday they announced that the campaign\u2019s closing rally Monday night would feature not only Clinton, her husband and daughter, but President Obama and the first lady. At that rally, in Philadelphia, where she accepted the Democratic nomination in July, Clinton will outline how she intends to keep promoting the \u201cAmerican ideals of progress, inclusion, equality and strength that our founders enshrined in our Constitution,\u201d the campaign said. The campaign has long believed that Clinton thrives\u00a0when she can speak directly to the widest possible audience. Those opportunities, though, have been limited to the convention and the three prime-time debates. In the day-to-day media, she\u2019s more likely to get attention for attacks on Trump than for policy speeches or calls for more \u201clove and kindness\u201d in the national dialogue. Asked about the dark tone, the campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, noted that\u00a0voters were making up their minds, and\u00a0\u201cin the closing week we want to reestablish for voters what that choice is.\u201d \u201cThe fact is,\u201d she said, \u201cthe choice that Donald Trump represents is pretty dark.\u201d Memoli reported from Winterville and Bierman from Washington, D.C.

Play Donald Trump cautions himself: 'Stay on point, Donald' 3:05 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161103180227if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/799900739599\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Team Clinton breathes sigh of relief, but isn't in the clear yet For Democrats who've been biting their fingernails over the last few days, Wednesday was a good polling day. The Marquette Law poll, the gold standard in Wisconsin, showed Clinton ahead there by six points. A trio of Pennsylvania polls had her ahead by four to five points in the Keystone State. And she was narrowly ahead in Florida and North Carolina, though well within the margin of error. Add them up all, and it was a (slight) sigh of relief for the Clinton campaign, as our sister publication The Lid put it . But they aren't out of the woods. A Colorado poll last night showed a tied race, and Clinton needs both Colorado and Virginia in her column to win without Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio. (A word of caution on that Colorado poll, though: It has the Latino electorate at just 9% , when it was 14% in 2012 -- and will likely be higher than that this year.) And a New Hampshire poll out this morning shows Trump up one point in the Granite State, which is the first survey to show Trump ahead in New Hampshire since the summer . So are things looking better for Clinton with the Comey news no longer dominating headlines? Yes. You'd much rather be Clinton than Trump, especially in the race to 270 electoral votes. But she isn't in the clear just yet. Time for Democrats to start sweating winning back the Senate But if Democrats can breathe a (slight) sigh of relief about the presidential race, the same isn't true in the battle for the Senate. The same Marquette Law poll that showed Clinton ahead by six points had Democrat Russ Feingold up a single point over vulnerable incumbent Ron Johnson (R-WI). A month ago, the Democratic formula for winning control of the Senate was to assume Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana were locked down -- and then hope to win only a couple more out of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Missouri. But right now, instead of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana being 100% locked down, only one of them is: Illinois.

'Just \u2014 we've gotta be nice and cool, nice and cool. Right? Stay on point, Donald, stay on point.'\" By contrast, Clinton's message has been much more negative, which maybe isn't surprising for a campaign that just wants to turn the page from the Comey news. But a week ago, this wasn't the message the Clinton camp wanted to be making down the final stretch\u2026 Clinton on Arizona: \"We have a real chance to turn this state blue\" NBC's Monica Alba : \"Hillary Clinton told supporters in Arizona late Wednesday that the traditional Republican stronghold was 'in play for the first time in years' as she addressed her biggest crowd of the campaign to date. Speaking to a rally of 15,000 people in Tempe, she noted that Arizona has only backed a Democrat for president once since 1948 \u2014 and that was for Bill Clinton in 1996. 'We have a real chance to turn this state blue again,' she added.More: \"Clinton continued to push down-ballot Democrats, but also took a swipe at local Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 who has made a name for himself by targeting Latinos \u2014 and urged voters to support his opponent. 'I think it's time you had a new sheriff in town, don't you?' Clinton said, to loud cheers.\" First Read's downballot race of the day: VA-10 Incumbent Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock represents two affluent DC suburban counties, Fairfax and Loudon, where Donald Trump is trailing badly. If she loses, it'll be because she was dragged down by the top of the ticket in her race against Democrat LuAnn Bennett.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Americans who lived through the nightmares of both the Watergate and Lewinsky scandals recall vividly how every day seemed to produce new evidence of wrongdoing. The drip, drip of deceptions and lies finally overflowed into a cascading pool of criminality and disgust. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The first scandal culminated in Articles of Impeachment.\u00a0 The other an impeachment trial.\u00a0 Is America now hurtling toward the same political abyss? It looks like it. So, fasten your seat belts and brace for impact. Sources tell Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier that the FBI has uncovered an \u201cavalanche of evidence\u201d in the Clinton Foundation investigation. Agents are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case,\u201d calling it a \u201cvery high priority.\u201d Armed with newly discovered email evidence and additional documents revealed by WikiLeaks, these sources say that agents will likely try to get Huma Abedin and others to cooperate in an effort to bring criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. It is a stunning development. But that\u2019s how avalanches happen. Suddenly, you\u2019re buried before you know it. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 If this is true, and if Clinton is elected president in a few days but thereafter indicted, several scenarios could unfold.\u00a0 She could resign before or after inauguration, leaving President Tim Kaine sitting behind a desk in the Oval Office.\u00a0 President Obama could pardon her before he departs that same office.\u00a0 Clinton, as president, could try to invoke broad constitutional immunity from prosecution, delaying her criminal trial until after she leaves office.\u00a0 Or she could pardon herself. \u00a0 However, all of that may not matter much if a Republican House of Representatives moves to impeach her. Neither immunity nor pardons apply to the ultimate constitutional remedy of impeachment. Thus, Americans will again be forced to suffer through another impeachment horror show. But Hillary may not be able to beat the rap the way her husband did back in 1999 when he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 What began as an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents\u2026 has now morphed into suspicions of rampant corruption involving Clinton\u2019s charity. Specifically, that she used her position as Secretary of State to confer benefits to donors who lavished money on her foundation and personally enriched the Clintons. \u00a0And the case against her is accelerating. \u00a0 \u00a0 It was inevitable, I suppose, that her emails would intersect somehow with the incredible wealth amassed by the Clintons since they left the White House. There\u2019s always a paper trail. Or pesky emails. \u00a0\u00a0 Or, in the case of Richard Nixon, those damnable tapes.\u00a0 Two Investigations Merge Hillary Clinton used her unauthorized, private email server not only to conduct State Department business involving thousands of classified documents, but it appears she also used the server for some of her foundation\u2019s communications. The FBI has devoted more than a year to investigating whether the Clintons illegally leveraged their foundation for personal gain -- that is into tens of millions of dollars in potential self-dealing and so-called \u201cpay-to-play\u201d.\u00a0 As I pointed out in a previous column, all of this, if proved, could constitute bribery, fraud, and illegal use of a non-profit charity which smacks of racketeering.\u00a0 What\u2019s that? Operating a criminal enterprise.\u00a0 It is often associated with organized crime.\u00a0 (See \u201cmafia\u201d)\u00a0 There is also the related matter of perjury.\u00a0 And obstruction of justice.\u00a0 The same charges that were leveled against Bill Clinton back in the day. \u00a0 Importantly, the newly discovered Weiner/Abedin electronic devices appear to contain email evidence relevant to both the classified documents case and the Clinton Foundation case. In addition, sources confirm that laptops belonging to Clinton\u2019s top aides, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, are now in the possession of the FBI and are being \u201cexploited for more evidence.\u201d The floodgates are open.\u00a0 While the foundation probe is now center stage, a reinvigorated look at whether Clinton mishandled classified documents has obviously been resurrected. It is possible that FBI Director Comey could reconsider his opinion of Clinton\u2019s legal \u201cintent\u201d under the Espionage Act and reverse himself in his recommendation on prosecuting Clinton.\u00a0 Sources say there is a 99 percent chance that up to 5 foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed Clinton\u2019s emails and stolen them, putting a lie to President Obama\u2019s claim that Clinton did not jeopardize national security. \u00a0 The Clinton Foundation As \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace pointed out in the final debate, \u201cemails show that donors got special access\u201d\u00a0 to Clinton while Secretary of State. While that is surely unseemly or improper, it is illegal only if Clinton used her position to confer a benefit in exchange for money. That is, if donors rewarded Clinton with cash. \u00a0 \u00a0 So, here is an example of what might be illegal.\u00a0 It has been reported that Clinton helped UBS avoid the IRS. Bill then got paid $ 1.5 million dollars and their foundation received a ten-fold increase in donations by the bank.\u00a0 If the money was a reward for Clinton\u2019s work on behalf of UBS, then that could be considered bribery under federal law. And racketeering. \u00a0 Another example: it has been reported that Clinton\u2019s state department approved billions of dollars in arms sales to several nations whose governments gave money to the Clinton Foundation.\u00a0 Again, if it can be proven there was a quid-pro-quo, it would be illegal.\u00a0 This is where the WikiLeaks hacked emails come into play.\u00a0 Messages show that charity official Doug Band, while raising money for the foundation, also steered millions of dollars to Bill Clinton. The cash came from foundation donors who had business before Hillary\u2019s state department.\u00a0 Band\u2019s emails, in which he brags about his prowess in funneling up to $66 million to Bill, make explicit how the Clintons appear to have used their foundation for personal profit. Organized crime and Illegal syndicates tend to use legitimate-looking businesses as a \u201cfront\u201d to try to fool law enforcement.\u00a0 Often, they devise a \u201cdual purpose\u201d company -- one which operates lawfully from the front door, but unlawfully out the backdoor. There is little doubt that the Clinton Foundation operated as a charity. But if there was a secondary, hidden purpose devoted to self-dealing and personal enrichment, and if the foundation was merely a conduit, then prosecution could be pursued under federal anti-corruption statutes. Did DOJ Obstruct The FBI? It\u2019s beginning to look that way. Even after Comey announced in July that he would not recommend prosecuting Clinton, the investigation into her foundation was still being actively pursued by some agents within the FBI. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department became angry over this and agents were told to \u201cstand down.\u201d\u00a0 Whether that happened is disputed.\u00a0 However, it appears that FBI agents wanted to examine emails on non-government laptops that were part of the Clinton classified documents case. They felt there might be evidence that the foundation was being used illegally by the Clintons, as noted above. But Justice Department prosecutors allegedly stopped them from doing it. \u00a0 \u00a0 Why? Was Justice protecting Clinton? Can we be assured that the renewed investigation of Clinton won\u2019t be obstructed by an attorney general with allegiances to both Hillary and Bill Clinton? \u00a0\u00a0 Time For an Independent Counsel \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given these reports of DOJ\u2019s interference, there are serious and legitimate doubts about the integrity of the government\u2019s ability to investigation Clinton.\u00a0 Attorney General Loretta Lynch was compromised from the beginning. She was first elevated to the position of U.S. Attorney by Bill Clinton. She met privately with him just days before a decision was made as to whether his wife would be prosecuted. As if that were not enough, Lynch\u2019s boss, President Obama, defended Clinton publicly last April on \"Fox News Sunday\" by declaring, in essence, she did not break the law. He made the same argument during an earlier \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.\u00a0 He prejudged the outcome of the case. This sent a pretty clear message to those in charge of just how the president wanted the question of prosecution to turn out.\u00a0 Now, it appears that Lynch\u2019s Department is heeding that message by actively obstructing the FBI\u2019s investigation.\u00a0 The attorney general has failed or refused to appoint a Special Prosecutor to ensure that these investigations are fair and impartial. President Obama could demand one, as well. He likely will not. His conflict of interest is as glaring as Lynch\u2019s. After all, the president has been campaigning vigorously for Clinton to succeed him. Why would he now jeopardize the chance of preserving or even burnishing his legacy? Donald Trump is vowing, if elected, to unwind much of what Mr. Obama has accomplished. \u00a0 Therefore, it is up to Congress to reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act to accomplish the same. It would direct the attorney general to petition the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to appoint one. No choice.\u00a0 Sadly, this may be the only way the public\u2019s trust can be restored. Gregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney. Advertisement ",

The effort is being coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, but reaches across the government to include the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, current and former officials say. Russia has been warned that any effort to manipulate the actual voting or vote counting would be viewed as a serious breach, intelligence officials say. \"The Russians are in an offensive mode and [the U.S. is] working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels,\" said Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. Officials are alert for any attempts to create Election Day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. But what is more likely, multiple U.S. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from Russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. For example, officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it. So far, document dumps attributed to the Russians have damaged Democrats and favored Trump. \"The Russians are in an offensive mode and [the U.S. is] working on strategies to respond.\" The Russians \"want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process in ways they've done elsewhere,\" said a senior Obama administration official. \"So this is to make sure that we have all the tools at our disposal and that we're prepared to respond to whatever it is that they do.\" \"We need to be prepared on every front, not just technical but messaging, and so on,\" the official added, saying the details were classified. \"Because any reporting irregularity could be incredibly disruptive. \u2026 They can cause tremendous chaos, and by the time we are able to attribute, the damage may have already been done.\" Officials were reluctant to discuss how they might be respond to such \"influence operations,\" other than to say they will make efforts to counter misinformation and keep open communication nodes. The U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security assess that it would be extremely difficult for even a nation-state actor to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber-attack, a second senior administration official told NBC News.

(Video: The Washington Post/Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post) By Abby Phillip , Jenna Johnson and Sean Sullivan November 3 at 10:02 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @wpjenna Follow @WaPoSean WINTERVILLE, N.C. \u2014 With fewer than five days left before the election, the bitter fight for the presidency descended Thursday on North Carolina, a crucial battleground where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump attacked one another at competing campaign events. Clinton urged African American voters here to turn out, warning them that Trump\u2019s vision for his presidency would leave them behind. About 200 miles to the west, in Concord, Trump cast Clinton as a \u201ccandidate of yesterday\u201d and complained that he is held to a different standard than his Democratic rival. Hours later, the Democratic and Republican nominees held dueling events in Raleigh and Selma, respectively, throwing more jabs at one another. It all came on a whirlwind day on the campaign trail as a full slate of surrogates, including President Obama and Melania Trump, were dispatched to key swing states to make closing arguments for their candidates. Polls show a tightening contest, adding a sense of urgency to each campaign stop. Clinton told a crowd of about 1,800 on the grounds of Pitt Community College that Trump \u201chas spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\u201d She said he \u201cretweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories,\u201d and noted that Trump had been endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's wife, Melania, gave a speech in Berwyn, Pa., Nov. 3, in which she said as first lady, she would fight online bullying and press for the advancement of U.S. women. (The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s campaign has rejected the endorsement. Trump\u2019s son Eric said in a Thursday radio interview with KHOW in Denver that former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke \u201cdoes deserve a bullet,\u201d agreeing with an assertion his interviewer made. Clinton noted that Trump had been repeatedly accused of housing discrimination at his real estate properties and that he had continued to proclaim the guilt of five black and Hispanic men, the Central Park Five, on assault and rape accusations, even after DNA evidence exonerated them. \u201cDo any of us have a place in Trump\u2019s America?\u201d Clinton asked. At his Concord rally, Trump drew attention to the FBI\u2019s renewed inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email practices while she was secretary of state, when she used a private server. \u201cNow she\u2019s got bigger problems. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis that would cripple the operations of our government,\u201d Trump said. He did not present evidence for his claim. The GOP nominee also criticized now-interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile, after an email released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks indicated that she had provided debate questions in advance to the Clinton campaign. Trump said that if he had done something similar, he would have faced a bigger backlash. \u201cHeadlines: \u2018Trump to leave race,\u2019 \u201d he said, opining about what the media reaction would have been had that happened. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes will be among the biggest prizes Tuesday night, and Thursday\u2019s schedule reflected that. At one point in the afternoon, both Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s airplanes were at the Raleigh-Durham airport. After the state voted Republican for seven straight presidential elections, Obama turned the state blue in 2008. But it flipped back to Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, and the GOP further reasserted itself in the 2014 midterms. Clinton\u2019s appeal to black voters in North Carolina has become increasingly urgent as early voting results show turnout among African American voters in the state has fallen from 2008 levels. A combination of fewer early voting sites, lower enthusiasm for Clinton and legal disputes about voter registration records are to blame. But the Clinton campaign has pointed to higher black turnout in recent days, after the number of polling places in the state were dramatically increased, as a sign that the situation is improving. Trump continued his attack on Clinton at an outdoor rally in Selma, N.C., on Thursday night that attracted more than 15,000 people. Trump was joined on stage by decorated military veterans who support him. \u201cYou know, when I look at these brave admirals and these great generals and these great medal of honor recipients behind me, to think of her being their boss? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said. Trump reiterated his military-related campaign promises, telling the crowd that he would fully fund all branches of the military, push allies to pay more for U.S. protection and only resort to military force when it\u2019s vital to the safety of the country, among other things. Trump again criticized Clinton for using a private email server while secretary of state. As he spoke of Clinton, one man screamed: \u201cCommunist!\u201d And the crowd repeatedly chanted: \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d Clinton, meanwhile, held a joint rally Thursday night in Raleigh, N.C., with her former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and musician Pharrell. The mostly younger crowed of 5,200 at an outdoor concert venue screamed energetically as Sanders took the stage and delivered remarks that didn\u2019t stray very much from the stump speech that had become his staple in the Democratic primary. Sanders urged the crowd to vote for Clinton based on the issues \u2014 particularly economic fairness and access to health care. \u201cThis campaign is not a personality contest,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re not voting for high school president, we\u2019re voting for the most powerful leader in the entire world.\u201d Clinton promised that she and Sanders would work together to push shared priorities in January, including a plan they jointly drafted to make tuition free at public colleges and universities for families making less than $125,000 a year. \u201cThis election has been a lot more fun now that we\u2019re on the same side,\u201d Clinton said. She also argued that the best way to reject what she characterized as Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric would be to vote in record numbers. \u201cThe best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, Trump and Obama held dueling rallies in all-important Florida, with the president seeking to rally young voters for Clinton, and Trump trying to stoke concerns about Clinton\u2019s practices as secretary of state. Speaking at Florida International University in Miami, Obama called Trump \u201cuniquely unqualified\u201d and \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to be president. Later, in Jacksonville, Trump claimed that Clinton is under \u201ccriminal investigation\u201d for \u201cpay-for-play corruption\u201d by the FBI, though no such investigation has been announced. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, made her highest-profile appearance on the campaign trail since her speech at the Republican National Convention. She delivered a speech in a Philadelphia suburb, vowing to be \u201can advocate for women and children\u201d if she becomes first lady. In Berwyn, Pa., she talked about her journey from Slovenia to becoming a U.S. citizen. She praised her husband for being \u201cbeholden to no one,\u201d and told the crowd: \u201cHe certainly knows how to shake things up, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Melania Trump also voiced concerns about online bullying directed at children, saying that \u201ctechnology has changed our universe,\u201d but that \u201clike anything that is powerful, it can have a bad side.\u201d As a candidate for president, Trump has routinely used his Twitter account to attack and belittle critics, rivals and others with whom he takes issue. Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), delivered an entire campaign speech in Spanish on Thursday afternoon in Phoenix, where he stressed his belief in an inclusive politics that celebrates diversity. He criticized Trump\u2019s controversial rhetoric about immigrants, calling the GOP nominee a \u201cpayaso,\u201d or clown. Kaine later appeared at a rally in Tucson that also featured former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords. Giffords and her husband have become leading gun control advocates in the aftermath of an assassination attempt against her in 2011 that left her with a brain injury. The Clinton campaign announced Thursday that her final rally before Election Day will be Monday evening in Philadelphia. She will be joined by Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and Bill and Chelsea Clinton, the campaign said. Trump\u2019s campaign released a new TV ad that seeks to highlight the renewed scrutiny of Clinton\u2019s emails and tie her to disgraced former representative Anthony Weiner, whom the narrator of the commercial calls a \u201cpervert.\u201d Emails were found on a computer belonging to Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a 15-year-old girl, triggered the FBI to revisit Clinton\u2019s email practices. Weiner is separated from Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s long-time aide. The Trump campaign continued to argue it has its sights set on Democratic-leaning states in the final days of the race. In an interview on MSNBC, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the campaign is trying to make a push into Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin . But polls show Clinton leading in those states. \u201cI mean, look, if you try to apply conventional political wisdom to Donald Trump, you lose every time,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThe idea that, well, Michigan or Wisconsin have been elusive to Republican candidates. He\u2019s just different. His message on illegal immigration, trade and jobs and patriotism. . . . It\u2019s just a different messenger.\u201d Johnson reported from Concord, N.C., and Selma, N.C. Sullivan reported from Washington. Jose A. DelReal, Sari Horwitz and John Wagner in Washington contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

These emails, CBS News\u2019 Andres Triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on Secretary Clinton\u2019s private server. At this point, however, it remains to be seen whether these emails are significant to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton. It is also not known how many relevant emails there are. In a letter to Congress last Friday, FBI Director James Comey indicated that the agency was taking steps to review newly discovered emails relating to Clinton\u2019s private email server. Those emails came from the laptop of Weiner, a former New York congressman. Abedin reportedly said she had no knowledge of the existence of any of her emails on Weiner\u2019s laptop . On Monday, CBS News reported that the FBI had obtained a warrant for the emails. In a separate matter, CBS News confirmed that there were disagreements between FBI agents looking into the Clinton Foundation and their superiors in Washington and at the Department of Justice. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the FBI was facing an \u201cinternal feud\u201d over how to handle the Clinton Foundation case in the middle of election season. Officials say tension like this is common in many cases. It is still unclear whether the FBI inquiry into the Clinton Foundation was a full-blown investigation. The current status of that inquiry is also unclear. However, no known charges have been filed related to the foundation. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",
