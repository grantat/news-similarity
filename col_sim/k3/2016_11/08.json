    "text": "Robert Durst Pleads Not Guilty to Killing Susan Berman By Lesley Messer Nov 7, 2016, 5:10 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Robert Durst Says He's Not Guilty of Killing Susan Berman 0 Shares Robert Durst appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom today on a murder charge. In a wheelchair and wearing a neck-brace, Durst told the judge that he's not guilty. \"I do want to say here and now, I am not guilty,\" he said. \"I did not kill Susan Berman.\" His next court date was set for Feb. 15. Prosecutors said they will not be seeking the death penalty in the case. The real estate heir, 73, is charged with first-degree murder for allegedly killing Berman in Los Angeles almost 16 years ago. He also faces charges of gun use and lying in wait. Durst's attorney Dick DeGuerin said last year that his client is not guilty of the crimes. \"Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman -- he\u2019s ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial,\" DeGuerin said. Durst was the subject of the 2015 HBO documentary \"The Jinx,\" which focused on the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, the death of his neighbor Morris Black, and Berman's murder. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder in 2003 and was never charged in connection with his wife's disappearance, for which he says he had no involvement. According to investigators, Berman had been scheduled to meet with authorities about Kathleen's disappearance when she was found dead at her Los Angeles home from a gunshot to the head. Durst was arrested just before the finale of \"The Jinx\" aired in March 2015. In that episode, Durst, seemingly unaware that his microphone was on, was heard whispering to himself, \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" Durst has been serving time in a federal prison in Indiana since September, stemming from a plea deal he took regarding a weapons charge in New Orleans, according to The Associated Press. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years and one month behind bars. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final, frenzied hours of the presidential campaign, offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of must-win states. Accompanied by rock stars, ex-presidents, old friends and their grown children, the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of their visions for the country. Mrs. Clinton, whom polls show leading Mr. Trump, gave a sunny and optimistic summation of her candidacy for the White House as she embarked on a four-state tour on Monday. \u201cTomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,\u201d she told a crowd in Pittsburgh. \u201cOur core values are being tested in this election.\u201d Photo Hillary Clinton campaigned at the University of Pittsburgh as part of a four-state trip on Monday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Mr. Trump, who was campaigning in five states on Monday, took a darker approach, assailing the \u201ccrooked media,\u201d attacking a \u201ccorrupt Washington establishment\u201d and mocking Mrs. Clinton over and over. \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged, rigged system,\u201d he declared in Raleigh, N.C. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the campaign wound down, both candidates dispensed with ritual. Mrs. Clinton, who relishes upbraiding her opponent, abandoned her usual assault on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and temperament. And Mr. Trump, who normally seeks to convey confidence at all times, sounded uncharacteristically vulnerable . \u201cThey say we\u2019ll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose,\u201d he said during a rally in Sarasota, Fla. \u201cI said: \u2018No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want any credit if we lose.\u2019\u201d Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there were signs that Americans were seizing the opportunity to express themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high , and in interviews, many voters said they were eager to bring an end to this unusual, exhausting and still suspenseful election. Photo Donald J. Trump arrived for a rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Monday. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m totally ready for this election to be over,\u201d said Mary Hoch, 54, who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Sarasota with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on her head and a \u201cDeplorable Lives Matter\u201d pin on her shirt. Ms. Hoch predicted a Trump victory. \u201cI think there are a lot of silent Trump voters,\u201d she said. Daniel Saunders, 58, who attended a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Charlotte, N.C., was just as exasperated by the race. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by it,\u201d he said. But Mr. Saunders said he was convinced that Mrs. Clinton would eke out a win. \u201cI think it will be close, but I think she will pull it out,\u201d he said. Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton sent their running mates, families and allies across the country to maximize their reach in crucial swing states. Mr. Trump relied on his three oldest children \u2014 Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u2014 along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Mrs. Clinton deployed President Obama and former President Bill Clinton, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the first lady, Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular political figure in the country. ",

Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016.</p> Close AP Photo/Richard Shiro WOODRUFF, S.C. -- The South Carolina man who confessed to a 2003 quadruple murder after authorities found a woman chained on his property will represent himself in court. Sheriff Chuck Wright told the Spartanburg Herald-Journal that Todd Kohlhepp is choosing not to hire an attorney. Investigators looking for more bodies on alleged S.C. killer's property Kohlhepp became a suspect in at least seven deaths after 30-year-old Kala Brown was found Thursday chained by her neck and ankle in a metal storage container on his 95-acre property near rural Woodruff. CBS affiliate WSPA-TV reports that authorities granted three requests before Kohlhepp confessed to the 13-year-old slayings at a Chesnee motorcycle shop. Wright says he let Kohlhepp talk to his mother. Wright delivered a photo to Kohlhepp\u2019s mom. And he transferred money to a girl Kohlhepp says he\u2019s helping raise, to help pay for college. Kohlhepp is charged with kidnapping Brown, as well as four 2003 killings known as the \u201cSuperbike murders.\u201d He has confessed to the notorious quadruple slaying at a motorcycle shop in the small town of Chesnee, investigators said. He was denied bond Sunday during a brief court appearance on four murder charges for those slayings. A body found Friday on the property has been identified as the boyfriend of the woman found a day earlier. Kohlhepp has shown officers where he says two more people are buried. Human remains were found in one gravesite Sunday and the search for more possible remains continues. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Chip Somodevilla, Mark Wilson (2)/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla, Mark Wilson (2)/Getty Images Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire (from left), Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. Chip Somodevilla, Mark Wilson (2)/Getty Images Republicans are feeling the best they have this cycle about their chances of holding their majority in the U.S. Senate, but doing that would require several states to break their way on election night. That's a risky place to be one day before control of the Senate is decided. The tightening of the presidential race over the past week may have had an impact on these Senate contests. Most of the contests remain firm toss-ups, though Democrats still have multiple paths to winning back the five seats they need (or just four if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the presidency). Illinois is all but assured of being in the Democrats' column, but it is the only seemingly sure thing. Former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold's lead in Wisconsin has shrunk in the closing days, and both parties are spending anew. Republicans, though, privately say they would be shocked if it broke their way. Article continues after sponsorship A Week From Election Day, Democrats Have Many Paths To A Senate Majority The next two most likely to flip, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, depend so much on the presidential race. Both are tight, but Democrats might have the edge because of a superior turnout operation. Weak GOP incumbents in Missouri and North Carolina continue to give Democrats an ever-so-slight edge, but in Missouri especially, the conservative lean of the state is certainly helping Republicans. North Carolina will also likely track closely to the presidential results in the battleground state. Perhaps the biggest shift over the past week has been in Indiana. Former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh hasn't had a cakewalk since he jumped into the race in July. His advantage here is gone, while Republicans are increasingly optimistic. And it's another state that's likely Republican in the presidential race. Nevada, the lone GOP offensive opportunity, has sunk on the list of most likely to flip control, with early voting in the state signaling heavy Democratic and Hispanic turnout. Still, if Democrats do take back control of the Senate, it will be by a much slimmer margin than they had hoped for weeks earlier. And if it's a one-seat majority, get ready for another fight in a year if Clinton does become president. That's because Vice President Tim Kaine's Senate seat in Virginia will come open in 2017, and it would become the focus of a very competitive special election. Even if Republicans lose the majority, they would have every incentive to delay and not go along with major legislation. Why? The 2018 Senate map is a minefield for Democrats. Expect some late calls across the board. And at least one race, possibly two, may go into overtime. The open Louisiana race won't be decided until a Dec. 10 runoff, because Tuesday is actually the all-party primary. And if Georgia GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson falls below 50 percent, he'll be forced into a Jan. 10 runoff. Both, however, won't decide the Senate, as they should stay in Republican hands. Here's our final ranking of the vulnerable Senate races, from most to least likely to change party hands: 1. Illinois (R-Mark Kirk) Previous rank: 1 'Your Parents Came All The Way From Thailand': Senator Wrongly Hits Rival On Heritage This one was baked a long time ago, and Kirk's downward spiral in the closing weeks certainly didn't help. No suspense here \u2014 Democrats start out at least a net one for the night with Rep. Tammy Duckworth poised to become the state's next senator. 2. Wisconsin (R-Ron Johnson) Previous rank: 2 It would be a pleasant surprise for Republicans if Johnson did hang on here in his rematch with former Democratic Rep. Russ Feingold. Final polling in the state showed this one was neck-and-neck, and spending from both sides has proven that. But Democrats view the last-minute investments as an insurance policy \u2014 you don't want to look back and regret not having done what it takes. If Johnson does pull what would be an upset here, it's going to be a very long night for Democrats. 3. Pennsylvania (R-Pat Toomey) Previous rank: 3 Clinton is favored in the Keystone State, but the margin may decide whether she takes Democratic nominee Katie McGinty with her. Toomey has pulled out all the final stops at the end, and his closing ad even quoted President Obama praising him for his work on gun-control legislation. But that tactic drew a sharp statement from the White House. Of the toss-up states, though, Democrats feel best about this one while Republicans don't. 4. New Hampshire (R-Kelly Ayotte) Previous rank: 6 The Granite State is tight across the board, but when you factor in Democrats' get-out-the-vote operation, and the fact that late deciders typically break their way here, it might be good news for Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Still, this one could go either way. 5. Missouri (R-Roy Blunt) Previous rank: 4 This race had to be a perfect storm for Democrats to even have a chance, and that has happened. Blunt is viewed as the ultimate insider, and he hasn't taken his challenge from Secretary of State Jason Kander seriously enough. Kander, a war veteran, was an early, solid recruit. Still, the Republican lean of the state is showing up in polls. If Blunt is able to win, it will be Trump who carries him across the finish line \u2014 the opposite of most of the other races on here. 6. North Carolina (R-Richard Burr) Previous rank: 7 Burr has been another underwhelming incumbent, but former state Rep. Deborah Ross has taken plenty of hits from Republicans over her tenure as head of the state's ACLU. Burr has also had some foot-in-the-mouth moments that are adding to the GOP's headache here. As the presidential race goes, so likely goes this Tar Heel State contest. 7. Indiana (Open, R-Dan Coats is retiring) Previous rank: 5 In Indiana's Senate Race, Political Royalty Tries To Put On A Fresh Face No candidate has seen his stock fall as far and as fast as former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh did this year. His late entry into the race this summer was heralded as a major shake-up, and it was, forcing Republicans to worry about this seat. But his double-digit lead has evaporated, thanks to questions about his residency, lobbyist ties and his final months in office back in 2010. Now, the momentum is all with GOP Rep. Todd Young, who has a slight edge in the final polls. Republicans are increasingly bullish, and with good reason. Trump's prospects have improved in the Hoosier State as well, which should help Young. 8. Nevada (Open, D-Harry Reid) Previous rank: 8 Hispanic Voters Key In Deciding Nevada's Tight Senate Race This is the only Democratic-held seat on this list. Republicans liked the trajectory of this race for months, but the state's Democratic tilt seems to have won out. An uptick in Hispanic turnout in the early vote, fueled by antipathy for Trump, isn't helping GOP Rep. Joe Heck, who has seesawed back and forth on his party's controversial presidential nominee. This state is hard to poll, but it almost always underestimates Democrats, particularly Latinos. Some Republicans point out that Sen. Dean Heller was able to win here in 2012 even as Obama carried the state, but his opponent, then-Rep. Shelley Berkley, was a poor candidate who was under a House ethics probe. 9. Florida (R-Marco Rubio) Previous rank: 9 There may be some Wednesday morning quarterbacking going on if Rubio is able to beat Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy by just a few points. But caution: Results may appear closer than they actually are. Some Democrats have begun finger pointing, saying they are missing a chance to take out a possible 2020 presidential candidate. But Democratic money was likely better spent putting multiple cheaper races into play. This is an incredibly expensive state, and the minute Rubio decided not to retire, he was going to be incredibly hard for Democrats to knock off. Not ranked: Arizona or Ohio Yes, we're stopping our rankings with just nine, because those are the only truly competitive races to watch on election night. Clinton playing in Arizona had given Democrats renewed hope they could knock off Sen. John McCain there, but there's no data to back that up. And Ohio Sen. Rob Portman likely sealed his ticket back to the Senate a long time ago, running maybe the best race of the cycle and putting away his opponent early. ",

With polls showing him trailing, Trump is frantically trying to pave the way for an upset win with stops in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Michigan. \"This is the last day of our campaign. Who would have believed this? Who would have believed it? It's been some campaign too,\" Trump said during a morning rally in Sarasota, Florida. Clinton will hit both of Pennsylvania's largest cities \u2014 Pittsburgh and Philadelphia \u2014 along with stops in Michigan and a midnight get out the vote rally at North Carolina State University with Lady Gaga. Her running mate, Tim Kaine, will barnstorm North Carolina and Virginia. \"Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger in our country. But I've gotta say, anger is not a plan, my friends,\" Clinton said during her rally in Pittsburgh. The highlight of her schedule will be an evening rally on Independence Mall in Philadelphia featuring President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, President Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and musicians Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. She also will air a two-minute television ad that will air on NBC and CBS on Monday evening.

Trump has continued to focus much of his message on his opponent and her email controversy. \"Look at what she's done with the emails, as an example. I mean, did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course, the FBI, the director, was obviously under tremendous pressure,\" Trump said during his North Carolina rally. The final NBC News battleground map shows the Democratic nominee with a comfortable lead over Trump, netting 274 electoral votes. Trump garners 170 with 94 votes in the toss up column. And the former secretary of state got more good news on Sunday, when FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to lawmakers saying a review of newly discovered emails had not changed the FBI's previous conclusion that Clinton is not guilty of criminal wrongdoing. But the closing days of the campaign have been filled with surprises in how both candidates have spent their time and resources. The final national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of the 2016 presidential race shows a tightening race with Clinton hanging on to a four-point lead. She had an 11-point edge in the poll last month following the release of a 2005 tape where Trump talks about groping women. Clinton's Allendale, Michigan event Monday will mark the second time in recent days she has visited the Great Lakes State that was once thought to be solidly in her corner. But polling in the state has shown Clinton's lead shrinking. Trump also continues to push in Michigan with a joint rally with Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence in Grand Rapids. On Sunday, he made a surprising stop in Minnesota, where polling shows Clinton with a sizable lead. Play ",

    "text": "A Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s investigative report says Kohlhepp \u201cconfessed to investigators that he shot and killed\u201d the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop. \u201cKohlhepp gave details ... that only the killer would know,\u201d the report says. Authorities say Kohlhepp is a suspect in at least three other deaths. Sheriff Wright says Kohlhepp also showed law enforcement officers Saturday where he says he buried two other victims on his 95-acre property near Woodruff. Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, was at the site for less than an hour. The sheriff would not say whether more bodies were found in the graves Kohlhepp led them to, but he did say they would be excavated, reports CBS Spartanburg affiliate WSPA-TV . Those alleged grave sites are in addition to the body found Friday at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver , the boyfriend of the woman found Thursday. Carver and the woman went missing around Aug. 31. Their last known cellphone signals led authorities to the property. The Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted. Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds. An anthropologist is helping determine how long Carver was buried, Clevenger said. He declined to say how many times Carver had been shot. The sheriff says it\u2019s possible more bodies will be uncovered. The wife of one of the 2003 victims said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the shop several times. Melissa Ponder told The Associated Press she was resigned that her husband Scott\u2019s death would never be solved before getting a phone call Saturday evening from one of the case\u2019s original detectives. Detectives told family members of all four victims of the confession at the same time. \u201cHe knew too much about the crime scene,\u201d Ponder said of Kohlhepp\u2019s account to detectives. \u201cHe knew everything.\u201d The Superbike killings stunned the Chesnee community, with rumors like they were committed by a Mexican drug gang or were part of a love triangle crushing the families of the victims. Melissa Ponder is glad the rumors weren\u2019t true. \u201cIt isn\u2019t closure, but it is an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am thankful for that.\u201d Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. Fifteen years after he was released from prison for that crime, Spartanburg County deputies were brought to his property by the last known cellphone signals of two missing people. On Thursday, they found Brown chained in a container for two months. She told investigators that Kohlhepp shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her.\u00a0 His prison stint didn\u2019t stop Kohlhepp from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm. Wright said \u201cit\u2019s strange\u201d that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long. Scott Waldrop, who\u2019s lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \u201cprepper\u201d who liked his privacy, but \u201che didn\u2019t seem like a threat.\u201d Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \u201cI was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hate to know somebody who\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private but liked to brag about how much money he made day trading online. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Clinton\u2019s devices were not certified as secure by the State Department.\u00a0As for her use of a non-secure BlackBerry, Whitnah stressed that email can be intercepted and, \u201cEven if turned off, it\u2019s still a listening device so that\u2019s why you take out the batteries.\u201d As Clinton was sworn in as secretary in January 2009, government contractor Amel Smith said he was also working at the department and: \"State Department rules are clear. I helped write those rules.\" Smith says his 30 years of experience includes serving in the U.S. Army's 82nd\u00a0Airborne, before becoming a counter-intelligence and counter-espionage investigator at State tracking down breaches of classified materials. He reviewed some of the FBI witness interviews from the Clinton email investigation with Fox News, and questioned those who claimed not to have the proper training in handling sensitive information. \"I hear things like, well, I forgot, um, I don't know that I was trained, I don't know this. You know -- every single person that had access to that information when it was sent is in violation,\" Smith emphasized. The FBI witness interviews also show secure facilities for classified information -- known as SCIFs -- were specially built for Clinton in her in Washington, D.C., and Chappaqua, N.Y., homes.\u00a0Doors that were supposed to be locked were left open. \"If you've got an uncleared person in there, it's automatically a compromise,\"\u00a0Smith said. Another FBI interview summary said there were personally owned desktop computers in the secure facilities at Clinton's homes, yet she told the FBI that she did not have a computer of any kind in these facilities. \"If somebody said they're there, then they probably were there, and you know, the reason you would deny it was because you probably didn't have approval,\"\u00a0Smith said. Having unapproved computers in a SCIF would automatically call for a security investigation. Asked for his reaction to Clinton's claim that nothing she sent or received was marked classified, Whitnah called that assertion a \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d\u00a0 Fox News was first to report in June that at least one of the emails contained a classified information portion marking for \"c\" which is confidential. FBI Director James Comey later said in July when he recommended against criminal charges that a handful of Clinton emails contained classified markings. But more than 2,100 emails with classified information,\u00a0and at least 22 at the \u201ctop secret\u201d level, passed through Clinton's unsecured private server.\u00a0Asked how it happened, Smith said, \"Personally, there had to have been somebody moving classified information from C-LAN, C-LAN again is Secret, Confidential only, and JWICS. JWICS is where all top secret information is.\" After new emails were found in the Anthony Weiner sexting case belonging to his estranged wife Clinton aide Huma Abedin, the FBI reopened the Clinton email investigation.\u00a0On Sunday, Comey said the emails did not change his recommendation against criminal charges because his investigators did not find intent to move classified materials outside secure government channels \"Whether it's the private email server, whether it's this private laptop. If there's classified -- one document on there -- that's classified, it's a violation. Somebody violated [the] law,\"\u00a0Smith said. \"Throw all the politics out the window, what we're talking about is the defense of this nation.\" Asked about Smith and Whitnah, who filed a complaint against the State Department, a department spokesman said they were not direct hires -- adding that the head of diplomatic security told the FBI that Clinton was \"very responsive to security issues.\"\u00a0 Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C. She covers intelligence, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security. Herridge joined FNC in 1996 as a London-based correspondent. Pamela K. Browne is Senior Executive Producer at the FOX News Channel (FNC) and is Director of Long-Form Series and Specials.  Her journalism has been recognized with several awards.

But if partisan trench warfare is inevitable, few people have more experience in the muck than Clinton. Related: Hillary Clinton's Victory Prize: Congressional Investigations \"There's nothing that she's going to confront that she hasn't faced before from Congress,\" said Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. \"So that should put her in a pretty good place to handle recalcitrant Republicans.\" With the avenue for action largely obstructed in Congress, Clinton has already signaled that she's prepared to cut Congress loose and redirect energies to the executive branch and the judiciary, where should would have the opportunity to change the balance of the Supreme Court. It took years for Obama to come to the conclusion that he needed to work around the GOP, while Clinton could skip that learning curve. So she's set goals in line with what she could control, like making the government look more like America, with a Cabinet that is half-female. But she would need a Democratic Senate to confirm her nominees for both. Progress where possible Clinton's legislative agenda has been kept in line with that reality. While her website lists dozens of policies \"from Alzheimer's to Zika,\" as top policy adviser Jake Sullivan likes to say, she's promised to target only three major policy goals in her first 100 days. In order of feasibility, they are: push for a jobs and infrastructure bill, introduce a comprehensive immigration reform and push for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United campaign finance court ruling, which is largely symbolic. Related: NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll: 2016 'An Election About Fear' The infrastructure package, likely paid for with some modest tax reform, is at the top of Clinton's priority list because it is widely seen in both parties as one of the few issues on which Republicans might be willing to work with a President Clinton. \"In the approach that she takes to Republicans and in the issues that she prioritizes, she's not going to do anything to fritter away an opportunity to find consensus,\" said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton. \"She intends to make the infrastructure jobs package the test of people's willingness to get something done.\" Progressives are already pushing for the package to go beyond bridges and roads and the hard-hat jobs (read: male) they create, to include more human infrastructure like health and child care jobs (read: female). \"Our traditional notions of infrastructure are very gendered,\" said Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a liberal think tank. Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employee International Union, said: \"Service and care workers all over this country expect the next president to announce the most ambitious jobs program since World War II.\" Competing priorities There's a limited window for action in any new administration and especially one in which there would be little, if any, congressional willingness and bandwidth for legislating. So Clinton would have to triage competing interests of key interest groups in the Democratic coalition. First and foremost would be Latinos, who feel frustrated by a lack of action on immigration in Congress and empowered to make demands by a surge in their turnout this year. \"We need to make sure that the fact that our community will be seen as essential in turning this election is considered and the issues that we care about will be given a heightened sense of priority,\" said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. Given the divisive nature of the immigration debate, Murguia and others are hoping to reframe the issue around immigration's economic benefits, so it could coupled with or sequenced behind an infrastructure plan as part of major economic push. Related: Trump and Clinton Sprint to Election Day Finish Line \"There needs to be real serious run at legislation \u2014 an assertive, affirmative effort to address this in Congress,\" Murguia added. \"We just need to make sure it is not seen as a side issue or a special-interest issue but as an issue that is integral to strengthening the U.S economy.\" Bipartisan cooperation on immigration reform seems doubtful after the Republican Party nominated Trump, but Democrats are hoping a Trump loss would lead the GOP on another soul-searching process that allows moderates in the party to reassert themselves, especially on this issue. \"Trump has damaged the Republican brand with Hispanic voters to the point perhaps where it's beyond repair unless there is fast action among Republicans to be seen as reasonable and constructive on issues important to that community,\" Fallon said.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP U.S.-backed fighters rest during fighting with the Islamic State group near Ein Issa, north of Raqqa, Syria, as shown in a video by Qasioun, a Syrian opposition media outlet. AP U.S.-backed troops are making slow progress in their offensive aimed at retaking the Syrian city of Raqqa, the so-called capital of the Islamic State. This comes as Iraqi forces, assisted by the U.S., report gains in their mission to capture Mosul, the most important ISIS stronghold in that country. The Syrian Defense Forces \u2014 a coalition led by Kurds that also includes Arab and Turkmen fighters \u2014 are trying to isolate Raqqa before attempting to take control of it. The SDF announced the start of the offensive on Sunday. It's backed by U.S.-led air support and military advisers. > \"As in Mosul, the fight will not be easy and there is hard work ahead, but it is necessary to end the fiction of ISIL's caliphate and disrupt the group's ability to carry out terror attacks against the United States, our allies and our partners,\" U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement . Iraqi security forces launched their offensive on Mosul in mid-October and have steadily gained ground. Last week, forces entered the eastern neighborhoods of the city. As the fighting continues, concern is growing about widespread reports that ISIS is using civilians as human shields and carrying out executions. Article continues after sponsorship After Iraqi troops cleared ISIS fighters from the strategically located village of Hamam al-Alil south of Mosul, they discovered a mass grave with about 100 decapitated bodies, according to a Ministry of Defense statement. It wasn't immediately clear who the people were and when they died. Raqqa fell under ISIS control in 2014 and is seen as the group's most important stronghold in Syria. ISIS is likely to launch a fierce defense of the city, as Abdelaziz Alhamza of the citizen-journalism collective \"Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently\" tells Morning Edition . \"And [ISIS] losing Raqqa, it means like defeating the Islamic State,\" he added. While the coalition troops are reportedly making gains, the composition of the ground force has raised questions. The SDF's most powerful component is the Kurdish YPG, a key U.S. ally against the Islamic State in Syria that neighboring Turkey views as a terrorist group. Turkish concerns have complicated planning for the offensive, according to Reuters, because the country \"does not want to see any further expansion of Kurdish influence in northern Syria.\" \"The Kurdish participation is problematic,\" as the BBC's Mark Lowen reports , because \"Kurdish fighters are accused of expelling Arabs from areas they've taken in the north and Raqqa has an overwhelming Arab majority.\" The U.S.-led coalition said in a statement that Arab troops involved in the operation are \"indigenous to the area and will help establish regional support for SDF operations.\" Monday saw heavy fighting in the countryside north of Raqqa, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that the SDF fighters faced suicide attacks as the two sides exchanged fire. North of Mosul, Iraqi commanders tell NPR's Alice Fordham that they are making gains in the village of Bashiqa. As Alice reports, intense fighting continues in the city's eastern neighborhoods, and \"an eyewitness inside says ISIS is preventing people from leaving, and mosques are broadcasting calls for people to join the fighting.\" ",

By Jenna Johnson November 7 at 6:00 AM Follow @wpjenna Donald Trump greets supporters before speaking at the state fair in Oklahoma City on Sept. 25, 2015. (J. Pat Carter/Associated Press) On Sept. 25 last year, several thousand people gathered on a Friday night around a bandshell at the Great State Fair of Oklahoma for what felt like a rock concert. The opening acts included a live bald eagle named Uncle Sam, a young singer who belted out pop covers and a fiddler. The audience included an Elvis impersonator, a bearded member of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d family and a group of young Democrats from a nearby college who couldn\u2019t stop themselves from dancing along with the crowd. And then there was the featured act: Donald Trump. For 50 minutes, the unlikely Republican presidential candidate ordered journalists to pan the sprawling crowd with their cameras, mocked 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, imitated political pundits, bragged about his poll numbers, plugged an upcoming \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview and promised that he would make the country wealthy again. He vowed to self-fund his campaign, bully U.S. companies that try to move to Mexico, let Russia handle the Islamic State terrorist group and get rid of birthright citizenship for \u201canchor babies.\u201d The audience pulsed with laughter, cheers and chants of his name. Why were they there? Political pundits had said for months that it was just for the show, while Trump insisted that he had sparked a political movement. He was right. Standing toward the back that night was Charlie Bevers, a retired social studies teacher in his 60s from Moore, Okla., who said he was increasingly frustrated by what he viewed as the federal government having little respect for the U.S. Constitution. \u201cAt first, when he said he was going to run, I thought it was a joke. When he got out there and did his \u2018Trumpisms,\u2019 I listened because I thought it was funny,\u201d Bevers said that night. \u201cThen I realized he was saying what I want to hear.\u201d Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump spoke about his personal wealth, China, Secretary of State John F. Kerry's bike accident and more in his announcement that he would be running for president. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) It was a sentiment that I would hear again and again over the next year, as I followed Trump to more than 170 rallies in 35 states and talked with thousands of his supporters. The first question I usually asked: Why do you like him? The answers were nearly always the same: He\u2019s saying what I\u2019m saying, thinking, feeling or wanting to hear. He\u2019s not a politician and not part of a corrupt system. He\u2019s honest and speaks his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. And he\u2019s tough. [ \u2018Finally. Someone who thinks like me.\u2019 ] Plus, Trump told his supporters that it was okay to blame their financial problems on undocumented immigrants and the Chinese, that it was okay to be fearful of Muslims and those who don\u2019t speak English, that it was okay to punch back at Black Lives Matter activists, that it was okay to hate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In those early days, Trump had no Secret Service protection and nothing to lose. He took kids on rides in his helicopter in Iowa and stopped by a high school homecoming. There were no fundraisers, no sprawling staff, no teleprompters, no one telling him no. He held rallies in struggling former industrial towns with low median incomes and high rates of anger \u2014 and thousands showed up. The rally in Oklahoma foreshadowed what would come. There was the crowd \u2014 loud and adoring, no matter what Trump said or did or what might be revealed about his past. There was the palpable outrage, the sharing of conspiracy theories, the mob mentality. \u201cPick up your pitchfork!\u201d a local politician shouted, firing up the crowd before Trump arrived. \u201cFollow our next commander in chief! Join the Trump brigade and take back America once and for all!\u201d And there was the candidate, basking in the glow. \u201cNo matter where I go, we have these incredible crowds,\u201d Trump said that night. \u201cSomething is happening that is amazing. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d Trump gestures to the cameras while greeting supporters at a campaign rally in Worcester, Mass., on Nov. 18, 2015. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Nov. 18, 2015: Worcester, Mass. On a Wednesday night in mid-November, more than 12,000 Trump supporters and a small group of protesters gathered at an arena in downtown Worcester, a city with many more registered Democrats than Republicans. [ Nine things that happened during Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Worcester ] Generations ago, waves of immigrants moved here to work in textile factories, many of which closed decades ago. The town has tried to reinvent itself as a biotech and health-care hub. Although less than 70\u00a0percent of Worcester is white, it seemed like nearly 100\u00a0percent of Trump\u2019s crowd that night was. Earlier that month, Trump received Secret Service protection, a sign of just how far he and his movement had come. Photos of the packed arena in a blue town in a blue state would stun those who were convinced that at any moment, Trump would implode and drop out, allowing them to resume the traditional process of selecting a nominee. Sitting close to the stage were Tom and Sandy Morrissey, who drove in from Rhode Island and spoke longingly of the days when the nation was, in their eyes, a better place. \u201cWhen I grew up in Miami, it was English-speaking and now 75\u00a0percent of the households are non-English-speaking,\u201d said Tom Morrissey, a Vietnam War veteran in his late 60s wearing a red Trump \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. \u201cAnd people say they like to go to Miami because they like to go down there for the Cuban music. Well, I love Cuban music \u2014 I like to go to Cuba for Cuban music.\u201d \u201cI want my home town back,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd you can call me a racist or whatever.\u201d The Morrisseys said they once tried to buy a get-well card in a Miami convenience store but there were no options in English. Another time they went into a bakery and, they said, the woman working there refused to sell them pastries unless they ordered in Spanish. \u201cThey would not serve us,\u201d Sandy Morrissey said. \u201cThat\u2019s how bold people have gotten because they can be bold. That\u2019s the only reason why.\u201d \u201cSo if you want that to happen to this whole nation,\u201d Tom Morrissey said, \u201cyou go ahead and vote for Hillary.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know the truth,\u201d Sandy Morrissey added later. \u201cI don\u2019t think people care \u2014 and I think God has withheld his judgment on America. We are in deep trouble. This is not the America I knew as a child. It just isn\u2019t. And I feel bad about that.\u201d On the stage that night, Trump marveled at the crowd. \u201cLook at the people pouring in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been a movement. No matter where I go \u2014 and I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s for me. It\u2019s for me, I guess, a little bit. It\u2019s for the message.\u201d Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has found a groove for his campaign rallies \u2014 poll numbers, protesters, Vladi\u00admir Putin, and of course, making America great again. Here we break down a rally on Dec 21 into the required parts. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) Dec. 21, 2015: Grand Rapids, Mich. A few days before Christmas, Trump traveled to an aging arena in Grand Rapids on a cold, dark, rainy night. As traffic backed up, some parked near the railroad tracks. Generations ago, the city was known for its furniture factories that have mostly closed, although the economy here has been rapidly growing the past few years. The rally felt like a Christmas party. The stage was decorated with huge wreaths and a red \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d sign written in elegant script. \u201cSanta Claus is Coming to Town\u201d blared. Many in the crowd said they couldn\u2019t wait for the country to again say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d under President Trump. Sitting near the top of the bleachers was Kevin Steinke, a self-employed consultant in his 50s from a nearby suburb. He and his wife, a part-time music teacher, have two teenage sons, and they feel as though they are financially stuck in place, maybe falling behind. It had become difficult for Steinke to find clients, and he thought about once again working for a company instead of for himself \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to get hired over 50, he said. Sitting with his sons, he said the country needs a chief executive more than a \u201cpolitician in chief\u201d \u2014 someone who can cut government bloat without destroying the government, who can ease taxes without destroying schools, who can get rid of regulations without wiping them all out. \u201cPeople are getting frustrated by the fact that we don\u2019t seem like we\u2019re getting anywhere as a nation,\u201d Steinke said. \u201cA lot of us feel like we\u2019re going backward.\u201d Steinke has always been a Republican and has always voted for Republicans, and he doesn\u2019t understand why the GOP continues to allow the Affordable Care Act to stand. He\u2019s glad the party received a much-needed jolt from an outsider. \u201cIt\u2019s causing some of the establishment people to panic,\u201d he said, \u201cand I kind of like that.\u201d On stage that night, the Republican front-runner triumphantly declared: \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a silent majority anymore, folks. This is a very, very aggressive, very, very noisy, loud majority. Very, very noisy. Very, very loud.\u201d Trump acknowledges photographers after speaking at a campaign rally in Baton Rouge on Feb. 11. (Gerald Herbert/Associated Press) Feb. 11, 2016: Baton Rouge Ten days after losing the Iowa caucuses and two days after winning the New Hampshire primary \u2014 his first ballot victory \u2014 Trump traveled to an arena in Louisiana\u2019s capital that pulsated with gleeful energy matching his new burst of momentum. [ The target on Trump grows larger ] The South was home to Trump\u2019s biggest and rowdiest crowds, and a pre-rally speaker noted that the candidate didn\u2019t have a \u201cSouthern nickname,\u201d dubbing him \u201cDonny John.\u201d Sitting near the stage were Matthew Stirling and Darrin Hahn, brothers-in-law who live just outside town and hustle for every dollar they make. Stirling kept apologizing for Hahn\u2019s bad language. Stirling, then 40, said he installs security fences and had seen a huge spike in business because so many people \u201cfeel pretty damn unsafe.\u201d Hahn, then 45, is a commercial electrician. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go drum it up,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go drum up work, then I\u2019ve got 11 guys who don\u2019t work the next day, so I constantly have to go, literally, business to business.\u201d And that\u2019s why they like Trump. He hustles, just like them. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular guy,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cHe eats Wendy\u2019s on his plane.\u201d \u201cBut he owns a plane!\u201d I responded. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump documented the changes he made to his 757 jet in a 2011 video on his YouTube channel. (Donald Trump/YouTube) I was endlessly surprised that people said they related to Trump \u2014 who grew up wealthy, attended boarding school, received a $1\u00a0million loan from his father as a young man and who lives in a gold and marble tower in Manhattan with his third wife, a former model. He is a germaphobe who doesn\u2019t like shaking hands and will drink soda only from a sealed can or bottle. Backstage at a rally in New Hampshire in January, I asked Trump to tell me about one interaction he had with a supporter that stuck with him \u2014 and he called his campaign manager over to answer the question. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Hahn said, shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019s actually out there and hustled it and built it.\u201d Said Stirling: \u201cHe can come over to my house, and I will boil him crawfish. He can land his plane in the cul-de-sac. I mean, if he wants to go hang out with all of those VIP donors, that\u2019s fine. But come hang out with a real hard-working American man. I\u2019ll buy his beer, I\u2019ll buy him Wendy\u2019s, I\u2019ll boil his crawfish. Don\u2019t matter.\u201d Trump waves to the crowd as he arrives at a rally at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington on Aug. 9. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) Aug. 9, 2016: Wilmington, N.C. It was early August on the North Carolina coast, and it was miserably hot. Hundreds of people were lined up outside a small coli\u00adseum at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. [ From Trump\u2019s controversial words, a pattern: Outrage, headlines and then denial ] In June, after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump attacked a federal judge assigned to one of his civil cases, saying he was unable to be impartial because his parents were born in Mexico. In July, after becoming the nominee, Trump attacked the Muslim American parents of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq, saying they had no right to question him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention. In the spring, Trump had appeared poised to topple Clinton. Now, it seemed as though the race was over. Instead of focusing on the messages that resonated with Americans, he was obsessed with defending himself. Yet his most avid supporters were still standing with him, still waiting hours to see him. I was there with them, fanning myself with a reporter\u2019s notebook and sweating off my sunscreen. In June, Trump banned The Washington Post from covering his events, although reporters could attend most of his rallies by entering with the general public. For three months, I attended his gatherings like his fans did \u2014 signing up for a free ticket online, arriving to venues hours early and waiting in line. That gave me a direct look at the chronic disorganization of Trump\u2019s campaign. He had sparked a movement, but his campaign seemed to be doing little to harness it. The lines were often long, sometimes stretching more than half a mile. Food and water were rarely available, and neither were separate entrances for the elderly or the disabled. Occasionally, local Republican organizers would sign people up to vote and recruit volunteers, but the campaign never did. At many political rallies \u2014 including those of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Clinton\u2019s Democratic primary challenger \u2014 campaign staff members count off the line and let supporters at a certain point know that there is no chance they will get inside. This never happened as I waited. Those around me assumed that if they had a ticket, they would get in. Either the campaign was too disorganized to grant this kindness to its most devoted supporters \u2014 or, as I came to suspect, they cared more about creating a spectacle for reporters to document and for Trump to point to as proof of his broad support. In a rare move ahead of the Wilmington rally, the campaign limited the number of tickets to 5,800 \u2014 although no one was checking tickets at the door. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d a retiree said when she heard the news from those around her, tears welling up in her eyes. (She was one of the last people admitted.) Frustration grew as the start time neared. As the Trump supporters waited, protesters on the other side of the street behind a barricade screamed at them. A young woman yelled out Bible verses while holding a pink sign that read, \u201cJesus was a socialist.\u201d A guy in a banana costume quietly held a sign reading, \u201cThis s--- is bananas.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters were hot and tired, and now they were being attacked. Many yelled back. \u201cYour food stamps are in the mail!\u201d \u201cDeport Obama!\u201d Soon the venue was filled and workers closed the doors. There were disappointed groans, but I couldn\u2019t find anyone who blamed Trump. After all, they said, it\u2019s not his fault that he\u2019s so popular. People hung around for a few minutes, not sure what to do. Some went back to their cars. Others made an angry beeline for the protesters. Inside, Trump bragged about the \u201cthousands of people outside that can\u2019t get in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the messenger,\u201d Trump said, trying to make this movement about more than just him, \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you what, the message is the right message.\u201d Supporters packed the Pier Park Amphitheater in Panama City Beach, Fla., for Trump\u2019s Oct. 11 rally. (Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images) Oct. 11, 2016: Panama City Beach, Fla. In early October, Trump traveled to the Florida Panhandle, one of his hotbeds of support. More than 8,000 showed up at an outdoor rally on the water, a much-needed confidence boost for Trump. He had just apologized for recorded comments revealed by The Washington Post of him bragging in 2005 about sexually assaulting women, and faced accusations from a growing number of women that he had forced himself on them. Leaders of the party were distancing themselves, resigned to a loss of the White House but hoping to keep as many seats as possible in Congress. [ For Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, this election is about him, not the GOP ] \u201cPaul Ryan\u2019s an idiot,\u201d said Marla Clark, 52, a legal assistant at a private law firm who lives in Panama City, referring to the House speaker. \u201cThey need to get rid of the parties. Everybody needs to be independent because when the Republican Party doesn\u2019t stand by their own people, then they don\u2019t need to have a party. The parties are nothing but a problem. That was great in my parents\u2019 generation, but in this generation?\u201d She was also mad at Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for not standing more firmly with Trump when controversy hit. (\u201cDoes an officer leave his canine behind? No.\u201d) She was mad at those offended by Trump\u2019s crude comments. (\u201cThey\u2019ve never spewed anything nasty out of their mouth?\u201d) She was mad at Clinton, the \u201crigged system\u201d and the media. (\u201cThey\u2019re desperate.\u201d) And she was even a little mad at Trump. \u201cI was worried that he gets angry too fast,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried that he doesn\u2019t think about what he says. And there have been many times where I\u2019m like: I want him for president but his mouth does tend to just get out of line once in a while.\u201d She wants Trump to win, and she was still hopeful he could \u2014 as long as people realized how bad things have gotten and how much worse they could still get. \u201cI\u2019m truly scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just scared for the world. I\u2019m scared for the United States. I really am.\u201d Trump at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Oct. 31. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) Oct. 31, 2016: Grand Rapids, Mich. Eight days before the election, Trump returned to the aging arena in Grand Rapids. It was Halloween morning, and his campaign decorated the stage with pumpkins, buckets of crimson mums and bales of hay. \u201cMonster Mash\u201d and other Halloween songs blared. The audience included Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, Lady Liberty and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in an orange jumpsuit. Sitting near the top of the bleachers for that afternoon rally was Robert Donley, 74, who retired from IBM in 1999, drove a commercial truck for five years, and now splits his time between Michigan and Arizona. For most of his life he was a Democrat, but he said he began voting for Republicans after President Bill Clinton was caught lying about having an affair with a young intern. He likes that Trump wants to go after companies that exploit workers or move jobs overseas. He agrees with Trump on cracking down on illegal immigration but is conflicted on the nominee proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country, although he doesn\u2019t have a better idea. He likes that Trump doesn\u2019t dwell too much on social issues such as same-sex marriage. But he doubts that Trump will win. Instead of hammering on the messages that resonate with voters like him \u2014 job creation, trade, taxes and the economy \u2014 Trump obsessed over his own personal feuds. Donley was stunned when Trump attacked the Hispanic judge, calling it \u201clow-class, lowbrow.\u201d But Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server was once again in the news, and Trump seemed to have one last opening. \u201cIt opens a window, but the problem with Donald \u2014 I mean, he can turn a good thing into a defeat really fast with his mouth,\u201d Donley said. On the stage that day, Trump insisted that he would win. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a movement. This is like a great movement that the whole world is talking about,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd honestly you\u2019ll never have this chance; in four years, I don\u2019t care who it is that runs, you\u2019re never gonna have this chance. So you have to get out and vote. Vote with all of your heart, vote with all of your soul, because this is it.\u201d 1 of 55 ",

    "text": "Decision day for Illinois voters on president, Senate and beyond Duckworth, Kirk Stacey Wescott, Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Rep. Tammy Duckworth, left, and Sen. Mark Kirk make campaign appearances on Nov. 7, 2016. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, left, and Sen. Mark Kirk make campaign appearances on Nov. 7, 2016. (Stacey Wescott, Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy An ever-more-polarized electorate goes to the polls Tuesday to decide races from the White House to the county courthouse in one of the most contentious and expensive elections in Illinois history. Polls open statewide at 6 a.m. and close at 7 p.m., though voters in line at closing time are still eligible to vote, election officials said. A chance of morning rain is in the forecast. Voters throughout Illinois will pick a successor to hometown two-term Democratic President Barack Obama , choose a U.S. senator and weigh in on a special election for comptroller. In many parts of the state, voters also will decide Illinois House and Senate contests that have amassed record spending by forces allied with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic Speaker Michael Madigan . Congressional, judiciary and county races also are on the ballot. Before voters even get to those choices, though, they'll be asked if they want to change the Illinois Constitution with an amendment that aims to prevent transportation-related funding from being used for nontransportation purposes. Once they wade through that lengthy question, voters will get to the marquee contest \u2014 the race for president featuring Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , who was born in Chicago and raised in Park Ridge, against New York real estate mogul and former reality TV star Donald Trump , the GOP nominee. The winner here gets Illinois' 20 electoral votes, with 270 securing the presidency. Donald Trump hammered Hillary Clinton in the final hours before Election Day as corrupt and urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box,\" while Clinton pivoted away from the email controversy that has dogged her campaign and suggested Monday that early voter turnout was breaking her way. ... ... (Sean Sullivan, Anne Gearan, Matea Gold) As has been the case in most recent presidential elections, Illinois largely has served as flyover territory, owing to the state's tradition of heavily favoring the Democrat. Illinois last went Republican in 1988, voting for Republican George H.W. Bush against Democrat Michael Dukakis. As a result, the presidential contest in Illinois has served more as a point for questions about voter intensity and turnout, particularly in the first presidential race without Obama on the ticket in eight years, and whether the battle for the White House will have any down-ballot effects. Monday was the last day for early voting, and at times lines of people wrapped around the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners' special voting center in the Loop. On the eve of Election Day, more than 1.6 million people statewide had voted early or by mail as the number of registered voters crossed the 8 million mark, the State Board of Elections said. Early voting records were expected as the chance to cast a ballot ahead of time was expanded to more than a month after running 13 days in 2012. Election officials said they weren't sure if it was a sign of large turnout or just a substitution from normal Election Day voting. Voters also can register on Election Day. Rather than serving as a contested battleground state, Illinois has served as a significant source of cash to federal candidates, including those running for president. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated Illinois donations to federal candidates and national political parties at more than $125 million during the two-year 2016 election cycle. The group ranked Illinois fourth nationally in contributions to Democrats at more than $66.8 million and seventh to Republicans, with more than $58.4 million \u2014 not including money given to super political action committees. But big money, especially from outside groups, failed to materialize in the U.S. Senate campaign between Republican Sen. Mark Kirk , of Highland Park, who is seeking a second term, and Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth , a two-term congresswoman from Hoffman Estates. The contest is central to Democratic efforts to retake the Senate from Republicans. With a Clinton victory, Democrats need to take four seats currently held by the GOP, five if Trump wins the White House. Heading into the Senate contest, Kirk faced difficult headwinds due to Illinois' Democratic presidential-year propensity. Duckworth also raised more money than Kirk for more than a year, and major Republican-backed national super PACs and independent spending groups shied away. Mark Kirk Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Sen. Mark Kirk greets supporters as he makes a campaign stop at the New Trier Republican headquarters Nov. 7, 2016, in Winnetka. Sen. Mark Kirk greets supporters as he makes a campaign stop at the New Trier Republican headquarters Nov. 7, 2016, in Winnetka. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) On Monday, Kirk stopped by a Republican campaign office in Winnetka, where he spoke to about two dozen campaign workers and supporters. He predicted an \"upset win\" on Tuesday as he lamented the difficulties of running as a Republican statewide. \"When you're a Republican in Illinois, everybody discounts you,\" said Kirk, who noted that his own campaign polling showed him trailing Duckworth. \"People usually are surprised by a Kirk win that comes on a Tuesday election day.\" It wasn't long ago that a Republican won statewide office here \u2014 Rauner did it in 2014. But aside from publicly supporting Kirk's candidacy, the Republican governor and de facto leader of the Illinois GOP hasn't figured much in Kirk's campaign, which has centered on a pledge to restore fiscal order to the federal government. Since Rauner took office, state government has been embroiled in a political stalemate between the governor and Democrats who control the General Assembly \u2014 and the dysfunction has helped to drive the state far deeper into the red. \"It's probably my strategy, that I have not sought to borrow every single problem from Springfield,\" Kirk said when asked why he hadn't tapped Rauner for help on the campaign trail. \"My job is to take care of problems in Washington, D.C. I am up to the minute on Washington, D.C. ... let Bruce run the state, because I think \u2014 I very much support the governor.\" Tammy duckworth Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune Tammy Duckworth, 8th District Congresswoman and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, greets well-wishers Nov. 7, 2016, outside her campaign office in Arlington Heights. Tammy Duckworth, 8th District Congresswoman and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, greets well-wishers Nov. 7, 2016, outside her campaign office in Arlington Heights. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Duckworth made an election eve stop at a Democratic campaign office in Arlington Heights, where she and fellow candidates spent a few minutes dialing for votes. \"I'm pushing hard every single minute, every single hour, all the way through the election day,\" Duckworth said. \"I learned in the Army never to give up on the mission before it's accomplished, and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can.\" Flanked by U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky , of Evanston, and Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza , who is running against Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger, Duckworth thanked campaign workers for knocking on doors \"not just for me but for everyone on the ticket.\" \"I can't wait to get to work and get past tomorrow,\" Duckworth said. The Rauner-Madigan battle will play out in General Assembly contests. All 118 House seats and 40 of 59 Senate seats are up, though more than 60 percent have candidates running unopposed and additional contests feature only token opposition. ",

Compare your picks with ours. (Los Angeles Times) We've updated our electoral map for the final time in this topsy-turvy campaign year.\u00a0 For this version, our goal was no toss-ups. We're giving you our best estimates, based on public polling, state vote histories and the reporting done by our campaign staff, on which way we think each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia will fall this year.\u00a0 The previous version of the map had five toss-up states. In the end, we're predicting that three of them -- North Carolina, Ohio and Arizona -- will go for Hillary Clinton. Iowa will go to Donald Trump , we expect. So will Utah, where independent\u00a0candidate Evan McMullin\u00a0has been threatening Trump, but seems likely to come up short.\u00a0 Our projection would give Clinton 352 electoral votes, while Trump would end up with 186. That would put Clinton's electoral majority midway between President Obama's 2008 win and his 2012 reelection. Of these last picks, Ohio and Arizona were the hardest. Polls have been close in both states. Ohio does currently seem like a jump ball, but we lean toward Clinton winning there\u00a0because of the strength of her get-out-the-vote operation. In Arizona, we're expecting that the surge in Latino votes that has been visible next door in Nevada will put Clinton over the top. Polls that show Trump winning may be underestimating the size of the Latino turnout. That's what we think, anyway. But the map allows you to test out your own hunches. Have at it. Latest updates ",

Brown\u2019s boyfriend Charlie Carver, with whom she had vanished from Anderson in late August, was also found dead on the property, bringing the total number of bodies uncovered on the sprawling 100-acre lot to three. Investigators say Kohlhepp also confessed to the shooting deaths of four people in a\u00a0 notorious 2003 case in Chesnee known as the \u201cSuperbike murders.\u201d In total, he is a suspect in seven deaths. Clevenger did not release details on the state of the two bodies found Sunday and Monday, including their gender or whether they were decomposed, pending an examination. Both of the bodies were removed from the lot Monday and are now off-site, he said. New details on woman held captive for months \u201cI can\u2019t state how long they have been deceased or how long they have been buried,\u201d Clevenger said. Lt. Kevin Bobo, a spokesman for the Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s office, said the majority of the property has been searched and authorities don\u2019t believe they will uncover any more remains. He said there would be a \u201cscaled-down\u201d \u00a0law enforcement presence at the site Tuesday to re-check the grounds. \u201cRight now we feel like we have found all the bodies that are here,\u201d Bobo said.

Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final, frenzied hours of the presidential campaign, offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of must-win states. Accompanied by rock stars, ex-presidents, old friends and their grown children, the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of their visions for the country. Mrs. Clinton, whom polls show leading Mr. Trump, gave a sunny and optimistic summation of her candidacy for the White House as she embarked on a four-state tour on Monday. \u201cTomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,\u201d she told a crowd in Pittsburgh. \u201cOur core values are being tested in this election.\u201d Photo Hillary Clinton campaigned at the University of Pittsburgh as part of a four-state trip on Monday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Mr. Trump, who was campaigning in five states on Monday, took a darker approach, assailing the \u201ccrooked media,\u201d attacking a \u201ccorrupt Washington establishment\u201d and mocking Mrs. Clinton over and over. \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged, rigged system,\u201d he declared in Raleigh, N.C. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the campaign wound down, both candidates dispensed with ritual. Mrs. Clinton, who relishes upbraiding her opponent, abandoned her usual assault on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and temperament. And Mr. Trump, who normally seeks to convey confidence at all times, sounded uncharacteristically vulnerable . \u201cThey say we\u2019ll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose,\u201d he said during a rally in Sarasota, Fla. \u201cI said: \u2018No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want any credit if we lose.\u2019\u201d Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there were signs that Americans were seizing the opportunity to express themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high , and in interviews, many voters said they were eager to bring an end to this unusual, exhausting and still suspenseful election. Photo Donald J. Trump arrived for a rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Monday. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m totally ready for this election to be over,\u201d said Mary Hoch, 54, who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Sarasota with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on her head and a \u201cDeplorable Lives Matter\u201d pin on her shirt. Ms. Hoch predicted a Trump victory. \u201cI think there are a lot of silent Trump voters,\u201d she said. Daniel Saunders, 58, who attended a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Charlotte, N.C., was just as exasperated by the race. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by it,\u201d he said. But Mr. Saunders said he was convinced that Mrs. Clinton would eke out a win. \u201cI think it will be close, but I think she will pull it out,\u201d he said. Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton sent their running mates, families and allies across the country to maximize their reach in crucial swing states. Mr. Trump relied on his three oldest children \u2014 Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u2014 along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Mrs. Clinton deployed President Obama and former President Bill Clinton, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the first lady, Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular political figure in the country. ",

The Sunday before the 2016 presidential election saw NBA superstar LeBron James campaign with Clinton in Cleveland. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Straining toward the finish line of the wildly unpredictable White House race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump blitzed through battleground states Monday in a final bid to energize supporters. Clinton urged voters to embrace a \"hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America,\" while Trump called for support to \"beat the corrupt system.\" The candidates planned to campaign late into the night, a frenzied end to a bitter election year that has laid bare the nation's deep economic and cultural divides. Clinton opened the day Monday buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. The inquiry had sapped a surging Clinton momentum at a crucial moment in the race, though she still heads into Election Day with multiple paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the nation's first female president. \"I think I have some work to do to bring the country together,\" she acknowledged as she boarded her plane for her last battleground tour. \"I really do want to be the president for everybody.\" As Clinton took the stage in Pittsburgh, supporters yelled out, \"We love you\" \u2014 an unusual occurrence for the Democratic presidential candidate who has sometimes struggled to connect with voters. \"I love you all, too. Absolutely,\" Clinton said with a slight chuckle. Trump was aggressive to the end, repeatedly slamming Clinton at his first event of the day in Sarasota, Florida. Having made the new FBI review a centerpiece of his closing case to voters, he argued that Clinton was being protected by a \"totally rigged system.\" \"You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice,\" Trump said. \"Do not let this opportunity slip away.\" Images of the presidential campaign's final days as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump make their final push. The comments were a reminder that Comey's news, delivered in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, was a doubled-edged sword for Clinton. While it vindicated her claims that the emails would not yield new evidence, it ensured that a controversy that has dogged her campaign from the start would follow her through Election Day. Across the country, nearly 24 million early ballots were cast under the shadow of Comey's initial announcement of a new email review. That number represents more than half of the roughly 42.5 million people who had cast votes by Monday afternoon, according to Associated Press data. The inquiry involved material found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide. Comey said Sunday the FBI reviewed communications \"to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state.\" Clinton tried to fly above the controversy Monday and was not expected to address the matter during stops in Michigan and North Carolina. She was also headlining an evening rally in Philadelphia with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, along with rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. Full coverage: 2016 election Open link Nearing the end of his two terms in the White House, Obama was nostalgic as he launched his own busy day of events, noting that he was probably making his last campaign swing for the foreseeable future. \"Whatever credibility I have earned after eight years as president, I am asking you to trust me on this. I am voting for Hillary Clinton,\" Obama said. Clinton is banking in part on high turnout \u2014 particularly among Obama's young, diverse coalition of voters \u2014 to carry her over the finish line Tuesday. Roughly half the states with advance voting have reported record turnout, including Florida and Nevada, which have booming Hispanic populations, a possible good sign for Clinton. In Florida alone, Hispanic participation is up by more than 453,000 votes, nearly doubling the 2012 level. Black turnout is up compared to 2012, but that share of the total vote is lower due to bigger jumps among Latinos and whites, according to University of Florida professor Daniel Smith In Nevada, where more than three-fourths of expected ballots have been cast, Democrats also lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie downplayed the impact of increased Hispanic participation, telling reporters on a conference call, \"We feel that we're going to get a good share of those votes.\" However, he sidestepped two questions about the level of Hispanic vote Trump needs to win the presidency. Without victories in Florida and Nevada, Trump's path to 270 electoral votes would be exceedingly narrow. He already must win nearly all of the roughly dozen battleground states. Trump planned to campaign at a breakneck pace through Election Day. Following the rally in Florida, he headed to North Carolina and then was off to Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. After voting in New York Tuesday morning, After that, Trump was to return to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire. Midway through his travels Monday, Trump praised his supporters for having created a \"movement.\" But he warned it would all slip away if he loses Tuesday. \"Go vote,\" he urged. \"Or honestly, we've all wasted our time.\"\u00a0 Associated Press ",

By comparison, a\u00a0Times review of campaign finance reports and daily campaign disclosures found total contributions to the 17 ballot measure campaigns are roughly twice what Republican candidate Donald Trump has reported raising\u00a0for his presidential campaign. The Times review includes cash donations to campaigns, as well as non-monetary donations like staff time\u00a0and even loans that are expected to be repaid. The total is on pace to break the previous record from 2008, when ballot measures generated\u00a0$471 million in contributions, according to\u00a0data since 2003 compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. Ballot measure campaigns: $1\u00a0million a day On average, more than $1.5\u00a0million has been raised every day this year to influence the outcome of propositions on the November ballot. In the last few weeks, the rate of donations has\u00a0increased dramatically. On Oct. 19, ballot measure committees reported a one-day total of more than\u00a0$24\u00a0million in donations. More than a third of the money has come from tobacco and pharmaceutical companies The two most expensive measures are the ones potentially most damaging to the profits of the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries. Pharmaceutical companies have been the force behind the campaign to defeat Proposition 61, an initiative to influence prescription drug costs . At more than $109\u00a0million, it's one of\u00a0the most expensive ballot measure campaigns in California history, according to data from the\u00a0National Institute on Money in State Politics. Proposition 61 would\u00a0limit state government spending on prescription drugs to\u00a0the prices paid by\u00a0the\u00a0 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs .\u00a0Because the VA typically negotiates the lowest prices for prescription drugs of any public or private entity, the measure\u2019s supporters say they hope to curb rising drug costs paid by the state. Drug companies and trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have provided almost all the funding. Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson are the top three contributors to defeating Proposition 61. Tobacco companies have mounted the second largest campaign cash effort this season in their bid to defeat Proposition 56, which would impose a $2-per-pack tax on cigarettes . Tobacco giant Philip Morris alone has\u00a0spent more than $44 million to oppose the measure. Sign up for our Essential Politics newsletter \u00bb Hospitals and teachers have poured in a lot of money, and so have several\u00a0wealthy Californians The California Hospital Assn. and the California Teachers\u00a0Assn. have both contributed millions to support an income tax proposal to finance schools, healthcare and other government programs. The groups have each donated more than $20 million to support Proposition 55, which would extend current income tax rates on wealthy Californians \u00a0that are set to expire in 2018. The hospitals group\u00a0has donated another $10\u00a0million to Proposition 56, the tobacco tax increase , and\u00a0has also partnered with healthcare organizations to fund the majority of the nearly $60-million campaign to support Proposition 52. If passed, that proposal\u00a0would make permanent a program to help fund Medi-Cal , the state\u2019s subsidized healthcare program for low-income residents. Several wealthy donors\u00a0are also spending millions to influence November ballot measures. Tom\u00a0Steyer, a former hedge fund manager and potential 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has donated more than $11 million to ballot measure campaigns this cycle. Most of his money has gone to Proposition 56, but he\u2019s also contributed to Proposition 55, death penalty repeal measure\u00a0 Proposition 62 , prison parole initiative\u00a0 Proposition 57 \u00a0and bilingual education measure\u00a0 Proposition 58 . Palo Alto physicist Charles Munger\u00a0Jr. has donated more than $10 million to Proposition 54, a measure requiring legislative bills at the state Capitol to be in print for three days before lawmakers can give final approval. Former Facebook president Sean Parker has contributed more than $8 million to support Proposition 64 , the campaign to legalize marijuana. Gov. Jerry Brown has made a last-minute push for his parole proposition and against another\u00a0to impose\u00a0new rules on state borrowing In the final weeks before the election, the governor has devoted time and resources to two measures in particular: Proposition 53 and Proposition 57. Last month, Brown used his 2014 gubernatorial campaign account to\u00a0donate more than $4 million to defeat Proposition 53, which would require voter approval \u00a0before the sale of revenue bonds of $2 billion or more, the kind of bonds used to fund large infrastructure projects.\u00a0Brown also appears in a new\u00a0 television ad \u00a0opposing the measure.

USA TODAY Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on their final campaign swings before Election Day. (Photo: AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 In the race for president of the United States, everyone's vote counts. But some count more than others. That fact of American democracy is never more obvious on Election Day, when the president and vice president are elected\u00a0state-by-state under systems that change from county-by-county or even precinct-by-precinct. By the end of the night, more than 100 million individual voting decisions will be distilled into the only votes that count: the 538 votes in the Electoral College . The first candidate to 270 wins. Beyond the red states and blue states, voters will be segmented into bellwether counties, in-person voters and absentee ballots, and dozens of demographic groups: men and women, the more\u00a0and less educated, Baby Boomers and Millennials, Catholics and Jews, African-Americans and Hispanics, union and non-union households. For savvy election watchers, understanding those differences can send signals about who's winning and whose losing even before the last vote is cast. The Associated Press and the television networks have traditionally used exit polling to help quickly \"call\" states for one side or another. But as more states allow greater access to early voting, it's also possible for significant numbers of votes \u2014 more than half in some states\u00a0\u2014 to be counted and reported immediately after the polls close. What time do polls open and close in each state on Election Day? With the results in most states seemingly predetermined, the race comes down to a handful of \"swing states\" \u2014 places like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Nevada. Most analysts agree that Donald Trump needs more of those states than Hillary Clinton does. But the president isn't the only federal office on the ballot. The 2010 Tea Party surge swept in a class of Republican senators now defending their seats. Twenty-four of the 34\u00a0Senate seats are being defended by Republicans, and Democrats only need to win five of them to regain control of the Senate\u00a0\u2014 or just four if Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine is presiding. Here's a guide to watching the returns: 5 a.m. ET Every state has different poll opening and closing times, but in Vermont the polls can open as early as 5 a.m. And almost as soon as poll workers show up, there will almost certainly be problems reported. Locked polling places. Long lines. Power outages. Ballot shortages. Those are all problems that can bedevil election officials even in a less contentious\u00a0election year. Social media and growing distrust of the election system will shine a brighter light on them this year. And given the acrimony of 2016 \u2014 and Trump's charges that the election will be \"rigged\"\u00a0\u2014 both sides will be carefully watching to make sure elections are conducted peacefully and fairly. 6 p.m. ET Polls close in most of Indiana and Kentucky. Senate race\u00a0to watch: Democratic hopes to win the Senate could depend on a comeback by Democratic former senator Evan Bayh, scion of an\u00a0Indiana political family.\u00a0Bayh has been in a tight race with GOP Rep. Todd Young for the seat now occupied by retiring Sen. Dan Coats. 7 p.m. ET Polls close in Georgia, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, most of Florida,\u00a0and the western parts of Indiana and\u00a0Kentucky. Battlegrounds: Florida is one of the first states with polls to close,\u00a0and \u2014 if recent elections are any guide \u2014\u00a0will be one of the last states to be called. That means election watchers could have one eye on the Sunshine State for much of the night. But early voting could give some early indications: As of Sunday, 6.2 million voters had already cast ballots. That's nearly half the number of registered voters, and three-quarters of the number voting in 2012. Registered Democrats had cast 32,528 more votes than registered Republicans, but that gap is narrower than it was in 2012. Here's why Donald Trump (almost certainly) can't win without Florida Hillsborough County, home of Tampa, has the ethnic and economic diversity to make it a near-perfect microcosm, with a mix of longtime residents and snowbirds from other swing states like Michigan and Ohio.\u00a0\u201cThat diversity in geography and diversity in demographics makes Hillsborough County such a purple county,\" said\u00a0Ana Cruz, the former head of the\u00a0Florida Democratic Party. Hillsborough is \"a microcosm of what this battleground state of Florida represents.\" By all rights, Georgia shouldn't be in play; it hasn't gone Democratic since Bill Clinton in 1992. Trump has a healthy lead in recent polls, so a Clinton win \u2014 or even a close race \u2014 could signal trouble for Trump later on.\u00a0One reason: It would likely signal a motivated African-American turnout, which is going overwhelmingly for Clinton. An election official hands out stickers to encourage early voting in Atlanta on Oct. 17, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Erik S. Lesser, European Pressphoto Agency) 7:30 p.m. ET Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. Battlegrounds:\u00a0Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. It's not as important as it was a decade ago, but it's still more important to Trump as it is to Clinton. No Republican has won the White House without it. And on paper, it should be fertile ground for Trump's message: It has a high proportion of white voters without a college degree, and it's been buffeted by job losses caused by globalization. Reviving Rust Belt city in Ohio not convinced by Donald Trump's message Look to swing counties like Stark, Ross and Clark as bellwethers. Ottawa County, on Lake Erie, has predicted the national winner every year since 1964. But don't call the state until Cleveland vote comes in. Cuyahoga County often reports its votes late, and its\u00a0high concentration of true-blue Democratic voters can cancel out Trump wins downstate. \"I always feel like the Republican generally leads in the middle portion of the night, and then we wait and see if what happens in Cuyahoga,\" said Kyle Kondik, author of\u00a0 The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President . North Carolina is enjoying\u00a0\u2014 if that's the right word\u00a0\u2014 its newfound status as a swing state. In 2008, President Obama was the first Democrat to win it since 1976, but he lost it to Republican Mitt Romney four years later. It's gotten plenty of attention from both campaigns\u00a0\u2014 and from Obama, who made three stops there in the last week of the campaign. At the same time, the state has been roiled by\u00a0debates on transgender bathrooms and voting rights. The African-American turnout was key to Obama's 2008 victory and is crucial for Clinton as well. \"If she doesn\u2019t have a decent showing by black voters, then it makes it that much harder to make the state flip to blue,\"\u00a0 said Mike Bitzer , a political scientist at\u00a0Catawba College. Early voting is a good sign of whether the Clinton campaign has been successful in getting those voters to the polls; the first returns reported after the polls close could be revealing. Senate race\u00a0to watch: Democrat Deborah Ross, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, is challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr in the Tar Heel State. Burr made national headlines in the final days with comments about putting a bull's-eye on Clinton and promising to block Supreme Court nominees for another four years. A win by Democratic Senate challenger Deborah Ross in North Carolina could signal a change in Senate control. \u00a0(Photo: Gerry Broome, AP) 8 p.m. ET Polls close in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, most of Kansas,\u00a0Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, most of Michigan,\u00a0Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and\u00a0Rhode Island, most of Texas, eastern Tennessee\u00a0and the Florida panhandle. Battlegrounds:\u00a0Pennsylvania is so important to Democrats that Clinton decided to end her campaign there with a Philadelphia rally that brought her heaviest hitters\u00a0\u2014 the president and first lady\u00a0\u2014 back to the city where she was nominated. A big turnout in Pennsylvania is essential for her, but much of the attention will be in the suburban \"collar counties\":\u00a0Bucks, Chester, Delaware and\u00a0Montgomery. The moderate Republican voters there are usually a counterbalance to the urban Democrats, but this year could be different. A suburban tide against Trump could sink his election bid \"In Donald Trump, you have a perfect storm of a candidate in terms of pressing buttons to sending white, college-educated voters, particularly women, in the other direction,\" said\u00a0Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. Part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula is on Central time, so polls there close an hour later. But networks could call the state earlier based on exit polls in the Eastern time zone. Turnout in Detroit's Wayne County will be a key indicator of Clinton's support among African-Americans, but a better bellwether might be Macomb County, just north of 8 Mile Road. It's historically been ground zero for Reagan Democrats\u00a0and could indicate whether Trump's anti-trade, anti-immigration message swings enough union members to close the gap. Trump, Clinton each face challenges courting African-American vote in Detroit Maine is a curiosity, because it's one of two states (Nebraska is the other) that splits its electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 giving Trump a chance to pick up a spare vote in Maine's 2nd\u00a0district. New Hampshire voters have seen these candidates up close more than anyone else, and Trump has surged in the polls there in recent weeks. A Trump win may not\u00a0be decisive\u00a0\u2014 it has just four electoral votes\u00a0\u2014 but it could be a signal of whether Trump's rebound is for real . Senate races to watch: In Missouri,\u00a0GOP Sen. Roy Blunt faces a surprisingly strong challenger in Democratic Army veteran Jason Kander. In New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan is taking on GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte in a race dominated by the candidates' relationship to the presidential candidates. And in Pennsylvania, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is fending off a challenge from Katie McGinty, a former environmental protection official with close ties to Clinton and Obama. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and Democratic challenger Katie McGinty take part in a debate in Philadelphia on Oct. 24, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) Polls close in Arkansas. 9 p.m. ET Polls close in Arizona, Colorado, western Kansas,\u00a0Louisiana, the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Minnesota, eastern Nebraska, New Mexico,\u00a0New York,\u00a0western South Dakota the western panhandle of Texas,\u00a0Wisconsin and Wyoming. Battlegrounds:\u00a0In a normal election year, Arizona would be safely in the Republican column. The state has gone Democratic just once since 1948, and that was in the three-way race in 1996 when Reform Party candidate Ross Perot siphoned off Republican votes. While an Arizona Republic poll three weeks ago showed Clinton up by 5 percentage points, more recent polls have favored Trump. But those poll results are based largely on models that show that Hispanic voters are historically underrepresented in voter turnout. And Democrats are hoping that Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric will drive Latinos to the polls.\u00a0Exit polls will show whether that's happening. Trump supporters arrive at a rally in Phoenix on Oct. 29, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Caitlin O'Hara, AFP/Getty Images) Obama carried Colorado twice, moving it from purple to blue on most electoral maps, and Clinton leads in most recent polls. And its demographics work against Trump: It's younger, more educated and more Hispanic than the country at large. But Trump visited the state Saturday night ,\u00a0and GOP officials say they've pulled ahead on mail-in votes submitted by Republican voters. \"I don't think people are talking about it today, but we're 1,700\u00a0votes ahead in an all mail-in state in\u00a0Colorado\u00a0today. It is a jump ball in\u00a0Colorado,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on ABC's This Week. That's a change from a week ago, when Trump visited the state and claimed there were\u00a0\"real problems with ballots being sent\" and encouraged supporters to vote in person. In New Mexico, Clinton has had a consistent lead in the polls, with the latest\u00a0Albuquerque Journal poll showing her leading, 45% to 40%. So the most interesting thing to watch may be how well former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson does. The Libertarian candidate once hoped to play spoiler here, but his support has been cut to 11% from his high-water mark of 24% in September. 10 p.m. ET Polls close in southern Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Nevada,\u00a0eastern North Dakota, far eastern Oregon and Utah. Battlegrounds:\u00a0Once considered competitive, Iowa seems to be trending in Trump's direction. A Des Moines Register poll published Sunday showed him up by 7 percentage points. \u201cThe bigger surprise on election night would be if he lost Iowa, not that he won it,\u201d\u00a0said Amy Walter, national editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t afford to lose Iowa, and Hillary Clinton can.\u201d Like Colorado, Nevada is another state where the two main sources of predictive data\u00a0\u2014 polls and early votes\u00a0\u2014 are trending in opposite directions. Trump seems to have a slight lead in recent polls, but a surge of early ballots cast by registered Democrats would seem to favor Clinton. Trump needs crossover and independent votes\u00a0\u2014 and big turnout by Republicans on Election Day\u00a0\u2014 to overcome a 40,000-ballot early-vote advantage by registered Democrats. But Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., told a Trump rally in Reno on Saturday that the early voting numbers fail to take into account independent voters, who he said will break toward Trump on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cGuess what, the history in Nevada is Election Day is elephant day. Election Day is independent day,\" he said. Also closely watched will be the fate of Utah's six electoral votes, with recent polls showing insurgent conservative Evan McMullin within striking distance of Donald Trump. McMullin would be the first third-party candidate to win electoral votes since George Wallace in 1968 \u2014 and those are electoral votes Trump needs. Senate race to watch: The retirement of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid leaves an open seat in Nevada. Hoping to fill it are\u00a0Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic former state attorney general, and GOP Rep. Joe Heck. Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto shakes hands with GOP Rep. Joe Heck after the Nevada Senate debate on Oct. 14, 2016, in North Las Vegas. \u00a0(Photo: Erik Verduzco, AP) Polls close in California, Hawaii, northern Idaho, western North Dakota, most of Oregon and Washington. 12 midnight ET Polls close in most of Alaska. 1 a.m. ET Polls close in half the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.

Markus Schreiber/AP More than four years after he took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will face questioning there on Nov. 14 over Sweden's allegations against him of sex crimes, including rape. This could mark a breakthrough in the standoff. Assange has repeatedly denied the accusations, which date to 2010. He maintains that he would face extradition to the U.S. if he appeared in Sweden for questioning, as we reported . Sweden has said an interview is necessary before it can determine whether to file charges against Assange. Ecuador Acknowledges It Restricted WikiLeaks Founder's Internet Connection Sweden's prosecution authority said in a statement that \"Ecuador has granted the Swedish request for legal assistance in criminal matters.\" It said an Ecuadorean prosecutor will conduct the interview with a Swedish prosecutor and police investigator. They will also take a DNA sample from Assange, should he give his consent. \"I welcome the fact that the investigation can now move forward via an interview with the suspect,\" Director of Prosecution Marianne Ny said. The prosecutors said they will not release details after they conduct the interview because this is an ongoing investigation. \"Since he took refuge in the embassy, three of four sex-crimes allegations against Assange have expired, due to statutes of limitation,\" as we have reported. \"The fourth allegation, of rape, remains.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

As Clinton blasted what she called her opponent\u2019s \u201cdivisive vision\u201d for America, Trump blamed her and her husband\u2019s policies for manufacturing job losses and vowed a change if he\u2019s elected. \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you. We\u2019re going to bring back wealth taken from this country,\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, said in battleground state North Carolina, the second of his five stops Monday. \u00a0\u00a0 Trump began his day in Florida before heading to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. The race remains tight hours before voting gets underway. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows Trump\u2019s prospects improving in four key states -- Arizona, Iowa, Utah and North Carolina \u2013 though Clinton still has the advantage on the electoral map. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Clinton returned to the campaign trail Monday, less than 24 hours after the FBI concluded a revived probe into her personal email use as secretary of state, lifting a cloud off her campaign in the final hours as she seeks to become the first woman elected president in U.S. history. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time,\u201d Clinton said at her first rally, in Pittsburgh. \u201cWill we come together as a nation or split further apart? \u2026 We don\u2019t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive big-hearted America.\u201d Before embarking on her three-state campaign swing, Clinton told reporters that she has \"some work to do to bring the country together\" and that she wants to be president for those who vote for her and those who don't. Clinton after Pennsylvania went to battleground state Michigan before planning to return for an event in Philadelphia, then a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Trump on Monday resumed his breakneck race through the country to make a final appeal to voters to help him \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. In the wake of the FBI announcement, he urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box.\"\u00a0 On Sunday, Trump and running mate Mike Pence held events in seven states, with the last starting after midnight in Virginia. \u201cShe wants to fight ISIS?\u201d Trump said Monday in North Carolina about Clinton, who has essentially led for the entire 2016 election cycle. \u201cShe wants to fight nobody. She\u2019s got no chance.\u201d Trump is aiming for an upset victory Tuesday, which is still possible if he is able to win key toss-up states and pick off one or more strategic states considered Democratic territory. The former reality TV star shocked the country\u2019s political class this spring when he defeated 16 major candidates in the Republican primaries, among them several senators and governors. While seeking victories in the so-called battleground states, which have a mix of voters who could go for either major party candidate, Pennsylvania is considered critical for Trump. The state has not elected a GOP presidential nominee since 1988 in the candidates\u2019 race to get 270 Electoral College votes. Trump still expressed optimism Monday about winning Pennsylvania. \u201cAre you watching what\u2019s happening in Philadelphia?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cWe are going to win.\u201d The public transit system in liberal-leaning Philadelphia will be running in time for Election Day, after a weeklong strike, which is good news for Clinton and other Democratic candidates on Tuesday's ballots. City officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. Early voting in other battleground states suggests Clinton is leading among Hispanics, a key voting bloc. However, the African-American vote does not appear as strong for her as it was in 2008 and 2012 when black voters helped elect and re-elect Barack Obama.\u00a0 The Justice Department said Monday that it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That's a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago, amid Trump\u2019s persistent warning about potential voter fraud at polling stations. Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. The announcement also came amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show that the staff has not stopped Trump from tweeting despite a report suggesting otherwise.\u00a0 Many of Trump\u2019s most inflammatory comments during the campaign were made on Twitter. But he has exhibited unusual restraint on social media in the final days of the campaign. After days of attacks on Trump's qualifications and temperament, Clinton this past weekend cast herself as the candidate of \"healing and reconciliation,\" despite being one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Overshadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI Director James Comey's latest letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.

James Comey, director of the FBI, speaks during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 27, 2016. (Zach Gibson / Bloomberg) Tribune news services Contact Reporter FBI Director James Comey was being honored Monday night by a group whose board includes several people with longtime ties to Donald Trump , including the CEO of the National Enquirer and a convicted felon who goes by the nickname \"Joey No Socks.\" Comey, already criticized over his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation in the final days of the presidential campaign, was accepting the lifetime achievement award from the nonprofit Federal Drug Agents Foundation. The group lists more than three dozen board directors on its website; another was the developer of a troubled Trump-branded tower in Toronto. An FBI spokesman said the foundation provides disability, bereavement and personal crisis support to federal agents and educational and charitable grants. Foundation representatives did not immediately respond to phone and email messages from The Associated Press. The foundation regularly hosts dinners and events honoring law enforcement officials. Past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include Attorney General Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. It was not clear whether Comey \u2014 a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan \u2014 was aware of the board members' ties to Trump, or whether he decided those connections were not consequential given the group's stature with New York law enforcement. But the award and ceremony came as the FBI has been accused by partisans on both the left and right of injecting itself unnecessarily into the presidential race through Comey's statements and updates about the FBI's now-concluded review of Hillary Clinton's email practices. Among the Trump-connected board members is David Pecker, a friend of Trump's and the chief executive of American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer. ",

    "text": "[ For FBI, email investigation yields little but criticism ] Earlier Monday, her campaign manager Robby Mook criticized Comey\u2019s handling of the probe as \u201cbizarre,\u201d even as he said that he was relieved by the outcome. \u201cWe were glad obviously that this was resolved,\u201d Mook told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on ABC. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t have just looked into the matter and resolved it and not created such a ruckus in the campaign, but we\u2019re just glad in this last day Hillary can get back on the road.\u201d In July, Comey ended an FBI probe into the server saying that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with classified information in the emails, but that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would recommend criminal charges. A government official said Comey\u2019s latest letter represented the conclusion of the FBI\u2019s investigation. Trump, who had been trailing badly in the polls when the new emails were revealed, has since narrowed the gap, leaning on a message that Clinton was \u201ccrooked\u201d and likely to be charged. But Clinton appears narrowly ahead in most polls, and her campaign officials pointed to heavy turnout among Hispanics and Asians in crucial swing states, such as Florida and North Carolina, as evidence that the race was moving in their direction. More than 6.4 million voters in Florida have voted early, up nearly 35 percent over 2012, according to the Clinton campaign, with big early surges in majority Hispanic Miami Dade county. More broadly, the Clinton campaign said that early voter turnout was breaking records \u2014 with more than 41 million Americans casting ballots before Election Day \u201cWe are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history,\u201d Clinton said in Pittsburgh. \u201cIf the lines are long tomorrow, please wait.\u201d The Justice Department said Monday that it would deploy more than 500 poll-watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, including at least three in each of the swing states. Many of the jurisdictions have large Native American, black, Latino and Muslim populations The department said its lawyers would be working to enforce federal voting rights laws \u201cto ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot.\u201d It also has a hotline (toll free at 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-3931) to register complaints. In the last few days of the campaign, Trump has invested time and resources in blue-leaning states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees. The real estate developer told crowd after crowd Monday that he was on track to victory, urging his supporters to ignore the \u201cphony stuff\u201d in the media. And Trump continued to erroneously assert that he had given \u201cover $100 million\u201d of his personal funds to finance his campaign. (In fact, he donated a little more than $66 million, according to Federal Election Commission reports.) \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy \u2026 and money,\u201d Trump said in Raleigh, adding, \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, honestly, we\u2019ve all wasted our time.\u201d On Sunday, Trump used a swing through the Midwest to warn about the threat of refugees, including in Minnesota, where he singled out \u201clarge numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state ... and with some of them then joining ISIS.\u201d Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, said Trump\u2019s remarks would backfire on him by spurring Somali Americans to go to the polls. \u201cAny young Somali who was wondering \u2013 should I vote? should I not vote? \u2014 is off the fence now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe probably gave us two to three points, and he badly misunderstood who our Somali immigrants are. They\u2019re neighbors. ... If you attack them, you attack the whole state of Minnesota.\u201d Both Trump and Clinton scrambled across the country Monday, appearing within hours of each other in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Raleigh. The appearances reflect an electoral map that seemed to shift in the wake of Comey\u2019s announcement of the new emails nine days earlier. Clinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states that included Georgia and Arizona, has turned back to defend blue turf such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Monday, Clinton was set to hold four rallies in three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. She will finish the day with a rally in Philadelphia that includes President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, followed by a midnight speech in Raleigh, where Lady Gaga was set to appear. The Clinton campaign is leaning heavily on the president and Michelle Obama to drum up enthusiasm and spur voter turnout on election day. Obama appeared in Michigan several hours ahead of Clinton and used his remarks to praise the Democratic nominee and tout his work in the first term to bolster the country\u2019s then-sputtering auto industry. \u201cI think I\u2019ve earned some credibility here,\u201d Obama said of his efforts to shore up the auto industry. When it comes to voting for Clinton on Tuesday, he continued, \u201cI am asking you to trust me on this one.\u201d [ Clinton holds edge in swing state Virginia ] Later in the day, in Durham, N.H., Obama grew reflective, noting that it was his final solo rally as president. He recounted the story of Edith Childs , the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan \u201cFired Up! Ready to Go!\u201d \u2014 the same story he told at his last rally on the eve of his first election. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us,\u201d the president told thousands of cheering supporters who filled an arena at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cThis is one of those moments,\u201d Obama added. \u201cDon\u2019t let it slip away.\u201d Gearan reported from Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Mich., Sullivan from Raleigh and Sarasota, Fla., and Gold from Washington.

USA TODAY Minimum wage hikes have boosted the pay of restaurant and retail workers in many states. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) 1134 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 142 COMMENTEMAILMORE Voters in four states on Tuesday will consider ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage, threatening to widen the disparity between the growing number of jurisdictions that have lifted their pay floors and the rest of the country. In Arizona, Colorado and Maine, state hourly minimums would rise to $12 by 2020 from a range of $7.50 to $8.31. In Washington, the pay floor would climb from $9.47 to $13.50 over the next four years. Polls in the four states generally show solid majorities supporting the measures. A sweep would widen the gap between the 29 states \u2014\u00a0with 60% of the U.S. workforce \u2014\u00a0 that now have base wages higher than the federal government\u2019s $7.25 an hour, and the 21 states that remain at the U.S. minimum, according to the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. In the past couple of years, about 20 states and dozens of cities and counties have approved gradual increases in their pay floors through legislation or ballot initiatives as Republicans in Congress have blocked efforts to raise the federal minimum. \u201cThis is about states taking matters into their own hands,\u201d says Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the NELP Action Fund, the group\u2019s policy advocacy arm. Low-paid workers are leading in wage gains About 2 million workers in the four states voting Tuesday would be affected by an increase in their pay floors, according to NELP. Proponents of the measures say higher wages are needed to provide lower- and middle-income households a reasonable standard of living and narrow the yawning divide between those groups and the wealthy. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says the increasing divergence among state minimum wages heightens the need to lift the national pay base. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to win the geographic lottery to get access to a (higher) minimum wage,\u201d he said in an interview. Employers in states at the federal pay floor are at a growing disadvantage as they scramble to attract workers in a tightening labor market with a low 4.9% unemployment rate, Conti says. $15 minimum wage could spread in 2016 But Michael Saltsman, research director for the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry, says, \u201cThe exact opposite is the case,\u201d with businesses drawn to states with lower labor costs. Higher minimum wages, he argues, have prodded some restaurants and retailers to cut staff or close, and to hire older, more experienced employees, closing off opportunities for teenagers and lower-skilled adults. \u201cYou going to make it that much more difficult for people to find jobs at the bottom end of the career ladder,\u201d he says. Still, Americans generally favor a higher minimum wage, according to surveys, and their views could impact key Senate races. A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling for NELP\u2019s action fund showed voters in states such as Missouri and North Carolina switching preferences after learning of Republican Senate candidates\u2019 opposition to raising the minimum wage. Proponents of the hikes at least partly attribute the shift by states to the Fight for $15 campaign that has led fast- food worker strikes across the USA since 2012 and is financed by the Service Employees Union international. Earlier this year, California and New York approved minimum wage increases to $15 an hour by 2022, joining cities such as Seattle and San Francisco. 1134 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 142 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f2MScx ",

His border wall would be \"the most difficult to accomplish\" on his immigration wish list, former Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Doris Meissner said. He would need Congress to approve funding for it in the budget and would face legal obstacles in order to build on vast stretches that pass through private, state, and tribal lands. Democrats in Congress would oppose construction of the wall out of hand, especially if it's not attached to immigration reform measures including a path to citizenship for existing undocumented immigrants. Republicans would be divided as well, making passage unlikely. Mexico's leadership has also made clear they won't pay for the wall as Trump as promised, and his promise to compel them to do so by cutting off transfer payments by private citizens between Mexico and America may not be legally or politically possible. Finally, Trump would face the task of nominating a new Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, who died last year. He already has put out a growing list of possible names, all of whom are broadly in line with conservative wish lists. A bumpy foreign policy ride Trump would almost certainly face a global crisis even before he took office, as allies abroad are alarmed by his \"America First\" rhetoric and stated disregard for the international institutions the United States has led since World War II. In particular, Trump's threats to abandon NATO countries and military allies like South Korea and Japan if they fail to shoulder more of the cost of American protection have caused a firestorm. He would also have to chart a course with allies in the Muslim world like Saudi Arabia, who he has criticized regularly, after promising to ban all Muslims from America. \"He's taken a stand that is farther than what anyone in the security community has previously advocated,\" Jacob Shapiro, a professor of international affairs at Princeton, said. Dozens of foreign leaders, breaking from more typical diplomatic tones towards potential US presidents, have publicly warned Trump would damage relations with their countries and have criticized him in unusually personal terms. A poll by Pew of residents in a variety of European and Asian allies in June found broad opposition to Trump , with majorities and pluralities across the board saying they had \"no confidence\" in his ability to lead. Trump listens to a speaker during a meeting with Cuban supporters at Trump National Doral, on Oct. 25 in Miami. Evan Vucci / AP Presidents have extremely broad authority on foreign policy and Trump has some big ideas, making this the area early in his presidency to watch most. Does he reach out to reassure foreign leaders that some of his campaign lines were for show? Or does he actively start calling into question international agreements, from military alliances to trade deals to the Geneva Convention , which he has said should be altered to allow torture and other war crimes? \"Many of these questions would be shaped by the foreign policy team around him, about which we know nothing,\" Galston said. \"Virtually the entire Republican foreign policy establishment has jumped ship.\" In another flashpoint, Trump has called climate science a hoax and said he'd pull out of the Paris climate agreement, a massive global priority already backed by over 190 countries. He'd also look to undo energy regulations that would keep the US on track to meet the deal's emissions targets that scientists warn are the bare minimum to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change. Among other problems, this would also create instant tension with China which agreed to a major deal with the U.S. on climate emissions ahead of Paris. When it comes to the war against ISIS, Trump would face immediate questions about how to handle Syria, where he would have an opportunity to put his call for warmer relations with Russia to the test. It would also be a battleground within the party and likely his own administration. Trump has said repeatedly he'll look for cooperation with Russia, including on a joint military campaign against ISIS, and not pursue avenues to remove Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. His running mate Pence, however, said in a nationally televised debate with Tim Kaine that he would threaten Assad with military force over his use of indiscriminate bombing and opposes Russian involvement. Trump later said Pence was wrong. Pence has also threatened consequences against Russia if they're found to be involved in election related hacks, which Trump has denied is the case despite a consensus assessment by U.S. intelligence officials. Trade wars Then there's Trump's top agenda item: Trade. Trump would likely follow through on his campaign promise to reopen talks on NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, which he has threatened to leave if they go poorly. He's also floated withdrawing from the World Trade Organization , which could set off an international trade war and financial panic, although he has put less emphasis on the idea. \"From what I've noticed, he's moved away from saying he will automatically take the US out of these agreements to saying that he will demand renegotiation,\" Robert Howse, a professor of international law at New York University, said.

    "text": "By Juliet Eilperin and Greg Jaffe November 7 at 6:00 AM Follow @eilperin Follow @GregJaffe In the waning days of a bitter, exhausting, enervating election season, President Obama has often seemed to be the only person in America who is still having fun. On each of his stops for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he has been greeted by screaming crowds and a palpable nostalgia embodied by the same largely improvised exchange. \u201cI love you,\u201d a voice from the crowd inevitably calls. \u201cLove you, too,\u201d Obama always replies. The exchange captures one of the striking paradoxes of this election season: At a moment defined by anger at Washington, voter cynicism and two historically unpopular presidential candidates, Obama\u2019s approval rating is the highest it has been since his first days in office. It now stands at 56\u00a0percent, according to a Gallup tracking poll released Sunday. How Obama tackled America\u2019s most divisive issues and what that means for the country\u2019s future. View Graphic How Obama tackled America\u2019s most divisive issues and what that means for the country\u2019s future. For the first time in decades \u2014 dating back to Ronald Reagan \u2014 a lame-duck incumbent is in high demand on the campaign trail. The good feelings, meanwhile, extend beyond the president himself. First lady Michelle Obama has been perhaps Clinton\u2019s most effective surrogate, campaigning alongside her in North Carolina last month. In crucial swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, Vice President Biden\u2019s popularity surpasses even that of the president at his eight-year peak. Nearly two-thirds of voters in Pennsylvania, for example, have a favorable view of the vice president and the first lady, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics poll. Some key factors have worked to the president\u2019s advantage. Respectable job growth and declining unemployment have helped the public mood, and for the most part, this White House has not been hobbled by any significant scandals in the second term. But the biggest reason for the late-term surge in presidential popularity may be the election itself. \u201cI know a lot of you are cynical about politics,\u201d Obama told a crowd in Miami last week. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about this election that gives you reason to be.\u201d [ Obama veers off script, turns up the passion at Clinton rally in Florida ] Presidential elections often are, at least in part, a referendum on the incumbent. But for months, Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump have been blasting away at each other in what amounts to a contest about character between two highly polarizing figures. Even a recent surge in insurance premiums associated with the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy accomplishment, has left the president largely unscathed, and broader Republican attacks on him have not been particularly effective. \u201cWe should have been able to say, \u2018We\u2019re ready for a change,\u2019 \u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said. \u201cThat has not been done successfully by the Trump campaign.\u201d At a rally for Hillary Clinton in Miami on Nov. 2, President Obama said Sen. Marco Rubio's vote for Donald Trump shows that the Florida Republican \"will say anything or be anything\" to \"get elected or cling to power.\" Obama told voters to elect Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) instead. (The Washington Post) Typically, Obama is Trump\u2019s third or fourth target, behind Clinton, the GOP establishment and the news media. Last week, as Trump\u2019s plane was taxiing for takeoff in Miami, he spotted Air Force One on the tarmac. \u201cHe\u2019s down here campaigning for Crooked Hillary,\u201d Trump said at a rally later that afternoon. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he back in the White House bringing our jobs back? And helping our veterans? Why? Why isn\u2019t he back working?\u201d Trump, however, has been either unwilling or unable to go after Obama for his handling of foreign affairs, the area where support for the president\u2019s policies is weakest. Since 2012, nearly 400,000 Syrians have died in that country\u2019s civil war, while nearly 5\u00a0million have fled as refugees. Amid that worsening humanitarian catastrophe, the toughest critiques of Obama\u2019s approach have come from Clinton, who has questioned the president\u2019s unwillingness to arm Syrian rebels early in the conflict or establish no-fly zones to protect American allies from Russian and Syrian bombs. Trump, channeling the electorate\u2019s fatalism regarding the Middle East, has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy and suggested outsourcing the crisis to the Russian and Syrian regime forces. \u201cThings are not going well in Syria or Iraq,\u201d said Michael Singh, a former top foreign policy official in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. \u201cBut there is no heated partisan debate on how to handle it.\u201d As the rhetoric has grown louder and meaner, Obama also has benefited from a White House message machine built, over the past eight years, for the digital age. Both the president and the first lady have been in heavy rotation on the TV talk-show circuit. Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d appearance with \u201cLate Late Show\u201d host James Corden has garnered more than 46 million views since it first aired in July \u2014 an audience that dwarfs any for campaign advertising in the current election cycle. [ Here\u2019s why Joe Biden chose Obama to deliver his son\u2019s eulogy ] The president, meanwhile, has gone from being a relative newcomer to national politics when he won in 2008 to a more practiced and confident politician. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m fearless,\u201d Obama said in a podcast interview last year. Jennifer Psaki, the White House communications director and a longtime Obama aide, recently made a similar point in an interview: \u201cWhat people are seeing is that he feels liberated, and he\u2019s able to be the wonky, optimistic, slightly nerdy president that people elected.\u201d In the final months of his presidency, Obama has played on that public nostalgia, returning repeatedly to the broader themes of the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that made him a political star and his 2008 inaugural address. \u201cI\u2019m asking you the same thing I asked of you eight years ago,\u201d he said in Miami. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to believe \u2014 not in my ability to change things or one person\u2019s ability change things . . . I\u2019m asking you to believe in your ability to change things.\u201d Obama\u2019s campaign audiences are often full of young, college-age voters, many of whom were in elementary school when he was elected. The message, however, is the same Obama message. \u201cYou can draw a straight line between that speech in 2004 and the speeches\u201d he is giving on the campaign trail, said David Simas, White House political director. The question is whether that loyalty and good feeling will transfer to Clinton. Obama spent the hours leading up to Election Day trying to rally the vote in swing states where support for Clinton, particularly among young people and African Americans, looks shaky. Several of the president\u2019s former campaign aides have started sharing their own video, titled \u201c Do It for Obama ,\u201d in which they recount war stories and explain why Clinton deserves support. Liz Jaff, who worked on both of Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and helped create the video, has spent more than a week turning out voters in Ohio. As she walked around a parking lot in Columbus near Clinton\u2019s campaign office, she worried that a Trump victory would essentially be a repudiation of Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cIf we elected the first African American president and it just opened up more racism in our society, it\u2019s just really hard,\u201d she said, her voice cracking as she started to cry. \u201cWe did everything for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be the same for her.\u201d Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",
