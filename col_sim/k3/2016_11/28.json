    "text": "CBS News Francisco Lopera: They were getting disease very early in the life. It all began many years earlier, back in the 1980s when Lopera was a young medical resident. \u00a0He had read about small numbers of people scattered around the world who\u2019d developed Alzheimer\u2019s in their 40s.\u00a0 So when a 47-year-old man came into his Medellin clinic with Alzheimer\u2019s-like symptoms, he was intrigued and decided to investigate. Lesley Stahl: You met this one man and you decided to go to where he was from? Francisco Lopera: I decided to go to the town where he was living. Lopera learned that the man\u2019s father and grandfather had also lost their memories in their 40s.\u00a0 Then, a few years later, another similar patient came into the clinic, this time a 42-year-old woman from a town 40 miles away. \u00a0Dr. Lopera\u2019s then-nurse, Lucia Madrigal, asked if any of her relatives also started losing their memories when they were young. Lucia: They told us yes, that the father, the uncles, the grandfather, the great grandfather, so I started making a little family tree, on one page, and I showed it to Dr. Lopera and I told him \u201cLook what we have here. What is this? So many with the same disease\u2026\u201d And so began a detective hunt that lasted more than a decade. Lopera and Madrigal traveled all over the region, finding more and more people afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and compiling family trees.\u00a0 They thought it might be genetic, so Madrigal spent days at parish churches, poring over heavy ledgers where priests for generations had recorded village births, marriages, and deaths.\u00a0 Thanks to these meticulous records, she was able to trace the disease back hundreds of years, and to make an important discovery -- the different families were actually one huge extended family, connected generations back by common ancestors who had died young, with an unusual cause of death written down by the priest: \u201csoftening of the brain.\u201d This is what \u201csoftening of the brain\u201d looks like in real life.\u00a0 Fernando is 46 years old, a descendant of that second patient years ago. He started forgetting things when he was in his late 30s, and now can no longer speak, feed himself, or do just about anything on his own. His aunt takes care of him round the clock just as she did with his mother when she got the disease at the same age. Norelly is at an even later stage of the disease.\u00a0 Despite her appearance, she is just 58 years old. Patients were going from mild symptoms to complete dementia and then death within about a decade -- as Dr. Lopera showed us in these cognitive test results. Francisco Lopera: You can see, at 38\u2026 Even at age 38, this man struggled -- as many older Alzheimer\u2019s patients do -- to copy a complex drawing accurately. Francisco Lopera: At 45.\u00a0 And things got worse from there.\u00a0 Francisco Lopera:\u00a0 He lost more. At 50. Lesley Stahl: Ah! Oh! Francisco Lopera: At 51. Lesley Stahl: Oh! Dr. Lopera was convinced that what he and Madrigal were discovering was scientifically important, but even as they found more patients and more related families, he couldn\u2019t get anyone outside Colombia to take notice. Until 1993, when a Harvard professor came to give a talk about Alzheimer\u2019s in Bogota, several hours away. Ken Kosik: There was a person in the audience, Francisco Lopera, who came up after the talk and said, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s-- I have a family here that w-- has-- early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d Ken Kosik, now at UC Santa Barbara, was that professor. Lesley Stahl: A family. Could\u2019ve been four people. Ken Kosik: It could\u2019ve been just four people. But he started to tell me how many it was. And as I listened to him, I became just so absorbed and taken with what he was telling me that I changed all my plans, went with him to Medell\u00edn. And, we began a collaboration that goes on to this day. They showed Kosik what Lucia Madrigal showed us -- the family tree they had compiled based on all that searching through church records, for just one of the affected families, going back all the way to the 1800s. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: This is one family? Lucia: Una sola! (Only one!) It just kept unfolding and unfolding. Covering these pages are small squares representing men, circles for women. The colored-in squares and circles mean the person got sick with Alzheimer\u2019s at an early age.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Look, she had these sons and a daughter. And then it just kept going down-- through the generations\u2014 Lucia:\u00a0 Si. Ken Kosik: When we looked at the family trees, about 50 percent of the offspring were getting the disease. That\u2019s a clear signature of a gene. But what gene? Kosik connected Dr. Lopera with leading geneticists in the U.S., and they started collecting blood samples and searching.\u00a0 Within a year, a major breakthrough. They found a specific mutation in a gene on chromosome 14 \u2013 one tiny flaw in the DNA responsible for all this family\u2019s suffering.\u00a0 The discovery was published in 1997 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Lopera had identified the largest concentration of early onset Alzheimer\u2019s cases in the world. Lesley Stahl: If a person has that mutation, do they get Alzheimer\u2019s? Ken Kosik: Yes, they do. Lesley Stahl: If they have it, they definitely get the disease. Ken Kosik: Right. There are some mutations where you don\u2019t definitely get it. But this is a bad one. And if you have this mutation, you get it. For families like Alonso\u2019s, discovering the mutation was a blessing \u2013 a crucial first step toward finding a way to fight the disease.\u00a0 But it was also a curse, because it meant that anyone whose parent had the mutation has a 50/50 chance of having inherited it too. Lesley Stahl: Do any of you know if you have that mutation? Do you know? Victor: No. Freddie: Nobody knows. Lesley Stahl: Nobody knows. Well, somebody knows.\u00a0 Dr. Lopera and his team have been testing for the mutation and compiling a database, but their policy is not to tell family members if they have the mutation or not -- and not even to reveal the results to Dr. Lopera -- since at this point there is nothing that can be done to help.\u00a0 Cecilia: Sometimes I ask, which one will get it? But I throw that thought away, because I don\u2019t want to think about that. I pray a lot to God that none of them gets it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see my children with that disease. Lesley Stahl: Each one of you knows, because of your father, that you have a 50/50 chance. So what kind of a weight does that put on you, day in and day out? Julio: I\u2019ve even prayed to God that if there\u2019s one person who has to have the disease, I say to God, \u201cLet it be me.\u201d Sara: I thank God that I\u2019m a nurse and that I would be able to take care of them, but I tell myself, \u201cFirst I had to go through it with my dad, the experience of the disease, and I may have to go through it with one of my siblings, or with several, we don\u2019t know.\u201d Sara told us she would love to have children of her own, but given her risk of developing the disease, she\u2019s decided against it. Sara: So that my children don\u2019t have to go through my same experience. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019ve been working on this 30 years. How do you cope with all this pain? Francisco Lopera: [breaks down] It was not the response we had expected.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: It\u2019s that hard? It\u2019s that hard. But Dr. Lopera knew that even in the midst of all this tragedy, there might just be a glimmer of hope.\u00a0 Because what he had discovered in these families -- hundreds of people destined to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, and easily identifiable with a simple genetic test -- presented a unique scientific opportunity to test whether it\u2019s possible to step in and stop early-onset, and maybe all, Alzheimer\u2019s disease before it starts. That part of the story, when we come back. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.\u00a0 More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s right now, and given the aging baby boomer population, that number is projected to nearly triple by mid-century.\u00a0 Yet unlike many other leading killers, there is no effective treatment. An Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is essentially a prescription for a slow descent into oblivion -- an inexorable loss of the memories, spatial skills, and ability to think that make us who we are. \u00a0 Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patients like the hundreds of family members in Colombia are a tiny fraction of the whole, but to scientists, they could be everything.\u00a0 Because they are offering researchers something they have never had before -- a way to test whether intervening years before people start having symptoms, might halt the disease in its tracks. Answers are still years away, but with more than a thousand Americans developing Alzheimer\u2019s every day, a way to prevent it can not come soon enough. The scene we witnessed in Dr. Pierre Tariot\u2019s exam room at the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute in Phoenix is one that plays out in neurologist\u2019s offices every day. Dr. Tariot: So if I asked you what city we\u2019re in right now, what would you say? Norm: Uh, you know, right, I don\u2019t know at this moment. Norm, age 72, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s -- the typical, late-in-life form so many of us fear. It begins with mild memory and thinking problems and spirals into full-on dementia. Dr. Tariot: Who is that young lady over there? Norm: Betsy. Dr. Tariot: Betsy. And is she a friend? Norm: Yes. Dr. Tariot: How do you know Betsy? Norm: Because I\u2019ve been loving her for a long time. Dr. Tariot: OK. Is she your sister? Norm: A little bit of both. Dr. Tariot: Uh-huh. Is she your wife? Norm: I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I think you\u2019re-- somebody.\u00a0 I wish I was, but\u2026 They\u2019ve been married 51 years. Unlike early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, there\u2019s been no single gene identified that causes this. No way to know who among us is destined to get it. Lesley Stahl: What percentage of all people are going to be get Alzheimer\u2019s? Pierre Tariot: One percent of us 60 or older will have a dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But by the time you hit 85\u2014 Lesley Stahl: What percent? Pierre Tariot: --that-- that percentage is approaching 40ish percent. Norm: That\u2019s a Dogan and these are Gogans. Pierre Tariot: Alzheimer\u2019s disease has been called out by the World Health Organization as the coming pandemic of the West. We have to do something to put it behind us. Claudia to female patient: Can you draw the numbers for a clock? But Dr. Claudia Kawas, a leading Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and clinician at the University of California Irvine, says she\u2019s frustrated that she can\u2019t offer her patients any hope. Claudia Kawas: I have to say I\u2019ve been doing this now for a third of a century. And when I started, I just never would have believed we would still not be closer than we are now to making a real difference. It has been a little disappointing. It hasn\u2019t been for lack of trying. Kawas gave us a quick primer on the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in the brain after autopsy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Claudia Kawas: Every place you see a brown spot, that is a senile amyloid plaque. In contrast, you see these black things that tend to be triangular shape. Those are what we call neurofibrillary tangles. The relationship between plaques and tangles isn\u2019t completely understood, but because it\u2019s been shown that amyloid plaques build up in the brain before tangles -- and years before patients develop symptoms -- pharmaceutical companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars since the early 2000s developing drugs to remove amyloid from the brain, and hundreds of millions more to test those drugs in patients like Norm. Lesley Stahl: Of all the trials that have been done, what percent have succeeded? Pierre Tariot: About one percent. In other words, a resounding failure.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So what does that say, do you think? Claudia Kawas: Well, it says either amyloid is not the right thing to go after. Or it says we need to remove it earlier on in the process before it\u2019s made all the other things cascade after it. You know, if you give a polio vaccine once somebody has polio, you can understand why it doesn\u2019t work. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re saying that maybe those drugs haven\u2019t worked because the person already had Alzheimer\u2019s? Claudia Kawas: Exactly. And maybe if we give \u2018em early enough, it might work. But how can you test drugs on people before they develop the disease, when you don\u2019t know who among us is going to get it?\u00a0 Dr. Tariot and the executive director at the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute, Dr. Eric Reiman, realized there was a place where you could know who was going to get Alzheimer\u2019s --- Antioquia. Ken Kosik: And that\u2019s when my phone began to ring. By then, Ken Kosik had been studying the Colombian extended family for 15 years.\u00a0 Ken Kosik: Received a call from the people at Banner. And they said, you know, \u201cYou have this family. We know when they\u2019re gonna get it. We know who\u2019s gonna get it. Can we start treating before the disease strikes?\u201d Kosik connected Tariot and Teiman with Dr. Lopera, who by that time had identified hundreds of people who carried the gene mutation, guaranteeing they would be struck with Alzheimer\u2019s in the prime of their lives. Reiman and Tariot traveled to Medellin and met with both healthy and sick members of the extended family. Lesley Stahl: Is this particular family, in the world-- extraordinary? Pierre Tariot: There\u2019s nothing else like it. The idea that there\u2019s this concentration within roughly 100 miles of each other is-- just an extraordinary phenomenon. And a perfect scientific laboratory. To lay the groundwork for a large clinical trial, Banner flew a group of extended family members from Medellin to Phoenix for PET scans.\u00a0 One goal: to compare the brains of those with and without the mutation years before any memory loss began, when they were in their 30s.\u00a0 Dr. Reiman showed us the results. Eric Reiman: This is somebody who doesn\u2019t have the gene. They have no plaques in the brain. But in members of the family with the mutation, it was a different story.\u00a0 \u00a0 Eric Reiman: Extensive amyloid deposition in the brain. Lesley Stahl: That\u2019s the red. Eric Reiman: Red is more amyloid. But yellow is also amyloid. This brain had even more. The images showed that amyloid plaques build up in the brain more than a decade before memory loss begins. So if a drug could remove that red and yellow, maybe the disease could be prevented.\u00a0 Banner developed a plan for a multimillion dollar drug trial and convened a meeting with leading scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and representatives of the NIH.\u00a0 Pierre Tariot: The end of the meeting, each scientist was allowed to say one closing thought. And Francisco had the last word. Lesley Stahl: Lopera? Pierre Tariot: And he paused a long time. And you could hear a pin drop in the room. Francisco Lopera: I said to them-- \u201cWe w-- the families are waiting for you.\u201d Lesley Stahl: They\u2019re waiting for you. Pierre Tariot: That\u2019s the point when, you know, the goose bumps came, and we said, \u201cWe really have to make this work. We really do.\u201d And they did.\u00a0 With a commitment of $15 million from NIH, another $15 million from philanthropists, and the rest from drug company Genentech, the trial -- on an immunotherapy drug to remove amyloid plaque -- enrolled its first patient three years ago, and they\u2019ve been enrolling more people ever since. \u00a0 Freddie: They told me about the study and I said yes. I\u2019ll go right away, and anything that you need it, I am here. Freddie and all his siblings signed up.\u00a0 The plan is to enroll a total of 300 members of the extended family who are healthy and have no memory loss yet -- 200 who have the mutation and another 100 who don\u2019t.\u00a0 That way, no one will learn their genetic status just by being accepted into the study. Of the 200 with the mutation, half will get injections of the drug; the other half will be injected with a harmless placebo.\u00a0 The study is double-blind: neither patients nor investigators will know who\u2019s getting what. They have to come in every two weeks, for at least five years -- long enough to see whether the group taking the drug does better than the group taking placebo. Final results aren\u2019t expected until 2021. Lesley Stahl: Is this the first time in all these years of seeing these patients that you can actually offer them hope? Dr. Lopera: Yes, this is the first time. Because in the past we only offer them education-- better quality of life but no hope to have a solution.\u00a0 And now they have hope, a big hope. Lesley Stahl: What would be the best outcome? Pierre Tariot: Nobody who receives the immunotherapy experiences any worsening of their thinking or memory ability. Doesn\u2019t change at all. Doesn\u2019t decline. That would be fabulous. That\u2019s a stretch goal. And that would be just the beginning. Claudia Kawas: If it makes a difference for them, I think there\u2019s a reasonable chance it could make a difference for all the rest of the people who get Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And that of course is the ultimate goal: to help prevent the late in life form of Alzheimer\u2019s that we\u2019re all susceptible to. The hope is that one day every one of us could be screened and when necessary, treated before problems begin.

The president-elect did not elaborate on his illegal voting claim. Clinton topped Trump by more than 2 million votes in the election, but her support was not distributed in key states. Trump captured more states and claimed victory in the Electoral College. As he has in post-election interviews, Trump said he would have campaigned differently if the popular determined the presidential winner. In a series of two tweets, Trump said \"it\u00a0would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College\" if he had focused on three or four big states rather than the 15-state strategy he employed against Clinton. \"I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" Trump tweeted. Trump's claim\u00a0of illegal voters drew derision. William Kristol , editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, said on Twitter: \"Every time you decide that maybe a Trump Administration could work out ok, you're reminded (as by his tweets today) of one obstacle: Trump.\" In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Nov 27, 2016 5:12 PM EST President-elect Donald Trump is alleging that he would have won the nation\u2019s popular vote if it weren\u2019t for the \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally,\u201d during a series of tweets in which he panned the recount efforts that could take place soon in three states . Mr. Trump expressed his feelings Sunday afternoon on the \u201cso-called popular vote\u201d on Twitter: In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-- \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 The president-elect has not provided any evidence for these claims. Mr. Trump won the electoral vote earlier this month by a wide margin, beating out Clinton with 290 votes compared to her 232. But according to the latest count by the Cook Political Report, which regularly updates its popular vote tally, Mr. Trump is currently losing that vote by over 2.2 million. The president-elect\u2019s tweetstorm comes as he continues to criticize the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein for her attempts to initiate vote audits in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Stein\u2019s vote recount efforts are motivated, in part, because of fears that illegal votes were cast for Trump due to hacking or other fraudulent activity. Earlier this weekend, the Clinton campaign announced it would participate in the recount effort in Wisconsin, where paperwork has already been filed, and would do the same in the other two states if they follow suit. The president-elect\u2019s latest claim seems to contradicts his previous assertions in the days immediately following the general election, when he called the contest \u201cvery open and successful.\u201d Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "By Philip Bump November 27 at 5:15 PM Follow @pbump Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Charleston, W.V., on May 5. (Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Something has clearly been gnawing at Donald Trump. Sure, he won the electoral vote and therefore the presidency, but he lost the popular vote by 2.2 million votes \u2014 and counting. (Counting mostly in California, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won easily and where there are 1.4 million more ballots to tally.) Trump's victory is marred by that fact: He will be the president, but more people voted against him. With news that Clinton's campaign would join the Green Party's Jill Stein to review ballots in key Midwestern states, Trump went on a Twitter tirade, dismissing Clinton's decision as hypocritical and that it would end with the same result . (\"Sad!\u201d he added.) That's probably true. But he couldn't resist taking the idea one step further in another tweet Sunday afternoon. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Clinton didn't really win the popular vote, he's arguing, because millions of votes were invalid. This is one in a series of efforts to dismiss Clinton's popular-vote victory, efforts that have hinged on misreading CNN election results or random tweets underpinned by no actual data. In fact, this claim that millions of illegal immigrants voted is itself the result of a random tweet. On Nov. 13, Gregg Phillips, a former Texas Health and Human Services Commission deputy commissioner, tweeted about there being 3 million votes that were cast by noncitizens. We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens. We are joining . @TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged \u2014 Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 13, 2016 Phillips claims in another tweet that his organization (it's not clear which organization, but it may be VoteStand ) has a database of 180 million voter registrations and he confirms that 3 million of the people in that database who voted are noncitizens. He has been asked to provide evidence for that claim repeatedly, without having done so. Regardless, the story was quickly picked up by the conspiracy-theory hawking site InfoWars , a story that was linked out at the top of the Drudge Report on Nov. 14. When Matt Drudge qualifies something with \u201cClaim:,\" it's worth treating it with skepticism. The rumor-debunking site Snopes looked at Phillips's claim and found no evidence for it. (It also noted that Phillips has a history of implying that Obamacare will lead to the registration of millions of immigrants here illegally.) Phillips replied on Twitter, \u201cOne might imagine someone would have called me.\u201d That's easier said than done; when I was looking at this earlier this month I couldn't find a way to contact Phillips. An email to True the Vote , a conservative group focused on the issue of voter fraud (for which Phillips claims to be a board member), did not receive a reply. Phillips has said that he will release evidence of his claims at some point in the future \u2014 but not to the media . As of writing, there simply isn't any data to that effect. What's more, Phillips made his claim on Nov. 13, only five days after the election. Meaning that his data apparently came in before any number of states certified their results. One of the first to do so was Vermont , which certified its results on Nov. 17 \u2014 four days after Phillips was able to determine that his 180-million-person database included the votes of 3 million immigrants here illegally. Republicans and Democrats react to the announcement that Hillary Clinton's campaign plans to join a vote recount in Wisconsin initiated by former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Paul Mitchell of the California voter data firm Political Data explained by phone that it was possible that Phillips's group piped numbers from early voting into its database. About 47 million people voted early , including about 5.2 million in California. Mitchell notes, though, that in the nation's largest state, only about 15 percent of the early votes cast were by Latinos, meaning that if Phillips's data suggests that most of the immigrants voting illegally are from Central and South America, nearly all of those early votes would have had to have been from illegal voters. This is a massive undertaking infrastructurally, it's worth noting, requiring reaching out to individual counties in every state. What's more, Phillips could have blown the whistle before Election Day if the numbers were early voting data. He didn't. But again: There's no evidence at this point that this is the case, and the only claim to the effect that it is comes from a person who refuses to provide any evidence. When PolitiFact analyzed it , it noted past studies claiming that large percentages of immigrants voted illegally \u2014 but that the study in question was based on flawed data. One examination of a database of voter fraud found 56 cases of noncitizens voting, over 11 years. The irony of Trump's claim about illegal immigrants, of course, is that one way to determine whether thousands of noncitizens voted in this election \u2014 for which, again, there's no evidence -- is through a recount and audit of ballots, the very thing he was criticizing Clinton for embracing. (He also didn't win the electoral vote in \u201ca landslide,\u201d by the way.) But this isn't rooted in logic. Trump has been complaining about the voting process for years, and apparently winning the presidency isn't going to change that. That's the broader point that's worth raising. The president-elect of the United States is willing to embrace unproven and highly questionable data to raise questions about the electoral process even after he won simply to soften the blow of losing the popular vote. Trump has repeatedly suggested, including in his Thanksgiving message, that the country must unite behind his presidency. Casting the votes of millions of Americans as somehow suspect seems like an odd way to achieve that goal. Anyway, there's also this: \u2014 Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 16, 2016 Okay. ",

    "text": "Hey Bears, is Ryan Pace still in charge? Photos of the Bears general manager Ryan Pace. Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog I\u2019ve been on vacation for a week and was expecting Bears titular general manager Ryan Pace to surface to explain this mess and what it means going forward. But no. He didn\u2019t he didn\u2019t come up for air. Publicly, at least. He didn\u2019t act like a GM who\u2019s in charge might act, and perhaps he\u2019s not. Maybe John Fox told him to stay hidden. Maybe the head coach actually is in charge of football operations. After all, Fox is the only one we\u2019ve heard from, and yeesh, has he ever sounded like a goof at times. Whatever happens with injuries and idiot players getting popped for performance-enhancing\u00a0drugs, here was Fox at his embarrassing worst: When asked why the Bears didn\u2019t run more against the Giants, Fox said the Giants had eight men in the box. When then asked why he didn\u2019t pass more, Fox said receivers were covered. Good game plan. Good adjustments. Good talk. Halas Hall Pass: Jay Cutler and the Bears QB situation The Tribune's Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell talk about Jay Cutler and the Bears' quarterback situation in this week's Halas Hall Pass.\u00a0 The Tribune's Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell talk about Jay Cutler and the Bears' quarterback situation in this week's Halas Hall Pass.\u00a0 See more videos Can you believe the Bears are paying this guy? Something has to change, or at least be answered for, and in theory the titular GM is the guy who can make those changes or provide those answers, although George McCaskey, the alleged driver of ownership\u2019s McClown car, could ask mom if she\u2019s \u201cpissed off\u2019\u2019 and maybe that would clear the tracks of this train wreck. Short of that, Pace was the person to find to answer for refusing to draft a quarterback, the inability to stock the roster with quality depth, the head coach\u2019s standing after a year of painful regression, the head coach\u2019s standing after choosing an ineffective offensive coordinator, the decision to dump such productive players as Martellus Bennett and Matt Slauson , and pages of injuries that might make you wonder about the team\u2019s sports science department or practice and training methods. So, because I\u2019m a pleaser, not a teaser, I checked around the city while on a week\u2019s vacation to see if I could find Pace. I went to O\u2019Hare to pick up my daughter on Tuesday, but I did not see him in United\u2019s baggage claim walking out of the concourse or, closer to what I was expecting, waiting there holding a sign with somone\u2019s name on it. When the season ends and the Bears get down to the business of evaluating not just what went wrong but how they can fix it, everything should be on the table. From the club's poor performance in the red zone \u2014 the Bears rank 23rd entering Sunday's game against the Titans \u2014 to how they tape ankles,...

(Brad Biggs) During a trip to Portillo\u2019s, the new one that opened on Lake-Cook Road in Deerfield, the woman taking my order said she had not seen him, but did I want hot or sweet peppers on that beef sandwich? On Wednesday, the woman working the register at Target didn\u2019t know who Pace was, and our waitress at Wildberry brought us more coffee and a box for the leftover Oreo S\u2019Mores pancakes (to die for, people). Thursday, Pace was not at our Thanksgiving dinner, nor was he at the Little Goat Diner on West Randolph Street on Friday evening, which is surprising when you consider the way the whole goat thing would fit him these days if, I don\u2019t know, such a thing as a Bears GM in fact existed. One last shot came Saturday, but Pace was not at Mio Caro, a restaurant on Wilson that apparently is BYOGM. Rich Campbell Marcus Mariota had graced the cover of Sports Illustrated four times before, so the attention was nothing new. But the fifth time was not like the others.

(Rich Campbell) So, maybe he doesn\u2019t really exist. Maybe he was just a\u00a0 hologram the Bears dragged out because a real-life GM like Phil Emery was too much of a joke. I didn\u2019t ask around Halas Hall because if such a person as this Pace character existed, he would\u2019ve surfaced there and addressed the disastrous state of the franchise and how he planned to change it, starting with the coach\u2019s future, the quarterback\u2019s future, everybody\u2019s future. But no. No dice. No Pace, presuming he actually exists as a carbon-based life form. If only this supposed Pace person were as good at making a football roster as he is at playing hide-and-seek. ",

During their third consecutive defeat that dropped their record to 2-9, the Bears were outplayed on both sides of the ball for much of the game before mounting a fourth-quarter comeback. Marcus Mariota was 15-for-23 for 226 yards and two touchdown passes for the Titans, who improved to 6-6 on the season. On the flipside, Matt Barkley\u2019s first NFL start ended in defeat before a crowd of 48,408 on the lakefront. Playing in place of injured starter Jay Cutler, Barkley was 28-for-53 for 316 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Key drops by Bears receivers didn\u2019t help Barkley\u2019s bid for his first career victory. The Bears took the lead in the game when Barkley found Daniel Brown for a 7-yard score late in the first quarter. But the Titans reeled off 27 consecutive points starting with a Derrick Henry 11-yard run to tie it.Mariota then hit Delanie Walker with a 4-yard TD pass and followed that with a 29-yard scoring strike to a diving Rishard Matthews. Ryan Succop then booted two field goals to extend the Titans\u2019 lead to 27-7. The Bears cut the deficit to 27-14 midway through to the fourth when Barkley connected with Marquess Wilson on an 8-yard TD pass. A Barkley to Deonte Thompson 6-yard TD pass got the Bears to within 27-21 but they couldn\u2019t finish off the comeback. \u2014 Chris Kuc ",

Trump, who himself implied that he would not concede the election during the campaign if he had lost, used his Twitter account to declare that \"Nothing will change.\" He also reiterated that Clinton had already conceded the election. Related: Clinton Campaign Backs Jill Stein's Election Recount Effort: Lawyer Trump, however, also effectively offered his own support for the recount, providing a seemingly baseless allegation that he would have won the popular vote \"if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" In another tweet, he said without evidence that there was \"serious voter fraud\" in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat charged with ensuring the state's vote goes smoothly, called Trump's claims \"absurd\" and \"reckless.\" \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,\" Padilla said in a statement tweeted on his personal account . \"His unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\" \u2014 Alex Padilla (@AlexPadilla4CA) November 28, 2016 It was unclear Sunday night where Trump got the ideas for his tweets or why he waited until Green Party Candidate Jill Stein's recount request in Wisconsin to raise the issue. Voting illegally is difficult, as Trump illustrated in a 2004 video in which he was turned away from three voting locations. It's hard to vote illegally. Trump himself was turned away from 3 polling places in 2004 b/c he wasn't on the rolls. https://t.co/tAW366jr7F \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) November 27, 2016 The president-elect said he could have had an easier campaign had he pursued the popular vote instead of the Electoral College. According to his Twitter account, the future commander-in-chief said he would have only had to campaign in three or four states instead of the numerous states he visited. It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-- \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 In the past, Trump has come out against the Electoral College. Previously, on Twitter of course, he called the institution \"a disaster for democracy.\" He also told Mitt Romney supporters via tweet in 2012 to \"fight like hell\" after Romney's loss, as he incorrectly believed the Electoral College had allowed President Obama to win. The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 President Obama won both the popular vote and the Electoral College by large margins in 2008 and 2012. Earlier Sunday, Trump directed his tweets at Clinton, quoting three instances via six tweets in which Clinton slammed Trump for suggesting he would not accept the election results. Hillary's debate answer on delay: \"That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free -- \u2014 Donald J.

Sad \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump was responding to the Clinton campaign's announcement that they intend to back the statewide presidential election recount effort taking place in Wisconsin, which was led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Marc Elias, a Clinton campaign lawyer, said they would involve themselves to ensure a \"fair\" process for all involved. Related: What Happens if Donald Trump Loses and Won't Concede? Stein said she also intends to pursue recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, though she also stated on Twitter that she would \"do a recount in any state where the deadline has not passed.\" I will do a recount in any state where the deadline has not passed.

Stein also took some shots at Clinton's interest in the election recount, tweeting: \"Why would Hillary Clinton \u2014 who conceded the election to Donald Trump \u2014 want #Recount2016 ? You cannot be on-again, off-again about democracy.\" Why would Hillary Clinton\u2014who conceded the election to Donald Trump\u2014want #Recount2016 ? You cannot be on-again, off-again about democracy. \u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 26, 2016 Donald Trump's top aides on Sunday also denounced the recount effort. \"It is a total and complete hypocritical joke that the group of people that thought that they were nervous about President-elect Trump not conceding are the people that are conducting recounts in states where we won by over 68,000 votes,\" said incoming Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also slammed the recount effort on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" where she referenced the backlash over Trump's refusal to say he'd accept the election results during the third general election debate as evidence of hypocrisy on the part of Democrats now supporting the recount. Multiple media analysts have opined that president-elect might be using his Twitter account to distract from more serious news, such as the New York Times investigation into Trump's potential conflicts of interest around the world.

    "text": "This year's Black Friday shoppers went online more \u2014 and spent less (Los Angeles Times) Shan Li Consumers increasingly turned online during the Black Friday weekend, boosting traffic during the crucial start of\u00a0the holiday shopping season. Nearly 109 million people shopped from their computers and mobile devices from Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, while about 99 million hit the sales in brick-and-mortar stores, according to a survey from the trade group National Retail Federation. That\u2019s compared to last year, when shoppers were more evenly split, with 103 million browsing online and 102 million in stores. \u201cThe story of the weekend was online increasing over in-store,\u201d said Pam Goodfellow, principal analyst at Prosper Insights and Analytics, which crunches data for the trade group. Some shoppers, of course, did both. That put the total number of shoppers during the four-day weekend at more than 154 million \u2014 up from 151 million in 2015, the survey said. Shoppers spent an average of $289.19, down from $299.60 last year, the survey said. Matthew Shay, chief executive of the trade group, said some promotions were steeper than in\u00a02015. This year, 36% of shoppers reported that all of their purchases were sale items; last year, 11% of consumers said so. The holiday season is vital to retailers, which can make up to 40% of their annual sales during that time. The National Retail Federation forecasts that sales during November and December will climb 3.6% to $655.8 billion, up slightly from the same period in 2015. Although Black Friday has evolved, it continues to be the biggest day of the year in terms of shopper traffic, according to a separate report from consumer analytics firm ShopperTrak. In-store visits dropped 1% over the two days of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, but that decline came from slower traffic on Turkey Day. \u201cWe found that Thanksgiving Day store openings were increasingly pulling shopper visits from Black Friday over the past few years,\u201d said Brian Field, senior director of advisory services for ShopperTrak. \u201cThis year, we saw a reversal of that trend, which can be attributed to several factors including fewer store openings on Thanksgiving Day, as well as online shopping.\u201d Field said that eight of the 10 biggest shopping days of the year have yet to come, including Super Saturday on Dec. 17. Retailers should get a boost from Christmas falling on a Sunday this year, Field said. The Friday before Christmas and the day after, which is a Monday, should also be top shopping days as well.

By Paul Kane November 27 at 6:36 PM Follow @pkcapitol President-elect Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud. As his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretary of state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton\u2019s tally of 64\u00a0million votes \u2014 more than 2\u00a0million beyond what he garnered \u2014 by suggesting without evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election. \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\u201d Trump tweeted late Sunday , one of more than 10\u00a0tweets on the recount issue. [ Fact Checker: Donald Trump\u2019s bogus claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton ] But Trump\u2019s embrace of the claim created even more instability around the election results from both ends of the political spectrum, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein leading calls among liberal activists for recounts in key battleground states to make sure voting fraud did not give the election to Trump. The charges and countercharges could present a highly toxic issue for the Justice Department, including Sen. Jeff Sessions \u00ad(R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, whose tenure, if confirmed, comes amid a long-running battle over renewal of the Voting Rights Act. The two parties are already locked in fights over ballot access, with Republicans advocating ID requirements and other limitations that Democrats say are aimed at suppressing the votes of minorities and others more likely to vote Democratic. Trump spent the Thanksgiving weekend out of the public spotlight, holed up inside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and continuing his private deliberations about building the next administration. Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now senior adviser to the transition team, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump and President Obama spoke by phone for about 45\u00a0minutes on Saturday, the latest in a series of conversations the two men have had since the bitter campaign concluded. Conway also led a remarkable rear-guard attack on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a possible secretary of state, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor was disloyal to Trump and should not be considered for the post. The remarks highlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whether Romney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment or instead whether a loyalist such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should get the nod. Rather than referee that dispute, however, Trump\u2019s only public proclamations came over Twitter \u2014 his favorite means of communication \u2014 beginning at 7:19\u00a0a.m. Sunday, when he lambasted the Clinton campaign for agreeing to take part in a recount of votes in Wisconsin spearheaded by Stein. \u201cHillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump then composed five tweets quoting parts of Clinton\u2019s responses at the third presidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator Chris Wallace that he would \u201ckeep you in suspense\u201d rather than outright promise to accept the election results. At the debate, Clinton had called Trump\u2019s answer \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201ca direct threat to our democracy.\u201d On Saturday, Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias said Clinton\u2019s advisers had been monitoring voting patterns in critical states to see whether there were any signs of foul play, particularly in the wake of hacking of emails at the Democratic National Committee and of senior campaign officials earlier this year. Elias wrote that no evidence of wrongdoing had emerged in their preliminary review. But once Stein\u2019s campaign formally started the recount process in Wisconsin, Elias said Clinton\u2019s campaign would join the effort even if her top advisers did not expect the outcome to change in any of the Midwestern states that tipped the electoral college balance to Trump. \u201cWe had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\u201d he said. Clinton\u2019s campaign plans to do the same if Stein, who has raised more than $5\u00a0million to help fund the recounts, follows through on plans to ask for the same process in Michigan and Pennsylvania. The total margin in those three states was 107,000 votes out of nearly 13.8\u00a0million cast, with a combined 46\u00a0electoral votes among them \u2014 enough to give the race to Clinton had she won those three battlegrounds. Clearly irritated by losing the popular vote, Trump suggested that the math to getting to the 270-vote margin in the electoral college made him come up short. \u201cIt would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited,\u201d he tweeted. Meanwhile, the extraordinary feud over his pick for secretary of state hit a fevered pitch when Conway took to three Sunday television shows to attack Romney\u2019s credentials to be the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidants who are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence the \u00adpresident-elect\u2019s decision. Romney\u2019s supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents \u2014 Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trump loyalists \u2014 have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt. Those opposed to Romney have been advocating Trump to reward Giuliani with the secretary of state position, stressing his loyalty vs. Romney\u2019s refusal to publicly say whom he voted for in the presidential race. \u201cI don\u2019t think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position,\u201d Conway said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d suggesting Romney went too far in questioning Trump\u2019s character and intellect during the presidential race. \u201cThere was the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.\u201d The Conway offensive, which began Thursday on Twitter and continued in her three appearances Sunday, led the echo chamber of opposition to the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich said most Trump supporters could not countenance Romney\u2019s selection for any high-profile posting in Trump\u2019s new administration. \u201cI think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority,\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News. Others inside Trump\u2019s orbit, particularly Vice President-elect Mike Pence, are viewed as Romney supporters, believing he has a steady hand that would benefit Trump in the turbulent world of diplomacy, according to people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also has a long-standing relationship with Romney since he served as Republican National Committee chairman during Romney\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid. Infighting over such a prominent position is not unusual. Four years ago, President Obama faced internal division over his choice to succeed Clinton as secretary of state, with one possibility being Susan E. Rice, who had been a longtime Obama confidant. Senate Democrats preferred their colleague, John F. Kerry, and eventually Obama made Rice his national security adviser and gave Kerry the State Department. However, that internal Democratic feud played out in the traditional Washington manner \u2014 behind closed doors and in anonymous background quotes to news outlets. Today\u2019s Republican battle has been carried out in an unusually public fashion that left some old Washington hands stunned and wondering whether this would be the new normal over the next four years. \u201cI have never, ever, seen any aide to a POTUS or PEOTUS publicly try and box the boss in like this. Extraordinary,\u201d David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns, wrote on Twitter, using the acronyms for president and president-elect. Axelrod later questioned whether Conway was assigned the job of trashing Romney, or else it was an \u201cunbelievable breach\u201d for a staffer to do so while Trump was still making his choice.

    "text": "Syria Forces Advancing in Aleppo, Sending Hundreds Fleeing By PATRICK REEVELL Nov 27, 2016, 5:19 PM ET 0 Shares Star GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images Syrian pro-government forces inspect an area in the Masaken Hanano district in eastern Aleppo, Nov. 27, 2016, a day after they reseized it from rebel fighters. 0 Shares Email Russia's military said today that Syrian government troops have pressed into rebel-held areas of the besieged city of Aleppo, as a two week-long offensive there grinds forward, sending hundreds of civilians fleeing and appearing to push rebel defenders closer to defeat. Syrian state-controlled media announced that troops loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad had seized two keys neighbourhood in the city, threatening to split the rebel-held east of the city into two parts. Syrian troops captured the Jabal Badro neighborhood a day after they took another, Hanano, bringing them close to being able to drive a wedge that would separate the southern areas held by rebels from those they control in the north, the BBC reported. Russia's defense ministry said Syrian government troops had taken Hanano, as well as four other neighborhoods. Journalists in Aleppo reported that shelling and airstrikes were hammering rebel defenses in new areas and that hundreds of civilians were fleeing the government advances, moving to the regime-controlled West the city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a UK-based group that monitors the conflict, said 500 civilians had fled the rebel-held east of the city over the weekend; Russia's military claimed more than 900 had left from one area alone. The Observatory said 219 civilians had died since the offensive began, including 27 children. \"Thing in eastern Aleppo very, very bad,\" Khaled Khatib, a photographer for the White Helmets group that rescues people in Syria from buildings collapsed by airstrikes, wrote on Twitter. \"Aleppo will die,\" he wrote. The government gains bring the Assad regime another step closer to re-taking Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city, the eastern part of which has been held by rebels since 2012 and which has been under siege for months. Around 275,000 people are trapped in the city, according to the UN, living under daily government bombing and enduring acute shortages of food and medical supplies. Backed by heavy Russian air strikes, government forces along with fighters from Lebanon and Iran have encircled the eastern part of the city and are now tightening the noose, breaking through rebel front lines and taking areas controlled by the opposition since 2012. A mixture of more moderate opposition groups are fighting alongside radical jihadists militants to try to halt the advance. On Sunday, opposition groups said government troops were now moving on the Sakhur neighborhood, which if it falls would cut the rebel-held zone in two. Yasser al-Youssef, from the rebel group Nour al-Din al-Zenki, told AFP that opposition fighters were shoring up defenses in the area. \"We are strengthening our positions to defend the city and residents, but the aircraft are destroying everything methodically, area by area,\" he said. Eastern Aleppo has been under total siege since late summer and residents are now living in increasingly dire conditions, with food and medical supplies running out. A week ago, the World Health Organization said the last hospitals in Aleppo had been forced to stop operating after they were bombed. The UN, which was last able to distribute rations on November 13, has pleaded to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to the city, but has been refused by the Syrian government. Asked by reporters if there was any Plan B if the aid was not resumed, a UN relief adviser, Jan Egeland, said: \"In many ways Plan B is that people starve.\" Egeland said that must not happen. The fall of Aleppo would be a major victory for Assad and his ally Russia, whose intervention in September last year has pulled the Syrian president's regime back from the brink of collapse. Since November, Russia has intensified its bombing campaign across Syria, as the government has appeared increasingly emboldened. Efforts by the U.S. to broker ceasefires for Aleppo fell apart in September and Moscow and the Assad regime appear determined to retake the city, despite protests from Western countries that they are committing war crimes by indiscriminately bombing civilians and targeting hospitals. The Obama administration has warned Russia no military victory is possible in Syria, but Assad has repeatedly said he will take back all areas of the country. A representative of an opposition group that Moscow backs in now stalled peace negotiations, said no further talks were possible until Aleppo had been retaken. Qadri Jamil, a member of the so-called Moscow-Astana Opposition, which contains former Syrian government figures and closely follows Russia's public positions on the conflict, said he expected the city to fall before the end of the year. The UN has condemned the government offensive, with the head of its emergency relief program, Stephen O'Brien saying the bombardments were exceptional in their brutality. \"Let me be clear: we are not just seeing a resumption of violence in Aleppo, this is not business as usual,\" O\u2019Brien said in a statement last week. \"What has been unleashed on civilians this past week is yet another low in an unrelenting inhuman onslaught.\" 0 Shares ",

(Associated Press) \u201cIn addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\u201d \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 27 Angered by demands for a recount in the three states that gave him an electoral college victory, President-elect Donald Trump made a bold but unsubstantiated assertion in a tweet \u2014 that \u201cmillions of people\u201d voted illegally in the presidential election. He suggested they voted for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who now leads in the popular vote by 2.2 million votes, and thus he actually also won the popular vote. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Winning the electoral college is all that counts in the presidential race. But losing the popular vote by such a substantial margin apparently gnaws at Trump . Is there any basis for his claim? The Facts The simple answer is no. This is a bogus claim with no documented proof. Our colleagues at Snopes.com and PundiFact have already examined this claim, back when it was hot in the right-wing blogosphere, not a statement made by a future U.S. president. The whole thing started with a few tweets by Gregg Phillips, a self-described conservative voter fraud specialist. Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team. \u2014 Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 11, 2016 We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens. We are joining . @TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged \u2014 Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 13, 2016 These claims were then picked up by such purveyors of false facts as Infowars.com , a conspiracy-minded website that, among other things, claims that no one actually died in a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn . One article described Phillips as being affiliated with VoterFraud.org but in reality he says he is the founder of VoteStand.com, supposedly an app that detects vote fraud. Phillips also has claimed that Obamacare is the \u201cbiggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world\u201d because it provided opportunities for voter registration. In any case, Phillips made this claim \u2014 and then has declined to provide any evidence to back it up, even though reporters have asked: ",

GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images Syrian pro-government forces walk past damaged houses in eastern Aleppo, near Masaken Hanano, on November 23. GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images In the Syrian city of Aleppo, forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad have established full control of the largest rebel-held district, Masaken Hanano, according to Syria's state news agency. The government fighters are moving to take back the battered eastern side of Aleppo that has been largely under rebel control since 2012. NPR's Alison Meuse reports Assad's forces are \"pressing to split the besieged side of Aleppo in two.\" The BBC said , \"Syrian forces regained [Masaken Hanano] on Saturday \u2014 a move making it easier for them to isolate the northern districts of east Aleppo from the southern ones.\" Alison reports: \"A Syrian rebel spokesman confirmed the advances and said he anticipated a regime push to capture the adjacent districts, and sever the siege in two.\" On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported airstrikes on those area. NPR is working to confirm reports that a second rebel-held district may have fallen to government forces. Article continues after sponsorship After Rocky Pause, Airstrikes Resume On Syria's Aleppo Earlier this month, the Syrian government renewed its offensive to take back the besieged eastern half of Aleppo, where more than 250,000 civilians \u2014 desperate for food and supplies \u2014 have been trapped for months. The government forces have tried to cut off supply lines to rebel-held parts of the city. The BBC wrote that capturing the entire city of Aleppo \"would be a major victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after six and a half years of conflict.\" Capturing Masaken Hanano is an important strategic and symbolic victory for the government forces. Alison says: Masaken Hanao was the first district the rebels captured when they launched their Aleppo offensive in 2012. At the time, they vowed to take the whole city. But after four years of brutal stalemate, Assad's forces have managed to encircle the rebel-held side of the city\u2014which the UN says is home to a quarter of a million people. Only a trickle of families have managed to escape the siege and local residents say they're paying $500 a person to flee. Since government forces took control of Masaken Hanano, more than 400 people fled to the regime-held area overnight, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ",

Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump's consulted the president on his Cuba policy and the two spoke this weekend. \"He's even been talking to President Obama. You know, beyond the sit-down they had 30 hours or so after President-elect Trump won the election, they've been talking regularly on any number of issues. They talked just yesterday,\" she said. The latest conversation went on about 40-45 minutes, she said, though she wouldn't offer details on what was discussed. But the two \"get along nicely,\" Conway added, despite their differences. A Trump transition team official later told NBC News that the president-elect and his predecessor have spoken several times since they met in the Oval Office two weeks ago. \"I can tell you from President-elect Trump's side that he very much enjoys speaking with President Obama, talking about the serious issues that face this country and the world,\" Conway said. \"They get along nicely. They disagree on many things. That's not going to change.\" In response, the White House would only refer to previous comments made by press secretary Josh Earnest noting that the Trump and Obama have talked since the first Oval Office meeting \u2014 and a desire to keep those conversations private.

Conway also suggested Trump was disinclined to pursue an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use, despite the fact that \"lock her up\" was a rallying cry for his supporters on the campaign trail. \"He said he wouldn't rule it out,\" Conway said on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" referencing Trump's recent sit-down with the New York Times, but \"he said it's not his focus right now.\" During her interview on CNN, Conway also wouldn't rebut reporting from the Washington Post, confirmed by sources to NBC News, that Trump has received only two intelligence briefings since the election and turned down others. Asked outright if he'd turned briefings down, Conway replied: \"I can't discuss that publicly.\" Related: Donald Trump Has Attended Only Two Intelligence Briefings \"What I can tell you is that he is the most engaged individual I've ever met, and brilliant to boot, and he is certainly availing himself of the information that is provided to him from a number of sources, including those intelligence briefings,\" she added. Conway insisted Trump is receiving \"a steady stream of information\" to prepare him to become commander-in-chief, including dozens of meetings he's held with elected officials and business leaders over the past few weeks as he's been interviewing candidates for his cabinet. One particular cabinet slot has taken center stage as a handful of contenders have waged a behind-the-scenes battle for the position. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former UN Ambassador John Bolton, among others, are all reportedly under consideration for secretary of state, but Romney in particular has faced public opposition from Conway and other Trump loyalists who believe his fierce criticism of the president-elect during the campaign disqualifies him. Related: Mitt Romney Lays Out Scathing Critique of Donald Trump Conway has made no secret of her concerns with Romney, tweeting out veiled critiques and going even further in television interviews. Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Conway insisted that \"I'm not campaigning against anyone. I'm just a concerned citizen.\" But she then went on to warn that Romney's consideration for the position has some feeling \"betrayed,\" noting the former Massachusetts governor still hasn't publicly said who he voted for, and aggressively criticized Trump during the presidential campaign. \"People feel betrayed to think that Governor Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump, now our president-elect, would be given the most significant cabinet post of all, Secretary of State,\" she said, adding she's simply reflecting what she's hearing from the \"grassroots.\" In another appearance, however, on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Conway did acknowledge that it wasn't \"wrong to say\" that she has personal concerns with Romney. Conway continued: \"I'm all for party unity, but i'm not sure that we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position.\" Romney infamously called Trump a \"phony, a fraud\" and unfit for the presidency during the GOP primary. But the two met last week and Romney has emerged as a leading contender for the secretary of state position. Alexandra Jaffe ",

One person who spoke with Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend said the president-elect had appeared to be preoccupied by suggestions that a recount might be started, even as his aides played down any concerns. Another friend said Mr. Trump felt crossed by Mrs. Clinton, who he believed had conceded the race and accepted the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team\u2019s general counsel, said the campaign would participate in Ms. Stein\u2019s recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result, partly out of a sense of duty to the millions who voted for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states \u2014 Michigan \u2014 well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount,\u201d Mr. Elias said, noting that Clinton campaign officials had found no \u201cactionable evidence\u201d of hacking or attempts to tamper with the vote. Late Sunday night, Mr. Elias responded on Twitter to Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations, writing , \u201cWe are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn\u2019t ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud.\u201d In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22,177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10,704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70,638 votes. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides echoed his concerns about the recount effort in appearances on Sunday morning television news programs. Ms. Conway, who was his campaign manager, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Mrs. Clinton and her campaign advisers would have to decide \u201cwhether they\u2019re going to be a bunch of crybabies.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for the debate over Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway, echoing comments she posted last week on Twitter, made clear that she opposed choosing Mr. Romney as secretary of state. \u201cThere was the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement, and then there was Gov. Mitt Romney,\u201d she said on ABC. During the primaries, Mr. Romney called Mr. Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d Ms. Conway said it was important for Mr. Trump to seek to unify the Republican Party by making gestures to those who opposed his candidacy. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think the cost of party unity has to be the secretary of state position.\u201d Moments after appearing on the show, Ms. Conway, who is under consideration to be Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, wrote on Twitter that she had told Mr. Trump her opinion privately, \u201cand I\u2019ll respect his decision.\u201d On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d she said people felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the idea that Mr. Romney could get a top cabinet job. \u201cI\u2019m not campaigning against anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just a concerned citizen.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if he voted for Donald Trump,\u201d she added.

Early in the campaign, Trump said he supported Obama's policy on Cuba, but he retreated later, saying he would reverse Obama's executive orders and concessions until freedom is restored in Cuba. For Arturo L\u00f3pez-Levy, who formerly worked with the Cuban government, it's important to see what course the United States takes once Trump is sworn in. But \"I don't think the death of Castro will alter the pace of the reform,\" said L\u00f3pez-Levy, a Cuba expert and lecturer in political science at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley. L\u00f3pez-Levy expects significant change to begin when Raul Castro, 85, steps down, which he has said he will do in 2018. Although various names have been floated around as potential successors, most analysts agree that the likely next leader of Cuba will be First Vice President Miguel Mario Diaz-Canel, who's 56. \"The clock is ticking to pass the presidency to a new generation,\" L\u00f3pez-Levy said.

(George Ourfalian / AFP/Getty Images) Nabih Bulos There may be little common ground among Syria's fractious opposition groups, but they have long agreed that the country's largest city, Aleppo, is vital to their plans to overthrow the government of President Bashar Assad . With the city divided between the government and the opposition since 2012, its eastern neighborhoods emerged as the rebels\u2019 most important bastion, and a full takeover was to be the launchpad for a victorious march to the capital, Damascus, almost 200\u00a0miles to the southwest. But  Sunday, that scenario appeared more remote than ever, as pro-government troops expanded their hold on vital sections of eastern Aleppo, burrowing farther into the rebels\u2019 enclave even as thousands of civilians escaped into government-controlled areas to flee the violence, state media and opposition activists said. A day earlier, the Syrian army announced that it had seized a key neighborhood on the outskirts of the city\u2019s eastern flank, 13 days into an all-out government offensive to finish off the rebels. The takeover carried symbolic weight -\u00a0 the neighborhood, the Hanano Housing district, was the first to fall to the rebels in 2012.\u00a0 A damaged mosque and buildings in eastern Aleppo, Syria, are seen in a picture provided by the official Syrian Arab News Agency on Nov. 27, 2016.

(SANA / European Pressphoto Agency) But it was also the beachhead from which government troops, on Sunday, were able to consolidate their control on the nearby neighborhood of Jabal Badro, according to SANA, the state news agency. Pro-government activists on social media reported troops also breached three adjacent neighborhoods. Later on Sunday, SANA reported the army had established fire control over the Hellok and Sakhour districts, which lie on the front line separating rebel areas from government-controlled parts of western Aleppo. The move effectively split the rebel enclave in two, while a ferocious rocket barrage pummeled other opposition areas near the center of the city. Even as troops advanced from the east, the Quds Brigade, a Palestinian paramilitary group fighting alongside the government in Aleppo, advanced on the besieged rebels\u2019 northeastern flank, according to the group\u2019s official account on social media. Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitor based in Britain with a network of activists in Syria, acknowledged the government\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In recent months, a large-scale campaign, backed by Russian air power and thousands of Shiite militiamen from Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, established a punishing siege on the estimated 250,000 residents living in the rebel enclave. Despite several counteroffensives, the rebels failed to punch through government lines.\u00a0 As the rebels retreated deeper into their enclave, thousands of civilians escaped to government-controlled areas through Hanano. State media said the armed forces had \u201csecured the exit\u201d of 1,500 people. The \u00a0Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number at 4,000, saying that an additional 6,000 had made their way to Sheikh Maqsoud, a northern Aleppo neighborhood controlled by a Kurdish militia, which has forged an uneasy alliance with the government in the area.

(George Ourfalian / AFP/Getty Images) Syrian state television beamed images of uniformed fighters running through thoroughfares near an important mosque in Hanano, as well as video of ragged-looking civilians riding on buses provided by the government to shelter areas in western Aleppo.\u00a0 In recent weeks, the government, along with its ally, Russia, had opened up humanitarian corridors for eastern Aleppo residents during unilaterally imposed cease-fires.\u00a0 Rebels who laid down their arms were promised an amnesty allowing them to return to government areas. Those who refused could take their personal weapons and receive passage to join other rebels in the opposition-held province of Idlib, west of Aleppo.\u00a0 In one bizarre initiative, the government even invited east Aleppo residents to a \u201cfriendly soccer game\u201d as a way to build confidence. Despite the government repeatedly exhorting the rebels through leaflets and phone messages to abandon their positions inside the city \u201cbefore it was too late,\u201d very few heeded its call.\u00a0 Instead, rebels shelled the checkpoints the government had set up to receive those who left. Meanwhile, the  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported gunfire near the rebel side of the passageways, and said it had prevented roughly 100 families from leaving. It did not specify who had fired the weapons. The government said the rebels had prevented civilians from escaping, and accused them of using residents as human shields. On Nov. 19, the U.N. special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, proposed that the government stop its offensive after more hard-line Islamist elements inside the city leave their positions, while the opposition\u2019s administrative bodies continue managing the city. Damascus refused, effectively sidelining the U.N.\u2019s political efforts in Aleppo, said regional expert Mouin Rabbani, a former member of the envoy\u2019s staff. \u201cI think it's fair to say that the U.N. under De Mistura's stewardship has been reduced to an incoherent spectator,\u201d Rabbani said in an interview from Amman on Sunday. \u201c[It] has largely forsaken its political role and responsibilities to focus on humanitarian issues.\u201d The speed of the opposition\u2019s fall in eastern Aleppo surprised pro-opposition activists, who accused the rebels on social media of betraying residents there. Commentators on Syrian television, meanwhile, exulted in what they said was an impending victory of the government. Pro-government activists, meanwhile, quoted a statement from what they called a \u201csecurity source\u201d in the army\u2019s operations room in Aleppo. \u201cWhoever thinks for one moment that the army and its allies will renege on their goal to liberate all of Aleppo city is delusional,\u201d said the source. \u201cThis is a final decision and there is no turning back from it.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 27, 2016, 12:45 PM Veterans protest Hampshire College decision to stop flying U.S. flag A worker takes down a flag at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., in 2006. CBS Boston Email Last Updated Nov 27, 2016 3:34 PM EST AMHERST, Mass. -\u00a0Veterans protested Sunday at a western Massachusetts college facing criticism from around the country for its decision to stop flying U.S. flags after students allegedly burned a flag in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election. Dozens of veterans and other demonstrators held American flags and chanted \u201cU.S.A.\u201d at Hampshire College in Amherst on Sunday, in what organizers called a \u201cpeaceful demonstration of freedom.\u201d Local veterans and others intended to place hundreds of U.S. flags on the streets around the college. College officials decided to indefinitely stop flying flags earlier this month after the main flag in the center of campus was burned after students lowered the banner to half-staff. Officials replaced the flag, but it was lowered again. School officials say they welcome peaceful discussions about the flag decision. In a statement about their decision to remove the flag, college officials said: \u201cThis decision is not and was never a commentary on the presidential election.\u201d Clarifying the statement, Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash told CBS Boston he knows it\u2019s a controversial decision to remove the flag, but he wanted to create a dialogue among those with differing opinions about the symbol. \u201cThere were a range of views on campus, including people whose experience growing up have made the flag a symbol of fear, which was strengthened by the toxic language during the campaign, and people for whom the flag is the symbol of all that\u2019s best throughout the country,\u201d said Lash. He said the trouble started with a gesture meant to help provoke \u201cmeaningful and respectful dialogue\u201d on campus\u2013a stance he outlined in a\u00a0 post on the college\u2019s Facebook page . In that post, he said the Board of Trustees decided to fly the flag at half-staff due to the \u201cenvironment of escalating hate-based violence\u201d in the wake of the election. Lash said the gesture was also meant to be an \u201cexpression of grief\u201d over deaths around the world, including those of U.S. service members. But, the move didn\u2019t work as planned and many\u2013especially veterans and families of veterans in the Hampshire College family\u2013saw it as being disrespectful of the tradition of expressing mourning on a national level. \u201cFrankly, doing that, it didn\u2019t help,\u201d he said. \u201cFlying the flag at half-mast just created more controversy.\u201d On Veterans Day, someone removed the flag and burned it. \u201cIn the middle of the night, we have no idea who did it or even why,\u201d said Lash. So that\u2019s why they decided to take down the U.S. flag\u2013and all flags\u2013on campus. \u201cThe flag had become a heated symbol that was making that more difficult,\u201d Lash said. \u201cWe really feel our community needs a conversation in which both sides listen to each other, and we wish the nation would have that kind of dialogue. We felt that if we could stop arguing about the symbol, we could get to the underlying issues.\u201d Of course, that decision has created even more backlash, and Lash said there \u201ccertainly is\u201d a lot of anger about the decision. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 While President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team huddle privately to pick their administration\u2019s secretary of state, top adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday made a repeated, public case against deciding on Mitt Romney. Conway says she will support whomever Trump picks, but continues to argue that the grass-roots supporters who backed his improbable victory feel let down about Romney, considering he called Trump a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d \"People feel betrayed to think that \u2026 Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump \u2026 would be given the most significant Cabinet post of all,\u201d Conway said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\u201d Trump, a Republican, and his team of advisers appear to be split on whether Trump should pick Romney, a former GOP presidential nominee, or former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, an early Trump loyalist. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d downplayed rumors over vicious infighting over who will lead the State Department, saying that Trump's \"going to make the best decision for the American people.\u201d However, Conway, openly talking outside the confines of transition headquarters in New York\u2019s Trump Tower, suggests a clear divide. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 \u201cWe don't even know if (Romney) voted for Donald Trump,\u201d Conway said in a separate interview Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe and his consultants were nothing but awful to Donald Trump for a year \u2026 \"I'm all for party unity. But I'm not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position. I think there are concerns that those of us that are loyal have, and we want a secretary of state who's loyal to the president.\" This is not the first time that Conway, who emerged late in the White House race to lead the Trump campaign to victory, has made her thoughts known about Romney. On Thursday, she tweeted: \u201cReceiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state.\u201d On Sunday, Conway, now a senior adviser for the Trump transition team, said on Twitter that she has privately expressed her thoughts to Trump and that she\u2019ll respect his decision. However, the larger \u201cpoint is the volume & intensity of grass-roots resistance to Romney is breathtaking,\u201d she also tweeted. Advertisement ",

    "text": "How Does The Electoral College Work, And Is It Fair? Trump currently has 290 Electoral College votes according to the Associated Press, well more than the 270 he needs to win the presidency. That total is expected to grow when Michigan certifies its vote on Monday. Trump leads in that state by more than 10,000 votes and the state's 16 Electoral College votes would push Trump's total over 300. Trump started tweeting on Sunday amid a push for recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Those states essentially delivered Trump victory in the presidential election, as they had made up the Democrats' so-called \"blue wall\" \u2014 industrial states that secured victories for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Trump's tweets over the weekend have both criticized the calls for recounts in the three key industrial states he won, while simultaneously raising questions about the integrity of the vote nationwide. Trump tweeted another claim without evidence on Sunday evening, regarding voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California \u2014 all states Clinton won. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla responded with a statement: \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\" As the recount proceeds in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton's legal team will participate, citing concerns from supporters over the integrity of the vote, though the campaign says it has not seen any evidence to support those concerns. Jill Stein told NPR that she does not expect the outcome to change. Trump's margins in the states in question measure in the tens of thousands. Recounts have generally only had an impact on the result of an election when the margins are in the range of several hundred. Stein and Clinton's teams cited concerns over the integrity of voting systems, which Trump himself discussed during the campaign. He would often say that the only way he could lose would be if the election was \"stolen\" and Clinton called Trump's remark in a debate that he might not accept the results if he lost \"horrifying.\" Clinton conceded the race to Trump in the early morning hours of Nov. 9 and gave a speech later that day declaring, \"Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" The former Democratic nominee is not pulling back from that position, and her campaign is trying to distinguish between its decision to have legal representatives participate in the Wisconsin recount and actually promoting it, which the campaign says it has not done. \"Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\" Marc Elias, the general counsel for Clinton's campaign, wrote on Saturday . But Elias also said the campaign had received \"hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton.\" No evidence has emerged to support those claims. Wisconsin granted the request for a recount on Friday. It's expected to start at some point this week. It will have to be completed by Dec. 13, in compliance with federal law that requires any recounts to be finished 35 days after the election. In Wisconsin, the request came from Stein and independent candidate Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, and they will have to cover the costs of the recount. Stein has raised more than $6 million in support of these efforts. The deadline to formally request a recount in Pennsylvania, where Trump had his biggest margin of victory of the three states in question, is Monday. Michigan appears to be Trump's closest margin of victory, and the state is set to certify the results at 2 p.m. ET on Monday, and then a request for a recount must be submitted by Wednesday. ",

The U.S. severed ties with Cuba in\u00a01961\u00a0in opposition to Castro's communist regime. President Obama announced in December 2014 that he had ordered the full restoration of diplomatic ties to Cuba. In March, he\u00a0became the first president in more than 50 years to visit the island nation. The U.S. still has an economic embargo against Cuba that only a vote of Congress can lift. Trump didn't mention the embargo in his comments following the death of former Cuban president Fidel Castro nor has he been specific about how he would reverse Obama's diplomatic overtures. Former Trump campaign director Kellyanne Conway said on \u00a0ABC's\u00a0This Week with George Stephanopoulos that Trump is \"open to researching and, in fact, resetting relations with Cuba.\" Castro dominated the Sunday morning talk shows, and\u00a0politicians showed\u00a0less space between them on the dictator's legacy than most any\u00a0issue in the news lately. Senator Ted Cruz, R-TX, is shown during a November 2016 conference in Washington, DC. \u00a0(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) Republican politicians with Cuban heritage reiterated their disdain for Castro and all he stood for. \"This ought to be a moment where Cubans are dancing in the street because they\u2019re being liberated, but instead ... if you dance in the street, you\u2019re going to be thrown in jail,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on This Week. \"Cuba is not a free society.\" Obama: History will judge Castro's impact on Cuba, world Cruz said his father, aunt and her two closest friends in high school were all imprisoned and tortured under Castro, adding, \"and what they did to girls in Cuban prisons was \u2014\u00a0was unspeakable.\" To avoid any doubt about where he stands on Castro, Cruz said he is not going \"to be one of those people romanticizing him as a hero.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban-American, made similar remarks on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. He didn't, however, say he'd support undoing\u00a0\u00a0Obama's efforts\u00a0to normalize relations between the two countries. \"I'm just against\u00a0unilateral changes from which we get nothing in return for our country or for the freedom or liberty of the Cuban people,\" Rubio said.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Mr. Antonio\u2019s combination of jobs \u2014 he is a business partner with Mr. Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the president-elect \u2014 is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table. Advertisement Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged \u201ca separation\u201d from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years\u2019 time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial , prompting criticism from the Obama administration. Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America\u2019s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite. \u201cIt is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,\u201d said Michael J. Green , who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department. Continue reading the main story The Trump Brand Around the World Donald J. Trump has business interests in at least 20 countries, in addition to extensive hotel and real estate holdings in the United States, according to an analysis of his financial disclosure report . Each dot represents a city where he has at least one enterprise. The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What\u2019s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders. In an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business \u2014 and his family\u2019s ability to keep it running after he takes office. \u201cI\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it.\u201d In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings. \u201cVetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies. In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake \u2014 is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India \u2014 where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America \u2014 are being built through companies with family ties to India\u2019s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans. In Ireland and Scotland , executives from Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail\u2019s habitat \u2014 a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States. And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump\u2019s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan \u2014 suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup \u2014 the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests. Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It\u2019s two.\u201d These tangled ties already have some members of Congress \u2014 including at least one Republican representative \u2014 calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them. \u201cYou rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,\u201d Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. \u201cIf you have contracts w/foreign govts, it\u2019s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story David J. Kramer , who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump\u2019s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency \u2014 and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad. \u201cThis will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president\u2019s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials. \u201cThe working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,\u201d said Michael H. Fuchs , who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cThey will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies. Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president? What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization\u2019s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders \u2014 of Turkey, Argentina and Japan \u2014 having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide. Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause , appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels. \u201cI mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in. \u201cLet\u2019s listen and not prejudge,\u201d said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI want to see what he does as president.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Trump\u2019s project in Rio de Janeiro. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a Brazilian federal prosecutor, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. Credit Lianne Milton for The New York Times BRAZIL Nation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect\u2019s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish 171-room beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a 4,000-square-foot nightclub. \u201cThis is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time. But just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the president-elect in their dealings in Latin America\u2019s largest country. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds \u2014 Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State \u2014 put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra. Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil\u2019s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries. But Brazil\u2019s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades. The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic. The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of \u201chighly suspicious\u201d potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. \u201cIt is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,\u201d Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October. In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies. Mr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil\u2019s 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently. In a statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Alan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company \u2014 given that it does not own the hotel \u2014 and \u201chas no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.\u201d The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Serra, Brazil\u2019s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect. Even if Brazil\u2019s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent. \u201cBrazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that\u2019s about all they can do,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Trump Tower Mumbai is one of five Trump Organization projects in India, a country where connections between developers and officials are common. Credit Asmita Parelkar for The New York Times INDIA Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles On the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing. In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state\u2019s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization\u2019s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed. The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump\u2019s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were \u201crequesting a concession that could not be given.\u201d By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,\u201d Mr. Chavan said. Kalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai , the Trump Organization\u2019s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor. \u201cThe notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,\u201d Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. \u201cThe Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.\u201d This example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians \u2014 officially or unofficially \u2014 to push projects through the bureaucracy. Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats \u201cwhose main goal in life is to attract rent,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, Trump Towers Pune , is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country\u2019s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad. In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs. It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans. Top officials might \u201cthink in some way the U.S. president will help them,\u201d and \u201ccan put in a friendly word with the banks\u201d to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure. \u201cIf the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will think the president is meeting them.\u201d Photo Donald J. Trump\u2019s real estate partners from India met with him in New York on Nov. 15 as the presidential transition was underway. Another pitfall is that Donald Trump\u2019s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits. ",

The country\u2019s\u00a0government oversaw the worst crackdown on dissent in nearly three decades. The Chinese\u00a0built, then militarized, islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea. They tightened controls over the Internet, freezing out foreign firms while allowing their domestic competitors to prosper.\u00a0 Then the United\u00a0States\u00a0elected Donald Trump as president. Now some of those same countries are looking to Beijing to defend international cooperation on matters as diverse as trade and climate change, propelling\u00a0China to new heights on the world stage. And yet China doesn\u2019t sound particularly enthused about its elevation. The Global Times, a Communist Party mouthpiece, this week called it \u201cbeyond imagination to think that China could replace the U.S. to lead the world.\u201d\u00a0 The 21st Century Business Herald, China\u2019s leading business newspaper, referred to the country as \u201ca promoter, a reformer, not a revolutionary.\u201d\u00a0 China \"wants to be a force of stability,\u201d said Min Ye, an associate professor at Boston University\u2019s Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. \u201cBut it\u2019s not into changing the global order. It's a big responsibility \u2026 China still sees itself as a growing power.\u201d \u00a0 Donald Trump comes under unusual pressure to choose his secretary of State Nov. 27, 2016, 7:29 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now: Trump warned supporters will feel betrayed if he picks Mitt... (Matt Pearce) China, whose leaders\u2019 greatest concern is domestic stability, is also battling a slowing economy and rampant income inequality at home. \u201cFactor one is whether China has the capacity to be leader, and factor two is whether China has the willingness to be leader,\u201d said Chen Dingding, professor of international relations at Jinan University in Guangzhou.\u00a0 \u201cIf the U.S. \u2014\u00a0No. 1 power \u2014 not interested in global leadership, why should China be?\u201d \u00a0 The election of a U.S. president who takes an inward and sometimes\u00a0contradictory approach to foreign policy has already handed China major geopolitical wins, analysts say.\u00a0 The president-elect\u2019s vow to block President Obama \u2019s signature trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, has drawn some countries\u00a0closer to\u00a0China\u2019s economic orbit. Malaysia, once a backer of the 12-nation free trade deal, is shifting its focus to a Chinese alternative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Vietnam recently decided not to ratify the U.S.-backed agreement, leaving an opening for China\u2019s pact. Even longtime American ally Australia plans to seek out other\u00a0trade options. Obama saw the TPP \u2014 which excluded China \u2014 as vital to expanding America\u2019s influence in the region. China considered it a blatant attempt to contain its growing economic and political clout. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the pact \u201cleaves a gap,\u201d said Claire Reade, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u00a0\u201cIs China going to walk into that gap to encourage regional and global integration? I think the answer is yes.\u201d President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria.

In a brief, presumably\u00a0final, face-to-face encounter, President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria. The night before, Obama sat with his Chinese... (Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons) The region\u2019s pivot toward China on economic matters\u00a0hurts the\u00a0United States\u2019\u00a0ability to shape developments on the political front.\u00a0The U.S. typically ties its international aid and loans to causes such as gender equality, government transparency and\u00a0human rights\u00a0\u2014 issues on which China\u2019s authoritarian leaders rarely engage. \u00a0 \u201cU.S. hegemony is not great, but it's the best hegemony we've had in a long time,\u201d said David Zweig, a Canadian who researches Sino-American relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. China has reason to defend globalization. Although Beijing has chafed at perceived U.S. incursions, including criticism of its human rights record and U.S. naval operations in the South China Sea, it\u00a0has benefited greatly from closer economic cooperation with the rest of the world.\u00a0The struggling country that entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 has grown\u00a0into the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u00a0 While Trump has been promoting his \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform, China has\u00a0sought to reassure world leaders about its reliability and consistency on international matters. \u201cChina will not shut the door to the outside world but will open it even wider,\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping said Nov. 20 at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.\u00a0 Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin last week dismissed Trump\u2019s assertion that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d invented by China to destroy U.S. competitiveness and pledged to defend a landmark agreement to fight global warming \u201cwhatever the circumstances.\u201d This year, China opened the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Beijing-based rival to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country has also greatly expanded its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, which aims to revive ancient Silk Road trade routes by building roads, ports and other infrastructure across\u00a0Asia, Europe and North Africa.\u00a0 Nations far outside China\u2019s regional\u00a0sphere of influence are paying heed.

(Alexandra Zavis and Mythili Sampathkumar) In 2012, China struck a deal with 16 Central and Eastern European countries\u00a0to deepen\u00a0economic, tourism and education ties. That framework has encouraged Eastern European countries\u00a0to see China as \u201csort of a savior\u201d\u00a0in difficult economic\u00a0times,\u00a0when there is a need for investment that the West cannot provide, said Anastas Vangeli, a sociologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences. China\u2019s economic rise, combined with the shock of the recent global financial crisis and the wave of populism now sweeping the U.S. and Europe, has\u00a0some\u00a0people in the region\u00a0questioning the virtues of Western-style democracy. \u201cWhen you take a lot of people who don\u2019t know much about China, and you show them snatches of Beijing and Shanghai, they get fascinated with it,\u201d Vangeli said. \u201cOften in their statements, they say things like, \u2018Maybe China got some things right.\u2019\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

In the posts, Trump claimed that \"millions\" of people cast illegal votes in this month's presidential election, and claimed that the press was covering the matter unfairly.\u00a0 In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump further contended that if the popular vote determined the presidency, \"It would have been much easier for me to win\" it because he would have altered his campaign to pile up overall vote totals, not Electoral College votes. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 The real estate mogul also tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she told supporters they must accept that \"Donald Trump is going to be our president,\" and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nominee for refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict. There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting or hacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. It's that very lack of evidence that suggests Trump is likely to prevail in recounts. Trump's social media storm came one day after a Hillary for America lawyer said that Clinton would join in a vote-recall effort by Green Party Candidate Jill Stein. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 The attorney, Marc Elias, said Clinton was taking the step \u201cto ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" Stein has already raised at least $5.4 million in her effort to recount votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- states that were the key to Trump's upset victory. She began the process Friday by officially requesting a review in Wisconsin. Stein has argued the recount is intended to test the integrity of the U.S. voting system, amid so-far unfounded speculation that Russia tampered with the process. However, the effort also could undo the 70-plus electoral votes by which Trump beat Clinton. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and, as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost 11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday. Stein received only about 1 percent of the national vote, which has prompted Trump to call her effort a fundraising \u201cscam.\u201d \u201cI would say (Trump) has been incredibly gracious and magnanimous to Secretary Clinton at a time when for whatever reason her folks are saying they will join in a recount,\u201d senior Trump transition team adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cShe congratulated him and conceded to him on election night. \u2026 The idea that we are going to drag this out now where the president-elect has been incredibly magnanimous to the Clintons and to the Obamas is incredible.\u201d Meanwhile, Conway refused to rule out the possibility of further investigating Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state between 2009 and 2013.\u00a0 Conway made clear that Trump said only that he wouldn\u2019t rule out another possible email probe because new evidence could emerge and he wouldn\u2019t want to undercut the authority of federal and congressional investigators. The FBI this summer concluded its one-year investigation into Clinton using the private server by saying she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and that some of the emails included classified information. However, the investigation was effectively closed without criminal charges being recommended to the Justice Department. Trump, in his presidential debates with Clinton, also suggested that if elected he would appoint a special prosecutor for the matter. Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgiving weekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said the president-elect had scheduled a series of meetings Monday with prospective administration hires. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

(WFAA-TV) A former Marine who stole a combat veteran\u2019s story of valor and scammed the government out of a house and benefits is facing 21 years in jail for his crimes, WFAA reported. The family of Casey Owens, a Marine who lost both of his legs in 2004 when his Humvee hit an anti-tank mine and then killed himself after a decade of pain and fighting the Veterans Administration, tells the station that Brandon Blackstone is no hero for what he did. \u201cIt took my breath away that someone would do something like that,\u201d his sister Lezleigh Owens Kleibrink of Trophy Club, Texas, said. Blackstone, of Arlington, recently pleaded guilty to defrauding the government. He faces sentencing in February. Blackstone and Owens were in the same unit in Iraq. His deception unraveled when he showed a picture of the mangled Humvee to one of Owens\u2019 Marine buddies who witnessed the explosion. \u201cThe only thing I can figure out is that he convinced himself,\u201d Kleibrink told the station, referring to Blackstone. She said she will attend the sentencing with her mother. \u201cI just want it to be a closed case so that these guys know their Marine is OK,\u201d she told the station, referring to her brother's unit pals. \u201cHe's standing at the gates of Valhalla. And he's proud of them. And they're proud of him. That's what matters most to me.\u201d WFAA reports that for years Blackstone told audiences how he earned a Purple Heart when his Humvee ran over a land mine, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury. The VA paid him monthly disability benefits and a charity bought him a house, the station reported. In truth he left Iraq with appendicitis. ",

    "text": "Trump Makes Baseless Claim That 'Millions' Voted Illegally, Costing Him Popular Vote By Katherine Faulders Nov 27, 2016, 10:36 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Lashes Out at Election Recount Efforts of Jill Stein 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump spent his Sunday lashing out against the movement to force general election vote recounts in three states that were critical to his Electoral College victory, but he is now alleging that \"millions of people\" voted illegally, costing him the popular vote. \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump inaccurately claimed in a tweet, alleging -- without any factual basis to make the claim -- that millions of people voted for Hillary Clinton illegally. Clinton currently leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes. In subsequent tweets Trump said \"It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 -- states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" In one tweet, he named Virginia, New Hampshire and California as three states with \"serious voter fraud.\" In none of the tweets did Trump point to any evidence of voter fraud to account for his claim and no other evidence of his assertion has emerged since the election. ABC News reached out for comment to election officials in the three states Trump named, but had not received a response Sunday evening. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla denied Trump's claim about illegal voting in his state, calling them \"unsubstantiated allegations\" in a tweet Sunday night. \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect,\" he tweeted. The Trump transition team had not responded Sunday evening to a request for evidence Trump may be citing in his claims. Kay Stimson, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State, said they \"have no information that can help to explain what sources or information are behind the basis of the tweets\" by Trump. Kellyanne Conway Slams Mitt Romney: He Went 'Out of His Way' to Hurt Trump The Clinton campaign's general counsel Marc Elias tweeted Sunday night that \"We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn't ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud.\" Elias announced Saturday in a post on Medium that the campaign would participate in the recount efforts, but is not seeking to cast any doubt on the Electoral College results, adding they have not found \"any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,\" after looking into the matter. In a tweet-storm Sunday morning, Trump attacked the Green Party-backed efforts to recount the vote in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania this weekend, calling the effort 'sad,' while criticizing the Clinton campaign's participation in the effort. \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\" Trump tweeted. A senior administration official told ABC News Saturday there did not appear to be any malicious activity related to the vote count, and remained confident regarding the overall assessment of the election's integrity. \"The Federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting out electoral process on election day ,\" the official said. \"As we have noted before, we remained confident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out on election day. As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.\" Jill Stein and the Green Party said Friday they raised more than $4 million in three days to support recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three key battleground states where Trump narrowly defeated Clinton. Stein has maintained her activities are in no way intended to benefit Clinton, whom she leveled strong criticisms against during the 2016 election. George Martin, a former co-chair of the Wisconsin Green Party who's involved in Stein's recount effort, said the party has been approached by computer scientists, election lawyers and other experts advocating vote recounts because of what they see as persuasive evidence of tampered election results. So far there has not been any verifiable evidence or proof of tampering or hacking. He said the recounts are not to change the outcome of the results but are rather a check and balance on the process of counting votes.

They then follow the occasion by marching through Havana's streets to protest the detention of political prisoners and support human rights in Cuba . \"We have decided, as fighters of human rights groups, to respect the pain, which we don't share. We will respect and have taken a recess on a national level, wherever the Ladies in White are, to not take to the streets today, to avoid provoking the government,\" Berta Soler, leader of the Ladies in White, told The Associated Press. The BBC noted that this is the first time the women have cancelled their protest in 13 years. Ha muerto Fidel Castro , que Dios lo perdone, YO NO pic.twitter.com/yFp3n8WJkv \u2014 Damas de Blanco (@DamasdBlanco) November 26, 2016 The group tweeted \"Ha muerto Fidel Castro , que Dios lo perdone, YO NO,\" in response to Castro's death, words that translate to \"Fidel Castro has died, may God forgive him, I WON'T.\" Soler said she did not expect Fidel Castro's death to change the human rights situation in Cuba. \"Now that Fidel Castro is not on the earth it doesn't mean we are going to start a new era, a new stage in which Fidel is not physically here in Cuba. We are going to continue with a dictator, Raul Castro, who will do the same thing Fidel did, those two did the same things together. And so in Cuba, the only thing that will change in this new stage is, it will be without the physical presence of Fidel Castro,\" she told the AP.

Kamil Zihnioglu/AP hide caption toggle caption Kamil Zihnioglu/AP Francois Fillon waves before delivering a speech after the conservative presidential primary on Nov. 27, in Paris. Kamil Zihnioglu/AP In France's presidential primary election for the mainstream conservative party, Alain Jupp\u0102\u00a9 conceded defeat to Francois Fillon. The 71-year-old Jupp\u0102\u00a9 congratulated Fillon, 62, on a \"wide victory,\" according to The Associated Press. The AP reported the election results showed Jupp\u0102\u00a9 winning 32 percent of the vote compared to Fillon's 68 percent. Fillon had surged \"in popularity in recent weeks over longtime favorite\" Jupp\u0102\u00a9, the news service said. Fillon, whose policies fall further to the right than those of Jupp\u0102\u00a9, will face candidates from the left and the extreme right in the French presidential election next May. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, \"With the left in disarray and the far right still too marginal, analysts say the winner of the conservative primary, Fillon, will likely become the next French president.\" Current French President Francois Hollande's own prime minister, Manuel Valls, has said that he hasn't ruled out opposing the president in next month's left-wing primaries, reports Jake Cigainero for NPR. He tells our Newscast unit: \"The left-leaning Socialists have lost so much public support under Hollande that the Republicans are expected to win the presidential elections. Republicans see Marine Le Pen and her extreme National Front as their biggest opponent and are already preparing for a showdown next spring.\" Article continues after sponsorship Eleanor said both Fillon and Jupp\u0102\u00a9 served as ministers in the government of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, and both pledged to \"drastically reform the French economy.\" But they differ in their approaches to multiculturalism and foreign policy. She said: \"Fillon is more socially conservative and has won the backing of traditional family values Catholics. Fillon also wants to reestablish working relations with president Vladimir Putin and drop sanctions against Russia. Jupp\u0102\u00a9 stresses a harmonious France based on respect for religious freedom and ethnic diversity.\" Jupp\u0102\u00a9 says he will support Fillon in the national election. French Conservatives Fear Populist Wave That Carried Trump Will Foreshadow Primary \"I finish this campaign as I began it, as a free man who did not compromise what he is or what he thinks,\" Jupp\u0102\u00a9 said in Paris on Sunday night, according to the AP. The news service added: \"Jupp\u0102\u00a9 is calling for unity and calm after an unusually harsh campaign in which he accused Fillon of pandering to the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam far right.\" ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story More quietly, Mr. Bannon systematically courted a series of politicians, especially those who share his dark, populist worldview: at home, a corrupt ruling class preying on working Americans; globally, \u201cthe Judeo-Christian West\u201d in a \u201cwar against Islamic fascism.\u201d They were views that placed him closer to the European right than to the Republican mainstream. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He made flattering films about Michele Bachmann , the former congresswoman from Minnesota, and Sarah Palin , the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate; repeatedly pressed the television host Lou Dobbs to run for office; and flirted with a range of Republican presidential hopefuls, including Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Finally, in Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon found his man. Mr. Bannon told a colleague in multiple conversations during the presidential campaign that he knew Mr. Trump was an \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d for the revolution he had in mind. But the upstart candidate and the media entrepreneur bonded anyway. In August 2015, Mr. Bannon told Ms. Jones in an email that he had turned Breitbart, where employees called certain political stories \u201cBannon Specials,\u201d into \u201cTrump Central\u201d and joked that he was the candidate\u2019s hidden \u201ccampaign manager.\u201d He hosted Mr. Trump for friendly radio interviews and offered tactful coaching. This August, with the Trump campaign foundering, Mr. Bannon took over as chief executive. Like Reagan, Mr. Trump addressed the people he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d \u2014 the white working and middle class. He vowed to take on Islamic radicalism, as Reagan had faced off against communism. Echoing the sole-savior theme of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d Mr. Trump declared of the nation\u2019s predicament, \u201cOnly I can fix it.\u201d Ms. Jones, for one, had no trouble seeing the parallels. \u201cTrump,\u201d she said, \u201cis Steve\u2019s Reagan.\u201d Trailer of the 2004 documentary \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d which Mr. Bannon helped write. YouTube Mr. Trump, of course, is not Mr. Bannon\u2019s creation, and the president-elect would not take kindly to any such implication. (Asked on Tuesday by New York Times journalists about Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump praised him but said , pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m the one who makes the decisions.\u201d) But Mr. Bannon understood better than any other 2016 campaign strategist how many voters were seeking dramatic change, said Patrick Caddell, a veteran pollster, who all but predicted a Trump victory on election eve as most pundits were calling the race for Hillary Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s been the forerunner intellectually of this moment,\u201d Mr. Caddell said. \u201cHis ideology is that of the outsider and the insurgent.\u201d To understand what to expect from the Trump administration means in part to fathom the driven, contradictory character of Mr. Bannon, whom the president-elect has named senior counselor and chief White House strategist. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a president-elect, thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities and many other Americans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story How did this son of Richmond, Va., who attended Harvard Business School, spent years at Goldman Sachs and became wealthy working at the intersection of entertainment and finance come to view the political and financial elites as his archenemy? Why does a man who calls himself a \u201chard-nosed capitalist\u201d rail against \u201cglobalists\u201d of \u201cthe party of Davos\u201d and attack the Republican establishment with special glee? As a filmmaker, Mr. Bannon, 63, has cited both the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl and the left-wing documentarian Michael Moore as models. In top physical shape as a young Navy officer, and for years wearing the banker\u2019s uniform of expensive suits, Mr. Bannon has in recent years sported flannel shirts and cargo pants. With a paunch and a sometimes scraggly beard, Mr. Bannon has a rugged look that Stephen Colbert described as \u201cRobert Redford dredged from a river.\u201d He is an avid reader of history, fond of citing Plutarch and Plato, and his career reflects a restless, eclectic mind. He has conceived a rap musical based on Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cCoriolanus\u201d (never completed); overseen the troubled Biosphere 2 project, an experiment in the Arizona desert meant to mimic the earth\u2019s ecosystem; acquired partial rights to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d before it became a megahit; moved to Shanghai to run a company marshaling Chinese computer gamers to earn points for Western players; and produced films on Washington corruption, Occupy Wall Street and Phil Robertson of \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d Vociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an anti-Semite and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable self-confidence and striking intensity. (Mr. Bannon turned down a request for an interview, saying he was too busy with the presidential transition.) Fans and foes agree that he is a \u201cscreamer,\u201d a volcanic personality who sometimes resorts to offensive or hyperbolic language. One of his three former wives claimed in court papers that he had said he did not want their twin daughters to go to school with Jews who raise their children to be \u201cwhiny brats,\u201d a claim Mr. Bannon denies. In a 2011 radio interview , he dismissed liberal women as \u201ca bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools.\u201d Photo At a rally on Nov. 16 in Los Angeles, people protested the appointment of Mr. Bannon as the chief strategist of the White House. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a president-elect, thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities. Credit David McNew/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images In a radio interview last year with Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon complained, inaccurately, that \u201ctwo-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia.\u201d He has sometimes portrayed a grave threat to civilization not just from violent jihadists but from \u201cIslam.\u201d He once suggested to a colleague that perhaps only property owners should be allowed to vote. In an email to a Breitbart colleague in 2014, he dismissed Republican congressional leaders with an epithet and added, \u201cLet the grass roots turn on the hate.\u201d \u201cNo one has called him nice,\u201d said Patrick McSweeney, a former chairman of the Virginia Republican Party and a Bannon admirer who has known his family for years. \u201cHe is the least politically correct person I know. His overriding concern is getting the mission accomplished.\u201d Mr. Bannon encouraged clickbait incitement on Breitbart.com, and links to Breitbart articles are often spread on Twitter and Facebook alongside Nazi rhetoric and racial slurs. Saying he is an economic nationalist and not a white nationalist, Mr. Bannon has dismissed such devotees as the kind of marginal characters who turn up in every political movement, but he has only mildly denounced the bigots among his admirers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some longtime associates said they had never heard him express bigoted views. \u201cIn the 14 years I\u2019ve known him, I\u2019ve never heard him utter a racist or anti-Semitic comment,\u201d said Peter Schweizer, a conservative author and the president of the Government Accountability Institute, where Mr. Bannon was a founder and the executive chairman. Mr. Bannon\u2019s backers note that several of Breitbart\u2019s top editors and managers are Jewish \u2014 as was Mr. Breitbart himself \u2014 and the site is staunchly pro-Israel. They also point out that Mr. Bannon\u2019s longtime assistant, Wendy Colbert, is African-American; so are Sonnie Johnson, a conservative writer he promoted on Breitbart, and a former Goldman colleague who has been a close friend for three decades and considers Mr. Bannon family, but who asked not to be named to avoid a flood of media attention. Mary Beth Meredith, Mr. Bannon\u2019s sister, said accusations of personal bigotry against him were \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d \u201cWe have interfaith marriages in our own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have interracial marriages \u2014 our family is a microcosm of the U.S.\u201d Where some perceive racism and nativism, others see a different -ism: opportunism. Whatever may be in his heart, they say, Mr. Bannon was happy to draw a white nationalist following to Breitbart, while denying that was his intent. Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who has been sharply critical of Mr. Bannon, called him \u201ca manipulator\u201d who had \u201cmainstreamed\u201d far-right extremists for cynical political purposes. Ms. Jones, Mr. Bannon\u2019s former film collaborator, who describes herself as very liberal, said, \u201cSteve\u2019s not a racist.\u201d But, she added, \u201che\u2019s using the alt-right \u2014 using them for power.\u201d Photo Mr. Bannon in 1975, when he ran successfully for student body president at Virginia Tech. An opponent, Gary Clisham, told the student newspaper that Mr. Bannon had \u201cimmense charisma\u201d but predicted that he would get nothing done. \u2018Son of the South\u2019 Robin Mickle, a fellow Navy officer of Mr. Bannon\u2019s aboard the destroyer Paul F. Foster, remembers that he and some of his idealistic mates were struck by something Mr. Bannon told them in 1978. \u201cHe said he joined the Navy so it would look good on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because he wanted to go into politics someday,\u201d said Mr. Mickle, a retired defense contractor.

He was fit, too. \u201cHe\u2019d run five miles at lunch and he had a 32-inch waist,\u201d Mr. Masso said. \u201cVery preppy when we were out of uniform \u2014 polo shirts with alligators on them, and penny loafers with no socks.\u201d Mr. Bannon was the middle child of five in an Irish Catholic family from a leafy North Richmond neighborhood. His father, Martin, 95, to whom he remains very close, was a telephone lineman who had worked his way into middle management at the phone company. Photo Mr. Bannon with his father, Martin Bannon, at the family\u2019s home in Richmond, Va. Credit Via Julia Jones Steve and his two brothers went to Benedictine High School, an all-male Catholic military school in Richmond where the boys wore uniforms, kept their hair short and were called cadets. \u201cIt was a very conservative world,\u201d said John Pudner, a Benedictine graduate who knows Mr. Bannon and runs Take Back Our Republic , an advocacy group based in Alabama. Steve was bit of a brawler as a boy, said his older brother Mike Bannon. \u201cHe was a fighter. He was a guy that believed what he believed.\u201d On occasion, Steve summoned Mike to the neighborhood pool for reinforcement. \u201cHe\u2019d get in little scrapes and come back and get me, and I\u2019d say, \u2018I wished it wasn\u2019t eight guys we were fighting. If it was two or three, I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u2019\u201d Mike Bannon, eager to rebut charges of racism against his brother, said the boys took two buses to get to Benedictine, and their parents instructed them to give up their seats if a woman boarded: \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference if they were black or white or Indian or Jewish or anything else,\u201d he said. Their mother, Doris, who died many years ago, loved to tell them about sneaking Jewish friends into her neighborhood pool in Baltimore \u2014 past a sign that said \u201cNo Jews Allowed.\u201d She later worked on campaigns for Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who became the first African-American governor of Virginia. For Mike Bannon, his brother Steve is \u201ca son of the South\u201d who has never shifted his principles or his character. \u201cHe knew who he was in fourth grade and he\u2019s never changed much over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in his own skin.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story At Virginia Tech, Steve Bannon got his first taste of politics, winning the Student Government Association presidency in a 1975 race that grew quite heated after he challenged the status quo. An opponent, Gary Clisham, told the student newspaper that Mr. Bannon had \u201cimmense charisma\u201d but predicted that he would get nothing done. Photo A campaign button for Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign, which employed almost the same slogan that Mr. Trump would use in his presidential campaign. Credit Fotosearch/Getty Images After graduation, Mr. Bannon joined the Navy, attended Officer Candidate School and served two deployments aboard the Foster, a guided-missile destroyer that took him all over Asia and into the Persian Gulf. His basketball style \u2014 running the length of the court without passing \u2014 earned him a sarcastic nickname, Coast-to-Coast, said Mr. Masso, his shipmate. Still, he said, Mr. Bannon was popular with the sailors he led in the engineering department, nearly 50 men, the majority of them African-American, Hispanic or Asian. Though his family had Democratic roots, Mr. Bannon, like most of his fellow officers, was scornful of President Jimmy Carter and entranced by Ronald Reagan. At Mr. Masso\u2019s condo, while they watched the two candidates\u2019 debate on television in 1980, Mr. Bannon could hardly contain his excitement. \u201cHe was pacing my living room, and whenever there was a point-counterpoint, he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 like we were watching a boxing match,\u201d Mr. Masso said. When Mr. Bannon heard later that the Reagan election night party was planned for a Los Angeles hotel, the Century Plaza, he worked the phones to try for tickets. When he got the brushoff, Mr. Masso said, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cHey, listen pal, we just got back from the Persian Gulf.\u201d Soon, he had Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger on the phone saying, \u201cThe governor would be honored to have you there.\u201d It was 4 a.m. when their group left the victory celebration to return to the ship, Mr. Masso said. Both men went on to take Pentagon jobs, and Mr. Bannon earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations at Georgetown at the same time. Mr. Masso thought his friend might try to get into politics, but he was accepted at Harvard Business School, and he left the Navy in 1983 to begin a new life.

After less than four years, Mr. Bannon left Goldman to start his own firm, Bannon & Co., which Mr. Vorse soon joined. As head of a scrappy start-up going up against financial behemoths to get Hollywood deals, Mr. Bannon showed the fierce competitiveness that would later drive his politics. ",
