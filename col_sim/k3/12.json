By Robert Costa , Philip Rucker and Elise Viebeck November 11 at 4:04 PM Follow @costareports Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @eliseviebeck Vice president-elect Mike Pence. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Vice President-elect Mike Pence will replace New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition effort, a change that will cement the Indiana governor\u2019s influence over the incoming administration\u2019s policy and personnel. Trump, in a broad transition shake-up announced Friday, also gave his son-in-law and three eldest children official roles as transition advisers. The involvement of Trump\u2019s adult children raises the specter of conflicts of interest, since they are poised to manage Trump\u2019s business over the next four years. The changes within the transition effort will substantially dilute the influence of Christie and his closest aides, add a conservative edge to the upper level of Trump\u2019s team and formally empower Trump\u2019s family in decisions about their father\u2019s administration. Rick Dearborn, the chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a Trump loyalist and hard-line voice on immigration, will now serve as the transition\u2019s executive director, replacing ex-Christie chief of staff Richard Bagger. The three Trump children \u2014 Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump \u2014 and Jared Kushner, husband to Ivanka Trump, will serve on the transition\u2019s executive committee. The move comes after two former aides to Christie, whose administration has been hobbled by scandal, were convicted for their roles in politically motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Christie, however, remains involved in the transition and was named a vice chair on Friday along with Sessions, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Republican presidential primary contender Ben Carson \u2014 all considered likely members of a Trump administration. [ Trump loyalists, inner circle poised to claim top government roles ] \u201cTogether this outstanding group of advisors, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, will build on the initial work done under the leadership of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThe mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTogether, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation \u2014 specifically jobs, security and opportunity.\u201d During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) The changes come as the transition effort races to organize personnel and policy for the administration that will begin Jan. 20. Three days after Trump\u2019s surprise win over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and one day after Trump met with leaders in Washington, campaign insiders spent Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to discuss the next steps. The group included Christie, who met privately Thursday with campaign chairman and Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon for several hours, according to two people familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss Friday\u2019s shake-up. A senior Republican briefed on the Trump transition team\u2019s deliberations said Trump confidants, including Kushner and banker Steven Mnuchin, his campaign\u2019s national finance co-chairman and a possible Cabinet appointee, felt the transition team was too loyal to Christie and wanted to assert Trump\u2019s influence on the operation. The Republican spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks have been confidential. \u201cThe Trump high command felt like the president-elect needed to get control of his transition,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt was populated with Christie loyalists, not that they weren\u2019t for Trump, and it didn\u2019t appear to be as ramped up as it should have been. So taking a page from George W. Bush\u2019s book, he decided to put his vice president in charge.\u201d Pence and Christie also met privately on Thursday for about 90 minutes, according to one Republican briefed on the meeting. Christie\u2019s sidelining comes as he is increasingly consumed by the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which George Washington Bridge traffic lanes were closed as political retribution against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. Christie has claimed he did not know about the scheme at the time, but multiple witnesses in the corruption trial against his former aides said he did know. The Democratic majority leader of the New Jersey Senate called Thursday for impeachment proceedings against Christie, who is seen as unable to focus full-time on transition work. Other people familiar with Friday\u2019s developments played down the reduction in Christie\u2019s power but acknowledged that he had been layered in the inner circle. They described Sessions and Dearborn as low-key presences at Trump Tower in recent days and the \u201cnatural\u201d successors to Christie because of their loyalty to the candidate and populist instincts. Neither clashed with Christie, the people said. The appointment of Dearborn is intended to install someone well known to Congress to serve as a bridge between Trump Tower and Capitol Hill, helping recruit talent and processing incoming requests and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from lawmakers. Pence is also bringing on three of his senior advisers \u2014 Nick Ayers, Josh Pitcock and Marc Short \u2014 to assist him on transition work. Other prominent Trump allies, including Mnuchin, Bannon, billionaire investor Peter Thiel and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, will serve on the 16-person executive committee alongside Trump\u2019s children and son-in-law. Ethics experts and Trump opponents raised questions about the younger Trumps\u2019 participation in the transition given the Trump Organization\u2019s announcement Friday that it is working to \u201cimmediately transfer\u201d company leadership to them. \u201cThe notion that Trump would put his company into a blind trust run by his children was already a total farce. Now, it\u2019s even more alarming that his children will be involved in the government while managing his dangerous conflicts of interest with our adversaries,\u201d said Jessica Mackler, the president of the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century. Other members of the executive committee are Reps. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Marino (R-Pa.) and Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi; conservative donor Rebekah Mercer and New York investor Anthony Scaramucci. The transition staff will include figures familiar from Trump\u2019s campaign: Kellyanne Conway as senior adviser, Don McGahn as general counsel, David Bossie as deputy executive director, Stephen Miller as national policy director, Jason Miller as communications director and Hope Hicks as national press secretary. Dan Scavino will continue to run the social-media operation. RNC Chief of Staff Katie Walsh will serve as another senior adviser. Prominent Christie allies Bagger and Bill Palatucci, who formerly served as the transition\u2019s general counsel, will return to the private sector. Trump\u2019s announcement stated they would remain \u201cadvisers\u201d to the transition. \u201cThe signal is they\u2019ve lost confidence in Christie and that Mike Pence will have a very outsized role,\u201d Republican consultant Rick Tyler said of the changes. \u201cEverything that is happening reflects the new dynamics and how Trump is going to be as president, focusing on the big picture and leaving details to others.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got people coming in who are going to help him with his agenda,\u201d added Tyler, a longtime adviser to Gingrich. \u201cThis is going to be a team that\u2019s ready to work with Paul Ryan and Congress.\u201d Giuliani was among the insiders who spent part of the day at Trump Tower. \u201cI can see already how he is going to be a great president,\u201d he told reporters in the lobby. Sean Sullivan contributed. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told reporters on Friday that his advice to President-elect Donald Trump is \"out of great loyalty\" and has \"no expectation\" about his role in Trump's administration.

    "text": "By Brady Dennis November 11 at 3:17 PM Follow @brady_dennis President-elect Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the regulations it has put out under President Obama are \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\u00a0He has vowed to roll back Obama\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, known as the Clean Power Plan, and to scrap a litany of other \u201cunnecessary\u201d rules, especially those imposed on the oil, gas and coal sectors. The man planning how a Trump administration can obliterate Obama\u2019s environmental legacy is Myron Ebell, a Washington fixture who has long been a cheerful warrior against what he sees as an alarmist, overzealous environmental movement that has used global warming as a pretext for expanding government. Ebell has argued for opening up more federal lands for logging, oil and gas exploration and coal mining, and for turning over more permitting authority to the states. And he has urged the Senate to vote to reject an international climate accord signed last year in Paris. The self-described public-policy wonk has for years\u00a0made his home at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a conservative policy group that once received considerable funding from ExxonMobil. More recently, the organization has been funded in part\u00a0by Donors Trust. The Virginia-based organization, which is not required by law to disclose its contributors, is staffed largely by people who have worked for Koch Industries or nonprofit groups supported by the conservative Koch brothers. Ebell, who is not a scientist, has long questioned the overwhelming scientific\u00a0consensus that human activity is fueling unprecedented global warming. He also has staunchly opposed what he calls energy rationing, instead arguing that the United States should unleash the full power of coal, oil and gas to fuel economic growth and job creation. All that makes him an ideal ambassador for Trump, who has repeatedly called the notion of man-made climate change a \u201choax.\u201d [ Trump victory reverses U.S. energy and environmental priorities ] Ebell declined to comment this week on his work or the type of people likely to be appointed to run the EPA, instead referring inquiries to the Trump transition headquarters. But it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to figure out the likely list of priorities. The \u201c energy independence \u201d section of Trump\u2019s transition website \u2014 there is no \u201cenvironment\u201d section \u2014 reads like an oil-and-gas-industry wish list. \u201cRather than continuing the current path to undermine and block America\u2019s fossil fuel producers, the Trump Administration will encourage the production of these resources by opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters,\u201d the site states. \u201cWe will streamline the permitting process for all energy projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama, and rescind the job-destroying executive actions under his Administration. We will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.\u201d The site does say that Trump is \u201cfirmly committed to conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats.\u201d But it has no specifics on what that might mean, other than \u201cAmerica\u2019s environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.\u201d As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Presumably that means people such as Ebell. He has gleefully opposed environmentalists and railed against the policies of the Obama administration and others that take aim at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions \u2014 and by extension\u00a0weaning the United States off its dependence of fossil fuels. A 2007 Vanity Fair profile \u00a0described Ebell as a \u201csound-bite artist\u201d and an \u201coil-industry mouthpiece.\u201d \u201cAlmost no scientist doubts that global warming is here, that man-made greenhouse gases are to blame, or that if we don\u2019t cut back on those gases fairly soon we\u2019ll be in a heap of trouble,\u201d the article said. \u201cBut as the \u2018other hand\u2019 in all those news stories, Ebell and his quotable cohorts sustain the impression that a scientific debate is still raging. The more studies that confirm global warming, the more ink Ebell gets.\u201d [ What it would really mean if Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement ] Last year, when Pope Francis in an encyclical wrote about the \u201curgent challenge to protect our common home\u201d and said \u201cthe earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor,\u201d Ebell was quick to pounce. \u201cThe Vatican seems to have forgotten to consider the effects that energy-rationing policies to reduce emissions will also have on poor people in poor countries,\u201d he said on CEI\u2019s website. \u201cPutting the world on an energy-starvation diet will consign billions of people to perpetual energy poverty.\u201d During an appearance on C-SPAN last year, Ebell criticized the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan as an example of the type of aggressive regulation that would hinder the U.S. economy while proclaiming to address what he said was the overblown issue of global warming. \u201cI think that the environmental movement has been proclaiming doom right around the corner since it was founded in the late 1960s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they fund the environmental movement. It\u2019s how they attract political support, by saying we have this crisis. We\u2019ve had one crisis after another. Many of them were real problems, but not crises.\u201d Steven Mufson contributed to this report.\u00a0 Read more at Energy & Environment: ",

Known as \"America's Parade,\" it features over 20,000 participants, including veterans of numerous eras, military units, businesses and high school bands and civic and youth groups. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images People attend the Veterans Day Parade in New York City Thursday. Known as \"America's Parade,\" it features over 20,000 participants, including veterans of numerous eras, military units, businesses and high school bands and civic and youth groups. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Stories from the frontlines of war \u2014 and from the descendants of military families \u2014 are being told on this Veterans Day, as America honors those who've worn its uniforms and promised to protect it. The conversation also centers on how the U.S. can return the obligation, and serve its veterans. President Obama laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, praising the military and highlighting the story of Patrick Holbrook, a young veteran from Hawaii who had written to him to say, \"Sir, all my life I've tried to find what a Good man is, and be that man but I [realize] now life is more difficult for some. I'm not sure where I am going, and it is something that I can not shake.\" YouTube Obama said, in both a written reply to Holbrook and at today's ceremony: \"I can tell from your letter you are already a good man; you just need to find the calling that will express that goodness \u2014 or it will find you. Article continues after sponsorship Here's a sampling of Veterans Day stories from NPR and its member stations. This list isn't exhaustive \u2014 but it gives a sense of the breadth of the military community, and the wide range of experiences and challenges shared by veterans. From St. Louis Public Radio comes the story of how a team of archivists are trying to recover millions of veterans' records that were damaged in a 1973 fire. Years later, the documents remain vital: They can determine veterans' benefits and burial rights. The center gets anywhere from 4,000 and 5,000 requests every day. \"They're not just documents,\" said technician Marie Taylor, 25, who was trying to restore a soldier's file from World War II. \"There was somebody who lived this out. I'm doing my best to preserve that. To remember that.\" From Arizona Public Media comes the account of a visit to Camp Bravo, a tent city that serves as a base for homeless veterans who need, as the station says, \"shelter, nourishment and protection against the damages they bear from mental and physical injury, addiction, and isolation.\" Member station WABE in Atlanta describes how the city is closing in on the federal designation of having ended homelessness among veterans. \"According to the U.S. Department of Housing, about 360 veterans were in shelters or on Atlanta streets in January,\" WABE reports, \"nearly half what it was the year before.\" The wildly varying ways veterans who return from war are seen by civilians is at the heart of the Veterans Coming Home project that's been explored at a local level by member station WHYY in Philadelphia. \"Civilians don't even know how to approach veterans,\" says Caroline Meehan, program and research manager of Volunteers of America. \"There's now sort of this view, this dichotomy in society: Are veterans just heroes? Or are they scary people with PTSD who are gonna explode?\" Members station WAMU in Washington tells us about a father and son who were both deployed to Afghanistan, years apart. Their conversation was recorded by StoryCorps Local. \"I never thought that you would end up fighting on the same battlefields that I was in,\" Gary Berntsen, who went to Afghanistan after the 2001 attacks, tells his son Garrett. First-person accounts make up Minnesota Public Radio's project with LifePosts for Veterans. It includes the story of a journalist and photographer who worked in Afghanistan \u2014 and who realizes, \"I'm too confused to know that I'm scared.\" Another voice comes from Vietnam vet Loren Hanson, whose tour as a finance clerk wasn't as quiet as he expected: \"After a short flight to Pleiku then on to An Khe, I processed through the replacement detachment and was assigned to Delta Company 1st Bn (Abn) 8th Cav, the \"Jumping Mustangs\", an Airborne unit - risky stuff for a leg finance clerk.\" And from member station KMUW in Kansas comes this historic note: \"The idea for Veteran's Day began through the efforts of Emporia shoe repairman Alvin King.\" After King's nephew was killed serving in the Army in Germany during World War II, King pushed to expand Armistice Day \u2014 which was dedicated to World War I veterans \u2014 to cover all U.S. military veterans. Rep. Ed Rees of Emporia \"agreed to take King's idea to Washington, D.C.,\" KMUW reports. \"The legislation passed, and President Dwight Eisenhower\u2014a native Kansan \u2014 signed the bill establishing the nation's first Veterans Day on Nov. 11, 1954.\" ",

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Volunteers load a pallet with bottled water to be distributed outside Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Flint, Mich., in February. Carlos Osorio/AP A federal judge has ordered state and local governments to provide home delivery of bottled water to the residents of Flint, Mich., as they continue to navigate a years-long crisis over lead-laced water. U.S. District Judge David Lawson said in his order that the city and state must provide at least four cases of water per resident every week, unless the officials verify the household has a water filter installed that is properly maintained or the residents opt out. Flint is in the process of repairing its water system after the city switched to a new water source in 2014 without implementing proper corrosion controls. The untreated water corroded the pipes, causing lead to leach out of the pipes. For months, officials have been handing out water filters and distributing bottled water at points throughout the city. But on Thursday, the judge said that's not enough. The water filters do bring the lead levels below the EPA's action levels, he said, but the distribution and monitoring efforts have been \"uneven at best.\" There's no guarantee the filters are \"properly installed and maintained,\" Lawson wrote. Article continues after sponsorship Independent Investigators: State Officials Mostly To Blame For Flint Water Crisis And he said that picking up water at distribution points \"has become a major challenge\" for some residents in Flint, where 40 percent of people live below the poverty line. He cites testimony from residents who spoke of confusion about where to pick up the water and how much they were allowed to take, long lines and the cost of transportation needed to take home the heavy bottles. Some people said they were not given enough to meet their family's needs, and some distribution points were said to have short, inconvenient hours. \"The fact that such items are available does not mean that they are reliably accessible or effective in furnishing safe drinking water to every household,\" Lawson wrote. \"Indeed, the endeavor of hunting for water has become a dominant activity in some Flint residents' daily lives.\" The judge's order granted a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking immediate, reliable access to safe water, as part of a larger case over lead levels in Flint's water that was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Natural Resources Defense Council and several others. \"Activists have fought hard for home delivery for more than a year,\" as Michigan Radio reports . \"Recent tests showed improvement [in lead levels], but lead levels continue to be higher than acceptable in many Flint homes.\" As The Two-Way has reported, many people and groups have come under fire for their handling of the crisis in Flint. An independent task force concluded earlier this year that primary responsibility lies with a state environmental agency called the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, but many others failed to take proper action as the lead levels rose. \"In modern society, when we turn on a faucet, we expect safe drinking water to flow out. As the evidence shows, this is no longer the case in Flint,\" Lawson wrote in his order. \"The Flint water crisis has in effect turned back the clock to a time when people traveled to central water sources to fill their buckets and carry the water home.\" Lead-Laced Water In Flint: A Step-By-Step Look At The Makings Of A Crisis A spokesperson for Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder tells Michigan Radio that \"the government's attorneys are reviewing the order.\" If you're catching up on Flint's lead crisis, have a look at our timeline , which shows how it played out.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence reacts after speaking at a public rally on Nov. 10, 2016, in Indianapolis. (Darron Cummings / AP) Noah Bierman , Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , the vice president-elect, to head their transition team, abruptly replacing\u00a0New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday\u00a0amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is\u00a0off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual step of naming his three\u00a0oldest children and his son-in-law to top posts, moves certain to create potential conflicts of interest\u00a0given that his attorney said Trump would\u00a0put his children in charge of his assets while he is president. The transition team is always crucial, but especially so for the first president elected without experience in either government or the military. In addition to recruiting thousands of people to staff the White House, Cabinet agencies, embassies and other key government posts, the transition team needs to make sure Trump is briefed and prepared to take responsibility for the government and for\u00a0implementing his policy initiatives as soon as he is inaugurated in just 76\u00a0days. \u201cYou need to have your team on the field when the clock starts,\" said Max Stier, who heads the\u00a0Partnership for Public Service, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on good-government practices.\u00a0\"This is not simply about achieving the policy promises;\u00a0it\u2019s also about keeping us safe. Transitions are the point of maximum vulnerability for our nation.\" The effort is almost always well underway before a new president is elected, given the complexity and critical nature of the job, even as candidates know the work will be in vain if they are not chosen by the voters. Legislation passed in 2010, and updated in 2015, formalized much of the process for the transition from George W. Bush to Obama after the 2008 election, considered one of the smoothest in history.\u00a0Both Trump and Hillary Clinton formed transition teams months ago that began working with the White House on first steps toward a potential handoff.

    "text": "Privacy Policy Whether that exchange suggests that Mr. Trump would not offer the Treasury job to Mr. Dimon is unclear. Aides to Mr. Trump have declined to confirm who is on the shortlist for cabinet posts. And despite the president-elect\u2019s return to Twitter on Thursday night, he has so far said nothing specific about his possible picks. For now, Mr. Trump is firmly ensconced in Trump Tower, where he returned after his whirlwind day at the White House and Capitol Hill on Thursday. Trump Tower has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the local police. The building has now been ringed by Jersey barriers and concrete blocks marked \u201cNYPD.\u201d The Secret Service has set up checkpoints on each end of 56th Street near the tower, and pedestrian access has been restricted around the building. Photo Ivanka Trump arriving at Trump Tower on Friday. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Inside, Mr. Trump and his top aides are accelerating efforts to evaluate possible job candidates. There are some indications that the transition effort was slow to start up, perhaps the result of Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory, which caught much of the political world by surprise. At least a few of the people helping organize the search for Mr. Trump were tapped at the last minute, while others have been preparing quietly for weeks. At the Pentagon and the State Department, officials of the Obama administration said Thursday that they had not yet heard from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team about beginning the complex work of transferring responsibilities and authority. A spokesman for the State Department said he did not have \u201cany firm word\u201d on when briefings might begin for designated officials from the new government. Even as Mr. Trump moves to create a new administration, his transition team is being reshaped. It has been led by Mr. Christie since May, when Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee. The transition team was treated as something of a backwater. Mr. Trump appeared to care little about it, and the adviser who was most involved with it, Paul Manafort, left the campaign in August. Now, with Mr. Trump preparing to take office in less than 90 days, the transition work has abruptly come to life again, but with a lag in who might get slots. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For now, Mr. Pence will play a more prominent role, according to two advisers to Mr. Trump, as will Mr. Sessions. Both men have been involved in the transition since it began, but Mr. Christie\u2019s role may now change, according to the advisers. Mr. Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor, was offered a role on the team and is under consideration to lead it, according to one person briefed on the matter. Still, the pending reorganization has not stopped a steady flow of potential appointees from being mentioned. The critical position of chief of staff \u2014 the gatekeeper for the president inside the West Wing \u2014 is expected to come down to a choice between Mr. Bannon, the editor of Breitbart News who was chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and Mr. Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Giuliani told CNN on Thursday that he might accept an appointment as attorney general, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me.\u201d Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman, is said to be a serious contender for Treasury secretary (though Carl Icahn, the investor, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have also been mentioned in the news media).

In his first interview since his election earlier this week, Mr. Trump said one priority was moving \u201cquickly\u201d on the president\u2019s signature health initiative, which he argued has become so unworkable and expensive that \u201cyou can\u2019t use it.\u201d Yet, Mr. Trump also showed a willingness to preserve at least two provisions of the health law after the president asked him to reconsider repealing it during their meeting at the White House on Thursday Mr. Trump said he favors keeping the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of patients\u2019 existing conditions, and a provision that allows parents to provide years of additional coverage for children on their insurance policies. \u201cI like those very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview.

In Trump's 10-point immigration plan, he says he will \"cancel\" the executive orders. Related: Latinos Who Voted, Campaigned For Trump Found Common Ground With Him Kobach was the architect of Arizona's SB 1070 law which allows law enforcement to ask people for to prove their immigration status when there is \"reasonable suspicion\" that they might not be in the country legally. He also coined the idea of \"self-deportation,\" which would make immigration laws so stringent that it would encourage people to leave the country. As for the wall along the southern border, Kobach said it will get built, \"no question.\" \"The only question is how quickly will it get done and who helps pay for it,\" he said. Trump has vowed that Mexico will pay for it. According to a document obtained by the New York Times , leading Trump's \"Immigration Reform & Building the Wall\" component of his transition is Danielle Cutrona. She is Sen. Jeff Sessions' counsel on the Judiciary Committee. Sessions has long opposed illegal \u2014 and many forms of legal \u2014 immigration. During the campaign, Trump adopted many of Sessions' policy positions, including ending federal funding for sanctuary cities and ending \"catch-and-release.\" Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said that \"personnel is policy\" at this point in the administration. \"Who is in the room and who is appointed to these positiosn has massive implications for the American economy, particularly when it comes to immigration,\" Noorani said. Trump made immigration central to his candidacy, and after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill Thursday, h e said immigration was his top priority. As for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country, Rep. Chris Collins of New York, one of Trump's earliest backers, said deporting them is not part of the plan and that after the border is secure and the \"criminal element\" is removed, Collins predicts some sort of legalization for the undocumented. \"I think we can do fundamental immigration reform,\" he said.

Bannon. Republican National Convention Chairman Reince Priebus and Donald Trump's campaign Chief Executive Officer Stephen K. Bannon. (AFP/Getty Images) Cathleen Decker and Evan Halper Contact Reporters Fresh from a successful battle against a Democratic opponent, Donald Trump \u2019s attention must now turn to defining his presidency. His campaign offered two divergent approaches. He was a disruptive bomb-thrower when it came to general demeanor and his immigration and national security stances. He was a more conventional Republican when it came to his social-issue positions and economic concerns. The warring options were on sharp display overnight into Friday. Responding to protests around the country Thursday night, Trump first issued a tweet in keeping with the defiant tone of his campaign that \u201cprofessional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\u201d Nine hours later came one that was more presidential in approach, if a reversal from his first sentiment. When all the ballots are counted \u2014\u00a0 some 4.3 million remained in California as of Thursday night, according to the state\u2019s secretary of state \u2014\u00a0 Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by well over a million votes, en route to losing the electoral college and the White House. The result put... When all the ballots are counted \u2014\u00a0 some 4.3 million remained in California as of Thursday night, according to the state\u2019s secretary of state \u2014\u00a0 Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by well over a million votes, en route to losing the electoral college and the White House. The result put... (David Lauter) \u201cLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\u201d he said. The early discussions about\u00a0key positions in his administration\u00a0included similarly opposed sentiments,\u00a0suggesting that Trump has yet to lock down precisely how he will approach governing the nation. Among those being considered for presidential chief of staff \u2014\u00a0the figure who more than any other determines how well a White House works, and at what \u2014 was Stephen K. Bannon, who took a leave as chairman of Breitbart News to serve as Trump\u2019s campaign CEO. Bannon is a controversial figure even among Republicans , seen in the campaign as encouraging Trump\u2019s more eye-opening stunts such as his news conference with\u00a0several women who accused former President Bill Clinton of making sexual advances. He also fanned some of Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and African Americans. But he has no experience in\u00a0governing or keeping on track an organization as large as the executive branch. Another person being considered was the far more buttoned-down Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, an establishment figure who has close ties to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other GOP leaders, having helped to run the party for almost six years. Bannon and Priebus share an alliance with Trump, but little else. The pick is seen as essential to Trump\u2019s direction since the chief of staff often has the president\u2019s ear just before a decision is reached. The picture is no clearer for other top Cabinet posts, such as secretary of State. Trump is considering Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a consensus builder in the Senate who is well-liked across the aisle. But he is also looking at former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, one of the most aggressive neoconservative hawks during the George W. Bush administration and a favorite among the Breitbart set. Adding further uncertainty, on Friday afternoon Trump shook up his transition team, announcing that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would take over, replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. As much as staffing, Trump\u2019s presidency also will be defined by the issues he chooses to take up early in his administration. Already, outside groups and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have control of both houses, are pressuring Trump to make good on myriad and sometimes competing campaign promises.\u00a0And they are moving into the vacuum formed by the lack of substantive policy proposals in the campaign. Trump\u2019s success in Tuesday\u2019s election rested on running against both parties, Democrats and Republicans alike. That suggests that he may end up cutting a distinct path untethered to the traditional lines, even Republican ones. For now, the president-elect is keeping his options open, at least publicly.\u00a0In a brief comment to reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday, he offered only one broad directive. \u201cWe're going to work very strongly on immigration, healthcare and we're looking at jobs, big-league jobs,\" he said. Asked specifically whether he intended to ban Muslims from entering the United States, as he pledged during the campaign, Trump raised his hand, said \"thank you\u201d and walked off. Turning from a campaign to governing is difficult for any winning nominee, but for Trump it represents not just an occupational shift but a cultural one. He will go from being the top man in a company bearing his name, with his children as his chief lieutenants, to commanding the sprawling executive branch with miles-long lines of authority and an expansive reach over issues with which he has no experience. He will confront not only the majesties of the presidency but its limitations \u2014 specifically the other equal partners in government, such as a legislative branch that runs on its own calendar and with its own priorities. For more on politics \u00bb Both Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans appear eager to make the repeal of Obamacare a prime early focus. In the waning days of the campaign, he had talked of calling a special session to repeal his predecessor\u2019s signature achievement, but Congress will already be in session by the time he becomes president. \u201cWe would urge them to go big on the issues and the first would be to repeal Obamacare,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-allied interest group that worked in dozens of states to elect Republicans. \u201cIt was a key issue in the elections in the Senate and the presidential as well. Don\u2019t nibble around the edges. Go big,\u201d said Phillips, whose organization also favors early action on tax reform. But calling for the repeal of a measure at campaign rallies peopled by voters who dislike Obama is different altogether than taking health insurance coverage from 20 million Americans without a detailed plan for replacing it. Already, differences have emerged between Trump and House Speaker Ryan as to how expansive\u00a0changes would be. Ryan, in a Fox News interview on Friday, suggested a revamping of both healthcare and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, long\u00a0thwarted by Obama\u2019s threatened veto. \u201cIf you are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThose things are part of our plan.\u201d But the coalition that helped elect Trump benefits from the very programs that Ryan wants to shrink. And as a candidate, Trump deviated from Republican promises to curtail entitlements. Still on his campaign website is a quote from the candidate distancing himself\u00a0from the very measures Ryan discussed Friday. ",

Trump's Potential Cabinet Fills Out With Washington Insiders by Alexandra Jaffe and Katy Tur Share VP-Elect Pence Takes Over Trump Presidential Transition Team 2:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161112013539if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/807068739586\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Donald Trump on Friday announced Vice President-elect Mike Pence would take over transition planning from Chris Christie, a move that sources say reflect a diminished role for the New Jersey governor. Sources tell NBC News that the controversy surrounding two former Christie aides being convicted in the closure of George Washington Bridge lanes was an issue, but more significant was Christie's failure to vocally defend Trump at key moments throughout the campaign. Pence, meanwhile, increasingly earned Trump's trust and respect by becoming one of his more vocal defenders on the campaign trail. Christie will remain a vice-chair, along with a number of other key campaign advisers, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, among others. \"The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,\" Trump said in a statement. Pence, as well as Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chief Steve Bannon will be leading the charge to whittle down names for cabinet positions. The transition executive committee will include three of his children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump. But despite Donald Trump's campaign pledge to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington and his outsider campaign, many of the prospects are clear Washington insiders. Sources tell NBC News that Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is being considered for Secretary of Homeland Security; former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, a past chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is on the list for Director of the CIA; while Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, is in the mix for Treasury Secretary. Rep. Mike McCaul, Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling NBC News Hensarling weighed in on the chatter with a statement saying \"serving in [Trump's] Cabinet is not something I've indicated an interest in and it's not something I am pursuing\" \u2014 but notably he didn't rule it out. \"It's nice to be mentioned, and I certainly want to help our new president make America stronger and more prosperous, but serving in his Cabinet is not something I've indicated an interest in and it's not something I am pursuing,\" he said. \"I've got enough on my plate working for the great people of Texas, serving as chairman of the Financial Services Committee.\" Related: In Capitol Hill Meetings, Donald Trump Reveals His Top Priorities Meanwhile, key campaign operatives were keeping their options open. Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway, considered a possible pick for chief of staff or a senior adviser in the Trump White House, left the door open to both. \"Those decisions have not been made. We\u00b9re just really trying to help with the transition and also just really digest the incredible victory that we had, but I'll be talking to Mr. Trump directly about that soon,\" she told NBC News Thursday night, when asked about the chatter.

Steve Bannon, campaign CEO for President-elect Donald Trump, leaves Trump Tower, Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, in New York. (Evan Vucci / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Donald Trump is considering a conservative bomb-thrower and the face of the GOP establishment, among others, for White House chief of staff \u2014 a major post that could set the direction for his presidency. The Republican president-elect is days away from naming his chief of staff, according to people with direct knowledge of his thinking. No position is considered more important than chief of staff, a behind-the-scenes power player who typically controls access to the president, guides the enactment of his policy priorities and oversees White House hiring. Trump has already narrowed his list to a handful of high-profile loyalists that includes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , campaign CEO Steve Bannon and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. The incoming president repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" during his campaign's final weeks, yet both Priebus and Conway have operated for years in that same Washington \"swamp.\" Bannon, by contrast, would represent a dramatically different direction, having spent recent years leading a conservative news site that fueled conspiracy theories popular with the \"alt-right\" movement of white nationalists. President-elect Donald Trump named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , the vice president-elect, to head their transition team, abruptly replacing\u00a0New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday\u00a0amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is\u00a0off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual...

Chris Christie on Friday\u00a0amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is\u00a0off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual... (Noah Bierman, Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons) Trump ran as an outsider, but some suggest it would be risky to tap another outsider to serve as his right hand in the Oval Office. \"I'm trying to think of who was successful as chief of staff as an outsider and I can't think of one,\" said John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who served as chief of staff for the first three years of former President George H.W. Bush 's administration. A president's chief of staff sets the tone for the White House, guarding who has access to the president and what problems land on his desk. The role blends both policy and politics, working with congressional lawmakers and Cabinet officials. The chief of staff is also typically among the closest advisers to the president, providing counsel on domestic and foreign policy decisions. In 2013, President Barack Obama made the decision to abruptly pull back plans to launch airstrikes on Syria while walking on the South Lawn with his chief of staff, Denis McDonough . The chief of staff \"is often the last person who speaks to a president before a decision is made,\" said Sara Fagen, who worked under two chiefs of staff in the George W. Bush White House. \"This person has to have the confidence of the president and they have to have the kind of relationship with the president where they can give him candid advice and tell him things he does not want to hear.\" Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.

Nov. 9, 2016. (The White House)\u00a0 Delivering a statement the day after the presidential election, President Barack Obama said he was encouraged by Trump's call for reconciliation. Nov. 9, 2016. (The White House)\u00a0 It's also helpful, Sununu said, if the chief of staff \"understands the nuances and the politics of policy so that the president doesn't accidently get himself into a bind.\" There are few people in Trump's inner circle who are experienced in the nuances of politics and policy. The businessman and reality television star is expected to lean heavily on Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a sitting governor who previously served in Congress for more than a decade. But with Trump having been shunned by most of the political world's most respected leaders for much of the last year, few of his closest campaign advisers have governing experience in Washington. Trump has only about 70 days to form a new government, including hundreds of senior-level employees across various federal agencies. The jobs \u2014 and the selection of his Cabinet \u2014 will be filled only after a chief of staff is selected. And with so many questions about Trump's specific priorities as president, his early personnel decisions become major signals of his intentions. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump made the comments to The Wall Street Journal in his first interview since winning the election. The newspaper said Mr. Obama had urged the president-elect to reconsider repealing his signature health care law , which Mr. Trump said had become \u201cunworkable.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in the interview, Mr. Trump said he told the president that he would consider keeping two provisions of the law: the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of a patient\u2019s pre-existing condition; and the one that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance plans until they turn 26. The problem: Without a mandate for everyone to buy health insurance, the popular pre-existing condition provision could send insurance companies into a tailspin, because their costs would rise with sicker customers, and that would not be offset by healthy consumers forced to buy insurance. \u2018A lovely call\u2019 from Clinton. Mr. Trump said in an interview to be shown on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday that Mrs. Clinton \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been nicer\u201d in a congratulatory call she made to concede the election, and that Bill Clinton had complimented him on \u201cone of the most amazing\u201d presidential runs he had ever seen. \u201cIt was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her \u2014 I mean, I can imagine, tougher for her than it would have been for me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, \u2018Congratulations, Donald, well done.\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump, who on Thursday said he would seek Mr. Obama\u2019s counsel about the presidency, said he would consider asking for Mr. Clinton\u2019s as well. Mr. Trump also promised that there would be no lapse in health insurance for millions of Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act when he repeals and replaces the law. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it simultaneously \u2014 it\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff. We\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. And we\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing.\u201d And speaking of olive branches \u2014 Mitt Romney Mr. Trump has quietly reached out to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who took an impassioned stand against Mr. Trump during the campaign. Advertisement The call came after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory on Tuesday night, according to two people briefed on it, although it was unclear how it went and what was said. Aides to Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney did not respond to requests for comment. Gloria Allred eyes the Paula Jones model. With her eye on the right\u2019s Paula Jones legal crusade of the 1990s, Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer representing women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, is trying to lure the president-elect into a legal battle before he takes office. Ms. Allred challenged Mr. Trump on Friday to retract his threat to sue his accusers for defaming him and suggested that she might bring a case against him if he refused. She also said that she was prepared to countersue if Mr. Trump made good on the threat. \u201cPresident-elect Trump now has the opportunity to act presidential,\u201d Ms. Allred said at a news conference with Summer Zervos, the former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who said last month that Mr. Trump tried to seduce her and grabbed her breasts in 2007. Ms. Allred cited a precedent for suing a sitting president: Ms. Jones. \u201cObviously the lawsuit against President Clinton by Paula Jones did proceed while he was in office for actions that were alleged to take place prior to his becoming president,\u201d she said. The Jones case forced Mr. Clinton into a deposition that resulted in his impeachment on charges of lying under oath about an affair with an intern. A sobbing Ms. Zervos sat next to Ms. Allred and offered her own solution: \u201cWhat happened to a good, old-fashioned I\u2019m sorry?\u201d Mike Pence is in, Chris Christie is out. Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take the lead on the president-elect\u2019s transition. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is under a cloud after two aides were convicted of conspiring to shut down traffic on the George Washington Bridge in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, moves aside.

(John Minchillo / AP) CNN says Corey Lewandowski , who served a brief, stormy stint as CNN commentator after being fired as Donald Trump 's campaign manager, has resigned from the network. CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin says the resignation Friday afternoon is effective immediately. Lewandowski's stay at CNN began days after he left the Trump campaign in June. It stirred debate over whether political insiders hired as network on-air contributors are more loyal to the politicians they once worked for than the network and its viewers. Lewandowski had stayed in close touch with Trump while at CNN, leading to speculation since Trump's victory this week that he might take a role in the new administration. Earlier on Friday, he was seen arriving at Trump Tower, where the president-elect was holding transition meetings. Associated Press ",

People with pre-existing conditions will still be covered in the version of health care that Trump wants to see replace Obamacare , he said in a wide-ranging interview with CBS News\u2019 Lesley Stahl on \u201c 60 Minutes .\u201d Production shots from Trump's interview with 60 Minu... \u201cIt happens to be one of the strongest assets,\u201d Trump said about insuring people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cIt adds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re gonna try and keep.\u201d And, he told Stahl, that there will be no lapse between the repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health-care law and its replacement by his version. The\u2019re won\u2019t be \u201ca two day period\u201d or \u201ca two year period where there\u2019s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you\u2019ll know. And it\u2019ll be great health care for much less money,\u201d he promised. Trump on Obamacare \u201cEither Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Friday. Mr. Trump favors keeping in place protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, along with a measure that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance policies until the age of 26, the Journal said, and it also reported that during their meeting Thursday, Mr. Obama asked the president-elect to reconsider repealing it.\u00a0 In fact, Mr. Trump told the Journal that a big reason for his shift from his call for a full repeal was his meeting with Mr. Obama, who, he said, suggested areas of Obamacare to keep intact. \u201cI told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. 17 Photos The Trump kids The measures on pre-existing conditions and keeping children on their parents\u2019 policies are popular even among the most partisan Republican legislators who have called for a full repeal of the law, and they have been included in proposals that would replace the ACA with a GOP-backed alternative. House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d healthcare plan, for example, would also prevent insurance companies form denying coverage to those with existing conditions and would keep the parental provision. Trump on speaking with the Clintons Trump himself has said before in a Republican primary debate that he would want to keep some measures Obamacare instituted. \u201cI would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. I want to keep pre-existing conditions. It\u2019s a modern age, and I think we have to have it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in February at the CNN-Telemundo debate in Texas. \u201cI would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. I want to keep pre- existing conditions. It\u2019s a modern age, and I think we have to have it.\u201d But Trump\u2019s recent answer in the Journal is a softening even from the plan his campaign team recently put on his website for his first 100 days in office , which explicitly calls for a piece of legislation called the \u201cRepeal and Replace Obamacare Act.\u201d The legislation, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, \u201cfully repeals Obamacare and replaces it.\u201d\u00a0 In the interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the president-elect also said talked about the call he received from Hillary Clinton when she conceded. 40 Photos Melania Trump \u201c[I]t was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u00a0\u201cI can imagine.

He insisted only a \u201csmall amount\u201d of fake news circulated on Facebook during this campaign, an unprecedented race that unfolded on social media as much as it unfolded on the physical campaign trail.\u00a0 Zuckerberg\u2019s strongly worded dismissal is unlikely to end the controversy over fake news on Facebook. Nearly half of Americans get their news from the social network, according to the Pew Research Center. His comments add another layer to the increasingly complicated and consequential conversation about the role that fake news plays in today\u2019s divided media landscape. Zuckerberg argued the focus on fake news stories planted by groups seeking to profit from page views or sway public opinion just distracts people from examining the real reasons Donald Trump won enough support to pull off a historic election upset.\u00a0 \u201cI do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is they saw some fake news,\u201d Zuckerberg said, according to USA Today. \u201cIf you believe that, then I don\u2019t think you have internalized the message the Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.\u201d In a statement, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, struck a different tone, and acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s so much more\u201d the company needs to do to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform. Facebook apologizes for \"trending\" fake news story For some in Silicon Valley, the criticism of Facebook feels more than appropriate. \u201cIt is a very good thing if people in Silicon Valley are contemplating the consequences of the inventions they delivered to an unsuspecting world,\u201d Silicon Valley forecaster Paul Saffo told USA Today . \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s any reflection going on at all is a very good sign. There has long been this naive view that technology is neutral and there\u2019s nothing neutral about technology. The problem is we can never figure out which way it\u2019s going to cut until it arrives.\u201d President Obama himself called out Facebook at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton on the eve of the election. \u201cPeople, if they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it\u2019s on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it\u2019s on social media, people start believing it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.\u201d Fake stories have long run rampant on Facebook \u2014 both on users\u2019 News Feeds , as users share content from inauthentic news sites to their personal networks, and on Trending Topics , the homepage module on Facebook\u2019s desktop site that presents viral stories of the moment. (Speaking of misinformation: Just today, Facebook was rocked by an apparent bug that led to numerous users being told, mistakenly, that their friends were dead via memorial banners on their profiles.)\u00a0 Facebook has little control over what users themselves share to their own networks. Its algorithm promotes content based on engagement levels, and Facebook doesn\u2019t make any kind of \u201cvalue judgment\u201d on the nature of the content that\u2019s being shared, CNET editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News.\u00a0 Mark Zuckerberg tops Fortune's Businessperson of the Year But recent investigative pieces have pulled back the curtain on the vast landscape of highly partisan operations that live only on Facebook and gained extraordinary momentum this campaign season. These hundreds of pages, from Occupy Democrats to Fed-Up Americans to RightAlerts to Addicting Info, represent the \u201cmost disruptive, least understood force in media,\u201d The New York Times wrote in August. \u00a0 Facebook has somewhat clearer control over Trending Topics, a feature that has been under fire in recent months for showcasing both conspiracy theories and false news reports. Facebook, which once employed a team of news curators to monitor and edit the Trending Topics section, laid off that team after an ex-staffer made anonymous claims that the section showed a\u00a0 consistent bias against conservative-interest news stories . Since August, Trending Topics has been controlled by algorithm rather than human curators. That move, however, did not mean the end to Facebook\u2019s headaches.\u00a0 In August, Facebook apologized after Trending Topics promoted a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose critical coverage of Donald Trump led the GOP nominee to launch a targeted campaign against her. The story, which falsely claimed that the cable channel had fired Kelly for being \u201ca closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win,\u201d was from the right-wing website End The Fed.\u00a0 In September, news organizations and social media users sounded the alarm after Facebook\u2019s Trending section promoted a so-called \u201c9/11 truther\u201d circulating the false claim that bombs and not terrorist-piloted planes brought down the Twin Towers in Manhattan. Under fire, Facebook removed the story from its Trending section. Social media\u2019s impact in shaping public perception and civic engagement is undeniable. Twenty percent of people surveyed say they have modified a personal stance because of content they saw on social media, according to the Pew Research Center. President-Elect Donald Trump\u2019s largest megaphone this campaign was his Twitter account . Facebook seems to be trying to have it both ways, Ackerman told CBS News. \u201cThe paradox for Facebook and Zuckerberg is this: They want to claim very loudly that Facebook is very influential when it comes to choosing what car you\u2019re going to buy, what phone you\u2019re going to buy, what movie you\u2019re going to go see,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cAnd then they want to say they\u2019re not really influential when it comes to these news stories affecting people\u2019s election choices.\u201d\u00a0 Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, issued a call for Facebook to take more responsibility for the proliferation of obvious propaganda on its platform. \u201cFacebook, now the most influential and powerful publisher in the world, is becoming the \u201cI didn\u2019t do it\u201d boy of global media,\u201d she wrote. \u201cClinton supporters and Trump detractors are searching for reasons why a candidate who lied so frequently and so flagrantly could have made it to the highest office in the land. News organizations, particularly cable news, are shouldering part of the blame for failing to report these lies for what they were. But a largely hidden sphere of propagandistic pages that target and populate the outer reaches of political Facebook are arguably even more responsible.\u201d With more than one billion active daily users, Facebook is the world\u2019s biggest distributor of information. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Between the Clinton and Trump supporters lies bitterness and distrust. How are the groups different? Noah Bierman , Joseph Tanfani and Jenny Jarvie Contact Reporters At a posh Miami cafe\u00a0the day after the election, a man worriedly monitored the stock market. His friend questioned whether the election had been rigged. At a nearby coffee shop, a barista tried to figure out why the data-driven websites she followed could have been so wrong. It\u2019s a safe bet that none of them had ever traveled to Stanley,\u00a0a North Carolina rail\u00a0town of 3,600\u00a0where construction workers, plumbers and an off-duty sheriff\u2019s deputy\u00a0watched Hillary Clinton \u2019s concession speech from Pete's Grill on Main Street. \"I don't know anyone who would vote for Hillary Clinton,\" said Terry Brown, a 55-year-old\u00a0plumber.\u00a0 \"She should be locked up,\" another diner said under his breath.\u00a0 The fissure revealed in this election was as wide as any in recent history: between those who believe Donald Trump will destroy everything that America stands for and those who are certain it has already been so destroyed that only Trump can fix it. Explore returns from the 2016 general election \u00bb \u201cMaybe I have a skewed vantage point because I live in a city,\u201d said Hannah Ratcliff, the 25-year-old barista in Miami, still shaking her head at the thought of voters selecting a man her friends called an \u201cidiot\u201d\u00a0 to represent America around the world. \u201cI just don\u2019t think they run into the same sort of experiences. I know a lot of people that immigrated to this country, and they\u2019re just horrified.\u201d Hannah Ratliff, 25, of Miami Noah Bierman / Los Angeles Times Hannah Ratliff, 25, of Miami Hannah Ratliff, 25, of Miami (Noah Bierman / Los Angeles Times) The election made clear that, in many cases, Clinton and Trump supporters came from two Americas, with different life experiences and mutual distrust. Clinton won the popular vote with supporters packed tightly into diverse urban clusters, with heavy immigrant populations, looser religious affiliations\u00a0and greater educational and economic opportunities. Trump\u2019s electoral path spanned the country, largely bypassing those metropolises\u00a0as it meandered through religious Southern towns, the vast rural heartland and the old industrial belt in the North that once provided the bedrock of the Democratic labor union coalition.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s supporters said throughout the campaign that they felt ignored by coastal elites whose influence over media, politics and culture seemed overwhelming. Many reveled in Clinton\u2019s description of them as a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d seeing it as proof that they were looked down upon. They worried about the\u00a0encroaching societal changes and their effect on jobs, immigration and security \u2014\u00a0so worried that they were willing to take what many knew was a risk. Shawn Lewis, left, and his boss, Tommy Morrison at Pete's Grill in Stanley, N.C. Jenny Jarvie / For The Times Shawn Lewis, left, and his boss, Tommy Morrison at Pete's Grill in Stanley, N.C. Shawn Lewis, left, and his boss, Tommy Morrison at Pete's Grill in Stanley, N.C. (Jenny Jarvie / For The Times) \"We're entering the unknown,\" said Tommy Morrison, 55, the owner of a local drain and grease trap cleaning company in Stanley, who also voted for Trump. \"The more educated, college-bred, liberal-thinking, progressive individuals see this country going backwards. I see it positively: We're going back to the roots and Christian values we were founded on.\" He also offered an olive branch to Clinton, saying he admired her hard work and believed she loves the country even as she was held back by her baggage.\u00a0 Samantha Miller, a 47-year-old paralegal, stood in the back of a rally in Virginia Beach last month, worried that America had become preoccupied with going \u201cto third-world countries\u201d to fight wars and aid others and needed to \u201ctake care of ourself\u201d first. \u201cNo one is here to help us,\u201d she said. Trump seized on that anxiety with nostalgia for a version of a post-World War II America, when overseas victories and the path to economic security for working-class whites were more clear-cut than they are in a modern world, with messy foreign clashes and fewer paths to economic prosperity for those without a college education. He said repeatedly that his election represented a \u201clast chance\u201d to reclaim past greatness,\u00a0and\u00a0declared in his acceptance speech: \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\u201d Here is how America feels about Trump's shocking win Open link Clinton\u2019s supporters said they could not quite grasp the fury of Trump\u2019s backers, which some blamed on racism or xenophobia. Many said on Wednesday that they continued to underestimate the other side\u2019s frustration. \u201cThere was just that sense of anger,\u201d Richard Bloomingdale, president of the 800,000-member Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, who said he was shocked at the indifference many voters expressed when his members knocked on their doors and made calls for Clinton. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care that [Trump] was a misogynist, or that he insulted disabled people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t care.\u201d He pointed to the largely white, fading\u00a0industrial counties around Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, where Clinton fared far worse than President Obama only four years earlier. In Luzerne County, she won nearly 13,000 fewer votes than Obama. The campaign trail laid bare each side\u2019s conviction that\u00a0the country would not just decline, but fall apart, if the\u00a0other side\u00a0won the election. And both sides were\u00a0confident of victory, a belief reinforced by\u00a0their\u00a0social media feeds and the people they saw at the grocery store. \u201cI have a lot of friends on Facebook that are just praying for him,\u201d said Bonnie Zink, a retired teacher from Sylva, N.C., who drove an hour from her home near the Smoky Mountains to see Trump at a fairgrounds in western North Carolina last month. She and her husband, Jim, had tried to attend two previous rallies but could not get in because tickets were so scarce. ",

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Trump acknowledged there are aspects of President Obama\u2019s signature health care plan that he wants to maintain, like protecting patients with pre-existing conditions and allowing parents to keep their children on their own plans until age 26. \u201cI like those very much,\u201d he said, according to the newspaper. Most congressional Republicans would agree that in order to craft a viable alternative to the president\u2019s law, they need to include at least those two aspects, which appear to be very popular with participants in the Affordable Care Act. Both of the items Trump mentioned are included in House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d health care agenda, although he has not yet offered actionable legislation to achieve them. Trump also appeared to back off his desire to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, which prompted chants of \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d at his rallies. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,\u201d he said.

USA TODAY NETWORK In this photo taken Nov. 10, 2016, President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House. Obamacare was one of the topics discussed. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) President-elect Trump backed down a bit from his vow to repeal Obamacare, suggesting in an interview Friday that he might retain the prohibition of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and the ability to keep children on parents' insurance until they are 26. In an interview with the Wall Street\u00a0Journal,\u00a0Trump\u00a0reportedly\u00a0said\u00a0he would move quickly to deal with\u00a0the Affordable Care Act (ACA), because patients \"can\u2019t use it\" due to its high costs. A total repeal of the\u00a0ACA would be as difficult as it is unlikely. Legislation\u00a0that passed both houses of Congress last year before it was vetoed by President Obama would have left more than 20 million people without insurance. It would have eliminated the subsidies to help them pay for it, the penalties if they don't buy it and the taxes to cover the costs. Trump election helps spur top Obamacare signups this month Health care economist John Goodman, who advises Republican members of Congress, says that\u2019s something neither party is likely to vote for without the assurance of a presidential veto. Neither party can afford the political backlash that would follow any move to take away 20 million people's health insurance Trump's apparent support for two of the most popular parts of the health law came as a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted that Ryan's \"A Better Way\" Obamacare replacement also would protect those with preexisting conditions and allow parents to keep children on parents'\u00a0plans until they are 26. Twitter | @brendanbuck Brendan Buck on Twitter That would be a major relief to Jackie Elledge of Oklahoma, who discovered she had stage 4 cancer earlier this year and then lost her job when her employer went out of business in February. Her chemotherapy treatments are all that are\u00a0keeping her alive, but they make her so sick she can't work. She is paying for a subsidized Obamacare plan with her disability payments and won't be eligible for Medicare for at least two years. That may be as long as she has live, however. \"I should not have to worry about being able to get health insurance while I am fighting for my life,\" says Elledge. ",

And though they have been bigger in scope than prior protests -- most of which surrounded the 2000 election where the winner was not determined for weeks after the vote -- the demonstrations have largely been confined to cities in states that Hillary Clinton won. \"The nation is highly polarized and even more than it had been in 2000. Differences are greater and, therefore, the stakes are higher, emotions run stronger, and losses felt more deeply,\" said James Campbell, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo in New York. ABC News USA_Post_Election_Protests_v01 Campbell, whose book \"Polarized: Making Sense of a Divided America\" was published this summer, said that the stark differences that were shown in these election results are likely contributing to the fervor. \"We are so polarized that many Americans had not really come into contact with others who have opposite views. Because of this, it becomes unthinkable to those on either side that other side could win the election. This was expressed in the claims about the election being possibly rigged,\" Campbell said. Campbell said other contributing factors include the age of many of the protesters -- and this being their first presidential loss -- and the general trend that \"protests are much more commonplace on the left than on the right.\" The locations of the protests fit with Democratic strongholds, though that comes as little surprise to Georgetown University associate professor Hans Noel. \"In general, Democrats are strong in cities and in areas with larger non-white populations,\" Noel told ABC News. 0 Shares ",

Aides to Mr. Trump have declined to confirm who is on the shortlist for cabinet posts. And despite the president-elect\u2019s return to Twitter on Thursday night, he has so far said nothing specific about his possible picks. For now, Mr. Trump is firmly ensconced in Trump Tower, where he returned after his whirlwind day at the White House and Capitol Hill on Thursday. Trump Tower has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the local police. The building has now been ringed by Jersey barriers and concrete blocks marked \u201cNYPD.\u201d The Secret Service has set up checkpoints on each end of 56th Street near the tower, and pedestrian access has been restricted around the building. Photo Ivanka Trump arriving at Trump Tower on Friday. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Inside, Mr. Trump and his top aides are accelerating efforts to evaluate possible job candidates. There are some indications that the transition effort was slow to start up, perhaps the result of Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory, which caught much of the political world by surprise. At least a few of the people helping organize the search for Mr. Trump were tapped at the last minute, while others have been preparing quietly for weeks. At the Pentagon and the State Department, officials of the Obama administration said Thursday that they had not yet heard from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team about beginning the complex work of transferring responsibilities and authority. A spokesman for the State Department said he did not have \u201cany firm word\u201d on when briefings might begin for designated officials from the new government. Even as Mr. Trump moves to create a new administration, his transition team is being reshaped. It has been led by Mr. Christie since May, when Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee. The transition team was treated as something of a backwater. Mr. Trump appeared to care little about it, and the adviser who was most involved with it, Paul Manafort, left the campaign in August. Now, with Mr. Trump preparing to take office in less than 90 days, the transition work has abruptly come to life again, but with a lag in who might get slots. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For now, Mr. Pence will play a more prominent role, according to two advisers to Mr. Trump, as will Mr. Sessions. Both men have been involved in the transition since it began, but Mr. Christie\u2019s role may now change, according to the advisers. Mr. Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor, was offered a role on the team and is under consideration to lead it, according to one person briefed on the matter. Still, the pending reorganization has not stopped a steady flow of potential appointees from being mentioned. The critical position of chief of staff \u2014 the gatekeeper for the president inside the West Wing \u2014 is expected to come down to a choice between Mr. Bannon, the editor of Breitbart News who was chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and Mr. Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Giuliani told CNN on Thursday that he might accept an appointment as attorney general, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me.\u201d Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman, is said to be a serious contender for Treasury secretary (though Carl Icahn, the investor, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have also been mentioned in the news media).

    "text": "Nov 11 2016, 7:26 pm ET What Can a New Trump Administration Do to Obamacare Right Away? by Maggie Fox Trump on Obamacare: Open to Keeping Some Provisions 2:16 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161112015054if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/807065667560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The \"repeal\" of Obamacare has become the top priority for the incoming Trump administration in the chaotic week after his surprise win. The president-elect has a Republican-dominated House and Senate in Congress to help him try, but experts say full repeal won't be so easy. And it may not be what the new administration even wants now. Trump told the Wall Street Journal he would consider keeping two of its most popular provisions \u2014 one that allows adult children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans, and another that would forbid insurance companies from refusing to cover \"pre-existing conditions.\" \"I like those very much,\" the newspaper quoted Trump as saying Friday. And the Trump transition team posted a policy website with a skeleton rundown of priorities. \"A Trump Administration will work with Congress to repeal the ACA (Affordable Care Act)and replace it with a solution that includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states,\" it reads. The Obama administration is still talking up the law, announcing via Twitter on Thursday that 100,000 people signed up for coverage on the \"Obamacare\" exchanges on Wednesday, the day after the election. Best day yet this Open Enrollment. Nov 9: Over 100K plan selections on https://t.co/VvaQqwzQu6 . Consumers shopping & enrolling. #GetCovered \u2014 Sylvia Burwell (@SecBurwell) November 10, 2016 The ACA, widely known as Obamacare, has been the signature achievement of Obama's two terms. It sought to transform the unruly, expensive and inefficient U.S. health care system by stopping what were widely considered insurance company abuses, such as dumping people when their health conditions got too expensive to cover and refusing to pay for pre-existing conditions. The ACA requires health insurance companies to pay for cancer screenings, wellness checks and vaccinations with no co-pay, and it allows children to stay on their parents' policies until age 26. Related: Exit Polls Show People Unhappy With Obamacare It puts into place gradual incentives to move from a system where people pay piecemeal for health treatments and, instead, reward doctors and hospitals for keeping patients well and managing their diseases. And most of all, it sought to provide health insurance to the 15 percent of Americans who did not have it before the law passed. It's gone a long way to doing that. Only 8.9 percent of Americans now lack health insurance. Republicans actually like many of these aspects of Obamacare, which was loosely based on Mitt Romney's plan for Massachusetts when he was the Republican governor there. \"The Administration recognizes that the problems with the U.S. health care system did not begin with - and will not end with the repeal of - the ACA,\" the new Trump policy statement reads. Much of the public debate has come because the average person does not understand what Obamacare does and what it doesn't do, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and an expert on health care. \"People who think we can just repeal Obamacare and everything will be great are in for a very, very, very rude surprise.\" \"Frankly, everything that has gone wrong with the health care system for the past six years has been blamed on Obamacare,\" Jost said. \"Everything that goes wrong with the health care system for the next four years will be blamed on Trump care. People who think we can just repeal Obamacare and everything will be great are in for a very, very, very rude surprise.\" Unlikely to lose coverage in 2017 For one thing, the Trump administration is going to worry about the political risks of leaving 20 million people suddenly without health insurance. \"The number of uninsured is expected to grow to about 50 million people with 'repeal and replace',\" PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) says in a report released this week. \"Trump's challenge will be to lower that number through his replacement proposals.\" Related: Obamacare as We Know it May Be Done For And he cannot do much alone. \"The White House is just one part of a much larger machine. To really put his stamp on health policy, Trump must work with a patchwork of federal lawmakers, regulatory agencies, trade and advocacy groups, and the Supreme Court. These institutions will either accelerate or decelerate Trump's agenda,\" PwC said. The people who now have coverage on the exchanges \u2014 including people signing up right now during open enrollment \u2014 are unlikely to lose their coverage in the coming year, experts from all political viewpoints agree. \"The new administration is going to want to do something fast to show that they are keeping their promise to fundamentally change the federal role in the health care system,\" said Michael Sparer, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University. One thing a new Republican administration could do immediately is drop appeals against last May's federal court ruling that said the Obama administration was illegally paying insurance companies to help keep health insurance costs down for low-income clients. \"The new administration is going to want to do something fast to show that they are keeping their promise to fundamentally change the federal role in the health care system.\" These so-called cost sharing reductions reimburse health insurers for charging lower co-pays and deductibles for more than 60 percent of Obamacare customers. Congress refused to allocate money to do that, and a federal district judge ruled in May that the administration couldn't spend that money. The federal government kept on doing so while it appealed. Related: How Trump Could Erase Obama's Legacy Symbolic moves A new administration could stop fighting that right away, although it's not a particularly sexy issue for voters. And it might irritate health insurance companies, Jost said. \"I don't think anyone disagrees that it would be the insurers left holding the bag,\" Jost told NBC News. A new administration could also stop fighting lawsuits against the mandate that employers pay for birth control for women covered under their insurance plans, Sparer said. That might be popular with conservatives who said the requirement forced them to violate their religious beliefs. There could be symbolic moves, also. The new Republican-led Congress may immediately vote on a repeal that will almost certainly be stopped by a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. While the Democrats do not have a majority in the Senate, they have enough seats to stop some legislation with a filibuster. \"I think the only grand gesture they can make is to blame Democrats for filibustering their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\" said Jost. Sparer agreed that is likely. Republicans could campaign to get more seats in the Senate in the 2018 elections. \"That gives them a couple of years to think about what the replacement plan they want to come up with is,\" Sparer said. A new Trump Health and Human Services Department could also stop promoting open enrollment onto the Obamacare exchanges, which closes at the end of January \u201410 days after Inauguration Day. Enrollment usually spikes right at the deadline, and simply stopping outreach could hit numbers. Related: Obamacare Premiums Are Up But What Does That Mean? In fact, doing nothing could accomplish a lot, said Jost. \"It has been a full court press by the Obama administration since 2010 to get this thing implemented and it has taken a Herculean effort,\" Jost said. \"As soon as it stops moving forward, it could start moving backward pretty quickly. Almost just by doing nothing there could be some very negative effects.\" \"I think the only grand gesture they can make is to blame Democrats for filibustering their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\" Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute, says Republicans plan to use the budget process to tweak the law. \"I would look to the reconciliation package,\" he told NBC News. \"This is the mechanism for how we move forward on this.\" Re-branding with a new plan Budget issues can pass the Senate with a simple majority, bypassing Democrats who may object, although they must go through a lengthy process involving committees. Troy said the GOP has been discussing ways to provide a transition period so as not to throw the health insurance and health care industries into chaos. \"What I always hear is that Republicans have no plans on replacing the Affordable Care Act. I think that is not only untrue, but unfair,\" Troy said. An immediate target may be the unpopular exchanges, the web-based system for buying health insurance. Troy says they are unnecessary, and changing them up would be an easy way for Republicans to re-brand Obamacare. \"People can get health care without exchanges,\" he said. \"People can get health care without exchanges.\" Trump has put forward the idea of allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines, and Troy said that could lower costs by creating more competition, although it will be a messy task to undertake since insurance is now firmly regulated by states. Trump's also advocated the use of health savings accounts and tax credits to help people pay for health insurance, although experts such as Jost say it's not clear how those would help low-income people. The mandate to buy health insurance is another obvious target for a new administration, even though Republicans originally supported the idea. It's there to try to ensure that enough healthy people buy health insurance so that companies can profitably pay for the sick, but it's been seen as onerous. And it hasn't worked well as an incentive, said Caroline Pearson of consultancy Avalere Health. Simply dropping enforcement of the mandate would be popular and easy, while causing little damage to existing coverage. Maggie Fox ",

    "text": "By Amy Goldstein November 11 at 5:30 PM Follow @goldsteinamy During the brief period since his election, President-elect Donald Trump has begun to revise his health-care agenda in ways that conform more closely to the heart of Republican thinking in recent decades. On the presidential transition website, at greatagain.gov , antiabortion statements and policy positions have appeared that were not part of the campaign\u2019s health-care platform. Other proposals have been deleted. Erasing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a set of policies long favored by conservatives remain at the core of the agenda. But in his first interview as president-elect, Trump significantly softened his language for the ACA\u2019s fate, telling the Wall Street Journal on Friday, \u201cEither Obamacare will be amended or repealed and replaced.\u201d He mentioned just two parts of the law to keep, both favored by House Republicans despite their eagerness to axe the law. Trump reiterated his support for a rule forbidding insurers to refuse coverage to people with preexisting medical problems. And he said young adults should be able to stay on their parents insurance policies until 26 \u2014 an aspect he did not discuss during the campaign. [Trump\u2019s health-care positions as a candidate] On the transition website, the first two lines in a set of bullet points say that the Trump administration will protect health-care workers from being required to perform services that violate their religious or moral beliefs and that it will \u201cprotect innocent human life from conception to natural death.\u201d Neither had figured among the campaign\u2019s health-care positions. Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat still might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Conversely, the website omits what had been the Republican nominee\u2019s call for Congress to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from countries where they are sold at lower prices. This idea has long been favored by Democratic lawmakers but repeatedly blocked by Republicans. The idea of drugs crossing U.S. borders could be construed as conflicting with the president-elect\u2019s support of trade barriers, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. But Cannon acknowledged that, overall, Trump\u2019s \u201chealth-care machinations have been a black box for me.\u201d According to insiders to the transition, the shifts in the agenda primarily reflect the views of people chosen to help handle his ascension to the Oval Office, not a deliberate strategy by Trump to align with the GOP majorities in the House and Senate. [ Is Paul Ryan already eyeing Medicare cuts? ] Many of the ideas, including the \u201cconscience clause\u201d for health-care workers, mirror the positions of the Heritage Foundation. Edwin Feulner, the conservative think tank\u2019s former president, has a prominent role in the transition for domestic policy. So does Kenneth Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state who is a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and serves on boards of other conservative organizations. The tweaked health-care agenda \u201cis certainly moving in the direction of traditional Republican thinking,\u201d said Gail Wilensky, a veteran health-policy expert who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush and has not conferred with the Trump post-election team. \u201cNot with a fulsome leap, but he\u2019s definitely moved in that direction.\u201d During the campaign, for instance, the candidate\u2019s platform did not address the future of Medicare, the vast federal insurance program for older or disabled Americans. The program has been strained financially for years, and the trust fund that pays for Medicare patients\u2019 hospital care is forecast to become insolvent in a dozen years. Before his election, Trump said repeatedly that he would not cut or change the program. \u201cI\u2019m leaving it the way it is,\u201d he said in May. 1 of 22 ",

He says Omarosa, 42, has in abundance the quality Trump values most of all: Total loyalty. \"She never wavered on loyalty to him, no matter what happened. And he honors loyalty,\" Hogg says. \"I\u00a0do think she'd be a strong candidate in the African-American community. \u00a0She\u2019s a hard worker, you can like her or not,\u00a0but no one can say she doesn\u2019t work hard.\" Spike Lee calls out Omarosa Manigault over her new appointment to Trump's campaign A more sour assessment comes from business consultant Kwame Jackson, who was the second-to-last-man standing on Season I (he lost to Bill Rancic) and who spent the campaign on cable news criticizing Trump. Donald Trump with his daughter-in-law Lara Trump (L) and Omarosa Manigault (R) in Charlotte, N.C. on Oct. 14,  2016. \u00a0(Photo: ERIK S. LESSER, EPA) \"I don\u2019t think Omarosa should get any job, I am not a fan of her work or her ideals,\" says Jackson, 42. \"Appointing her to direct African-American outreach is like appointing Benedict Arnold to lead the Revolutionary Army.\" There is no confirmation that Manigault will be tapped by Trump nor any discussion yet about what her job might be . But she is being \"mentioned,\" as the pols say in Washington, especially by Omarosa herself. Omarosa Manigault named head of black outreach for Trump campaign On election night, she told The Hollywood Reporter \u00a0that Trump asked her if she was \"ready to come with me to Washington.\" On Wednesday, she tweeted a picture of herself with a poster of Trump. \"My last briefing as senior adviser to #realDonaldTrump for campaign.\" At least two wags on Twitter are already pushing \"#ApprenticeCabinet.\" I fully expect Bill Rancic, Penn Gilette & Omarosa to be appointed to key positions in the Trump administration \uf609 #ApprenticeCabinet \u2014 RussChrusciel (@dbug4) November 9, 2016 It's not a totally off-the-wall possibility: Manigault was appointed Trump's adviser on outreach to African Americans in July. Trump still lost the black vote to Hillary Clinton, but not by as much as Mitt Romney did to Barack Obama in the 2012 campaign. \"It's higher than Romney but it's still single digits,\" says Jackson. \"She doesn't have resonance in the black community.\" Among the jobs Manigault could be suited for: Minority and millennial outreach, business outreach, communications and White House spokesperson, protocol, or just as a vaguely-defined \"senior adviser\" \u00a0or \"trusted confidant,\" as Valerie Jarrett has been for the two terms of the Obama administration. \u201cAs Donald says, I am his Valerie Jarrett,\u201d said Manigault during a one-on-one-interview \u00a0at a business conference for multicultural women in June. She's no policy poseur: Manigault once worked for Vice President Al Gore in the Bill Clinton White House. She's a church pastor, possesses\u00a0a PhD\u00a0in communications, and is\u00a0an undisputed self-marketing whiz. She is certainly the most famous previously unknown\u00a0castmember to come out of the\u00a0Apprentice\u00a0powerhouse. Omarosa: Trump already has an enemies list But she's also famous for clashing with practically everybody on the show, including celebrity castmembers such as Piers Morgan and La Toya Jackson . Like Trump, she was often caustic and unfiltered,\u00a0with little patience for anyone she considered a fool.\u00a0And a lot of people seemed foolish to her. Her post-Apprentice years have featured more clashes, including with the family of her late fiance , actor Michael Clarke Duncan, over his will. After she was appointed to Trump's campaign, Spike Lee attacked her in a dramatic way:\u00a0He posted a sideways\u00a0 photograph of Manigault \u00a0wearing a clown nose. \"Omarosa grew up a fighter her entire life, she's not going to back down,\" says Hogg. \"She's\u00a0always going to give her opinion; it's one of her strengths and\u00a0sometimes it\u00a0can hurt her. \"She's always prepared to be the villain.\" 1643 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fktOqq ",

    "text": "Pence replaces Christie in Trump transition team shuffle Published               November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Vice President-elect Mike Pence is taking over White House transition efforts from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2013 one of a host of changes announced Friday by President-elect Donald Trump as he works quickly to form his administration-in-waiting. Pence will now serve as chairman of the transition team. Christie, the scandal-scarred governor who has supported Trump ever since dropping his own 2016 presidential bid, will remain on board \u2013 only in a lesser role, as one of several transition vice chairs. \u201cTogether this outstanding group of advisors, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, will build on the initial work done under the leadership of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThe mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington.\u201d The decision marks Trump\u2019s biggest personnel move since being elected president. Speculation is widespread over whom he will consider for the highest-profile Cabinet and White House positions in his administration, but the first order of business was sorting out the team leading those discussions. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump expressed gratitude for the New Jersey governor's support in his election night acceptance speech. But in recent weeks, Christie\u2019s reputation has taken more hits from the scandal involving staffers who shut down several lanes of the George Washington Bridge in September 2013 to punish a political rival. Two more aides were found guilty of involvement in a trial where Christie's own knowledge of the closures repeatedly was called into question.\u00a0 Christie has maintained his innocence and said the outcome of the trial confirmed his past statements that those aides were responsible. It\u2019s unclear where the controversy goes from here, but Christie is set to continue serving as Trump transition vice chair along with Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Jeff Sessions. The news comes as Trump himself was in New York for discussions on his future administration team.\u00a0 Trump also announced Friday that several other big names would join the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee, including: his finance chairman Steven Mnuchin; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus; campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon; and children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump. Some of those figures are also seen as potential prospects for key administration posts.\u00a0 Sessions\u2019 chief of staff Rick Dearborn will be executive director of the transition team.\u00a0 Fox News' Dan Gallo contributed to this report.

    "text": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook against criticism that it doesn't vet fake news in its News Feed. Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook against criticism that it doesn't vet fake news in its News Feed. Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg says the notion that fake news influenced the U.S. presidential election is \"a pretty crazy idea.\" The Facebook CEO is finding himself in a unique position in this election cycle. Many news organizations have come under fire for their coverage of the campaign. Now Facebook is getting it too, as a modern media company that does not vet fake news from its News Feed and that, critics argue, allows users to stay in information bubbles that reinforce existing prejudices. Zuckerberg took both these criticisms head-on yesterday, at a conference called Techonomy . (You can find the full interview on his Facebook feed .) Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016? He says hoaxes existed before his platform was created. They aren't new, and people who say misinformation is why Donald Trump won simply do not get it. \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news,\" Zuckerberg says. He also says his company has studied fake news and found it's a \"very small volume\" of the content on Facebook. He did not specify if that content is more or less viral or impactful than other information. Weeks back Facebook algorithms accidentally promoted to \"trending news\" a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pledging her support for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Article continues after sponsorship In Wake Of Shootings, Facebook Struggles To Define Hate Speech Zuckerberg also said his team has studied the filter bubble effect and the research shows that almost everyone has some friend on the other side of the aisle. A Democrat may think there's no Republican in his News Feed, but there likely is. The social network's ability to connect people makes it \"inherently more diverse\" than the major news stations of 20 years back, Zuckerberg says. He says right now the problem is not that diverse information isn't there. It's there more than it was in the days of traditional media. The problem, he says, is that people don't click on things that don't conform to their worldview. And, he says, \"I don't know what to do about that.\" Facebook is not a free speech platform. It has a long list of rules, called Community Standards , of things you're not allowed to say or share. Naked pictures of children are a well-known example. With 'Napalm Girl,' Facebook Humans (Not Algorithms) Struggle To Be Editor During this election cycle, Zuckerberg personally intervened to change the rules. When Trump called for a ban on all Muslims, it was clearly hate speech, as defined by Facebook guidelines. But the CEO ordered his staff to not take it down because it was newsworthy. That example is just one illustration of the extraordinary power Zuckerberg has amassed to decide what news is. And from his talk, it's clear that he's thinking about how to wield this power. \"When we started, the north star for us was: We're building a safe community,\" Zuckerberg says. He thought about how to control for bullies. One of the things that has shifted, he says, is that now news is a more important part of Facebook content. \"We're still working through what that means.\" ",

    "text": "Snapchat Spectacles: video is sketchy but really, so what? Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY 4:54 p.m. EST November 11, 2016 x Share Jefferson Graham reviews the new Snapchat Spectacles video sunglasses, a fun toy that lets you shoot 10-second video clips hands free, on #TalkingTech. Video by Jefferson Graham Comedin Nemr Abou Nassar sports a pair of Snapchat Spectacles (Photo: Jefferson Graham) LOS ANGELES \u2014 For a short span Thursday, consumers got a chance to buy Snapchat's new $129 Spectacles. Within a few hours, they were gone. USA TODAY wasn't one of the lucky ones, even after\u00a0a two-hour wait , but we got to borrow a pair to test out. Here's the download. The specs let you record on-the-fly 10-second video clips that can be played back in the updated Snapchat app, for more spontaneous, on-the-moments. The glasses are stylish and a whole lot of fun. Snapchat has done a great job at making the operation drop-dead simple. But if you're looking for great video quality, stick with a camera or smartphone. The clips are low-res and really jerky \u2014 shooting from your eyes doesn't allow for any steadiness help from the hands. Like Google Glass, the late, $1,500 and since discontinued futuristic eyewear, Spectacles are meant to capture moments wherever we are, and that could create for awkward times. I wore them to the gym and picked up a clip walking in the door, which meant I was probably invading everyone's personal space. (I deleted it.) Moments in restaurants, bars and other open settings would have to also be considered intrusive. I see folks using Spectacles in social situations, but buyer beware: if used at a party or other evening gathering, the video quality will be pretty poor; at least it was for me when I shot inside. (The camera does better in daylight.) Actress Angell Conwell sports Snapchat Spectacles \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) But then again, no one is buying Spectacles for great video quality. They want Spectacles because they're colorful, cool and for the time being, represent an instant status symbol status, because they are so rare. x Share Snapchat's hard to get video glasses, Spectacles, went on sale Thursday in a vending machine on the beach in California. They sold out within 4 hours. Jefferson Graham reports Snapchat is selling Spectacles not online, or at retail, but via a bright yellow vending machine attached to yellow balloons that will just show\u00a0up unannounced. The Snap Bot appeared on the Venice Beach boardwalk Thursday for the first time and attracted long, long lines. Each bot will only make its appearance for one-24-hour period, says Snapchat and there's no word for where it\u2019s headed to next. Check spectacles.com and scroll to the bottom of the page, for the \"Find a Bot\" section to see if there's a Bot sighting in your neighborhood. As of this writing, no new sightings have been scheduled. Jarek Khan has fun with the new Snapchat Spectacles, which records in circular video \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) Spectacles basics: Begin by charging the specs. You need to connect the USB to the back of the glasses case. Once done, pair the glasses with the Snapchat app (again, make sure to update to the latest IOS or Android version.) Once charged, click the right button atop the glasses, and it starts recording 10-second video snippets of our lives. You'll know, and those around you will know, that\u00a0you're recording\u00a0because a light goes in a circular motion to indicate recording status. People wait in line to buy Snapchat's Spectacles, available Thursday. \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) The clips themselves get wirelessly sent to Snapchat, where you can view, share and save them to your camera roll. The video is in a new, circular format. But on Snapchat, they are processed and flattened. Outside Snapchat, they're round. Again, the video looks fine on Snapchat, but if you save and send them to your computer for viewing on a bigger screen, not so good. Not that I really cared, nor do I think anyone else will. Spectacles is a\u00a0fun toy, and easily the must-have gift of the holiday season--if you can find one. Good luck.
