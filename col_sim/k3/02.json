Got it At a rally in Dade City, Fla., Nov. 1, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton deplored how Republican rival Donald Trump has treated women like Alicia Machado. \u201cWe cannot hide from this,\u201d Clinton said. (Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post; Video: The Washington Post) By John Wagner , Jenna Johnson and Jose A. DelReal November 2 at 12:06 AM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @wpjenna Follow jdelreal DADE CITY, Fla. \u2014 Hillary Clinton and her allies on Tuesday intensified their attacks on Donald Trump\u2019s character and temperament, as they sought to shift scrutiny away from news that the FBI had revived an investigation into her email practices at the State Department. As part of that effort, Clinton made her most direct appeal yet for women to reject Trump\u2019s candidacy during a campaign stop in Dade City, where she recounted a litany of degrading remarks he made about women and referencing the allegations of unwanted sexual advances against him. Calling her Republican rival \u201csomeone who wants to bully us,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee was introduced at the rally by Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe whom Trump berated in the 1990s for gaining weight after she won the title. Machado \u2014 whom Trump again attacked after the first presidential debate \u2014 grew emotional while speaking about Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks and said she fought disorders in the subsequent years. [ Clinton\u2019s email trouble is a conversation starter for Republicans in tight races ] Later, in Sanford, Fla., Clinton blasted the GOP nominee for failing to pay federal incomes taxes and assuring he lacks the temperament to control the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Trump, meanwhile, rebuffed those efforts by attacking her over the emails during a rally Tuesday in Eau Claire, Wis., saying that her election would provoke an \u201cunprecedented constitutional crisis.\u201d Trump said a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring work in Washington to an \u201cunglorious halt\u201d and called the email controversy the \u201cbiggest scandal since Watergate.\u201d \u201cShe is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in a very large-scale criminal trial,\u201d Trump said. The crowd at Trump\u2019s rally erupted into chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at several points through the speech. News that the FBI is renewing its probe into the potential mishandling of classified material in Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state has roiled the closing days of the 201 presidential contest, and many public surveys show the race has tightened. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing into Clinton\u2019s tenure at State has been discovered by the FBI or in several Republican congressional investigations. Earlier in the day, during a campaign event in King of Prussia, Pa., Trump focused his remarks at the Affordable Care Act and again promised to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. \u201cWhen we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace,\u201d Trump said. (There appears to be no necessity for a \u201cspecial session\u201d on Capitol Hill. The current Congress will reconvene soon after the election. And early next year, the new one will gavel in.) [ Trump is back on script as the race tightens. Will that last? ] At a rally in Eau Claire, Wis., Nov. 1, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said \u201cthe work of government would grind to an unbelievably inglorious halt\u201d if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton became president. (The Washington Post) But Trump shifted away from talking about health care in Wisconsin: \u201cYou know, somehow I think that Obamacare is not going to be her biggest problem. Does that make sense?\u201d Trump quipped in Wisconsin. \u201cShe wants to blame everybody else for her mounting legal troubles, but really she doesn\u2019t have anyone to blame but herself.\u201d Looking toward Election Day, the Clinton campaign is seeking to shore up support in several states where she had maintained comfortable margins so far. While Clinton\u2019s schedule in coming days is focused mainly to battleground states where polls have been close, the campaign announced Tuesday that she would be visiting Michigan later this week \u2014 an announcement which raised questions about her strength in a state she is largely expected to win. Democrats said Clinton is not overly concerned about the state but is trying to shore up support in the Detroit area as a precaution. (Clinton has been leading in recent polls by 7 percent there, according to the RealClearPolitics average and in 2012, President Obama pulled away in the closing week and won the state by nearly 10 percentage points.) The Clinton campaign deployed reinforcements throughout battleground states Tuesday, where Trump\u2019s temperament and character remained at the center of their speeches. President Obama himself held an event on Clinton\u2019s behalf on Tuesday \u2014 part of an all-hands-on-deck roster of high-profile surrogates including Vice President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former president Bill Clinton. Obama took sharp aim at Trump\u2019s temperament during his speech in Columbus, Ohio, calling into question whether Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior made him fit to be commander in chief. Addressing men specifically, the president asked the crowd to consider the role that sexism may play in the election. \u201cI want you to think about it because she is so much better qualified than the other guy. She has conducted herself so much better in public life than the other guy,\u201d Obama said. He also said that Trump had shown no interest in working people before entering the presidential race. \u201cThe notion that this guy is your champion, the notion that this guy is going to fight for working people, when his entire life he didn\u2019t have time for anybody who wasn\u2019t rich or a celebrity, who wouldn\u2019t let you get into one of his hotels unless you were cleaning the room,\u201d Obama said, \u201cCome on. This guy is going to be your champion?\u201d Clinton spoke at length in Dade City about the allegations against Trump and said that he has revealed himself to have little respect for women by \u201cdemeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting\u201d them. She said that Trump\u2019s comments and the accusations have brought back \u201cpainful\u201d memories of similar experiences for women across the country. \u201cLook at what he does. He calls women ugly, disgusting, nasty, all the time. He calls women pigs, rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10,\u201d Clinton told told the crowd. At one point, she detailed accusations from former beauty pageant contestants that Trump would walk into the dressing rooms to \u201cinspect them.\u201d \u201cNow, as bad as that is, he didn\u2019t just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant, he\u2019s also been accused of doing this at the Miss Teen USA pageant,\u201d Clinton told the crowd. \u201cWe cannot hide from this. We\u2019ve got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America!\u201d [ Clinton: Trump has been \u2018degrading, insulting and assaulting\u2019 women for 30 years ] How Trump treats women became a heated campaign issue last month, when an 11-year-old recording surfaced in which he made lewd comments and claims about women. Trump dismissed the recording, calling it \u201clocker room talk.\u201d But since the tape surfaced, 12 women have come forward claiming the billionaire had made unwanted sexual advances upon them. Trump has repeatedly denied those charges, and he has raised the sexual exploits of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\u2019s efforts to protect his political future as a political counter-argument. During an evening rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a man carrying a sign sought to interrupt Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech and began to shout, \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist!\u201d Apparently in response, she offered an indictment of Trump and his supporters. \u201cI am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we are going forward into a brighter future.\u201d She added that the issue of how women are treated could have implications well beyond the election. \u201cI want all the girls in America to know you are valuable, you should feel good about yourselves,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cDon\u2019t let somebody like this bully tell you otherwise. And I want to say to all the young boys, show respect because that shows you are real man.\u201d The Clinton campaign released a new ad Tuesday featuring clips of Trump speaking about women in disparaging ways. Aides said the ad will air in eight targeted states, including Arizona, a heavily Republican state where Clinton is making a late play. Her campaign also plans to begin airing its first television ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico and will return to the airwaves in Virginia and Colorado after a months-long hiatus, a campaign official said. Recent polls have shown Clinton leading in those states. All four states will see a six-figure investment, according to a campaign official. Her campaign has raised a record-breaking $11.3 million online in the last 72 hours, according to a campaign official, money that could prove crucial down the stretch. \u201cThe Trump campaign claims their path to White House is through states like these but we\u2019re going to make sure those doors remain shut,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, Clinton\u2019s deputy national press secretary. [ Post-ABC Tracking Poll: Trump 46, Clinton 45, as Democratic enthusiasm dips ] In a statement, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, characterized the Clinton\u2019s new ad reservations as a defensive move. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that in the final week of this campaign it is actually the Clinton campaign being put on defense and being forced to start advertising in so-called \u2018blue states\u2019 to hold off Mr. Trump\u2019s surge in the polls, including two states the Clinton campaign boasted of having put away months ago,\u201d Miller said. The Trump campaign announced it was also investing $25 million in advertising across 12 states, including New Mexico and Michigan. But it did not say how much would go to each location. A Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Trump at 46 percent and Clinton 45 percent in a four-way contest. The poll finds little shift in Clinton\u2019s overall support following news of the FBI\u2019s renewed look at her emails, but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Trump in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. Clinton still leads Trump by an average of four points in Colorado, five points in Virginia, seven points in New Mexico, and seven points in Michigan according to RealClearPolitics. [ Election maps are telling you big lies about small things ] Speaking to reporters en route to Florida, a senior Clinton aide said that the campaign does not believe the renewed scrutiny by the FBI is hurting Clinton\u2019s standing in the polls. \u201cThe race has tightened the way that we thought it would tighten but \u2026 we do not see anything that would suggest that the FBI story is impacting our support,\u201d said the aide, who requested anonymity to speak more freely about campaign strategy. Asked why Clinton is spending so much time in Florida, the aide said: \u201cIt\u2019s a state that we think we\u2019ll win. It\u2019s a state that Trump has to win. \u2026 Obviously we don\u2019t think he has any path without Florida.\u201d Wagner reported from Dade City, Fla.; DelReal reported from Washington.

Alison Meuse/NPR hide caption toggle caption Young people pose at \"I Heart Damascus\" in Omayyad Square, in the capital of Syria. Alison Meuse/NPR At Damascus University, Syria's oldest and largest institution of higher education, students casually stroll the sprawling campus. Female students sport salon-fresh locks or smart white headscarves. Skinny jeans are still in fashion. The sounds are of fountains and chirping birds, not of bombs. A na\u00efve tourist could be forgiven for forgetting there is a brutal war tearing apart Aleppo, a city 200 miles to the north, or that armed opposition groups continue to have a foothold in the capital itself. But there are no tourists here. My NPR colleague Peter Kenyon and I were at the university for a government-approved conference this week, which offered a rare opportunity for foreign journalists to visit Damascus. As a journalist based in Beirut, covering Syria for the past 4 1/2 years, I spend hours each day communicating via Skype, Whatsapp and Facebook with Syrians suffering the unimaginable: hunger, bombings and siege. Some are living in areas surrounded and under fire by hard-line opposition groups, others by ISIS, and still more, are under attack by their own government. Article continues after sponsorship For Foreign Journalists, A Rare Invitation To Damascus As I leave the campus and walk through the streets of Damascus, bustling with cars, couples and children, I wonder how many of the capital's residents have grown used to the strange paradox of life during wartime. Did they lose a brother serving in the army or perhaps in a rebel brigade? How many had relatives kidnapped by the gangs that have sprung up amid the chaos? Maybe they had a son or daughter thrown in prison for joining the protests in those early days of the uprising in 2011. I wonder if they changed their minds about the upheaval when they saw hard-line jihadists rise to prominence and vow to take their cosmopolitan city. Do they believe it was the government's crackdown that pushed the protesters to arms and drove throngs of young dreamers from the country? Many here seem to be carrying on with grace and dignity, even enjoying mundane, simple pleasures \u2014 like the teenage girls and a 40-something man snapping selfies in front of a giant \"I (Heart) Damascus\" sculpture in a main square. Enlarge this image Syrian students on campus at a Damascus University in 2012, a year after the war started. Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images Syrian students on campus at a Damascus University in 2012, a year after the war started. Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images At the phone carrier, Syriatel, the salesman helping me set up a local cell number asked if I could be patient while he helped two trainees, a man and a woman, learn the ropes. It was a good opportunity to register a mobile to someone with a foreign passport, in this case, a U.S. passport. He walked us through each step, gently reminding them to get the passport number right and asking with care if I wanted an \"nice number\" \u2014 one easy to memorize. When the time came to pay, I realized I was just short of the Syrian pounds needed. There would be no credit card fallback or paying in dollars like I can in neighboring Lebanon. In Syria, cash is king; sanctions have stifled whatever global financial engagement the country was adopting before the war. Maybe the Syriatel salesman blamed the U.S. government for imposing sanctions, but if so, he didn't let on. Almost bashful, he told me not to worry and that I could come back anytime before closing to bring the money. So began my odyssey to find a place to change my American dollars. After going along the street from bank to bank, holding out hope for the Lebanese branches, I realized I'd have to go across town to the Central Bank district, where I'd find exchange offices. I flagged down a cab, agreeing to pay him at the end of our errands. We wound through Damascus traffic, finally arriving at our destination, a private exchange office on a tree-lined street, in sight of the imposing Central Bank. Changing $500 to be safe, I received in return wads of Syrian 500-pound notes bound in rubber bands. The teller handed me a black plastic bag to keep my transaction out of sight and a receipt, signed and stamped, with the official exchange rate of 514 Syrian pounds to the dollar. The government maintains this rate despite the existence of the black market, which pays slightly better. Back to my cab and I was on my way again through traffic, back at Syriatel to deliver the 4,000 Syrian pounds I owed. The salesman and his trainees smiled graciously and I went out the door, feeling more conscious of how cut off we were from the rest of the world. It was time to get back to the British Syrian Society conference my colleague and I were attending. I had missed the panel on the impact of sanctions. ",

The latest revelations come after the FBI revealed on Friday it was reviewing a new batch of emails that appeared to be \"pertinent\" to their suspended investigation into Clinton's use of a private server \u2014 and multiple federal sources told NBC News they were found as part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl. The FBI did not describe the nature of the emails. FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch speak to the media at the Justice Department in Washington on Nov. 19, 2015. Yuri Gripas / REUTERS file The Justice Department originally was opposed to the FBI's plan to notify Congress about the discovery of the new emails, according to senior officials familiar with the discussions. However, Comey concluded that it was better to inform Congress sooner rather than wait until after the election. \"In the end, we decided it was better to keep Congress informed,\" an FBI official involved in the process told NBC News on Saturday. Weiner is the estranged husband of Abedin. The emails, the sources said, were found on the household laptop. Abedin, through her lawyer, said she would cooperate with authorities but has not yet been contacted by the FBI. She said she found out from press reports that the FBI was looking at emails on her husband's laptop. Halimah Abdullah ",

On Tuesday, the campaign announced it was purchasing $25 million in TV ads for the final week in blue states like New Mexico and Michigan -- both of which Trump has visited in the last few days -- along with more obvious swing states like Ohio and Florida. They also are staying on the air in battleground states like Virginia and Colorado where the campaign has struggled to stay competitive in public polls. With one week to go, the question is whether this is a move borne out of strength or desperation. The Trump campaign has argued that the moves reflect their confidence that recent news of further FBI inquiry into emails by Clinton aide Huma Abedin obtained from an investigation into estranged husband Anthony Weiner has set the stage for a breakthrough. \"While Mr. Trump continues to climb in the polls and accelerate outreach in states like Michigan and New Mexico that are rarely won by Republican Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton is preoccupied fighting the sitting FBI Director and President Obama over yet another email scandal,\" Trump's digital director Brad Parscale said in a statement announcing the buy. As Democrats and some Republicans were quick to note, though, there's a long tradition of campaigns behind in the polls making a last-second move into unusual states. \"I think it's a reflection of how weak his prospects are as opposed to any sign of strength,\" Mitch Stewart, who served as Obama's battleground director in the last presidential campaign. \"It reminds me of Romney making late plays in Michigan and Pennsylvania in 2012.\" Play Analysis: Where Does the Electoral College Map Stand? 1:06 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161102165040if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/798626883859\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Regardless of the motive, the Clinton campaign and its allies made clear they wouldn't let Trump push into states uncontested. On Tuesday, they announced six-figure buys in Michigan, New Mexico, Virginia, and Colorado. Priorities USA, a top Democratic super PAC, is also going on the air in Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin, where the Clinton campaign recently bought ad time. \"The Trump campaign claims their path to White House is through states like these but we're going to make sure those doors remain shut,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in a statement. State and national polling has been relatively scarce since the news of the FBI investigation broke. While there have been no substantive revelations concerning Clinton's use of a private account, the news of the new emails has fueled a partisan war over director James Comey's decision to make the discovery public. What we know so far about the political fallout is mixed: An NBC News| SurveyMonkey poll showed the race unchanged and Clinton holding a 6-point lead, but other polls show Trump gaining in recent days, even before the FBI story. And a Washington Post/ABC daily tracking poll even gave Trump a 1-point lead on Tuesday. Clinton still maintains a lead in national polling averages as well as key states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Colorado that would put her past the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.

But a battleground map sent to supporters in a fundraising email on Tuesday showed New Mexico still blue, while Michigan was a \"toss up\" state. And it said that Trump was \"close\" in states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Colorado rather than winning. Trump campaign sources told NBC New that while the latest ad buy reflected improved polling in some states like New Mexico, the main purpose was to project confidence in the final days by going \"on offense\" rather than be portrayed as fighting to gain ground in existing battleground states. Jon Cavanagh, a pollster with Michigan-based EPIC-MRA, sounded confused by Trump's recent interest in the state given that surveys have consistently showed him down throughout the race by between 5 and 11 points. \"I'm not real sure what to make of it,\" he said. He noted an online poll by Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll conducted since the FBI news found Clinton up by 6, consistent with their findings the week before and polling averages of the state. New Mexico, where polling has been infrequent, may be even more of a reach thanks to its substantial Latino population. Trump's longstanding calls for a border wall and mass deportations have largely derailed outreach efforts and early vote patterns in several states already show a surge in Latino turnout . \"Trump pressing into those states now is the political equivalent of throwing a Hail Mary from his own five yard line,\" Republican pollster Chris Wilson said in an e-mail. \"For a Hail Mary to work, you have to have at least moved the ball down the field prior to the desperate throw.\" Play ",

City Council approves Frank Gehry's project on the Sunset Strip 8150 Sunset Gehry Partners, LLP The Los Angeles City Council voted 13-0 Tuesday to approve a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards. Above, a model rendering of the project. The Los Angeles City Council voted 13-0 Tuesday to approve a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards. Above, a model rendering of the project. (Gehry Partners, LLP) Alice Walton Contact Reporter The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry that will anchor the eastern edge of the Sunset Strip.\u00a0 The relatively swift approval of the project Tuesday was a contrast to last week\u2019s three-hour discussion on the famed architect\u2019s design for 8150 Sunset Blvd. The five-building complex at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards will include two residential towers, terraced gardens and a shopping center.\u00a0 Elected officials for both Los Angeles and West Hollywood as well as some neighborhood groups had voiced concern about the project, which originally included a 234-foot-tall tower. Critics believed the tower would be out of scale with the neighborhood. Others worried the project would bring too much traffic to an already busy intersection.\u00a0 Why a Frank Gehry project on the Sunset Strip doesn't appeal to some Hollywood residents A proposal for two towers, one rising 15 stories, terraced gardens and 334,000 square feet of retail is meeting stiff resistance from Hollywood\u00a0residents. A proposal for two towers, one rising 15 stories, terraced gardens and 334,000 square feet of retail is meeting stiff resistance from Hollywood\u00a0residents. See more videos But at last week\u2019s Planning and Land Use Management Committee meeting , the developer, Townscape Partners, agreed to reduce its tallest tower to 178 feet and\u00a0add more affordable housing and more parking spaces. It will also provide $2 million to ease traffic congestion. The project will have 229 residential units, including 38 for low-income families. There will be 65,000 square feet of commercial space and a pedestrian plaza.\u00a0 Many of those changes came after the area\u2019s councilman, David Ryu, released a lengthy letter outlining his concerns over the density and height of the development.\u00a0 \u201cCompromise is never easy but it\u2019s a core value of our city and democracy,\u201d said Ryu, who represents this stretch of the Sunset Strip. \u201cWhile this compromise isn\u2019t perfect, 8150 Sunset Blvd. is a much better project today.\u201d\u00a0 One issue that has yet to be decided is what will happen with the Lytton Savings building on the project site. The building, which is currently a Chase bank, was designed by architect\u00a0Kurt Meyer in 1960. It was nominated for historic-cultural landmark status but council members have delayed a vote on its landmark status until November.\u00a0 If the City Council votes to preserve the bank building, it could be incorporated into Gehry\u2019s design or moved to a new location.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the FBI would have to find to press charges against Hillary Clinton , Frank Gehry\u2019s controversial development is approved , two Des Moines officers were shot to death , and the Cubs push a game 7 of the World Series .

Matt Slocum/AP The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 9-3 in Game 6 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. The best-of-seven Series is now even at three games each. The decisive Game 7 will be played Wednesday in Cleveland. The Cubs were led by starter Jake Arrieta who gave up two runs and three hits in five-plus innings. He struck out nine and walked three Indians batters. He also had the luxury of watching teammate Addison Russell collect 6 RBIs, with a two-run double in the first inning and a grand slam in the third. Chicago struck early, scoring three runs in the top of the first inning with a two-out solo home run by Kris Bryant, followed by Russell's double on a fly ball that was mis-played by the Indians outfielders. The Cubs blew the game open in the third inning when they loaded the bases on a walk and two singles, chasing Indians starter Josh Tomlin. Cleveland reliever Dan Otero promptly gave up a grand slam to Russell. The Indians showed sporadic signs of life. They threatened to get back in the game in the fourth inning with a double by Jason Kipnis and an RBI single by Mike Napoli. They loaded the bases, but Cubs starter Jake Arrieta worked out of the jam.

Phillip/AP The Indians got another run on a solo home run by Kipnis in the fifth inning. Article continues after sponsorship Arrieta was pulled from the game after getting two outs in the sixth inning. Cubs reliever Mike Montgomery got the third out. The Cubs appeared to slam the door shut in the ninth inning when Anthony Rizzo smacked a two-run homer to right field, making the score 9-2. But the Indians scored one more in the ninth when Roberto Perez hit an RBI single before getting thrown out at second base trying to stretch out a double. Despite his team's lead throughout the game, Chicago manager Joe Maddon made it clear he was taking no chances in allowing Chicago to stage a comeback. He brought in his flame-throwing reliever Aroldis Chapman in the seventh inning when the Indians were threatening again. Chapman induced a ground out by Indians Francisco Lindor. Chapman pitched into the ninth inning, giving up one run and one hit. He threw 20 pitches and the question many will ask is, how much does he have left for Game 7? The final game will feature a showdown between Indians ace Corey Kluber, the winning pitcher of Games 1 and 4, and Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. ",

In a draft recommendation, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says all children ages 6 and older should be screened for obesity. (Radius TWC) Karen Kaplan Contact Reporter The fight against childhood obesity should begin in doctors\u2019 offices with routine weight screening for all kids ages 6 and up, according to fresh\u00a0advice from health experts. Draft guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force urge pediatricians and other clinicians to check the body mass index of children and adolescents to identify patients who would benefit from weight counseling programs. These \u201ccomprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions\u201d have been shown to help participants change the trajectory of their weight gain, cutting their odds of a lifetime of obesity. For kids, the official definition of obesity is having a body mass index in the top 5% for one\u2019s age and gender, based on official growth charts. Ideally, that means only 5% of children and teens are obese. But in America today, 17% of kids have a BMI high enough to fit that description. (Another 32% are overweight, with a BMI that puts them between the top 5% and 15% on growth charts.) Children who are obese suffer health problems such as\u00a0asthma, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, insulin resistance and orthopedic issues. They are also more likely to develop psychological and mental health problems, according to research reviewed by the task force. Reducing childhood obesity would reduce the incidence of these medical issues. But the larger goal of screening is to make a dent in the number of obese children who become obese adults. Most obese teens \u2014\u00a0nearly 80%, according to long-term tracking studies \u2014\u00a0are on track to be obese when they grow up. Overall, childhood obesity has stabilized in the United States.\u00a0But rates are still climbing for certain groups of kids, such as Latino boys and African American girls. The task force also noted that the proportion of obese kids who qualify as severely obese is growing. The authors of the proposed guidelines are under no illusion that universal obesity screening will be a silver bullet. Even the best programs to modify kids\u2019 behavior resulted in only a \u201cmoderate\u201d benefit, they wrote. But the downside risks of screening are \u201csmall to none,\u201d they wrote. The types of programs that work involve at least 26 hours of counseling over several weeks or months. The more hours involved, the better the results. Successful programs reviewed by the task force included counseling sessions not just for children who were obese but for parents and other family members as well. They taught patients how to improve their eating habits, including the importance of reading labels on packaged foods. They showed patients ways to exercise safely. They taught kids to keep tempting treats out of sight (and out of mind). And they helped them learn how to set goals for themselves, and monitor their progress toward reaching them. In 16 clinical trials that tested these programs, most participants gained no more than 5 pounds while growing in height, leading to lower BMIs. Meanwhile, patients assigned to control groups gained up to 17 pounds. On the psychological side, the programs resulted in small improvements in self-esteem, mental health and quality of life. The changes were too small to be statistically significant. The task force also considered the pros and cons of two medications \u2014\u00a0metformin and orlistat \u2014\u00a0that are sometimes prescribed to help kids lose weight. In clinical trials, both drugs helped patients lose a little weight. But the amount \u2014\u00a0on the order of 5 to 7 pounds \u2014\u00a0was too small for doctors to be sure it would make a real difference for patients. Against that modest benefit, studies found that orlistat (sold under the brand names Xenical and Alli) frequently caused side effects such as\u00a0abdominal pain, cramps, oily stools and fecal incontinence. In the end, the task force decided to recommend only behavioral interventions for weight loss. The panel did not consider bariatric surgery, noting that any patient heavy enough to be a candidate could be identified without screening. The proposed\u00a0guidelines were released Tuesday. Members of the public may comment on them until Nov. 28.\u00a0 Caption Rosetta's last mission The European Space Agency's Rosetta orbiter will commit operational suicide early Friday morning, but first it has just a little bit more science to do.

President Obama narrowly won it twice, but so did George W. Bush. \u201cI would like to see Donald Trump win this election,\u201d McNemar said, and she especially likes his plans for the economy. Donna McNemar making buckeye candies CBS News \u201cWhen you want business to grow, would you not need somebody that knows business?\u201d she said. She prefers Trump\u2019s current plan on the minimum wage: He wants the states to decide . Hillary Clinton supports a minimum wage as high as $15 an hour. Donna McNemar CBS News \u201cIf we\u2019re forced to pay $15 for minimum wage, guess who\u2019s gonna work more hours? Me. Because I\u2019m going to have to lay off employees. I can\u2019t, we can\u2019t, handle that kind of increase,\u201d McNemar said. She also favors Trump\u2019s tax plan , with across the board cuts, the biggest for the wealthiest Americans. Clinton\u2019s plan would raise taxes on the rich. \u201cI understand that they\u2019re wealthy and make a lot of money. But I also understand that they worked really hard for that money and if they have to pay more taxes it has to go somewhere and it\u2019s going to come down to me,\u201d McNemar said. Across Sandusky County in Bellvue, Ohio, Richard Stegman has a very different view. He is a big fan of Hillary Clinton. Stegman owns the Victorian Tudor Inn, a bed and breakfast he bought right before the recession hit. Richard Stegman, center, serving guests at his bed and breakfast CBS News \u201cI was this close, so close, to actually losing everything,\u201d he said. He credits President Obama\u2019s policies with turning the economy around and thinks Clinton would stay the course. \u201cI think it all goes under the umbrella of her experience,\u201d he said. Richard Stegman CBS News When it comes to minimum wage, \u201cI personally for the last several years have been paying my staffs anywhere from $14 to $15 an hour. You know, that\u2019s smart business\u201d Stegman said. \u201cI need good people.\u201d He also prefers Clinton\u2019s tax policies to Trump\u2019s. \u201cHer tax proposal benefits a wide variety of people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a tax policy that really benefits just a small segment. I think hers is very broad.\u201d Stegman agreed that he thinks Clinton will help the middle class more than Donald Trump.

Sources tell ABC News that despite calls from Clinton, top Democrats and some Republican leaders, the FBI is unlikely to release more information on the scope of the investigation until after Election Day . With seven days left to go until America votes, Trump's pitch to early voters for a redo appears to be a Hail Mary play. The Republican nominee has been hitting the Clinton email investigation hard, as well as possibly damaging emails disclosed by WikiLeaks from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta . In Wisconsin, voters have a right to three ballots. If they voted early or absentee, they may cancel their ballot if they think they made the wrong choice. Other states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, have similar rules that allow for changes to be made. Minnesota also allows changes, but the deadline, one week before Election Day, has now passed. In Wisconsin, Trump was joined by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and state leaders like Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ron Johnson . Johnson has been in a tough re-election battle against the incumbent he beat six years ago, Russ Feingold . \"I hope you are all going to get out and vote for Ron,\" Trump told his supporters. 0 Shares ",

The Cubs and Indians play Game 6 of the World Series on Tuesday night. If the Indians win, the Cleveland players become heroes forever in their city, ending a decades-long title drought and securing late-night TV appearances and free drinks and a White House visit. If the Cubs win, they buy themselves the chance to earn all those same things on Wednesday in Game 7. But six guys spread out around Progressive Field on Tuesday night will endeavor Game 6 seeking no such glory. Like the players, they represent the best in the world at their profession and, in the World Series, they are called upon to perform under unspeakable pressure. But the best any umpire can hope to achieve on Tuesday is for no one to notice him at all. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about the pressure, you\u2019ve got the wrong job,\u201d MLB umpiring director and former ump Randy Marsh told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cTo me, the pressure\u2019s the same as it is opening day \u2014 I want to get every pitch right. It\u2019s not any different when you\u2019re working the World Series.\u201d (Tommy Gilligan/USA TODAY Sports) The proliferation of high-definition video review and PitchF/X-type strike zone readouts prompt some to argue that MLB umpires have somehow gotten worse in recent years, a bafflingly illogical conclusion in a highly competitive baseball landscape changed daily by new technologies for assessing the performance of just about everyone. The umpires working the World Series represent the best of the best. \u201cThese guys are evaluated every game they work all season long,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cTheir strike zone is evaluated, all the plays they call on the field, how they handle situations \u2014 arguments and things like that, how they handle that. They get mid-year evaluations, they get year-end evaluations. In September, we bring our supervisors in and meet with (MLB chief baseball officer) Joe Torre and (VP of baseball operations) Peter Woodfork, and we go over the entire staff, all 76 names. \u201cWe have video review on all the calls they make, and we have the computer systems as far as plate work is concerned. The day after they work the plate, they get a readout on every pitch that they actually called. It\u2019ll tell them if they called a pitch two and a half inches outside, or it\u2019ll tell them if this pitch was inside the zone and they called it a ball.\u201d In September, the league selects four crews\u2019 worth of umpires to work the Divisional Series round. Two separate crews umpire the LCS series. The seven umps who rotate through the six postseason umpiring positions during World Series play all worked LDS games but not LCS contests, an effort made to find a balance between rust and fatigue. All umps receive postseason bonuses now, but working the World Series brings a larger one, and getting tapped for the job represents a big honor. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) \u201cJoe Torre refers to the World Series as the crown jewel of baseball, and being selected as an umpire for the World Series \u2014 that\u2019s the crown jewel selection,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. A lot of guys want that.\u201d Earlier this postseason, a lovely moment caught on camera between Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and home-plate umpire Angel Hernandez blew up online. Rizzo had assumed a pitch was ball four and began walking toward first when Hernandez called him back, and the slugger later apologized for inadvertently \u201cshowing up\u201d Hernandez. After the game, Rizzo pointed out something that rarely registers with fans: Umpiring a full baseball season is an extraordinarily taxing job. \u201cAll of the umpires are out here at the highest level, doing their best,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re out here working their tails off for 162 (games) like we are. There\u2019s no home for them. They\u2019re on the road the entire season.\u201d This moment between the @Cubs Anthony Rizzo and umpire Angel Hernandez is what sports is all about https://t.co/v0HoGHX0mL \u2014 Luis Antonio Perez (@NorthsideLou) October 20, 2016 It\u2019s true: While MLB players get to play half their games in one location, umpires travel constantly throughout the season. Across the course of the six-month regular season, they get four one-week breaks. And while Marsh said many umpires make their homes someplace near a big-league city, they\u2019re unlikely to be there for more than a couple of series a season. Marsh hails from a Cincinnati suburb in Northern Kentucky, and could recall a season in which he worked only three Reds home games all year. Naturally, umpiring has changed a lot in the last couple of seasons thanks to the dawn of the league\u2019s replay review system. Marsh said umps were resistant to the change at first \u2014 sensitive about having their calls overturned, and hesitant to overturn their fellow umps\u2019 calls during their turns overseeing replays. But replay, the umps found, saves them from the burden of botching a decisive call in a big game. \u201cThey realized it\u2019s for the betterment of the game,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cAlso, if you\u2019re an umpire and they\u2019ve changed your call, nine times out of ten it\u2019s not even written about in the paper. There\u2019s a call at first base that was overturned; the umpire\u2019s not out there hanging on a limb and getting ripped apart. Also, because they were able to do that, it didn\u2019t affect the outcome of the game \u2014 that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d During his career as an active umpire, Marsh worked five World Series and nine League Championship Series. During the 2004 LCS between the Red Sox and Yankees, he initially missed a call on a controversial play that he believes led to umpires more frequently conferring on the field to ensure accuracy. \u201cIt was the A-Rod play in Boston, where he slapped the glove,\u201d Marsh said, referring to the 2004 incident in which Alex Rodriguez intentionally knocked the ball away from Bronson Arroyo along the first-base line. \u201cI was at first base, and Mientkiewicz was at first base, the second baseman came over to cover, I had two people in front of me, I didn\u2019t see it. Joe West was the plate umpire, Jeff Kellogg was there, and they said Randy, he slapped it. I said, I\u2019ve got to change this. The thing was, the media supported me completely \u2014 even in New York, they knew that what he had done was wrong. In part it was embarrassing, but the other part was we got it right. And (former MLB exec) Sandy Alderson was our boss at the time; he could not have been happier. I think ever since then, umpires have been more receptive to saying, let\u2019s get together and get this call right.\u201d Umpires in 2016 face perhaps more scrutiny than ever before, especially when behind the plate. Fans and analysts armed with strike-zone plots can identify immediately if an umpire called a strike an inch below the zone or squeezed a pitcher on a fastball that nipped the outside corner. And pitchers throw harder than ever before. Perhaps as soon as tonight, a home-plate ump will need to determine whether a 102.5-mph fastball from Aroldis Chapman caught the top part of the strike zone or sailed an inch too high, and if he gets it wrong, he will be lambasted for it. Marsh said that umpires provide a support system for one another, and noted that many dedicated baseball fans do appreciate the difficulty of officiating a game. But when asked if he thought most people recognize how hard it is to be an umpire, he was unequivocal. \u201cGuys come to umpire school, and they think anybody can get behind the plate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time they get behind there at umpire school and the balls coming in at 50 mph, they\u2019re diving out of the way. \u201cThey have no idea.\u201d This year\u2019s World Series umpires are crew chief John Hirschbeck, Chris Guccione, Sam Holbrook, Marvin Hudson, Tony Randazzo, Larry Vanover and Joe West. If all goes well for them, you won\u2019t hear their names again in 2016. More MLB! ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 1, 2016 5:55 PM EDT The day the original story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server broke, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta wrote to another top Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills, that the emails would have to be dealt with, and \u201cbetter to do so sooner than later.\u201d\u00a0 In the exchange , just before 11 p.m. on March 2, 2015, Podesta wrote to Mills, who served as Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department. The New York Times published its story about the existence of Clinton\u2019s private email account just hours beforehand.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,\u201d Podesta wrote. A Clinton campaign aide clarified that by \u201cdump,\u201d Podesta meant to release to the public\u2014like in a document dump\u2014and not deleting or getting rid of them. This email exchange was part of the latest batch of emails released by WikiLeaks\u2014the 25th such exchange since Oct. 7. The total number of emails now available from Podesta\u2019s account totals 41,969. Clinton turned over roughly 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in December 2014\u2014before the story broke about her private server. Many of those pages have subsequently been reviewed and released to the public by the State Department. However, Clinton deleted an additional 33,000 emails because they were not work-related, she and her team have said. The issue is especially salient after the news last week that the FBI is investigating new material related to Clinton\u2019s email practices.\u00a0 The WikiLeaks dumps have shed light on the Clinton team\u2019s response to the ongoing situation with her private email practices, an issue that has plagued her campaign since its inception. For example, later in March 2015, Mills wrote to Podesta and other aides that they needed to \u201cclean this up\u201d when President Obama said he was unaware of Clinton\u2019s private email server until the news broke publicly. \u201cWe need to clean this up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe has emails from her - they do not say state.gov.\u201d This article has been updated to clarify the characterization of the Podesta email. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Cubs fan Joe Wiegand is dressed Tuesday as former President Theodore Roosevelt at Progressive Field in Cleveland before Game 6 of the World Series. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Nachos, check. Program, check. Chance to see the Cubs keep their championship hopes alive in the World Series ? You bet. Cubs fans from across the country poured into Progressive Field in balmy downtown Cleveland on Tuesday night, decked head-to-toe in blue and clinging to hope that the North Siders have two road wins in them to snap a legendary title drought. With the night feeling more like June than the first day of November, Cubs fans settled into the ballpark amid the Indians faithful, another Series starved fan base that brushed aside the invaders from the west, trying to will the home team to a clinching win.

Many Cubs fans who made the trek to Ohio said they plan to stay in town, wanting the chance to see the team win a championship with their own eyes. Cubs fans at Game 6 John J.

Kim / Chicago Tribune) When Addison Russell connected for a third-inning grand slam, a horde of Cubs fans in the outfield grandstand erupted in wild celebration. One man in a Jake Arrieta jersey dropped to his knees on the patio concourse and extended his arms to the heavens. Chicago fans behind the Cubs dugout went wild, as did patches of visiting fans from the upper deck to the left field bleachers. Fans in Cubs blue appeared all over downtown Cleveland earlier in the day, packing the bars and restaurants on East 4th Street, just as many had done a week ago for Games 1 and 2. Fans in Kris Bryant and Ernie Banks jerseys strolled down Ontario Street, one of the city's main arteries, which links the hotel district to the ballpark. Mike Fischer made a decision while watching Game 5. \"If they go to a Game 6, we're going to Cleveland for my old man,\" he said. Fischer bought the tickets \u2014 $900 apiece \u2014 then texted his dad: \"Pack your bags.\" \"I was stunned,\" said Jim Fischer, who was a baby in 1945 when the Cubs last appeared in the Fall Classic.

(Stephen Miller) The father and son piled in the car Tuesday morning for the three-state trek to the shore of Lake Erie, where they visited the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame after checking into their hotel and grabbing lunch as the Cubs prepared for their game against the Indians a few blocks down the street. \"You don't know if you're going to get another chance,\" said Mike Fischer, 34, of Crystal Lake, wearing his Cubs cap outside the entrance to the hall of fame, where he enjoyed the exhibit about one of his favorite bands, Phish. \"You don't know if it'll be another way-too-many years before they make it back (to the Series).\" Amy and David Weber wore Cubs gear as they stopped to take in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and the fountains at Public Square a few blocks north of the ballpark. \"She talked me into it,\" David Weber said. \"I called in sick to work. We'll assume that'll be fine.\" Amy Weber, 36, of Deerfield, said she's been a die-hard Cubs fan ever since childhood, when her dad took her to ballgames. With her favorite team in the World Series, she could not pass up a chance to see them, even if her dad, Bruce Dresdner, couldn't make it. Dresdner is in a nursing home in Highland Park.

The atmosphere was more subdued than last week, when there was a Mardi Gras vibe downtown, in outlying city neighborhoods and the Gateway District near Progressive Field. Many Clevelanders turned the day of Game 1 into a citywide holiday, but the lead-up to Game 6 was more reserved, with municipal employees and downtown business workers going about their day and the plaza beyond the left field gate noticeably quieter. Still, it wasn't hard to find someone wearing Indians gear, and many office buildings sported \"Go, Tribe!\" signs in their windows. The Cavaliers, the city's NBA team that plays across the plaza from the baseball stadium, moved up the start time of their game an hour to accommodate the World Series game. Sports talk radio crackled with Indians' fans predictions. All but one caller was convinced their team was wrapping up the title tonight. For the Fischers, the World Series trip was a baseball trip to remember. There was only one thing left on the checklist. \"I don't want any more of this 'Next Year' stuff,\" said Jim Fischer, 72. \"This has got to be the year.\" poconnell@chicagotribune.com ",

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses a rally at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., on Monday. Carlos Osorio/AP Some of the country's most prominent economists have signed a letter warning that Donald Trump is a \"dangerous, destructive\" choice for president and urging voters to choose someone else. The letter , first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by 370 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners. The text stops short of endorsing Democrat Hillary Clinton, though, and doesn't criticize Trump on ideological grounds. Instead, it says he has made repeated statements aimed at misleading the public about jobs and growth: \"He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country.\" Among other things, Trump has told voters that renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement or imposing tariffs on China would increase manufacturing jobs, the letter says. Article continues after sponsorship Why Do We Vote On Tuesdays? \"In fact, manufacturing's share of employment has been declining since the 1970s and is mostly related to automation, not trade,\" it says. Trump has \"lowered the seriousness of the national dialogue\" by saying that the deficit can be reduced by eliminating government agencies such as the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. \"A credible solution will require an increase in tax revenue and/or a reduction in spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or Defense,\" it says. The Republican presidential candidate has also falsely claimed that the United States is one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world, the letter says. It added: \"His statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to listen to credible experts. He repeats fake and misleading economic statistics, and pushes fallacies about the [value-added tax] and trade competitiveness. He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.\" Those signing the letter say they \"represent a broad variety of areas of expertise.\" They include Nobel winners such as Angus Deaton of Princeton, Oliver Hart and Eric Maskin of Harvard and Kenneth J.

Time Alabama defensive back Marlon Humphrey, left, celebrates fellow DB Ronnie Harrison (15) after an interception against Texas A&M; on Oct. 22. (Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) The initial College Football Playoff rankings of the season had one surprise. Alabama, Clemson and Michigan were expected to be in the top three. What was unexpected was one-loss Texas A&M being ahead of unbeaten Washington in the fourth position. The Aggies, whose lone blemish is a loss at\u00a0Alabama, sit\u00a0at No. 7 in the Amway Coaches Poll. But their difficult schedule in the Southeastern Conference, including a win at Auburn, helped move them past the Huskies. Washington has dominating wins against Stanford and Oregon\u00a0and a narrow victory Saturday\u00a0at Utah, but, despite being 8-0, are currently out of the playoff field. TOP 25:\u00a0 First CFP rankings \u201cTexas A&M won at Auburn and beat Arkansas at a neutral site,\u201d said selection committee chairman Kirby Hocutt, the athletics director at Texas Tech. \u201cIn the committee\u2019s mind, Texas A&M has played a stronger schedule.\u201d As for Clemson at No. 2 and Michigan at No. 3, a flip-flop\u00a0from the Amway Coaches Poll and AP poll, Hocutt said the margin was very narrow. \u201cThe two wins against CFP top 10 (teams) were something that stood out to us that nobody else within the CFP top 25 have,\u201d Hocutt said. \u201cThe road wins at (No. 9) Auburn and (No. 22) Florida State and obviously the win at home against (No. 7) Louisville gave the edge to Clemson for that No. 2 spot. ... \u201cThe separation was small,\u201d Hocutt said. \u201cMichigan has beaten three teams in our top 25, including a very good CFP ranked No. 8 Wisconsin team. Michigan has a great defense and has been very consistent as the season has gone along. Again, the separation between two and three was very small.\u201d One-loss teams Ohio State and Louisville were in the sixth and seventh positions with five weeks still left in the season. Wisconsin, Auburn and Nebraska round out the top 10, giving the Big Ten four teams and the SEC three near the top. Ranking Reaction: Texas A&M No. 4 for now, but no worries, Washington Also of note, No. 23 Western Michigan was one spot ahead of Boise State in the race among teams in the Group of Five conferences for a spot in one of the major bowls. Tuesday's ranking is the first of six to be unveiled by the playoff committee. The\u00a0top four teams in the final ranking on Dec. 4 will meet in the College Football Playoff. The semifinals will be played at the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl on Dec. 31.\u00a0The championship game will be held in Tampa, Fla, on Jan. 9. Here is the complete Top 25 from the committee: 1. Alabama (8-0) ",

Got it Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump delivers a speech in King of Prussia, Pa., on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Jenna Johnson , John Wagner and Sean Sullivan November 1 at 7:31 PM Follow @wpjenna Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @WaPoSean KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. \u2014 Donald Trump swerved back on script Tuesday, showing flashes of a cohesive closing argument in the final stage of a presidential campaign that is tightening with six days left. Joined here by his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and a small group of lawmakers, Trump delivered an uncharacteristically disciplined speech calling again for the eradication of the Affordable Care Act and a renegotiation of a sweeping trade pact he cast as a job killer \u2014 championing causes popular among many Republicans in Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin , where he is urgently trying to expand the map against Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee, who is trying to move past the FBI\u2019s renewed scrutiny of her email practices and sustain her advantage in key swing states, sought to redirect attention on Tuesday to Trump\u2019s treatment of women. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado delivered introductory remarks at a Clinton rally in Dade City, Fla., speaking about Trump\u2019s \u201ccruel\u201d comments about her weight when she held the crown. Clinton cited allegations from a dozen women that Trump had kissed or groped them without permission. Both sides also added fuel to the expensive war they are waging on the airwaves. The Clinton campaign plans to begin airing its first television ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico \u2014 where Trump is making a late push this week \u2014 and will return to the airwaves in Virginia and Colorado after a months-long hiatus, a campaign official said. The Trump campaign announced it was investing $25\u00a0million in advertising across 13 states. But it did not say how much would go to each location. Here in Pennsylvania, Trump tried to strike a more uplifting note than usual, a move that seemed geared to centrist voters put off by his dark rhetoric. \u201cIf we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach,\u201d he said. At a rally in Valley Forge, Pa., on Tuesday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined how he would \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. (The Washington Post) [ The Fix: Trump gave a very good speech today in Pennsylvania ] But it is unclear whether the speech, which had the accoutrements of a much more traditional campaign event than Trump usually holds, will hail a disciplined push in the last week before Election Day or whether he will return to the rudderless approach that has defined much of his campaign. Just as uncertain is whether it will assuage the concerns of moderate voters at a time when extremists continue to embrace Trump publicly, including an endorsement of Trump on Tuesday by the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s official newspaper . In recent rallies and speeches, Trump has lurched from talking about Clinton\u2019s email woes to his unsubstantiated claims of a \u201crigged\u201d election to his priorities for his first days as president. Along the way, he also reignited old spats and revived criticism of Clinton\u2019s health. Inside a hotel ballroom here before an invite-only crowd, however, Trump offered streamlined policy imperatives for supporting him. \u201cIf we don\u2019t repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever,\u201d he said, referring to the Affordable Care Act championed by President Obama. He also displayed more party unity than usual. Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.) and Reps. Tom Price (Ga.) and Andy Harris (Md.), all physicians, helped introduce Trump. So did Rep. Renee L. Ellmers (N.C.), who has worked as a registered nurse. Trump, who has been pledging to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington, referred to them as \u201cdistinguished members of Congress.\u201d Later in the day, Trump attended a roundtable discussion in Wisconsin with that state\u2019s governor, Scott Walker, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. As the audience in Pennsylvania waited to hear Trump speak, they were treated to light jazz rather than the normal jarring soundtrack at Trump events. Pence, the mild-mannered Indiana governor who has rarely appeared together with his running mate, warmed up the crowd and set the stage for the address. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton meets and speaks to voters at a rally in Dade City, Fla., Tuesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \u201cWe still got time to turn this thing around. Seven days to be exact,\u201d Pence said. Trump promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and expand \u201cschool choice.\u201d Trump said he swiftly would enlist Congress to help destroy the Affordable Care Act. [ With revived email probe, Republicans see chance to not talk about Trump ] \u201cWhen we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace,\u201d Trump said. There would be no need for a \u201cspecial session\u201d on Capitol Hill, however: The current Congress will reconvene soon after the Nov.\u00a08 election, while the new Congress will gavel in before Inauguration Day. In Dade City, Machado grew emotional while speaking about Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks about her gaining weight in the 1990s, saying that \u201cit is clear he does not respect women. . . . He thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.\u201d Machado added that for years afterward she fought eating disorders. Clinton spoke at length about the allegations of unwanted sexual advances against Trump and said he has revealed himself to have little respect for women by \u201cdemeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting\u201d them. Trump has denied the women\u2019s allegations and has suggested that some were not attractive enough to draw his interest. \u201cLook at what he does. He calls women ugly, disgusting, nasty, all the time,\u201d Clinton told the crowd. \u201cHe calls women pigs, rates bodies on a scale from one to 10.\u201d Obama campaigned for Clinton on Tuesday in Ohio \u2014 part of an all-hands-on-deck roster of high-profile surrogates deployed to several battleground states that includes Vice President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and former president Bill Clinton.\u201cI stand where I\u2019ve stood all fall and all summer. In fact, I already voted here in Janesville for our nominee last week in early voting,\u201d Ryan said on Fox News Channel from his home town. \u201cWe need to support our entire Republican ticket.\u201d \u201cThe only thing this office does is it amplifies who you are. It magnifies who you are,\u201d Obama said in Columbus. \u201cIf you disrespected women before you were elected, you will disrespect women once you\u2019re president.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has had an uneasy relationship with Trump throughout the campaign, said in a television interview Tuesday that he had voted for Trump but said he continues to have no plans to campaign for him. [ The KKK\u2019s official newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump ] Trump\u2019s more polished approach in his speech was a departure from what seems at times like randomness in his public remarks lately. During two rallies on Monday in Michigan, Trump mostly focused on promising to return manufacturing jobs. But he mixed in warnings of voter fraud, attacks on Hillary Clinton and random musings on how no one travels to Paris anymore, how Bill O\u2019Reilly is one of the \u201cgreatest political pundits today\u201d and his ability to predict the future. And on Sunday in Greeley, Colo., Trump blamed the NFL\u2019s ratings decline on the campaign and on San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Last week, Trump went off on random tangents during a speech in Charlotte, where he discussed a \u201cnew deal for black America,\u201d mocking long-vanquished rival Jeb Bush, whose moderate Republican supporters he desperately needs. Throughout it all, he has injected dire warnings about illegal immigrants killing Americans, Islamic State militants violently killing innocent people and portrayed the country as having only one final chance to get it right. That track record made what he said \u2014 and how he said it \u2014 in Pennsylvania unexpected. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country,\u201d Trump said.

    "text": "Paige St. John Contact Reporter Barely a year after the largest methane leak in U.S. history, and with two-thirds of its wells still shut down, operators of the Aliso Canyon storage field want to pump gas again. Southern California Gas Co. on Tuesday asked California regulators for permission to resume pumping pressurized natural gas into the ground northeast of Los Angeles, at a depleted oil field now used for storage. Records show the utility has been negotiating this step with regulators for several weeks. The company cited \"extensive physical upgrades\" and \"advanced technologies\" in contending it would be safe to resume operations. Local political leaders immediately disagreed. \"Since the multiple investigations into the cause of the leak have not been completed, we must proceed with extreme caution. Aliso Canyon is not ready to resume normal operations,\" U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said in a statement urging that the gas company be restricted to minimal operations required to prevent power interruptions. The storage field is a primary supplier to gas-powered electric plants. Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich introduced a motion, to be taken up by the board next week, asking state utility regulators to continue to prohibit gas injection at Aliso Canyon pending a review of whether the field can be permanently closed.\u00a0Legislation passed in May requires such a review before mid-2017. The Aliso Canyon leak began in October 2015 when high-pressure gas escaped from a well deep below ground and found its way to the surface. The blowout took five months to plug, forcing thousands of residents in nearby communities such as Porter Ranch to evacuate their homes. A report on what caused the failure has yet to be completed. In the aftermath, California regulators required Southern California Gas to test the remaining 114 active wells before returning the storage field to use. The state\u00a0adopted rules (which in May became state law)\u00a0that allow the field to reopen with only some wells operable. Only 29 wells have passed all the inspections required to return to use. State reports show 80 wells, many dating to the 1950s, have been plugged and taken out of operation. The gas company has a year to either repair and fully test those wells or abandon them. Preliminary test results showed a number of wells in the field -- originally drilled to produce oil and later converted for gas storage -- had underground leaks. Field operators are not required to report how much gas is lost in below-ground leaks. State environmental regulators said it could take weeks to decide on the gas company's request. State inspections at the field are still pending and state utility regulators must concur with reopening the field. \u00a0 \u201cSafety is our top priority. We will thoroughly review all the information and data, conduct independent site inspections, seek public feedback and the opinion of outside experts before making any determination,\" state Oil and Gas Supervisor Ken Harris said in a\u00a0statement. Originally, the gas company said its inability to use Aliso Canyon would interrupt power supplies during the summer.\u00a0\"However, warnings of rolling blackouts and energy shortages during the summer never came to fruition,\" Antonovich said in his motion.\u00a0 A federal task force formed in the wake of the Aliso Canyon leak last month called for safety precautions that include the use of outer casings to contain possible leaks. Southern California Gas had a practice of boosting well production at Aliso Canyon and other fields by pumping gas through both the interior pipe and external casing. The U.S. Department of Transportation also is reviewing national standards governing some 400 underground gas storage facilities in the United States. That ruling is expected this year. The gas company, a division of Sempra Energy, is defending itself against some 180 lawsuits over the leak. It has estimated costs of lost gas, plugging the leak and housing for about 8,000 area residents at about\u00a0$717 million.

Trump highlighted the developments since Friday's announcement from the FBI that it would revisit the Clinton email probe while speaking to a crowd in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. \"For all those voters who have buyer\u2019s remorse, Wisconsin is one of those several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you\u2019ve made a mistake,\" Trump told supporters. \"A lot of stuff has come out since your vote,\" he added. \"If you live here, or Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Minnesota, you change your vote to Donald Trump.\" In Wisconsin, voters can change their minds up to three times, but the deadline for doing so is Thursday. Changing votes is very rarely done, the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College told the Associated Press.

See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump also took time during his rally to hit Clinton presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta and interim chair of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile over emails released by WikiLeaks which appeared to show her sending the Clinton campaign a question before a CNN town hall event while she was a contributor at the network. \"Could you imagine if Reince got the question for a debate and found out,\" Trump told supporters, referencing Republican National Committee Chair Reince Preibus. \"It would be a double electric chair.\" He also used a line from his hit-TV show \"The Apprentice.\" \"John Podesta, if he worked for me I would fire him so fast, like 'The Apprentice,'\" Trump said. \"I would say 'John, you\u2019re fired!'\u201d Clinton meanwhile launched her own fresh line of attacks at a campaign stop in Sanford, Florida by saying the businessman has \"no excuse\" for not releasing his tax returns, and once again calling on him to do so before the election. \"We\u2019ve got someone running for president who not only bullied people and made bigoted comments, he is the only major party nominee for president in 40 years who hasn\u2019t released his tax returns,\" she said. Clinton told supporters she's particularly interested in learning about any dealings Trump has had with Russian interests and whether he contributed to charity. The Democratic presidential nominee told the crowd that most of those in attendance have probably paid more in federal taxes than Trump. \"He took everything our great country has to offer, scooped it up with both hands and then paid nothing to support us,\" Clinton said. \"Then he has the nerve to call our military a disaster, to insult POWs when he hasn\u2019t paid a penny to support the people who put on the uniform of the United States of America.\" She also slammed his business record. \"Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything that is wrong with this economy,\" \u00a0she told supporters. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

See how the investigation played out. USA TODAY NETWORK The FBI gave the Hillary Clinton campaign another unpleasant surprise Tuesday, this time releasing 129 pages of documents from a 2001 investigation into Bill Clinton's controversial presidential pardon of fugitive Marc Rich. The bureau initially released the heavily redacted files on Monday, but drew more attention to the documents in a tweet Tuesday. The Clinton team questioned the timing of the release, which comes one week before the election and just days after Director James Comey's stunning announcement that the FBI was looking into newly discovered emails related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton. William J. Clinton Foundation: This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the Will... https://t.co/Y4nz3aRSmG \u2014 FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) November 1, 2016 \"This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization,\" reads a statement on the FBI records vault website . \"The bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005. The material is heavily redacted due to personal privacy protections and grand jury secrecy rules.\" Rich, who died in 2013, was a financier who fled to Switzerland after being indicted on multiple federal charges, including tax evasion, in 1983. Clinton's motive for pardoning\u00a0Rich on his last day in office was questioned\u00a0because\u00a0Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, was a wealthy Democratic donor who made a $450,000 donation to\u00a0Clinton's presidential library foundation and more than $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. In a statement, the FBI said that any material requested three or more times under the Freedom of Information Act is automatically made available to the public online on a \"first in, first out basis.\" \"Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted before the FBI released its statement. \"Will the FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70?\" Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 The FBI actually did release a file on Donald Trump's father, Fred, on Oct. 8. The bureau also tweeted a link to those documents, along with links to files from 20 other\u00a0cases \u2014 including\u00a0 the investigation into Hillary Clinton's\u00a0email server \u2014\u00a0from its Records Vault account on Sunday. Prior to that, the last tweet from that account was in October of 2015. David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama, said the document release is another case of the FBI intervening in the election. \"Whatever the reasoning\u00a0behind it, this latest release further brands the @FBI as the Federal Bureau of Intervention,\" Axelrod said in a tweet. \"It's a head-scratcher!\" Whatever the reasoning behind it, this latest release further brands the @FBI as the Federal Bureau of Intervention. It's a head-scratcher! \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 1, 2016 The majority of the pages in the documents are completely redacted and they do not appear to shed any new light on the case. Comey took over the FBI probe into the Rich pardon in 2003 and the case was closed in 2005 with no charges\u00a0filed. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

By Karen Tumulty and Paul Kane November 1 at 1:56 PM Follow @ktumulty Follow @pkcapitol The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a virtual dead heat nationally. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The Hillary Clinton email controversy has given down-ballot Republicans something they badly need in the final days of the election: an opportunity to go on offense and talk about something other than Donald Trump. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s latest chapter in her ongoing email scandal, saga, is just a reminder of how much corruption there is in Washington and how disturbing this is,\u201d the embattled Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R- Pa .) told voters this week at a diner in the town of Media, near Philadelphia. He noted that the administration of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) is resisting a court order to release more than 50,000 emails that Toomey\u2019s Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, sent while she was the governor\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cHer devotion to Hillary Clinton is so complete that now she\u2019s decided that she has to have her own email scandal,\u201d Toomey said. McGinty, left, and Toomey, right, at an Oct. 24 debate in Philadelphia. (Photos by Matt Rourke/AP) As recently as a week ago, the Republicans\u2019 chances of holding on to the Senate appeared to be slipping away. Individual GOP candidates\u2019 efforts to distance themselves from Trump were being overwhelmed by the furor over an 11-year-old video in which the nominee boasted of kissing and groping women without their consent, and the subsequent claims by a procession of women that he had actually committed such acts. Last Tuesday, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which had earlier predicted that Republicans would manage to keep their Senate losses low, shifted to a projection that the Democrats would pick up five to seven seats \u2014 enough to regain control of the chamber. In the last 15 public polls, all in October, Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race has been nearly deadlocked: Three showed a tie, four had Toomey ahead and seven gave McGinty an edge, with most of those leads being within the margin of error. But now, Republicans see a chance to change the subject and remind voters of the drama and perceived moral ambiguity that has surrounded the Clintons for more than a quarter-century. Republicans could hardly have conjured a better \u201cOctober surprise\u201d than the revelation that a trove of emails belonging to close Clinton aide Huma Abedin had turned up on the laptop of Abedin\u2019s husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is under investigation over sexually suggestive texts he allegedly sent to a 15-year-old girl. However the latest FBI investigation of Abedin\u2019s emails turns out, the fact that they are even at issue goes back to Clinton\u2019s initial misjudgment in setting up a private email account and server. And that can be traced to the secretive impulses that have so often driven the candidate and her inner circle. \u201cThis is what life with the Clintons look like,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s always a scandal, one after another. There\u2019s an investigation.\u201d \u201cSo they can\u2019t win,\u201d he added, \u201cand she can come in with a Democratic Congress \u2014 worst of all possible things \u2014 if Republicans do not turn out and do not vote.\u201d Though it is an implicit acknowledgment of the fact that the Democrat remains more likely than not to win the White House , Republicans are seizing upon an argument that they must retain control of Congress to be a check on Clinton \u2014 not only on her agenda but on the behavior of her administration. \u201cWe used to say in prosecution, it\u2019s primacy and recency. The closing argument reintroduces all of the most pertinent issues,\u201d said Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), who was campaigning with Toomey. \u201cLook at this,\u201d Meehan said in reference to the latest email controversy. \u201cThis is almost the personification of the trust issue.\u201d The email issue may also have the effect of helping to unify Republicans, who have been divided over Trump. Don Chesnet, 71, a retired small-business man, explained his views of Trump and Clinton, respectively: \u201cYou either have scum or you have a criminal.\u201d He added that \u201cscum\u201d might not rub off, while criminal behavior was an affront to taxpayers. View Graphic Even a small shift in the political breeze could have a big impact on the Senate races, said Charlie Cook, editor and publisher of the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere are six races that are just teetering on the edge, where it wouldn\u2019t take much to tip several of them the same way,\u201d Cook said. He added that there is a significant slice of the electorate that is voting for Clinton primarily because they find Trump unacceptable. \u201cThey don\u2019t like her, don\u2019t trust her and would rather not vote for her but feel they have no choice,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere are a lot of voters who would certainly like to hedge [that vote] a little bit.\u201d Some Democrats worry that they have seen all this before \u2014 the last time that someone named Clinton was their standard-bearer. In 1996, Bill Clinton was cruising to reelection when a controversy exploded over the fact that Democrats had been taking large donations from foreign entities that are forbidden from donating to U.S. campaigns. A number of those illegal donors had access to the Clinton White House. \u201cThat\u2019s a good parallel\u201d to the effect that the resurgent email controversy could have today, a senior House Democrat said, requesting anonymity to discuss the downbeat feeling some have. In 1996, Bill Clinton\u2019s big lead held up, although he remained under 50\u00a0percent and House Democrats \u2014 who had hoped to bounce back into the majority after their disastrous 1994 showing \u2014 picked up fewer than five seats and remained in the minority for a decade to come. The 42nd president also had a contentious relationship with the FBI director at the time, Louis Freeh \u2014 and such a drama could play out again with another Clinton in the Oval Office. Hillary Clinton and her top campaign officials have been highly critical of the unusual decision by FBI Director James B. Comey to go public Friday with the fact that the bureau had resumed its investigation of the emails. All of which gives voters a new set of crosscurrents to navigate as Election Day draws near. For down-ballot Democrats, Sharon Jankauskas is their nightmare. The 60-year-old nurse practitioner, who attended Toomey\u2019s campaign event in Media, said she sees the presidential races as the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d She plans to vote for Clinton but is also pulling for Toomey. She also likes Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). So Jankauskas is looking for what, in her view, is a silver lining to electing Clinton: \u201cWe can always impeach her and get her out.\u201d All of which raises the possibility that another Clinton in the White House could bring a reprise of the political culture of the 1990s, when a Republican Congress was constantly investigating the Clintons. Americans have already gotten a foretaste. when the congressional panel investigating the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, helped uncover the fact that Clinton had been using a private email address and server when she was secretary of state. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told CNN that if Clinton is elected, Congress will continue its scrutiny. \u201cThe legislative branch does have an obligation to provide oversight,\u201d Gowdy said.

    "text": "How Donald Trump's Remarks About Renewed Clinton Email Probe Mirror Birtherism By TOM LIDDY Nov 1, 2016, 3:02 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Hillary Clinton Tries to Shift Campaign Tone 0 Shares Email During a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Monday, Donald Trump said he was \"sure\" that what's contained in the emails at the center of the FBI 's renewed probe into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server is \"absolutely devastating.\" Those emails are under review by the FBI, and their content has not been released publicly, but Trump appears certain in his pronouncement despite a lack of evidence. His trading on uncertainty without proof may seem familiar: His talk of the renewed probe mirrors his years-long perpetuation of the birther movement. A Look Back at October Surprises and Why Clinton's Email May Not Be One Birtherism Before the 2012 presidential race , when Trump considered a run, the real estate mogul cast aspersions on President Barack Obama, questioning whether he was a natural-born U.S. citizen and therefore eligible to be president. During Trump's initial push of birtherism, he repeatedly suggested that there was something amiss with Obama's birth certificate, despite having no evidence to support that claim. \"I want him to show his birth certificate,\" Trump said on ABC's \"The View\" in 2011. \"There is something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like.\" Birtherism was strongly linked to the theory that Obama is a secret Muslim and wants to hide his religion from the American people. Trump floated that possibility on Bill O'Reilly's show on Fox News in 2011. \"People have birth certificates. He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion. Maybe it says he is a Muslim,\" he said . \"I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn't born in this country, it's one of the great scams of all time.\" Trump also claimed on the \"Today\" show in April 2011 that he dispatched investigators to look into the matter \"and they cannot believe what they're finding.\" He claimed during the segment that Obama's certificate of live birth was \"easy to get\" and that Obama spent $2 million in legal fees to avoid the issue. That month, Obama released his birth certificate, but that still didn't satisfy Trump, who wrote on Twitter that it was a \"fraud.\" An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama 's birth certificate is a fraud. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012 And in 2013, one of the last times that he publicly discussed the issue before his presidential run, Trump again refused to acknowledge the evidence presented by Obama. \"Well, I don't know. Was there a birth certificate? You tell me. You know some people say that was not his birth certificate. So maybe it was, maybe it wasn't,\" he told ABC News' Jon Karl . As recently as Sept. 15 of this year, Trump refused to acknowledge that Obama was born in the United States, but the next day, after five years, Trump finally conceded, \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.\" Clinton Email Probe Trump has gone to great lengths to paint Clinton as the most corrupt politician in American history, repeatedly calling her \"crooked Hillary,\" among other monikers. \"Hillary's corruption is a threat to democracy, and the only way to stop it is for you on Nov. 8 to show up at the polls and vote,\" he said at an appearance in Warren, Michigan, Monday. He has called her a criminal on many occasions. \"Hillary is the one who set up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity ,\" he told the crowd Monday. He even threatened during their second debate to throw her in jail if he becomes president. Clinton was admonished this summer by FBI Director James Comey for her handling of email, including classified information, on her private email server while she was the secretary of state. She has acknowledged she made \"a mistake\" by using the private server. But she and her top aides have not been criminally charged in the matter. The FBI did not recommend charges in the case, and the DOJ declined to prosecute. Comey explained at the time that \"it takes mishandling it and criminal intent\" to make a case. \"I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That I could establish. What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent,\" he said . \"'Should have known,' 'must have known,' 'had to know' does not get you there. You have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they knew they were engaged in something that was unlawful.\" In a memo to FBI employees, Comey said the case was \"not a cliffhanger\" and \"really wasn't a prosecutable case.\" Little is known publicly about the new batch of emails, found on the computer of Clinton aide Huma Abedin 's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. In a letter to lawmakers Friday, Comey said the new emails \"appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" But in an internal memo sent later that day, he said the agency doesn't \"know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.\" It is also not clear whether any of the emails were sent by Clinton or if they contain any sensitive information. Clinton has slammed the review, saying there is \"no case here.\" But that didn't stop Trump from pouncing on Monday. \"We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating, and I think we're going to find out, by the way, for the first time,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "FBI releases documents on Bill Clinton's 2001 pardon of financier Rich Published               November 01, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0Only days before the presidential election, the FBI released an archive of documents from a long-closed investigation into Bill Clinton's 2001 presidential pardon of a fugitive financier, prompting questions from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign about its timing. The release comes amid the bureau's controversially timed review of emails from a Hillary Clinton aide. The 129 pages of heavily censored material about Bill Clinton's presidential pardon of Marc Rich were published Monday on the FBI's Freedom of Information Act webpage and noted by one of the bureau's Twitter accounts Tuesday. Earlier in October, the FBI unit published historical files as far back as 1966 about Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump. The Clinton campaign questioned the bureau's decision to make the file public so close to Tuesday's election. \"Absent a (Freedom of Information Act) deadline, this is odd,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted. \"Will FBI be posting docs on Trumps' housing discrimination in `70s?\" Fallon's reference was to news accounts of a 1973 federal housing discrimination lawsuit, later settled, against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In response to questions Tuesday from The Associated Press, the FBI said that the Marc Rich documents \"became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI's public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.\" The bureau said that under law, documents requested three or more times are made public \"shortly after they are processed.\" That processing, the bureau said, is on a \"first in, first out basis.\" Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he saw the FBI tweet shortly before he boarded Air Force One with President Barack Obama for a trip to Columbus, Ohio, to campaign for Hillary Clinton, but was unaware that anyone at the White House was consulted about the material before it was released. \"I've not spoke to anybody who has any awareness of being consulted about that material before it was released,\" Earnest told reporters traveling with the president. The newly released FBI documents are from a 2001 federal investigation into Bill Clinton's pardon at the end of his administration of Marc Rich, who was indicted in 1983 and evaded prosecution in Switzerland. Rich died in 2013. The files briefly cited the Clinton Foundation in connection with a large donation in support of Clinton's presidential library. The FBI documents cited public records showing that an unidentified person donated to \"the William J. Clinton Foundation, a foundation that supports the Clinton presidential library.\" Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, pledged a $450,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation's project to develop and build the presidential facility. The new FBI archive does not name Denise Rich, but FBI agents sought to talk to her as part of the probe into her former husband's pardon. Despite the extensive redactions, the FBI archive cites evidence being prepared for a federal grand jury, agents' reports and internal memos. Agents appeared to be interested in a New York dinner in which the Rich pardon may have been discussed. The federal probe started under then-U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who now heads the Securities and Exchange Commission for the Obama administration. When White left office in 2003, she was replaced by James Comey, the FBI director now under fire for notifying Congress last week about his agency's decision to review emails to and from Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The Rich investigation did not lead to federal charges under Comey and the case was closed in 2005. Advertisement ",

The Indians could win it all tonight -- or lose it all tomorrow. But the city is on a winning streak.\u00a0 Cleveland fans have adopted a new nickname for their oft-maligned hometown: Believeland. But it wasn\u2019t always so. In the past the Cleveland Indians have been lifted into the World Series, no doubt, thanks to the cookies baked for them by Sister Mary Assumpta ... Announcer Tom Hamilton is the voice of the Indians. To sum up the past five decades for sports fans here: \u201cA lot of frustration,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cA lot of broken hearts. And a lot of championships that seem to be lost in almost historical fashion.\u201d With the Indians possibly on the verge of the city\u2019s second championship in a year, Cleveland appears to have put its painful past behind it. But this resurrection isn\u2019t just happening in the realm of sports. Not so long ago, this city was down for the count. In the late 1970s, Cleveland\u00a0 became the first major city to default on its financial obligations since the Great Depression. Cleveland became the poster child for the declining Rust Belt. Richie Piiparinen teaches Population Dynamics\u00a0 at Cleveland State University. \u201cWe rose with industry and we died with industry,\u201d Piiparinen says. \u201cPsychically, we lost our identity.\u201d ",

The talk, which took place after a regularly scheduled national security meeting at the FBI yesterday, was a \"one on one\" discussion, according to the source who briefed ABC News. The FBI, which previously investigated Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state, has pulled the hard drive from a laptop used by Abedin's now estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly sexting with a minor. The source said the two talked about \"the seriousness of the ongoing matter\" which has caused a political firestorm in the final days before the Nov. 8 election. Lynch wanted to check in to see how the FBI chief is doing, the source told ABC News. The conversation was described as \"cordial,\u201d and it was the first time the two spoke in person since the latest controversy erupted on Friday. The FBI and Lynch remain under pressure to release more information about the investigation. According to the source, Lynch has confidence in Comey to manage the developments in the probe. 0 Shares ",

Alnahdi and one of his best friends, Tommy Hutson, had hung out at some local bars that Friday evening. But on Saturday night, Hutson said he decided to stay home while his friend went out. Bars had just let out for the night as students wrapped up an evening of carousing. Tommy Hutson with his roommate Hussain Saeed Alnahdi. Courtesy Tommy Hutson But Alnahdi, a Saudi student attending the University of Wisconsin-Stout would never make it home. He was attacked and left bloodied in the street near Toppers Pizza, a restaurant in downtown Menomonie around 2 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) on Sunday, according to police. Alnahdi, 24, died on Monday from injuries he sustained during the attack. No arrests have been made and investigators are treating the incident as a homicide, the Menomonie Police Department said in a statement issued Monday. Hutson has thought a lot about their final night out together and the good times he once shared with a friend he described as someone who \"always had a smile on his face and and made an effort to put a smile on the face of others.\" Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, a student at University of Wisconsin-Stout, died after a weekend assault. Courtesy Tommy Hutson \"Everyone has cried themselves out at this point and we are trying to remember the good times,\" Hutson said. In his home country, Alnahdi's parents are distraught, said Abdul Rahman Kadi, president of the Saudi Students Association. He, too, is a friend in mourning and was there at the hospital the night Alnahdi died. He placed the painful phone call to Alnahdi's cousin and brother. Alnahdi's father was too distraught to come to the phone, Kadi said. Alnahdi's family has no relatives in the U.S., Kadi said. The Royal Consulate General Of Saudi Arabia in Houston told NBC New they are in touch with Alnahdi's family in his home country and has sent a staffer to Menomonie to learn more about the incident from authorities and help arrange transporting his body back to his family. \"We are in the process of appointing an attorney to help locate the attacker and to request the maximum punishment,\" the consulate said in a statement. \"This 24 year-old, self-sponsored student had decided to attend University of Wisconsin-Stout because he believed Menomonie is a safe town to live in. He had dreams of earning a degree to secure his future and support and family. We trust the authorities will find the offender, and we trust the American courts will ensure a just punishment.\" Detectives were still searching for a motive on Tuesday. Witnesses told police the assailant was a white male about six feet tall. \"The motivation of the offender is unknown at this time,\" Commander Todd Swartz of the Menomonie Police Department told NBC News. \"It can't be confirmed at this time whether this was a hate crime.\" And the university community where Alnahdi studied is searching for meaning in the death of a young man who a classmate described to NBC News as \"a quiet guy\". Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, a University of Wisconsin student, died from his injuries after being assaulted early Sunday on Oct. 30, 2016. University of Wisconsin-Stout Alnahdi was a junior majoring in business administration and had arrived at University of Wisconsin-Stout last year, school Chancellor Bob Meyer said in a statement. He was enrolled in the school's English as a Second Language Institute and waiting to be begin business classes, said Mark Fenton, program director of the university's business department. He'd transferred from the College of Technology at Buryidah in Saudi Arabia \u2014 a branch of the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation in that country. Michael Lee, the International Student Adviser at the university, told NBC News that Alnahdi \"was well-integrated in the student body and he was liked by all different students.\" He loved to go over to his friend's house and hang out, Ali Aldehami, a close friend told NBC News. Alnahdi was a \"a nice guy\" who lived off campus and was learning English, Aldehami said. The two friends always felt Menomonie was a small and safe town, he said. \"I've never seen an incident of this type,\" Aldehami said. The university community was similarly shocked. \"Our deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers go out to Hussain's family in Buraydah, Saudi Arabia, and his friends at UW-Stout,\" Meyer's statement added. University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross also sought to offer solace to Alnahdi's family, friends and the broader college community. Bowman Tower on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Stout. UW Stout via Facebook \"It is difficult to find the right words in light of such of a tragedy, except to express our sorrow for all that knew Hussain,\" Cross said in a statement. The university community was reeling on Tuesday from the news of Alnahdi's death. International students hailing from 42 nations make up 4 percent of the University of Wisconsin Stout's population. The school has 140 students from Saudi Arabia. Ursula Murray Husted, an assistant professor in comic and sequential art at the University of Wisconsin- Stout told NBC News that while Alnahdi wasn't one of her students she taught many of his friends. \"I am busy working on getting my students to the counseling center today,\" she told NBC News. https://t.co/jOORHUfZoH We lost a bright spark yesterday to an act of senseless violence-Hussain Saeed Alnahdi didnt pass. He was stolen. \u2014 Ursula Murray Husted (@umurrayhusted) November 1, 2016 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy organization that has tracked a rise in anti-Muslim crimes in neighboring Minnesota, said it is currently monitoring the situation. As for Hutson, he's trying to think about the guy with the ready smile who was \"very open and accepting\". The two became roommates in August of last year and a friendship quickly developed, Hutson said. When Alnahdi first moved in he could barely speak any English, but they were \"all amazed how fast he learned.\" And Hutson, and his other four roommates learned from him as well. \"He often considered myself and our other roommates as his family,\" Hutson said. \"He was there for us when we needed him most. He is one of the best friends I've ever had and life will be a little darker without him here to light it up. If I ever spoke to someone that thought negatively of Saudis or Muslims I would tell them they needed to speak to Hussain and they would feel differently. We came from different worlds, but he showed me every day how much we had in common. He was my brother and I'll never forget him.\" Emmanuelle Saliba ",

    "text": "Ballot measures would legalize pot, end death penalty, create single-payer health care By Steven Greenhut Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 While this year\u2019s explosive presidential politics have drowned out battles at the state level, voters across the country nevertheless face a daunting number of weighty ballot questions on\u00a0Nov. 8\u00a0\u2013 ranging from an effort to abolish the death penalty to one that would usher in a state-run health care system. Other states are jumping on the bandwagon of weighing marijuana legalization, while minimum-wage hikes, gun control and even a statewide plastic-bag ban are being put to voters. As usual, California leads in the number of\u00a0 statewide ballot measures with 17 , including ones that revisit two hot-button social issues from the past.\u00a0 At the top of the list are\u00a0 two competing measures regarding the death penalty \u00a0\u2013 one (Proposition 62) putting an end to it and replacing it with life without parole. The other (Proposition 66) puts time limits on appeals in an attempt to fast-track executions. If both measures get a majority, the one that receives the most \u201cyes\u201d votes wins. The fracas is reminiscent of the 1980s, when California voters bounced three sitting justices from the state Supreme Court because of their reluctance to implement the death penalty. California is also voting on\u00a0 Proposition 58 , which would allow public schools to restart controversial bilingual programs. The question dates back to a divisive battle in the 1990s over a system that taught immigrant children largely in their native languages, typically Spanish. The English for the Children campaign in 1998 mostly outlawed the practice and replaced it with English immersion. The ballot measure would reconsider that decision. In neighboring Nevada, voters are considering a far-reaching electricity deregulation measure known as\u00a0 Question 3 . If approved, it would insert language into the state constitution to require an \u201copen, competitive retail electricity market.\u201d Supporters see it as a way of breaking the public utility monopoly and jump-starting a marketplace filled with clean, alternative energy providers. Supporters include Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk. Opponents, mainly unions, depict it as a giveaway to billionaires. Meanwhile, as ObamaCare gets bad publicity for rapidly rising premiums, Colorado voters are being asked to approve ColoradoCare, which would finance a $36-billion \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d system to cover almost all Coloradans, thus making the Rocky Mountain State the single-payer guinea pig for the nation. To do so,\u00a0 Amendment 69 \u00a0imposes a 10-percent payroll tax on employers, who would pay two-thirds of it, and employees, who would pay the remaining third. Voters in Democratic-leaning Oregon also are being asked to slap a tax increase \u2013 2.5 percent on gross sales in excess of $25 million \u2013 on some of the state\u2019s largest employers.\u00a0 Measure 97 \u00a0would be the largest tax increase in the state\u2019s history, something that would be applied to total sales rather than profits. Opponents say it would raise the cost of goods and services, on everything from gasoline purchases to groceries. Proponents say it would provide needed funds for healthcare, senior services and public education. Five states are considering the\u00a0 legalization of marijuana for recreational uses \u00a0(Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada).\u00a0 Polls show the measures leading in California, Maine and Massachusetts, but struggling in Arizona and Nevada. States that already have legalized recreational marijuana are Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. (The District of Columbia largely legalized pot possession and cultivation at home only.) Graphiq In California, the lieutenant governor has championed a gun-control measure (Proposition 63) that would require background checks to purchase ammunition. In Washington state, Initiative 1491 would allow courts to issue an\u00a0 \u201cextreme risk protection order\u201d \u00a0to ban weapons from people who family members of police claim to be a potential danger. Minimum-wage fights will play out on five state ballots . Arizona, Colorado and Maine voters will consider initiatives that would raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. Washington\u2019s minimum-wage measure would raise it to $13.50 by 2020 and mandate that many employers provide paid sick leave.\u00a0 In South Dakota , voters face a referendum on a law that would lower the minimum wage for under-18 workers from $8.50 an hour to $7.50 an hour \u2013 an effort supporters say would reduce teen unemployment. There are some odd twists, too. A California referendum ( Proposition 67 ) will let voters either approve or reject a new law that forbids stores from handing out single-use plastic bags and requires them to charge at least 10 cents for alternative bags. Annoyed at the role played by grocery stores, plastic-bag manufacturers backed\u00a0 Proposition 65 as payback . It would redirect proceeds from new-bag sales from the grocers to a state environmental fund. According to Ballotpedia , there are 160-plus measures on statewide ballots. If voters avert their glaze from Trump vs. Clinton, they\u2019ll find plenty of substantive issues worth researching. Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute.
