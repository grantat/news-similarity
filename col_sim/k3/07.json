Part of a Nov. 6, 2016, letter from FBI director James Comey to Congress is photographed in Washington, Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016. Jon Elswick / AP The investigative team had \"been working around the clock to process and review\" emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop \u2014 using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state. In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said, \"The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.\" The news comes after the FBI announced it would review a new batch of emails that appeared to be \"pertinent\" to the investigation that was suspended in July, which had looked into Clinton's use of a private server. Multiple federal sources told NBC News that the emails were found as a part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl.

Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server.

    "text": "Court Denies Injunction to End Philly Transit Strike Before Election Day By Michael Edison Hayden Nov 6, 2016, 4:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Philadelphia Transit Strike Comes to an End 0 Shares Email The largest city in the battleground state of Pennsylvania may have no mass transit running on Election Day . Philadelphia transit workers remain on strike, after a judge in state court on Friday evening declined the transit agency's request to issue an injunction to force an end to the work stoppage for Election Day. But the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA , will have another chance to press its case for the injunction when the hearing resumes Monday. Pennsylvania is a battleground state, and Philadelphia, the state's largest city, votes overwhelmingly Democratic. The transit agency has said that Philadelphia's elderly, disabled and ill are most at risk from the loss of subway, bus and trolley services during the strike. \"We are not going to lie down while they can't resolve this strike, and just watch our passengers suffer. Not going to do it,\" Gino Benedetti, a lawyer for SEPTA, told ABC News' affiliate 6-Action News. But Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the Transportation Workers Union Local 234 has told ABC News that the union does not expect the strike to affect voter turnout in the city. \"Our members are really solid; nothing is moving in this city,\" he said of the workers' unity and the strike's effect on bus, subway and trolley transportation. Jacqueline Larma/AP Photo Signs hang on a telephone pole as workers picket across from the Callowhill SEPTA Depot, Nov. 1, 2016, in Philadelphia. Horwitz told ABC News today that while talks have progressed between SEPTA and the union, no agreement has been reached. \"There's been movement on all issues, but there's no tentative agreement on anything,\" Horwitz said. Horwitz said the primary disagreements between the two sides focused on the scheduling of workers, who he said were frequently not given adequate time to eat, rest between shifts or take bathroom breaks. In addition to the issues over scheduling, the union is fighting on issues over pensions and health care. The strike began at midnight Oct. 31. Philly Transit Workers Downplay Fears Strike Could Hit Turnout in Dem Stronghold Jacqueline Larma/AP Photo Transport workers man a picket line near the 69th Street Terminal, Nov. 1, 2016 in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. Megan Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Republican Party , told ABC News last week that its staffers are monitoring the transportation strike but haven't taken any specific actions yet to accommodate voters who might be hindered by it. Jacqueline Larma/AP Photo A pedestrian passes a locked rail station in west Philadelphia, Nov. 1, 2016. \"We always have a really aggressive plan to make sure people get to the polls, and we always have contingency plans,\" she said, adding that she believed that enthusiasm for Donald Trump in the traditionally Democratic-leaning city appeared \"very strong.\" ABC News has reached out to the Pennsylvania Democratic Party but has not received a response. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf urged both sides to keep a dialogue open until an agreement can be reached. \"Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvania residents rely on SEPTA to travel each day to and from work and school, and the inability of TWU and SEPTA to reach an agreement is devastating for many of these individuals and their families,\" Wolf said in a statement last week. \"This will create extreme hardships for the city and for businesses.\" The most recent previous strike by the union, in November 2009, lasted six days before being resolved. Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Clinton in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and stressed the importance of the state to the Democrats retaining the White House. \u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, we win this election,\u201d Biden said. 0 Shares ",

Got it Two days before the presidential election, surrogates for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump discussed the candidates\u2019 chances on Sunday morning shows. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Jenna Johnson , Anne Gearan and John Wagner November 7 at 1:15 AM Follow @wpjenna Follow @agearan Follow @WPJohnWagner LEESBURG, Va. \u2014 Arriving here after midnight, Donald Trump promised a raucous crowd that he would end trade deals supported by \u201ccrooked Hillary,\u201d scrap the Affordable Care Act and dramatically restrict the arrival of refugees in communities that don\u2019t want them. \u201cWhen I\u2019m elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program, and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We\u2019ll keep them out,\u201d the Republican nominee told hundreds of people packed into a barn at the Loudoun County fairgrounds, with even more listening from outside. The stop was Trump\u2019s fifth since Sunday afternoon, several of them in Democratic strongholds he is trying to wrest away from Hillary Clinton in hopes of creating a path to victory on Tuesday. After starting his day in Iowa, where polls show him ahead, Trump stumped in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all states that have gone for Democrats for more than a quarter century. Until recently, polls had showed Clinton with a comfortable lead in Virginia as well. Clinton, meanwhile, campaigned in Pennsylvania, where she maintains a lead, and in Ohio and New Hampshire, two battleground states that could go either way. Clinton has maintained a narrow lead nationally and has several more plausible scenarios than Trump for winning in the Electoral College. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. The candidates\u2019 frenzied pace Sunday came as news broke that, after an expedited review of newly discovered Clinton emails, FBI Director James B. Comey had affirmed his decision that she should not face charges related to her use of a personal server as secretary of state. During Trump\u2019s Michigan rally \u2014 a state a Republican presidential candidate last carried in 1988 \u2014 he said Clinton was \u201cbeing protected by a rigged system, it\u2019s a totally rigged system.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton is guilty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. Now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8th.\u201d [ Clinton leads by five points nationally as Trump personality concerns persist, Post-ABC Tracking Poll finds ] Comey\u2019s announcement on Oct. 28 that the FBI was scrutinizing newly discovered email reinvigorated Trump\u2019s campaign in the closing stretch of the race, and polls in multiple battleground states have tightened since then. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri reacted to the FBI news on the campaign\u2019s flight to a Cleveland rally, telling reporters: \u201cWe are glad to see that ... [Comey] has confirmed the conclusions he reached in July, and we are glad that this matter is resolved.\u201d Clinton is using the closing days of the race to try to both shore up support in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where she has been leading and to tip the balance in other swing states. How the electoral college works Clinton appeared Sunday night in New Hampshire, where the race has tightened considerably. \u201cThis election is a moment of reckoning,\u201d Clinton told her crowd in Manchester. \u201cIt a choice between division and unity. ... What\u2019s really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren.\u201d Clinton was introduced at the rally by Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father of slain U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died while serving in the 2004 Iraq War. Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention and was later criticized by Trump, posed a pointed set of questions to Trump about whether his son, a Muslim, and other minorities would have a place in his America. \u201cWould anyone who isn\u2019t like you have a place in your America, Mr. Trump?\u201d Khan said. \u201cOn Tuesday, we\u2019re going to prove America belongs to all of us.\u201d Clinton said that Khan\u2019s family \u201cexemplify the values that make America great.\u201d Folk singer James Taylor performed at the rally ahead of Clinton\u2019s appearance. Clinton appeared earlier Sunday at a rally in Cleveland, where she was introduced by Cleveland Cavaliers basketball star LeBron James, part of an effort to spark enthusiasm in Ohio, a state where polls have showed Trump leading. \u201cI want an America where everyone has a place, where everyone is included,\u201d Clinton said there. \u201cAnd I know there is a lot of frustration, even anger, in this election season. I see it, I hear it, you know, I\u2019m a subject of it. I get it. But anger is not a plan. Anger is not going to get us new jobs.\u201d The more optimistic look toward the future was a script her campaign had hoped to use as a springboard past the exceptional rancor of the last several months of her contest with Trump, but it had been muted somewhat by the uncertainty surrounding the renewed FBI inquiry and the tightening polls. Sunday\u2019s event was Clinton\u2019s last scheduled visit to Ohio, where she trails despite heavy emphasis on turning out black voters in Cleveland. James was part of that effort, as were husband and wife singers Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, who performed a get-out-the-vote concert with Clinton on Friday night. In attempt to cobble together the 270 electoral votes needed to win, Trump has new targets in his sights in historically Democratic states including Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico. Once thought to be safe for Democrats, Michigan has become a last-minute battleground, with Clinton heading to Grand Rapids on Monday, the campaign announced this weekend. President Obama, who won Michigan twice, will campaign in Ann Arbor on Monday. And former president Bill Clinton made a stop in Lansing on Sunday after visiting churches in Flint. Clinton began her day Sunday by campaigning in Philadelphia after attending a get-out-the-vote concert in the city on Saturday night. And she will return to the state for two rallies on the eve of Election Day, a sign that the Keystone State is among the battlegrounds where her lead over Trump has dwindled in recent days. Her campaign announced that rock star Bruce Springsteen would join her at a Philadelphia rally that will also include President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. [ What to know about the 15 states that will decide the election ] Clinton also deployed a full slate of high-level surrogates around the country on Sunday, including Obama, who appeared in Kissimmee, Fla., and poked fun at Trump. \u201cApparently his campaign has taken his Twitter,\u201d Obama told the crowd at Osceola County Stadium. \u201cIn the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said we\u2019re just gonna take away your Twitter. Now, if somebody can\u2019t handle a Twitter account, they can\u2019t handle the nuclear codes.\u201d Trump started his five-state swing in Sioux City in eastern Iowa, close to the Nebraska border. Nebraska is one of two states that can split its electoral votes between candidates, and in 2008, one electoral vote from the Omaha area went to Obama. Trump\u2019s stop in Northern Virginia on Sunday night came as Republicans see new hope in a state where Clinton has long held a comfortable lead. He promised \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts for the middle class and to rebuild inner cities that he said in some cases are \u201cworse than war zones.\u201d And Trump decried NAFTA and other trade deals that he said are robbing the country of jobs. \u201cWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will stop the jobs from leaving Virginia, that I can tell you.\u201d At an earlier rally Sunday in Minneapolis, Trump told the crowd that Clinton was taking the Democratic leaning state of Minnesota for granted by not visiting it. Trump also warned about a local immigrant population: Somalis, most of them Muslims, who have left their war-ravaged country and settled in large numbers around Minneapolis. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have the right to talk about it. You don\u2019t even know who\u2019s coming in. You\u2019ll find out. You\u2019ll find out,\u201d Trump said. He mentioned a recent stabbing case, in which the suspect is a man whose parents brought him from Somalia when he was three months old. \u201cYou\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota.\u201d In Michigan, rock star Ted Nugent, a native of the state who in a 2012 Facebook post called for Clinton to be tried and hanged for treason, provided entertainment at the rally, declaring it was \u201cgood to see the real Michigan together.\u201d When Trump took the stage, he ticked off a series of trade deals that he said had devastated the state. He falsely claimed that Clinton is supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending deal supported by Obama. Clinton previously backed the deal while secretary of state but has since come out against it. [Is there a \u2018hidden\u2019 Hillary Clinton vote among women?] Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign continues to use its huge financial advantage over Trump to press its case to swing voters on the airwaves. The campaign on Sunday released two national ads appealing to moderate and Republican voters to reject Trump and embrace Clinton. Both ads feature straight-to-camera testimonials from Republican military veterans who say they cannot vote for their party\u2019s nominee, citing Trump\u2019s comments about women. Another two-minute ad was set to air Monday night, aimed at reaching about 20 million people, according to a campaign aide. Trump also released a closing campaign ad , a two-minute spot tying Clinton to the \u201cfailed and corrupt political establishment\u201d and \u201cglobal special interests.\u201d But the ad, which features images of piles of cash along with Jewish corporate and financial leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen, was sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for what it called anti-Semitic overtones. Gearan reported from Manchester, N.H., and Wagner reported from Washington.

Chiu / For The Times Angelenos line up at the North Hollywood polling station Sunday to cast their ballots ahead of Tuesday's election. Angelenos line up at the North Hollywood polling station Sunday to cast their ballots ahead of Tuesday's election. (Ring H.W. Chiu / For The Times) Sarah Parvini Contact Reporter Thousands of Angelenos braved long lines and, in some cases, waited up to four hours to take advantage of early voting this weekend at half a dozen polling stations set up around Los Angeles\u00a0County.\u00a0 From West Covina to Culver City, voters woke up before sunrise for a chance to be the first in line to cast their ballots and beat the inevitable crowds ahead of Tuesday\u2019s general election.\u00a0 At the polling station in North Hollywood, the line began in front of the public library, where voters stood with beach chairs slung across their backs, headphones plugged in or with cups of coffee\u00a0in tow. The trail snaked behind the building,\u00a0around the park and down the sidewalk.\u00a0 Jason Wesley drove by the hordes of voters on Saturday and decided he would wait until Sunday to cast his ballot. He arrived about 6:45 a.m. Sunday to try and avoid the line. \u201cI thought if I came an hour early, I\u2019d be OK,\u201d said Wesley, 37, who voted early because he will be out of town on Tuesday.\u00a0 By 9:45 a.m., he was still waiting to vote. \"There\u2019s a lot of planning that has to happen to vote early,\" he said. \u201cI still have 200 people in front of me.\u201d A record 19.4 million Californians are registered to vote in advance of the general election, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. More than 78% of eligible state residents are registered, the highest percentage in two decades, and 1.2 million additional voters are registered for this presidential election compared with 2012, the office said. Early voting in Los Angeles County Thousands turn out for early voting in Los Angeles County this weekend. (Bryan Chan / Los Angeles Times) Thousands turn out for early voting in Los Angeles County this weekend. (Bryan Chan / Los Angeles Times) See more videos In Los Angeles, officials said they were\u00a0\u201cseeing good turnout\u201d at several of the county\u2019s polling stations.\u00a0 \u201cPeople are very enthusiastic about the election,\u201d said Brenda Duran, a spokeswoman for the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s\u00a0Office. \u201cThey are being very patient.\u201d A total of 7,756 ballots were cast last weekend at early voting stations, Duran said. Sunday afternoon, voters broke that record. More than 8,000 Angelenos voted on Saturday alone, Duran said,\u00a0most of them in North Hollywood and Torrance. More than 25,000 people have voted early in L.A. County so far, she said. Early voting stations across the county opened from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. over the weekend. The Norwalk office will also be open for early voting on Monday. Sandy Santacreu, who lives four blocks away from the\u00a0North Hollywood Regional Library, said she wanted to cast her vote early because she wanted to avoid traffic \u2014\u00a0and worrying about work \u2014 on election day. She took her place in line about 7 a.m., she said. The atmosphere was peaceful rather than stressful, Santacreu said, and voters were helpful when others needed to briefly step away for coffee or food.\u00a0 A couple feet away, voters sat under a large white tent and waited for their numbers to come up. As\u00a0poll workers read from a list, a man in a striped\u00a0shirt jumped up from his seat and yelled, \u201cYahtzee!\u201d to a roar of cheers. Those still waiting clapped each time workers called a number. Parents walking with strollers stopped by the tent\u00a0to watch. \u201c4205?\u201d one voter said after the number was announced. \u201cThat\u2019s how many hours we\u2019ve been standing here, right?\u201d\u00a0 Along the surrounding\u00a0streets, drivers slowed their cars to a crawl to snap photos of the line and honked their horns in support.\u00a0 Like many others,\u00a0David Harvey arrived at the North Hollywood polling station just after dawn to find 100 people already waiting in line. Election 2016 \u00a0|\u00a0 Live coverage on Trail Guide \u00a0|\u00a0 Sign up for the newsletter \u201cAll in all, it\u2019s fairly well-organized,\u201d Harvey, 57, said. \u201cI have never seen such long lines. It\u2019s an important election.\u201d The New York native said he was pleased to see the election, no matter how divisive, was \u201cturning people out and not turning people off.\u201d Zoe Bergeron walked out of the library and up to her mother, Jane, with a grin. It was her first time voting, and after taking a government class the 18-year-old found the experience invigorating.\u00a0 \u201cI was nervous. ... I thought it was going to be more complicated,\u201d she said, adding that voting was well worth the wait. \u201cSeeing the line around the block, that was awesome.\u201d If anything, the large crowd created a sense of camaraderie,\u00a0Jane Bergeron said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to see a long line. The only time I had to wait in line was voting for Obama in 2008,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cYou had that sense that voting mattered. I get that same sense now. It\u2019s an important election, and you feel that.\u201d Caption Iraqi civilians flee Mosul area, white flags flying As Iraqis flee the Mosul area, they and the Iraqi military fear Islamic State fighters may have put on civilian clothing and joined the flood.

In July, after a year-long investigation, the FBI concluded that charges against Clinton were not warranted, saying agents had not found any evidence that Clinton knowingly sent or received classified information on the server.

    "text": "FBI clears Clinton after round-the-clock review of new emails, Comey says James Comey J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press FBI Director James B. Comey. FBI Director James B. Comey. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) David Lauter and Del Quentin Wilber Contact Reporters The FBI 's much-trumpeted new scrutiny of emails related to Hillary Clinton has turned up nothing that would cause the bureau to recommend charges against her, the bureau's director, James B. Comey , has told Congress. Nine days after rocking the presidential race with word that a new trove of emails had been discovered, Comey sent a brief letter to Capitol Hill that, in effect, put an end to the renewed controversy. The letter said that agents \"have been working around the clock to process and review\" the emails, which had been found on a computer owned by former Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin . FBI letter on Hillary Clinton emails Open link \"During that process, we have reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,\" Comey wrote. \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\" In July, Comey sharply criticized Clinton for being \"careless\" in handling classified materials but said there was no basis for bringing any criminal charge against her. A law enforcement official familiar with the matter said that almost all of the emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer were either duplicates of messages the FBI already had reviewed or were personal in nature. None rose to level that would cause agents to reconsider whether Clinton or her aides had knowingly mishandled classified information, the official said. Clinton\u2019s campaign quickly expressed satisfaction with the announcement. \u201cWe are glad this matter is resolved,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri.\u00a0 But the news from the FBI seems unlikely to calm the anger of many Democrats who have called for Comey to resign. His announcement that the emails had been discovered had violated Justice Department rules designed to prevent investigative actions from influencing elections, many prominent Democrats have said. Even if Clinton wins the presidential election, many Democrats fear that the controversy set off by Comey\u2019s announcement, which dominated news coverage of the campaign for the past week, had\u00a0damaged their prospects in several close Senate races that could determine control of the chamber. Comey was appointed by President Obama in 2013 to a 10-year term as head of the FBI. He prides himself on his independence and tangled with the White House in his previous job, as a senior Justice Department official\u00a0in the George W. Bush administration. The fact that Comey\u00a0is a Republican, however, coupled\u00a0with a seeming deluge of leaks damaging to Clinton from current or former FBI agents in recent days, has caused concern among many Democrats. The substance of Comey\u2019s announcement was not surprising \u2014\u00a0although the timing was. Former government officials and outside legal experts with knowledge of the case had said in recent days that the chances were slim that any of the newly found emails would change the FBI\u2019s previous conclusions. Bringing a charge would require\u00a0finding evidence that\u00a0clearly demonstrated that Clinton or her aides knowingly broke the law, exchanged materials they knew to be classified\u00a0or attempted to interfere with the investigation by withholding or destroying evidence, according to former federal prosecutors and legal scholars. During its nearly yearlong investigation of Clinton\u2019s email practices, FBI agents already had interviewed dozens of witnesses, conducted forensic tests and examined\u00a0tens of thousands of messages. In that previous phase of the investigation, the bureau had discovered information that officials said should have been considered classified in 193 emails that were part of 81 email chains. Eight of the chains should have been treated as top secret, the highest level of classification, the FBI reported. None of the emails was\u00a0marked with a classified header, however, and officials said they had not turned up evidence that Clinton or her aides had known that the information was considered classified. Indeed, State Department officials continue to dispute whether at least some of the messages should have been considered classified at all.

The shirt has the word #CAB printed on them, and stands for Coach Art Briles, (Photo: Tony Gutierrez, AP) Brenda Tracy\u2019s voice caught, and she started crying as she has, off and on, since Saturday morning when she first saw a photo of Baylor fans lining up to buy T-shirts to wear in support of Art Briles, the former football coach fired in the wake of a wide-ranging sexual assault scandal. Recent reports now include explosive allegations of gang rapes committed by Briles\u2019 former players. \u201cThe photo itself is so hurtful,\u201d Tracy told USA TODAY Sports on Sunday afternoon. \u201cTo see this person selling those T-shirts and all those people standing in line \u2014 it was so hurtful. My heart was breaking for these survivors because I know what they must be feeling like. I just couldn\u2019t believe how cruel and callous and mean people can be. \u201cI get that you like Art Briles, and that\u2019s fine. You can think he\u2019s a good football coach, but when you\u2019re campaigning for him, you\u2019re campaigning against these survivors. What you\u2019re doing is so extremely hurtful.\" The line for #CAB shirts outside McLane Stadium. pic.twitter.com/mmbLG7Qw2f \u2014 Ryan Osborne (@RyanOsborneFWST) November 5, 2016 Tracy, who said she was gang-raped by then-Oregon State football players in 1998 and has since become an advocate for rape survivors, has been frustrated all fall by Baylor\u2019s response to a university-wide sexual assault scandal that also engulfed the football program and cost school president Ken Starr, athletic director Ian McCaw and Briles their jobs. Tracy even had visited with the team earlier this year to share her story and ideally help football players understand consent and sexual assault prevention. Now, after seeing the Baylor team take the field on Saturday in black uniforms and fans wearing those #CAB T-shirts, Tracy believes the school should cancel the rest of the football season. \u201cAll this stuff keeps coming out and these people just keep defending that man (Briles) \u2014 at the expense of all these victims and survivors \u2014 and I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why nobody is standing up and saying something about it. \u2026 You know that this is being organized. Why would you do this?\u201d Tracy paused to regain her composure. Baylor fans line up for T-shirts supporting Art Briles \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about 15 years of wanting to take my own life. I think about how badly I wanted to die every day. I think about these young women, and they\u2019re already traumatized by a rape, especially the women who were gang-raped. They\u2019re already struggling to survive, and you are putting this further trauma on top of them. It\u2019s like spitting in their faces. \u201cI think about how much they must be struggling \u2014 and how shameful it is of Baylor in this football season to not even care what these victims are going through. I\u2019m so angry with them. \u2026 You\u2019re making sure their lives are destroyed. People treat us (rape survivors) like we\u2019re not even human, like we don\u2019t even matter.\" Tracy read about Harvard canceling the remainder of its men\u2019s soccer season after it discovered those players had sexually objectified and written lewd observations of members of the women\u2019s soccer team. She thinks that\u2019s what Baylor should do with its football program \u2014 nothing the university has done so far has really shown that the players, coaches and program as a whole have learned anything from this scandal. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Baylor end the season for this?\u201d Tracy said. \u201cTo me, this is egregious behavior. This is not OK on any level. You cannot tell me that those assistant coaches and players didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\" After the release of the Pepper Hamilton report earlier this year, nine assistant coaches remained with the football program, now under direction of interim coach Jim Grobe. Those assistant coaches have remained steadfastly loyal to Briles amid what they perceive is an unjust firing, trying to convince visitors like Tracy that Briles did nothing wrong, and tweeting out statements disputing the new news reports regarding a 2011 gang rape. There's a #CAB banner hanging from one of the suites at McLane Stadium #Baylor #TCUvsBAY pic.twitter.com/urkDe5K6hO \u2014 Jessica Morrey (@JessicaMorrey) November 5, 2016 Kendal Briles, Art Briles\u2019 son and the Bears\u2019 offensive coordinator, wrote the letters CAB \u2014 for Coach Art Briles \u2014 on his hands during Baylor\u2019s season-opening win. Since then, the hashtag #CAB has gained traction among those in the Baylor fan base who believe the scandal is part of some wide-ranging conspiracy to oust the school\u2019s most successful football coach; this subset of fans also tends to believe that the sexual assault survivors who have come forward are either lying or anomalies and not part of a program-wide or school-wide problem. #CAB T-shirts and the subsequent push for a \u201cblackout\u201d to protest Briles\u2019 firing were planned for Saturday\u2019s game against TCU. Baylor players wore black uniforms, too, although the team denied that the uniforms were for any other reason than that of a heated rivalry against the Horned Frogs. \u201cNo,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re embroiled in this scandal. You are intentionally doing things to be hurtful and spiteful. I felt like that game and those uniforms were so disrespectful. \u2026 Those assistant coaches, I\u2019m so frustrated with them. What type of leadership is that? You should not have those kids in black uniforms. You know what black uniforms stand for. Even if those kids were innocent, and, \u2018Oh it\u2019s just a game and we do this every year' \u2014 in the middle of this scandal, and people trying to organize blackout for Art Briles, you don\u2019t do it. Period.\" Brenda Tracy speaks out after disappointing encounter at Baylor Tracy said she\u2019s tried to give Baylor the benefit of the doubt in the past, particularly because Grobe had invited her to visit with the team. She wants to believe that the players were engaged and absorbed her lesson. She wanted to believe that the coaching staff was, too. But receivers coach Tate Wallis accosted her afterward , trying to convince her Briles had done nothing wrong and she shouldn\u2019t even have visited. \u00a0And she\u2019s watched the other assistants tweet #TruthDontLie and other related hashtags to support Briles and antagonize those in the Baylor university administration who do want to address the scandal and implement changes. So Tracy says she is done being optimistic \u2014 and is now calling for the rest of the football season to be canceled. She believes only a drastic measure will actually affect change at this point. Baylor (6-2) has four games left in the regular season. ",

    "text": "WATCH Pope Francis In A Minute 0 Shares Email Days before the U.S. presidential election, Pope Francis spoke publicly about the danger of citizens becoming 'walled-up' and tyrannized by people exploiting their fears. Some observers at different ends of the U.S. political spectrum took the pope's address as an indirect criticism of some of the policies of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has proposed to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The pontiff spoke at the Vatican on Saturday evening before the Third World Meeting of Popular Movements, a collection of grassroots groups representing the poor. Pope Francis warned against \"the terrorism of an economy focused only on making money,\" fostering fear so that \"the citizens who still have some rights are tempted by the false security of physical or social walls ... Walls that enclose some and exile others,\" according to Catholic News Service . \u201cNo tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears,\u201d the pope further said, according to a transcript provided by Vatican Radio. \u201cCitizens are walled-up, terrified on one side; on the other side, even more terrified, are the excluded and banished,\u201d Pope Francis said. His remarks drew both praise and criticism on Twitter.

Earlier this year, the pope directly criticized Trump's proposal to build a border wall. \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" the pontiff told journalists in February. \"This is not the Gospel.\" A Vatican spokesman said afterward that Pope Francis was not personally attacking Trump or telling anyone how to vote. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Obama seeks to settle scores with Republicans as he campaigns for Clinton Barack Obama John Raoux / Associated Press President Obama speaks at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee, Fla. on Sunday. President Obama speaks at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee, Fla. on Sunday. (John Raoux / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli Campaigning for Hillary Clinton at a Florida baseball stadium, President\u00a0Obama lamented Sunday that the nature of this year\u2019s presidential race has become so negative that even \"Saturday Night Live\" this week couldn't keep parodying it.\u00a0 What bothered him most, the president said, was the way \"stuff that\u2019s not normal, people have been treating like it\u2019s normal.\" He referred to how just days ago he encouraged people at one of his rallies\u00a0to show respect for a Donald Trump supporter who came\u00a0to protest the event. But Trump claimed just hours later that Obama had yelled at the man. \"Didn't just make it up, but said the exact opposite of what had happened, with impunity,\" he said. \"There was tape. There was a video.... He thought it was OK just to lie in front of all his supporters. \"That says something about how unacceptable behavior has become normal,\" Obama added. \u201cAnd that's why he is uniquely unqualified to hold this job. The good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure that he doesn't get the job!\" Obama also mocked Trump after a report that his own campaign apparently had taken away his access to Twitter, where Trump has been known to send insulting\u00a0missives. \"If somebody can\u2019t handle a Twitter account, they can\u2019t handle the nuclear codes,\" Obama said. It was a typically chesty speech from the outgoing commander in chief as he not only stumps aggressively for Hillary Clinton to succeed him, but settles some scores with the Republicans who have tried to stifle his every move for eight years. In his reelection campaign four years ago, Obama would talk somewhat optimistically \u2014 in retrospect, perhaps naively \u2014\u00a0about his view that Republicans who had opposed him\u00a0in his first term would be more cooperative should he win a second. Knowing he would not be on the ballot again, there was less political incentive to deny him policy victories, and perhaps political incentive to try to find common ground, he thought. \u201cThe fever will break,\u201d he would say back then. \u201cC'mon, man,\u201d has become his head-shaking\u00a0credo now.\u00a0 Obama on Sunday again attacked Republicans who support Trump even though they hold private\u00a0\u2014 and some even public \u2014 reservations about him.\u00a0He also warned that electing a Republican Congress would lead to a continuation of the obstruction he's faced. \"They're suggesting they might impeach Hillary. They don\u2019t know what for yet. But they\u2019re thinking about it,\" Obama said.\u00a0 Gridlock, he continued, is not \"some mysterious fog that descends on Washington,\" or something equally the fault of Democrats and Republicans. \"You want some more endless gridlock, vote for Republicans. You want an America that can do better \u2026 then you need to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot,\" he said. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)\u00a0has emerged as one of\u00a0Obama\u2019s favorite targets, an example of a\u00a0Republican whose devotion to defeating Democrats sometimes supersedes his personal and policy convictions.\u00a0 Rubio supports Trump now, Obama said, even though he called Trump a con artist while running against him for the GOP nomination.\u00a0 \"He tweeted, 'Friends don\u2019t let friends vote for con artists,'\" Obama said.\u00a0\"Guess who just voted for Trump a few days ago? Marco Rubio.\u201d Rubio's opponent, Rep. Patrick Murphy , appeared before Obama on Sunday. \"If you want a senator who will say anything, do anything, be anybody just to get elected, then that\u2019s your guy,\" Obama said of Rubio. \"If you want a senator who will show up and work for you and tell you the truth, then vote for Patrick Murphy and give Hillary some help.\" Obama made just one stop Sunday here in Central Florida, a key swing area in the always-important battleground state. \"We win this election if we win Florida,\" Obama said. \"If we win Florida, it's a wrap.\" Monday he has three appearances scheduled,\u00a0in Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. He will join Clinton at the latter. Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty. Gen.

Alex Wong/Getty Images Updated at 7:46 p.m. ET Following up on his letter that set off a firestorm of speculation just two weeks before U.S. voters head to the polls to choose a new president, FBI Director James Comey says the investigative team that analyzed a new trove of emails that were either to or from Hillary Clinton has finished its work \u2014 and that the review doesn't change the findings he put forth in July, when he said no charges will be pursued against Clinton. \"Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\" Comey wrote Sunday, in an official communication with 16 chairmen and ranking members of relevant House and Senate committees. A Changing America Faces A Stark Choice This Election \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\" Comey wrote Sunday. Two sources familiar with the investigation tell NPR's Carrie Johnson the material the FBI recently discovered and reviewed largely contained copies of messages the agents had already seen or personal emails. In response to Comey's letter, Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri said the campaign had been confident that the FBI would reach this conclusion, adding, \"we're glad that this matter is resolved.\" The topic of Clinton's use of a private email server gained new immediacy on Oct. 28, when Comey sent a letter to leading members of several congressional committees, in which he said federal agents had obtained a search warrant, as NPR reported , \"to examine the thousands of emails found on a computer belonging to former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner that could be pertinent to the investigation\" into Clinton. Article continues after sponsorship Hillary Clinton's Path To Election Day: Plans, Luck And Self-Inflicted Wounds News of a potential new angle in the email investigation opened the way for Clinton's Republican rival Donald Trump to attack her \u2014 a crucial development that was seen as helping his candidacy rebound from the devastating release of a 2005 audio recording in which Trump bragged about groping women. In the wake of the FBI director's letter , the race tightened and Clinton was forced to play defense. At a rally Sunday evening in Sterling Heights, Mich., Trump directly responded to Comey's new letter to Congress. \"Right now, she's being protected by a rigged system,\" he told the crowd. \"You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days \u2014 you just can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.\" Earlier in the day, his vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence, touched on the matter at a rally in Hickory, N.C. \"Mishandling classified information is a crime,\" Pence said. \"Hillary Clinton said that she never sent or received any classified information, and the director of the FBI told the Congress classified information was sent.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Sunday afternoon that despite the FBI's findings, the incident shows \"a pattern,\" saying of Clinton, \"She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules.\" Comey's new letter comes after two weeks in which the FBI has been criticized for inserting the nation's top law enforcement agency into the closing weeks of a tense political season; Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid even wondered whether Comey had violated the Hatch Act . The new letter also comes four months after the legal issues at stake had seemed to be resolved: It was on July 5 that Comey announced that while Clinton and her staff were \"extremely careless\" in handling classified data via a private email server that Clinton used while she was secretary of state, the FBI was recommending no charges be brought against her.

Sixty-four percent of likely voters say the election of the next president has made the nation more divided, versus 23 percent who think it's made it more united. NBC News In addition, 62 percent say the country is headed in the wrong direction. And strikingly, 6 in 10 voters say the election has made them less proud of the country \u2014 compared with just 12 percent who said that before the 2008 presidential election. \"This election was never about hope, but it was an election about fear,\" says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the NBC/WSJ survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm. \"Donald Trump's message was the fear of what was happening to America, and Hillary Clinton's was about the fear of Donald Trump.\" Majorities have negative opinion of Trump, Clinton Both Clinton and Trump remain the most unpopular presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Fifty-nine percent of likely voters have a negative view of Trump, while 53 percent have a negative opinion of Clinton. So regardless who wins the election, the next president will be someone \"this country will be very uncomfortable with,\" says McInturff, the Republican pollster. When voters were asked about Clinton's and Trump's controversies and vulnerabilities during the presidential campaign, 76 percent said that whether Trump has the right temperament to serve as commander-in-chief is an important factor in deciding their vote. Sixty-five percent said the same of Trump's comments and language about women, immigrants and Muslims. For Clinton, 58 percent said her use of a private email server is an important factor in deciding their vote, and 50 percent said the same of the FBI's recent account of an investigation into thousands of emails that might be related to Clinton's use of private server. Obama's job-approval rating remains at 53 percent Despite that negativity, however, the popularity of the current Oval Office occupant remains high. President Barack Obama's overall job-approval rating stands at 53 percent among likely voters, which is unchanged from last month. Moreover, 51 percent have a position view of the president, versus 40 percent who have a negative view. And 49 percent said they would consider voting for Obama if the U.S. Constitution allowed him to seek a third term, compared with 50 percent who said they wouldn't consider it. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Nov. 3-5 of 1,282 likely voters (including more than 600 reached by cellphone), and it has a margin of error of plus-minus 2.7 percentage points. Mark Murray ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 6, 2016 10:19 PM EST FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to Congressional leaders Sunday that the agency has not found anything new that would warrant charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Comey wrote Sunday, in a letter sent to members of Congress and released by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California).\u00a0 This summer, the FBI announced that after a full investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, it was not recommending criminal charges against her. However, in a surprise move, Comey wrote to Congress on Oct. 28 -- barely ten days before Election Day -- to say that the agency was taking steps to review new emails relating to Clinton\u2019s case. That news was then leaked by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and the letter began to circulate more widely. The new emails came from the laptop of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. That announcement upended the 2016 race between Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump, with the Trump campaign praising Comey\u2019s actions and Democrats expressing concern that the FBI would make such an \u201cunprecedented\u201d move so close to Election Day. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d Comey wrote on Sunday. \u201cDuring that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State \u2026 I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.\u201d A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Comey reached his decision on not recommending charges Sunday shortly before he sent the letter to Congress. Comey reportedly had interaction with the Department of Justice before sending the letter to Congress, the source said. However, it\u2019s not clear as to whether he spoke with Attorney General Loretta Lynch directly. The bulk of emails to and from Clinton which were discovered on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop were found to be either personal emails or duplicates of emails previously reviewed by the FBI, the source said. Others had to be painstakingly investigated to determine if they contained sensitive national security matters. Dozens of FBI agents worked as fast as they could to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review. The assistance of special software helped in the efficiency of the process. Speaking to reporters aboard the campaign plane, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters they are happy the issue has been \u201cresolved.\u201d \u201cWe have seen Director Comey\u2019s latest letter to the Hill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were glad to see that as we were -- that he has found as we were confident that he would that he has confirmed the conclusions that he really -- reached in July and we\u2019re glad this matter is resolved.\u201d Trump, too, responded to the news at a rally in Minneapolis. \u201cYou have to understand, it\u2019s a rigged system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s protected.\u201d And then in Sterling Heights, Michigan, he cast doubt on the FBI\u2019s ability to process the emails so quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,\u201d Trump told the rally. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, folks.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the FBI\u2019s initial findings about Clinton\u2019s email practices were \u201ca damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment\u201d -- and that the new statement doesn\u2019t change anything. \u201cThe FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNone of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Fox2Now) A St. Louis man took his own life after he killed his two young sons in a local park, according to reports Sunday. Fox2Now reports Christopher Cadenbach, 43, killed himself in Cliff Cave County Park Saturday night after a shootout with cops. The station reported that police had issued an Amber Alert an hour earlier saying Cadenbach had abducted his sons Owen, 4, and Ethan, 5, in their mother\u2019s Ford Focus. Cadenbach\u2019s mother reported the abduction to police. St. Louis County Deputy Police Chief Ken Cox said the woman became alarmed when Cadenbach told him that he wasn\u2019t going to be taken alive and talked of \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d Cox said Cadenbach had a warrant out for his arrest on a domestic violence charge. Police in Franklin County issued the warrant earlier Saturday. Fox2Now reported that a park ranger saw the Ford around 8 p.m. Saturday and called police, the station reported. \u201cThe [police] helicopter was up, spotted the car and saw somebody moving toward the car,\u201d Cox said. \u201cOfficers responded down there and as soon as they go down there shots rang out, apparently shooting his children.\u201d Cox said Cadenbach then shot at the officers who fired back and then killed himself. Cadenbach had gone to his mother\u2019s house Saturday afternoon. She was watching the children. Cox said Cadenbach took his mother and the boys to a park for a few hours. He said Cadenbach\u2019s estranged wife had an order of protection. It wasn\u2019t clear if the order included the children. ",

    "text": "Cubs stars give 'SNL' a post-World Series song and dance Video: Chicago Cubs on 'SNL' Watch the Chicago Cubs on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Watch the Chicago Cubs on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Phil Rosenthal Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A trio of Cubs playing themselves -- David Ross, Dexter Fowler and Anthony Rizzo \u2013 were exotic dancers for a dead grandmother live from New York on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d the first stop on their post-World Series tour of late-night television. Later in the program, joined by \u201cSNL\u201d alumnus and longtime Cubs fan Bill Murray, they returned in matching straw hats and Cubs sweaters to (sort of) sing the fan anthem \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d in the guise of having won a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d version of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d \u201cThis is the best thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Fowler said flatly to little studio audience response. If both bits seemed awkwardly tacked on, it\u2019s understandable \u201cSNL\u201d would run a \u201cW\u201d flag up the pole in a bid to catch a bit of the national buzz the Cubs have generated with their first World Series championship in 108 years. After all, the decisive Game 7 on Wednesday averaged 40 million viewers on Fox, 5.6 million more people than this year\u2019s Academy Awards. The \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d bit, at least, was innocuous. As for the exotic dancer sketch, well, for fans keeping score at home, what might have been a wild pitch should probably go down as an error. The premise: A grandmother (played by Aidy Bryant who\u2019s remarrying is treated to a surprise bachelorette party. The shock of the unexpected celebration kills her instantly, but this goes unnoticed by both the guests and a pair of dancers (one played by guest host Benedict Cumberbatch). The dancers rubbed up against dead grandma, sprayed her with whipped cream to be licked off her. Then they announced that, as a special reward, actual Cubs players would perform. Fowler asked who wanted a \u201cgranny slam.\u201d Ross said not to worry because\u00a0 \u201cGrampa Ross\" would \"take real good care.\u201d Rizzo said something about \u201ca triple-header.\u201d Then they (sort of) danced. Even within the pantheon of sports stars on \u201cSNL,\u201d it wasn\u2019t quite was more Derek Jeter in drag than Peyton Manning nailing a hapless kid with a bullet pass. No one will confuse any of it with Nancy Kerrigan skating with Chris Farley, O.J. Simpson as a Conehead, Joe Montana as an extremely sincere roommate or Michael Jordan plagued by self doubts and telling himself: \u201cI'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!\" The Cubs are going to get more practice in the days to come. Just to start, on Monday night, Rizzo, Fowler and Ben Zobrist reportedly are scheduled to visit Jimmy Fallon on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show,\" while Kris Bryant is penciled in for ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d But even if it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019re going to quit their day jobs. philrosenthal@chicagotribune.com ",

By Chris Cillizza November 6 at 5:58 PM Follow @thefix FBI Director James B. Comey told lawmakers on Nov. 6 that the bureau won't recommend charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing newly discovered emails. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Nine days ago, FBI Director James B. Comey shook the political world with a letter to Congress noting that emails \u201cpertinent\u201d to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server had been discovered on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Today, 48 hours before Election Day, Comey sent another letter to key leaders in Congress \u2014 this one making clear that no charges would be brought against Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cWe have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Comey wrote. Um, what? Comey had to know that he would set off a political whirlwind with his first letter. The FBI investigation of Clinton's emails \u2014 and the fact that she used a private server exclusively during her time as secretary of state \u2014 has been an anchor around her campaign's neck for the entirety of the presidential race. Clearing Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing \u2014 while simultaneously blasting her judgment \u2014 in July, Comey seemed to put a stop to the political impact of the email controversy. To then turn around so incredibly close to the election and publicly announce that an investigation that had lain dormant for months was now back on because of the emails found on Weiner's computer suggested that there was some there there. And, the fact that investigators working on a case involving Weiner had known about the Clinton-related emails for weeks and had briefed Comey on them before he went public seemed to bolster the case that the director had a strong suspicion that something beyond what had already been discovered was on Weiner's computer. After all, it would be the height of irresponsibility to inject the email controversy back into the campaign on the off chance that something on Weiner's computer might implicate Clinton. If Comey had no real indication that there was evidence of problems for Clinton \u2014 above and beyond the errors in judgment he had previously knocked her for \u2014 then why go public with anything? Comey defenders will insist that he was in a no-win situation. Acknowledge the investigation of the Clinton-related emails on Weiner's computer publicly, find nothing, get blamed. Keep the investigation private until after the election and be accused by Republicans of pulling punches to help get Clinton elected. Sure, sort of. If this had been 2014 or even 2015, it's easy to see how Comey could and should make the choice he did. But, it's impossible to say that he and the FBI operate entirely outside of the political world or that the same rules of the road apply when it comes to when and whether things should be made public. Referees in the National Basketball Association ref the first 44 minutes (or so) of a game differently than they ref the final four minutes. They understand that in the final four minutes, the bar for a foul is higher because the stakes are raised. Shooting two free throws in a two-point game in the first quarter is very different from doing the same thing with 35 seconds left in the game. Same goes for Comey. He needed to understand that to say something about Clinton's email investigation so close to the election meant that he had very real concerns about the possibility of a president-elect being indicted. To simply say \u2014 after a nine-day hurricane of news stories about Clinton's emails \u2014 that there was never anything to see here is a remarkable swing and miss on Comey's part. The Clinton campaign won't say much about Sunday's Comey announcement for fear of re-injecting the FBI and her emails into the conversation in these last few days of the campaign. But, if I were them \u2014 or lots of down-ballot Democrats \u2014 I would be livid. politics ",

    "text": "Kohlhepp appeared before Magistrate Judge Jimmy Henson on Sunday for the brief bond hearing on the four murder counts. The issue of bond could be taken up by a circuit court later. Wearing an orange jumpsuit, Kohlhepp declined to make a statement when offered the chance. After Kohlhepp left the courtroom, Henson addressed the victims\u2019 families, saying, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve gone through ... is beyond what a lot of people would understand.\u201d Kohlhepp\u2019s arrest has put to rest for local law enforcement and the families of the victims a mystery that has haunted them for more than a decade. \u201cWe got \u2018em today. We got \u2018em today. I\u2019m rejoicing that this community can know that four people who were brutally murdered, there\u2019s no wondering about it anymore,\u201d Sheriff Chuck Wright said late Saturday night. Prosecutors said more charges are expected. A Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s investigative report says Kohlhepp \u201cconfessed to investigators that he shot and killed\u201d the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop. \u201cKohlhepp gave details ... that only the killer would know,\u201d the report says. Authorities say Kohlhepp is a suspect in at least three other deaths. Sheriff Wright says Kohlhepp also showed law enforcement officers Saturday where he says he buried two other victims on his 95-acre property near Woodruff. Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, was at the site for less than an hour. The sheriff would not say earlier Sunday whether more bodies were found in the graves Kohlhepp led them to, but he did say they would be excavated, reported CBS Spartanburg affiliate WSPA-TV . Those alleged grave sites are in addition to the body found Friday at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver , the boyfriend of Kala Brown, who was found Thursday. Carver and the woman went missing around Aug. 31. Their last known cellphone signals led authorities to the property. Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds. An anthropologist is helping determine how long Carver was buried, Clevenger said. He declined to say how many times Carver had been shot. The sheriff said it\u2019s possible more bodies will be uncovered. The wife of one of the 2003 victims said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the shop several times. Melissa Ponder told The Associated Press she was resigned that her husband Scott\u2019s death would never be solved before getting a phone call Saturday evening from one of the case\u2019s original detectives. Detectives told family members of all four victims of the confession at the same time. \u201cHe knew too much about the crime scene,\u201d Ponder said of Kohlhepp\u2019s account to detectives. \u201cHe knew everything.\u201d The Superbike killings stunned the Chesnee community, with rumors like they were committed by a Mexican drug gang or were part of a love triangle crushing the families of the victims. Melissa Ponder is glad the rumors weren\u2019t true. \u201cIt isn\u2019t closure, but it is an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am thankful for that.\u201d Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. Fifteen years after he was released from prison for that crime, Spartanburg County deputies were brought to his property by the last known cellphone signals of two missing people. On Thursday, they found Brown chained in a container for two months. She told investigators that Kohlhepp shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her.\u00a0 His prison stint didn\u2019t stop Kohlhepp from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm. Wright said \u201cit\u2019s strange\u201d that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long. Scott Waldrop, who\u2019s lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \u201cprepper\u201d who liked his privacy, but \u201che didn\u2019t seem like a threat.\u201d Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \u201cI was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hate to know somebody who\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private but liked to brag about how much money he made day trading online. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department hide caption toggle caption Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Todd Kohlhepp, 45, was arrested for kidnapping Thursday; on Saturday, he confessed to a nearly 13-year-old quadruple homicide. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Days after the dramatic rescue of a woman that a local sheriff said had been \"chained like a dog\" and held prisoner in a metal storage container in Woodruff, S.C., officials say the man accused of that crime has also confessed to a quadruple killing from 2003. Todd Kohlhepp, 45, was arrested Thursday after sheriff's deputies found Kala Brown on his wooded property. He now faces kidnapping charges and four counts of murder, with other charges likely to follow. The body of Charles Carver, Brown's boyfriend, was also found on Kohlhepp's property; the couple had been missing since late August. On Saturday, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said Kohlhepp, a realtor who was a registered sex offender due to a kidnapping and sexual assault case when he was a teenager in Arizona, had confessed to shooting and killing four people in Chesnee, S.C. \u2014 a case that's been known locally as the Superbike murders and which could now be solved on Nov. 6, its thirteenth anniversary. The number of murders Kohlhepp is charged with could still grow. He visited his property with deputies Saturday, and Wright says Kohlhepp claims to have buried two other bodies there, local TV WYFF reports . Article continues after sponsorship On Sunday, Kohlhepp appeared in a court hearing that saw a judge deny a bond. The 2003 killings at a motorcycle shop had been featured on America's Most Wanted back in 2012 . Announcing news of the confession late Saturday, Wright said the case had repeatedly prompted him and his deputies to pray. Enlarge this image Since 2003, the killings of four people at a motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., had remained unsolved. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department hide caption toggle caption Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Since 2003, the killings of four people at a motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., had remained unsolved. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department \"I can't even imagine what the victims' families have been going through,\" he said. When she was found on Kohlhepp's nearly 100-acre property, Brown told law enforcement agents that as many as four bodies could be buried there \u2014 prompting Wright to tell journalists Thursday , \"We're trying to make sure we don't have a serial killer on our hands.\" Wright added that in Kohlhepp, a serial killer \"very possibly could be what we have.\" As for how Brown was found, local TV news WSPA says that after she and Carver went missing in nearby Anderson County around Aug. 31, police had tracked her to the property where she was eventually found. From WSPA: \"Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said they were pinging Brown's phone two days after she was reported missing. He says it pinged on the property where Brown was found. The phone went dead after two days. \"Two weeks before they were able to get a search warrant for the property, the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office flew over the property and realized they needed to get on the ground. \"Anderson police say from early on they had no indication there was foul play, even with the cell phone pings.\" The recent discovery came after deputies executed a search warrant on Kohlhepp's property; they heard Brown banging on the container that was her prison, reports local TV News 13 . When the search warrant was finally executed, Kohlhepp was present at his property; he was arrested the same day. ",

Scott Waldrop, who\u2019s lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \u201cprepper\u201d who liked his privacy, but \u201che didn\u2019t seem like a threat.\u201d Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \u201cI was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hate to know somebody who\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private but liked to brag about how much money he made day trading online. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY NETWORK Why you should vote for me. Hillary Clinton campaigns Nov. 6, 2016, in Cleveland. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images) 22401 CONNECT TWEET 232 LINKEDIN 369 COMMENTEMAILMORE In January, America is going to have a new president. Things are going to change \u2014 that much is certain. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? We can build an economy that works for everyone, or stack the deck even more for those at the top. We can keep America safe through strength and smarts \u2014 or turn our backs on our allies, and cozy up to our adversaries. We can come together to build a stronger, fairer America, or fear the future and fear each other. Everything I\u2019ve done, as first lady, senator, or secretary of State, I\u2019ve done by listening to people and looking for common ground, even with people who disagree with me. And if you elect me on Tuesday, that\u2019s the kind of president I\u2019ll be. Here are four priorities for my first 100 days \u2014 issues I\u2019ve heard about from Americans all over our country. Donald Trump: Why you should vote for me First, we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. We\u2019ll invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come. We\u2019ll produce enough renewable energy to power every home in America within a decade. We\u2019ll cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire \u2014 because in America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. We\u2019ll pay for it all by asking the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share. And this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days. Creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidency. Second, we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was Ronald Reagan, and it was a priority for George W. Bush. I\u2019m confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship, secures our border, and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals. This is the right thing to do, and it will also grow our economy. Third, to break the gridlock in Washington, we need to get secret, unaccountable money out of our politics. It\u2019s drowning out the voices of the American people. So within my first 30 days, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. We should be protecting citizens\u2019 rights to vote, not corporations\u2019 rights to buy elections. Fourth, we need to get started on end-to-end criminal justice reform. Too many people have been sent away for far too long for non-violent offenses. I believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. There\u2019s so much more we need to do together, and we certainly won\u2019t get it all done in the first 100 days. But we\u2019re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for American families \u2014 and I\u2019ll never, ever quit. I want to be president for all Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans and independents; Americans of every race, faith and background. My opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness, fear and insults, and spent months pitting Americans against each other. I\u2019ve said many times that Donald Trump has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Because it\u2019s not just our names on the ballot this year. Every issue we care about is on the ballot, too. This is about who we are as a country \u2014 and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together, or change that pushes us further apart. It all comes down to this. I love our country. I believe in our people. And I think there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t achieve if we work together and invest in each other. Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president.

Seth Wenig/AP Mary Keitany of Kenya won her third consecutive New York City Marathon on Sunday, finishing in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 26 seconds, and leaving her closest competitors in the dust. Keitany pulled away from the elite women's pack less than halfway into the race and ran most of the race alone, her No. 1 spot uncontested over more than a dozen miles. The men's race was more conventional, with a pack of elite runners sticking together for more than half of the 26.2 mile course before 20-year-old Eritrean runner Ghirmay Ghebreslassie pulled away. He crossed the finish line in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 51 seconds, becoming the youngest man ever to win .

Jason DeCrow/AP Lucas Rotich of Kenya finished second in the men's field. Abdi Abdirahman, an American, finished third. Ghebreslassie finished fourth at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro over the summer. But Keitany was cut from Kenya's Olympic team \u2014 despite being the second fastest female marathoner ever. According to the International Association of Athletics Federations, only Paula Radcliffe has ever run a faster time than Keitany's 2012 London marathon time of 2 hours 18 minutes 37 seconds. Article continues after sponsorship What Makes Kenya's Marathon Runners The World's Best? Sunday was Keitany's triumphant return, showing that she could not only win, but do so without the luxury of fellow elite runners to pace her throughout the race. Sally Kipyego of Kenya took second place in the women's race with a time more than three minutes slower than Keitany's. Molly Huddle of the United States was third. In the women's wheelchair race, the American Tatyana McFadden won her fourth New York City Marathon title in a row, and her fifth overall, according to the official race press release . McFadden has dominated wheelchair racing since 2004 , when she won her first Paralympic Games medal as a 15-year-old. In 2012, she described how she won the right to compete as a young athlete at Atholton High in Howard County, Md.

Elsa/Getty Images NPR's Joseph Shapiro reported: \"[McFadden] wanted to be part of the high school track team. But on the eve of the first track meet, the coach refused to give her a uniform. She wouldn't be allowed to compete. \"After her mother complained, Tatyana was allowed to race, but not side-by-side with her teammates. At her first meet, her teammates and other competitors in the 400-meter race ran first. Then the track meet stopped and Tatyana was allowed to race \u2014 going around the track in her wheelchair, racing against no one. 'That was the most humiliating, embarrassing thing I've ever done, ever,' she says. \"She didn't want to be the girl in the wheelchair; even then, she wanted to be seen as a top athlete. 'People look at you and in their minds [they] see, 'Oh, the girl with a disability in a wheelchair is running for a high school team. Congratulations.' And for me as an elite athlete, it's not what you want as an elite athlete.'\" On the men's side, Marcel Hug of Switzerland narrowly won the wheelchair event, edging out Kurt Fearnley by six hundredths of a second, according to race regulators.

(Photo: Brennan Linsley, AP) 7135 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 174 COMMENTEMAILMORE For 17 months, I\u2019ve traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams. I\u2019ve been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare \u2014 Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof. It also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA and China deals that have deindustrialized the United States \u2014 importing unemployment and exporting our wealth. It means we don\u2019t have to keep kids trapped in failing schools \u2014 that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton: Why you should vote for me Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis \u2014 Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt. America has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation. It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people. That\u2019s what I\u2019m offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It\u2019s there for you to read at www.TheTrumpContract.com. In my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs. In my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged \u201copen borders,\u201d mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America\u2019s immigration officers described Hillary\u2019s extremist plan as \u201cthe most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history.\u201d I will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same. Finally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities. I am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the White House. Together, we will take our government back from the special interests \u2014 and we will Make America Great Again. Donald J. Trump is the Republican nominee for president.

The exchange between Podesta and Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden on July 24, 2015, started when Tanden asked if Podesta knew \u201cwho told Hillary she could use a private email? Has that person been drawn and quartered?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think Cheryl?\u201d Podesta answered. In a later reply to Tanden, Podesta added the kicker: \u201cAt least we now know why Cheryl didn\u2019t want her to run.\u201d CLINTON AIDE CRIED FOUL ON OBAMA'S EMAIL DENIAL That conversation wasn\u2019t the first time Podesta and Tanden had speculated that Mills played a central role in the establishment of Clinton\u2019s private email system. Just hours after The New York Times broke the Clinton email story on March 2, Podesta and Tanden exchanged emails about the nascent controversy that would dog Clinton throughout her run to the Democratic presidential nomination. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 \u201cThis is a Cheryl special,\u201d Tanden wrote in an email \u00a0that would later be hacked from Podesta\u2019s Gmail account and posted to WikiLeaks. \u201cKnow you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heal. Or kryptonite. She just can\u2019t say no to this s---. Why didn\u2019t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.\u201d Podesta replied \u201cUnbelievable\u201d before Tanden answered her earlier question: \u201cI guess I know the answer[.] they wanted to get away with it.\u201d Mills has been part of Team Clinton\u2019s orbit for decades, since serving as an associate counsel to President Bill Clinton starting in 1993. Mills also was chief of staff for Hillary Clinton during her tenure at the State Department. Additionally, Mills, who now runs her own company, has been a trusted adviser to Hillary Clinton, with emails showing Mills\u2019 influence extended from matters relating to The Clinton Foundation to numerous aspects of Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential run. The FBI interviewed Mills during its probe into Clinton\u2019s private email server, but Mills was granted partial immunity for her cooperation and wasn\u2019t charged with a crime. Advertisement ",

Jason Hammel delivers to the Cincinnati Reds in the first inning Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, at Wrigley Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Cubs started to look toward the future Sunday by cutting ties with 15-game winner Jason Hammel . The team announced it declined Hammel's option for 2017, making the right-hander a free agent. The option was worth $12 million, and Hammel gets a $2 million buyout. President Theo Epstein, in a statement, said the Cubs' intent was never to pick up the option and trade Hammel, which a few teams anticipated. \"While Jason is healthy and primed to have another effective season in 2017, we have decided to consider other internal and external options for our starting rotation next year,\" Epstein said in a statement. \"Our hope is that by giving a starting opportunity to some younger pitchers under multiple years of club control, we can unearth a starter who will help us not only in 2017 but also in 2018 and beyond.\" The only way the Cubs would have picked up the option was if the Cubs intended to keep him, Epstein added.

    "text": "FBI sends letter to Congress saying email review completed, decision not to prosecute Clinton stands Published               November 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI\u2019s original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would in the unrelated case review additional emails related to Clinton\u2019s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,\u201d Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. \u201cDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.\u201d Reaction from the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill to the letter, which still appears to leaves some unanswered questions, was swift and largely partisan. \u201cWe're glad this issue is resolved but for the record, this could easily have been learned before 1st letter was sent,\u201d tweeted Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton Democratic presidential campaign. \u00a0 The new case is purportedly related to ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner using a laptop he shared with estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin for \u201csexting\u201d an apparently underage female.\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Comey\u2019s letter last month said only that a new batch of emails \u201cappeared to be pertinent\u201d to the FBI\u2019s original Clinton email investigation. The Clinton campaign and it supporters howled that Comey with his letter had injected himself in the closing days of a very close White House race, while providing little information about the emails and the new probe. \"Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Sunday night. \u201cShe simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules. ... The American people should not have to endure four more years of their scandal and baggage. \u2026 Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump\u00a0on Tuesday.\" Neither Clinton nor Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has yet to comment on the Comey letter. Trump landed in Minnesota for a rally moments after\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement. He made no direct mention of the FBI decision and continued to insist that Clinton would be under investigation during her potential presidency. \"She's protected by a rigged system,\" he told supporters. \"She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president.\" Comey in July concluded the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of the private server system while at the State Department by saying some of the emails included classified information and that Clinton has been \u201cextremely careless.\u201d However, he declined to recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department, and the case was effectively closed. Clinton had appeared to be heading for a sweeping victory before the FBI review, but\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement blunted her momentum. Since then, national polls and battleground states have tightened, though Clinton still appears to hold an edge over Trump in the campaign's last moments.
