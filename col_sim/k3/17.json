Bruce Rauner's office during a veto session at the Capitol on Nov. 16, 2016, in Springfield. (Seth Perlman / AP) Privacy Policy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's budget office estimates the state's backlog of unpaid bills will hit a record $13.5 billion by July if the governor and Democrats who control the General Assembly remain deadlocked over a complete spending plan, a bleak reminder of what's at stake as negotiations begin anew. The projection came as the comptroller's office announced the bill backlog hit $10.6 billion on Wednesday, a situation that's turned thousands of vendors and small businesses into creditors for state government as they're forced to wait months to be paid for services rendered. Despite the grim prediction, Rauner and Democratic leaders gave little indication much will change to reverse that trend, as both sides seized on the figures to plead their case. Democrats led by House Speaker Michael Madigan pointed to the numbers as proof that it's time for Rauner to set aside the economic agenda he's made a condition of a larger budget deal, saying the state's budget problems are more pressing and changes would not bring about immediate savings. Rauner countered that Democrats aren't focusing on the big picture, saying quick budget fixes will mean nothing in the long term if Illinois doesn't take steps to help businesses grow and improve the overall economy. The figures were among the topics up for discussion as Rauner and legislative leaders met for the second day in a row ahead of the expiration of a temporary stopgap spending plan at the end of the year. Also on the agenda was an updated list of items the governor wants as part of a broader deal. They include a freeze on property taxes coupled with government consolidation, term limits for lawmakers and legislative leaders, a rewrite of the school funding formula and the curbing of costs associated with the workers' compensation system for employees hurt on the job. Rauner also wants an overhaul of the state employee pension system, which now has an unfunded liability of nearly $130 billion, according to a report released this week by the bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.

That might create a ... \u201cThe thing they most want - you know what one of the ten things: anything Trump. You believe it? My apartments, my ties. They love me,\u201d he said at a 2014 event.

Since 2013, the DWP has been plagued by a faulty computer billing system. (Richard Vogel / Associated Press) The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power owes its customers at least $67.5 million in refunds and credits after the utility overbilled them, an independent monitor has concluded. The latest estimate represents a significant increase from the proposed $44-million class-action settlement announced in August 2015. The DWP has been plagued by a faulty computer billing system launched in 2013\u00a0that overcharged tens of thousands of customers while failing to bill others at all.\u00a0 Officials said this week that after a year of working with the independent monitor and revising the settlement agreement, customers can expect to get refunds as early next summer. Under the terms of the settlement, DWP will refund customers 100% of the amount they are owed, officials said. Customers can also file claims for reimbursement if they disagree with the refund amount. Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the nation\u2019s largest public utilities. The tally for Measure RRR as of Wednesday afternoon was 52% against and 48% in favor, with 100% of precincts... Voters appear\u00a0to have rejected a ballot measure aimed at granting more autonomy to the scandal-plagued Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the nation\u2019s largest public utilities. The tally for Measure RRR as of Wednesday afternoon was 52% against and 48% in favor, with 100% of precincts... (Jack Dolan) The $67.5-million estimate is \u201ca floor,\u201d said Tom Merriman, an attorney with Landskroner Grieco Merriman, the law firm representing the ratepayers. He said his team expects \u201cthe\u00a0total value of the settlement to go up,\u201d in part because ratepayers have the right to make claims for \u201cconsequential damages\u201d stemming from the billing debacle, such as if a check bounced or if a customer unnecessarily hired a plumber.\u00a0 Both the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and DWP officials said they hope the court will grant preliminary approval to the revised settlement at a hearing Friday. If the court OKs the settlement, customers affected by the overbilling will receive letters detailing how much money they are owed within 90 business days, Merriman said. The $23-million increase brings the total estimated value of the settlement to about $90 million, according to court documents. The agreement requires LADWP to spend about $20 million\u00a0\u201cto remediate and stabilize\u201d its billing system. Not everyone is satisfied.\u00a0 Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said ratepayers have been waiting years to get refunds and still don\u2019t have a clear sense of what went wrong with\u00a0the billing system.\u00a0 Plaintiffs will ask the court to award attorneys up to $19 million \u2014 a $6-million increase from a previous version of the agreement \u2014\u00a0while the independent monitor can be reimbursed as much as $2.5 million, according to court documents. Those fees would be added to the $90 million already allocated by the settlement. But Court deems those\u00a0fees excessive. The lawyers in this case, he said, are \u201ccreating a very large \u2026 bill to enrich themselves.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAny extra money should be given to the ratepayers as interest on the three years of waiting,\u201d he said. Merriman, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, said\u00a0the judge will decide on the level of fees, and they may not total the maximum allowance. The flawed customer billing system was designed and implemented by PricewaterhouseCoopers , according to the DWP. In a statement, the nation\u2019s largest public utility said it has partnered with the city of Los Angeles and continues to \u201cpursue full repayment by PwC of \u2026 damages\u201d through separate litigation.\u00a0 City and utility officials have alleged\u00a0that the consulting firm misrepresented how it could help launch the\u00a0DWP's\u00a0system. The firm's initial contract with the city was $60 million; it was later increased by $9.2 million. Earlier this summer, attorneys for the city accused senior managers at PricewaterhouseCoopers of inflating their time records to earn additional payments and spending that money on liquor and prostitutes in Las Vegas. Representatives for the firm deny any wrongdoing and have called the original lawsuit \u201cmeritless.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Northern Californians who voted for Trump feel forgotten by the state , Megyn Kelly's new book took a new turn due to the elections , Twitter is trying to clean up , and the Crystal Cathederal is getting a new look.

Do we always bat 1,000? Not necessarily,\" Trump Communications Director Jason Miller told reporters gathered at Trump Tower on Wednesday. \"Last night probably was an example of where we could have been [in] a little bit better communication, but again, our goal going forward is to give you guys the best information in a timely fashion.\" Play Donald Trump Ditches Press, Steps Out for Dinner 0:47 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161117000427if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/809998403809\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump flouted years of tradition Tuesday night when he left Trump Tower without letting the reporters covering him that day know, and after his press secretary had told media his day had ended and not to expect any more movements from the president-elect. He visited a restaurant with his family, and the first indication the public was given of his plans was from a tweet posted by a Bloomberg reporter who happened to be dining at the same restaurant. NBC News was able to post a reporter at the restaurant after making a reservation to get in, and saw the Trump family, heavily guarded by Secret Service, finish their meal before Trump departed with a promise to the restaurant to lower their taxes. The president's movements are a matter of both national interest and national security, and since the creation of the White House press pool he typically has a member of the press with him at all times, even if they're held slightly apart from his activities, in case anything newsworthy happens to him. The White House Correspondents Association, the group that organizes the White House press pool, issued a statement from President Jeff Mason declaring it \"unacceptable for the next president of the United States to travel without a regular pool to record his movements and inform the public about his whereabouts.\" In the statement, Mason said they were \"pleased to hear reassurances by the Trump transition team that it will respect long-held traditions of press access at the White House and support a pool structure.\" \"But the time to act on that promise is now. Pool reporters are in place in New York to cover the president-elect as he assembles his new administration. It is critical that they be allowed to do their jobs,\" he said. Play ",

To be clear, at any given time, between 10 and 13 people live with Kenneth Shakespeare. \"I sleep in with my mom and dad where, um, they're in that room with the bunk bed and stuff,\" Taya Dixey, Lynell's 8-year-old granddaughter says. Lynell says it would be nice if Taya's family could move into a trailer now sitting on the property, but says that means paying $6,000 to install electricity, which is money they don't have. One of Lynell's daughters is on the waiting list for low-cost tribal housing, but has been waiting for two years. Lynell says, anyways, the family prefers to live together and take care of their elder. Article continues after sponsorship \"We don't want to go to housing,\" she says. \"We can stack up here.\" Patrick Goggles, who serves as Northern Arapaho Tribal Housing director, says Lynell and her family's preference to stay together is not uncommon. \"We find that a cultural value that enhances our family life,\" Goggles says. Oregon Occupation Unites Native American Tribes To Save Their Land He says a high birthrate has led to a population explosion and that traditional lifestyle is now strained. The tribe has grown to 11,000 people, but if they want to stay with family on the reservation, they have to cram into one of only 230 homes. \"In the business I'm in you never have all the funds or resources you need,\" Goggles says. Goggles says 600 more homes need to be built, but he has to use the funds he has to keep the limited housing livable. Heidi Frechette works for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Native American Program. She says Congress hasn't made sure funding has kept up with inflation over the years, or with the growing tribes. \"We're finding that folks are using more and more of their funds to rehab or repair existing homes and have less buying power and ability to construct new homes,\" Frechette says. More than 55 percent of the Northern Arapaho tribe can now be categorized as homeless because they're couch surfing. Tribal administrator Vonda Wells says that kind of overcrowding hurts families. \"People get stressed and...things happen...violence happens,\" Wells says. And she says with more domestic violence comes chronic illness such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. These living environments are especially hard on the kids. Wells says there is one boy she knows who sleeps on a bench every night.

And then, him trying to learn, trying to think about what his teacher's telling him and he's exhausted.\" With these problems in mind, tribal leaders have been brainstorming ways to eliminate overcrowding without giving up on multigenerational living and possibly building homes to accommodate extended families with lots of bedrooms and bathrooms, and big living rooms for hosting ceremonies. For the Shakespeare family, a roomy kitchen would be great. \"Oh, is this the elk meat, Jojo?\" Lynell asks. The family has gathered to cut and dry an elk brought in from a recent hunting trip. They say, until more homes are built, they'll keep living in a traditional lifestyle, even if it is crowded. ",

By Karen Tumulty November 16 at 12:40 PM Follow @ktumulty ORLANDO \u2014 Republican governors, including some who feuded with Donald Trump during the bitter presidential campaign, say they are bullish on his prospects to deliver what he has promised but warn that he must maintain his discipline and move quickly. Gathering for the first time since last week\u2019s upset election, members of the Republican Governors Association (RGA) said that Trump\u2019s win will be a boon for them as well. \u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Wednesday at the closing public session of the two-day conference. \u201cI think there\u2019s a road map.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recalled in an interview that, as his state\u2019s attorney general, he had filed 31 lawsuits against the current administration over policies including President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, greenhouse-gas rules and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. \u201cThe Trump administration is going in there and doing exactly what the states have been calling for,\u201d Abbott said of the president-elect\u2019s promises to dismantle all of those measures starting on Inauguration Day. Florida Gov. Rick Scott answers questions during a news conference at the Republican Governors Association conference Nov. 15 in Orlando. (John Raoux/AP) South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley once said that Trump represented \u201ceverything a governor doesn\u2019t want in a president\u201d and jabbed at him in her response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address this year as \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices.\u201d But on Tuesday, she told reporters she is \u201cjust giddy\u201d about what lies ahead in a Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019ve never known what it\u2019s like to have a Republican president,\u201d she said. \u201cI can tell you, the last six years, Washington was the hardest part of my job.\u201d [ Key figures purged from Trump transition team ] She and other state chief executives also noted frequently that Trump has chosen one of their own \u2014 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2014 to be his vice president and run his transition. Pence spoke to the group in a private session Monday. The governors here are well aware that the collective fate of their party at the statehouse level could hinge on whether Trump succeeds in the early years of his presidency. The GOP holds 33 governorships, the highest level of either party since 1922, when Warren G. Harding was president. But the map for them will be challenging in the 2018 midterm elections. Of the 36 states where governorships will be on the ballot, at least 15 will be open seats now held by Republicans. Only three of the gubernatorial offices that will be vacated because of term limits are in the hands of Democrats. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, left, speaks alongside Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson at the Republican Governors Association conference Nov. 15 in Orlando. (John Raoux/AP) The celebratory atmosphere here at the conference, heavily attended by lobbyists and donors, was a decided contrast from the RGA\u2019s meeting four years ago in the wake of GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat. At that meeting, Louisiana\u2019s then-governor, Bobby Jindal \u2014 then the incoming RGA chairman and considered among his party\u2019s brightest presidential prospects \u2014 had admonished Republicans that \u201cwe need to stop being a dumb party\u201d and become more inclusive. Jindal turned out to be one of 16 Republican contenders vanquished by the outsider Trump in the GOP primary. He folded his campaign even before the Iowa caucuses, saying, \u201cThis is not my time.\u201d Four years ago, former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour spoke to the RGA of the need to \u201cgive our political organization a very serious proctology exam.\u201d In an interview Wednesday, he said: \u201cPeople here are upbeat. They want Trump to succeed. They want governors to be part of helping him to succeed.\u201d [ President Obama warns of a \u2018crude sort of nationalism\u2019 in the U.S. ] If Trump does follow through on some of his biggest promises, however, there will also be challenges for Republican governors \u2014 among other things, what to do about health coverage for the estimated 20\u00a0million people who have gained it under the Affordable Care Act. Abbott argued that the problems of the revamped health-care system, including higher premiums and fewer choices for some who purchase policies, will put pressure on Democrats in Congress to work with Republicans in fashioning something to replace it. Obamacare \u201cwas subject to the death penalty already. The question was when it was going to die,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIt will atrophy and die within two years, regardless of the hissy fit the Democrats in Congress are going to throw.\u201d The governors here said they have been largely impressed by the discipline Trump has shown most of the time since the election and the moderate tone of his public comments. \u201cI hope he can continue to be that same person, using that same tone,\u201d South Carolina\u2019s Haley said Tuesday. But she added that Trump must also convince the country that real change is occurring on his watch. \u201cThe key is communication, communication, communication,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunicate what is being done. His goal should be to do something every day. Communicate every day to the American people on what you\u2019ve changed today.\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 another failed GOP primary candidate \u2014 said it would be \u201ca good use for his Twitter feed.\u201d Thus far, governors said, they have not been concerned about Trump comments such as when he indicated he would \u201camend\u201d Obamacare, which sounded less ambitious than his pledge to repeal and replace it. But Florida Gov. Rick Scott cautioned that as president, Trump will have to choose his words more carefully. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to work with your legislature, you\u2019re going to have to be precise,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cHe will. He has to.\u201d Some also called for more clarity in Trump\u2019s dealings internationally. \u201cIn the first 100 days, he\u2019s got to give assurance to our allies and confidence in his leadership,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said during a panel discussion. \u201cHe needs to provide clarity on immigration and border security. Those are expectations of the American people, and during the campaign it was opaque.\u201d In an interview afterward, Hutchinson said, hopefully, \u201cI think we will be reassured in the coming weeks.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Got it The Post\u2019s Greg Miller explores what\u2019s behind the national security shake-up within President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller November 16 at 4:50 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to push back against news coverage describing a chaotic transition to power, saying the process of selecting Cabinet secretaries and working with the Obama administration \u201cis going so smoothly.\u2019\u2019 As Trump met with senior advisers to discuss potential Cabinet candidates, there were further signs that power in his transition effort was consolidating within an ever-smaller group of loyalists generally not aligned with Republican members of the Washington establishment. [ The latest news on the Trump presidential transition ] Among them is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump adviser known for his hard-line views on immigration. His former staff director at the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is now helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump\u2019s team, according to two prominent Republican lawyers with knowledge of the matter. 1 of 8 Here\u2019s what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 11, 2016\u00a0 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/\u201d60 Minutes\u201d via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Benczkowski replaced Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former U.S. attorney and associate attorney general who had been managing the Justice Department transition, the lawyers said. A white-collar defense attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski previously worked in a number of senior Justice Department jobs and is a respected lawyer. His elevation is likely another indication that power has shifted away from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who was recently replaced as head of the transition team by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and who had been considered an emissary to more mainstream Republicans. Benczkowski declined to comment. The new developments came as Sessions himself emerged as a top candidate for defense secretary, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Both would bring hawkish views and military experience, but neither has executive experience running a massive bureaucracy such as the Pentagon. Trump was also visited Wednesday by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who emerged from a meeting with the president-elect saying that he told Trump that \u201cso many New Yorkers are fearful\u201d of what he plans to do as president. De Blasio, a liberal Democrat, has clashed with Trump in the past. And like mayors in many of the nation\u2019s major cities with diverse cultures, he has said New York City authorities would not assist federal immigration officials with the deportations of immigrants who are here illegally, providing them sanctuary. Despite such differences, De Blasio said the hour-long session was \u201crespectful\u201d and added that Trump \u201cloves this city.\u2019\u2019 Here are the people the rumor mill says Trump might pick for Cabinet spots Transition turmoil On his Twitter account, Trump took particular aim at a favorite target, the New York Times, which reported Wednesday that the transition has been marked by firings and infighting, and that U.S. allies were having trouble reaching Trump at New York\u2019s Trump Tower as he plans his government. \u201cThe failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. . . . I have received and taken calls from many foreign leaders,\u2019\u2019 Trump wrote in a series of posts on the microblogging site. He also denied reports that his transition team has sought security clearances for his children. In his tweets, Trump falsely implies the Times reported that he had not spoken with foreign leaders and never points out exactly what the Times had in error. The Times did report that American allies were \u201cblindly dialing in to Trump Tower\u201d in an attempt to reach the president-elect and that key members of the transition team had been fired. The paper reported that even key U.S. allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May had been patched through to Trump \u201cwith little warning,\u201d citing a Western diplomat. Later in the day, the transition team released a list of foreign leaders that Trump and Pence have spoked with. [ Trump\u2019s gripes about the Times are usually about stories that prove accurate ] The Washington Post has also reported about turbulence in Trump\u2019s transition . But Peter Hoekstra, a Republican former congressman from Michigan, defended Trump in an interview Wednesday, saying the president-elect\u2019s team has \u201ca monumental job to do and a short time to do it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just watching all the sniping coming in. They\u2019re not doing this right. They\u2019re not doing that right,\u2019\u2019 said Hoekstra, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman who is reportedly under consideration for CIA director. \u201cThis is what any transition team would do. You start with the people who brought you. I think the Trump team is going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they\u2019re going to do it in a methodical way.\u2019\u2019 The reported bloodletting in Trump\u2019s transition team that began with last week\u2019s ouster of Christie had escalated Tuesday with new departures, particularly in the area of national security. Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) announced that he had left his position as the transition\u2019s senior national security adviser. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leading candidate for CIA director, was among at least four transition officials purged this week, apparently because of perceived connections to Christie. As turbulence within the team grew, some key members of Trump\u2019s party began to question his views and the remaining candidates for top positions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Trump\u2019s efforts to work more closely with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin amounted to \u201ccomplicity in [the] butchery of the Syrian people\u201d and \u201can unacceptable price for a great nation.\u201d Trump met Tuesday with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who replaced Christie at the head of the transition Friday, to discuss Cabinet and White House personnel choices. Little to no information was released by the transition office, leaving a clutch of reporters gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower to hustle after team members passing between the front doors and the elevators. Trump posted a message Tuesday night on Twitter saying that a \u201cvery organized process [is] taking place\u201d as he decides on Cabinet and other positions. \u201cI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d As he had during the campaign, Trump appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable with outsiders and suspicious of those considered part of what one insider called the \u00ad\u201cbicoastal elite,\u201d who are perceived as trying to \u201cinsinuate\u201d themselves into positions of power. Those in the inner circle reportedly were winnowed to loyalists who had stuck with Trump throughout the campaign and helped devise his winning strategy. They include Sessions, former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and members of Trump\u2019s family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. \u201cThis is a very insular, pretty closely held circle of people,\u201d said Philip D. Zelikow, a former director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and a senior figure in the George W. Bush transition. \u201cConfusion is the norm\u201d for transitions, he said, \u201cbut there are some unusual features here, because they\u2019re trying to make some statements.\u201d \u201cThey feel like their election was a lot of the American people wanting to throw a brick through a window,\u201d Zelikow said. \u201cThey want to make appointments that make it sound like glass is being broken.\u201d [ President Obama warns against \u2018a crude sort of nationalism\u2019 in the U.S. ] Increasingly, among the shards are more mainline Republicans in the national security field. In an angry Twitter post Tuesday, Eliot A. Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump during the campaign who had advised those interested in administration jobs to take them, abruptly changed his mind, saying the transition \u201cwill be ugly.\u201d After responding to a transition insider seeking names of possible appointees, Cohen said, he received what he described as an \u201cunhinged\u201d email from the same person saying \u201cYOU LOST\u201d and accusing Trump critics of trying to infiltrate the administration\u2019s ranks. \u201cIt became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls, instead of the sense that actually what you\u2019re trying to do is recruit the best possible talent to fill the most important, demanding, \u00adlowest-paying executive jobs in the world,\u201d Cohen said. Rogers\u2019s departure coincided with word from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose possible selection as secretary of state comforted more mainline Republicans, that he was unlikely to be chosen. \u201cHas my name been in the mix? I\u2019m pretty sure, yeah. Have I been having intimate conversations? No,\u201d Corker said in an interview. \u201cDo I understand that it\u2019s likely that people who\u2019ve been involved in the center of this for some time, and have been surrogating on television, are likely front-runners? I would say that\u2019s likely, yes.\u201d The two people whose names are mentioned most often for the diplomatic job \u2014 former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and John R. Bolton, an undersecretary of state and one-year ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 are Trump loyalists. But both could be problematic, even among Republicans who would have to confirm them. Giuliani, thought to be an early choice for attorney general, was said by a person close to the transition team to have personally appealed to Trump for the diplomatic job. He has virtually no diplomatic experience or knowledge of the State Department bureaucracy. Bolton, a national security hawk who got his U.N. job through a recess appointment after the Senate refused to confirm him, was a leading advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, contradicting Trump\u2019s campaign position opposing it. Congress voices concern Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that Bolton would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that he would actively oppose his nomination. Others were more supportive. \u201cIf he picks John Bolton, then I\u2019ll support John Bolton. If he picks Rudy, I\u2019ll support Rudy,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The shortlist for defense secretary is said to include Sessions, Flynn and Cotton. Although Sessions serves on the Armed Services Committee, his main issue there has been immigration. Cotton is a Harvard Law School graduate who just seven years ago was a first lieutenant in the Army. Senate confirmation of Flynn, who also has voiced interest in serving as director of national intelligence, could be difficult, said the person close to the transition team. He was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency after two years over concerns about his leadership, and he has potentially problematic connections to foreign governments. [ A profile of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a key Trump national security adviser ] Flynn has admitted that he accepted money for appearing at a lavish gala with Putin in Moscow last year. He recently criticized the Obama administration\u2019s treatment of Turkey in an opinion column, without disclosing to the Trump campaign that his consulting firm has financial ties to that country, said the person close to the transition, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Another possible barrier for \u00adFlynn, who retired as a three-star general after leaving the DIA in 2014, is the statutory requirement that the defense secretary be at least seven years removed from active duty. Flynn has told members of the transition team that getting a waiver to this requirement would be \u201cno big deal,\u201d said the person involved with the team. But that assertion has been met with at least some internal skepticism, including from Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who asked at meetings whether such a waiver \u201chas ever been done before.\u201d The Senate waived the provision, part of the 1947 National Security Act, when President Harry S. Truman appointed retired Gen. George C. Marshall to the post in 1950. The person with ties to the transition said support for Flynn has waned as it has become evident that \u201che has some confirmation-type problems.\u201d But Flynn\u2019s influence in the transition remains high, and several sources on the transition team or with ties to Christie said Flynn and Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had seized control of the national security posts in the new administration and engineered the purges in what they described as a troubling episode of political score-settling. Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean Sr. (R), a longtime mentor to Christie, said in an interview that Kushner was widely considered unhappy with Christie\u2019s handling of the transition. There was \u201csome shock\u201d within Christie\u2019s circle at their abrupt dismissal from the transition ranks, Kean said. Tensions between Christie and Kushner date back more than a decade. In 2005, Christie, then the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, led the successful prosecution of Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, a prominent real estate developer and philanthropist, who was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion and witness tampering. Christie also has been beset by scandal of his own making. After a month-long trial that put his gubernatorial administration in a negative light, two of his former top aides were found guilty Nov. 4 for their roles in disruptive 2013 lane closures on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge. In addition, Christie is believed by some Trump intimates to have been insufficiently loyal in the final weeks of the campaign. Those who have been ousted along with or following Christie include Richard H. Bagger, a former Christie chief of staff who had been executive director of the transition, and William J. Palatucci, a New Jersey Republican who served as the transition team\u2019s general counsel. Most recent departures, a transition official said, include Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former Justice Department official who was in charge of that agency in the transition. The New York Times also reported the exit of Matthew Freedman, a protege of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who headed the National Security Council transition team. Earlier, Freedman privately told associates that the Trump team would be \u201cvery punitive\u201d toward Republicans who signed letters opposing him during the campaign and was looking to put \u201ctrue loyalists\u201d in top jobs. None responded to repeated efforts to contact them. The person close to the transition team said it was made clear to Rogers when he received a call from Trump adviser Rick Dearborn that he was being moved aside because of connections to Christie. In an interview after announcing his departure from the team, Rogers said: \u201cI still want them to be successful. I want them to be able to get a handle on the national security infrastructure of the United States and get it in the right direction. I still think it can happen.\u201d Ellen Nakashima, Philip Rucker, Robert Costa, Missy Ryan, Adam Entous and Julie Tate contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's transition, walks by reporters while exiting Trump Tower on Tuesday. Spencer Platt/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump's first week after pulling off an upset victory has had plenty of missteps. That rocky start to his transition planning that one source described to CNN as a \"knife fight\" has done little to assure his critics and skeptical Republicans that he'll have a smooth ascension to the Oval Office surrounded by qualified advisers. Trump denies that the transition is rocky. From the outset, his former transition chief throughout the campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, had to be replaced with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Just days before the election, Christie's top aides had been convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, and a pall of scandal hung over one of Trump's most loyal backers who likely would have had a top job in the new administration. From Lobbyists To Loyalists, See Who's On Donald Trump's Transition Team But with Pence now at the helm, the Indiana governor has apparently done little to steady the ship or stop leaks to the press. Trump's closing refrain of his campaign was that he would \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, but his initial transition team was flush with lobbyists . In one of his first moves, Pence ordered the removal of all lobbyists, according to the Wall Street Journal . Several very experienced members of the transition team \u2014 whose presence gave wary lawmakers comfort \u2014 have departed too. Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stepped down though several reports say he was let go. He had been seen as a possible candidate to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, but NBC News reported he was ousted in what two sources close to the former congressman described as a \"Stalinesque purge\" of Christie loyalists. Article continues after sponsorship \"I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,\" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Shaping Trumponomics: These Names Are Being Floated For Cabinet Posts CNN also reported that the overhaul of Christie's picks was spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. There's no love lost between Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, and Christie, who prosecuted Kushner's father for tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004 as a U.S. attorney. President-Elect Trump Names Pence To Lead Transition Team But his reported instigation of removing experienced hands like Rogers was described to CNN by sources as a \"knife fight\" that was \"mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues.\" Former State Department official Eliot Cohen, who served under President George W. Bush, had been a Trump critic but said he was open to advising him after the real estate magnate's upset victory. But on Tuesday, he had done a complete turnaround, painting the transition as chaotic and motivated by revenge. After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming \"you LOST!\" Will be ugly. \u2014 Eliot A Cohen (@EliotACohen) November 15, 2016 Cohen later told the New York Times in an interview that \"Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered some names of people who might serve in the new administration, but only if they felt departments were led by credible people.\" \"They think of these jobs as lollipops,\" Cohen told the Times. President-elect Trump's outreach to and from foreign leaders has been confusing and disorderly too, per the Times: Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through \u2014 a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain. On Monday Trump touted his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 who he repeatedly praised throughout the campaign even as U.S. intelligence found the Russian government had hacked into the Democratic National Committee to try and influence the American elections. That drew a sharp rebuke from Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who said that Putin's promises of improved U.S.-Russia relations should be taken with \"as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.\" Trump's rumored choices for America's top diplomat have also been met with controversy. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's most passionate surrogates during the campaign, is said to be atop the list. But Politico reported Tuesday that consulting work he did for foreign governments and companies, and the money he accepted from places like Qatar, Venezuela and from Iranian exiles, could prove problematic \u2014 not to say that Trump repeatedly criticized the Clinton Foundation for taking similar gifts from foreign governments. Another name that's surfaced to lead the State Department has been former UN Ambassador John Bolton. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who was among the challengers to Trump during the GOP primaries, said on CNN Tuesday that the former Bush appointee was \"totally unfit\" for the job, and also dismissed Giuliani as a choice. In a closely divided Senate, where the GOP is expected to have a 52-48 advantage, Republican defections will matter. Ex-Breitbart Executive Brings Alt-Right Ties To The White House All of the skirmishes over his transition team and possible cabinet picks may pale in comparison to furor over his controversial appointment of former Brietbart News Head and his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be his senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has ties to the alt-right movement, that's associated with white nationalism. Trump has also denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. NBC News reported Tuesday night Trump had requested a security clearance for Kushner, his son-in-law, so that he could join him for his daily security briefings. Trump tweeted Tuesday denying that the transition was in turmoil. But he added a bit of bombast and suspense typical of his background as a reality TV host: Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 And, in typical Trump fashion, he also took shots at the press, in particular the New York Times calling its reporting \"inaccurate\": The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, \u2014 Donald J.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump denied Wednesday that his transition was in disarray, assailing news media reports about firings and infighting and insisting in an early-morning Twitter burst that everything was going \u201cso smoothly.\u201d But legal and procedural delays by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team continued on Wednesday, all but freezing the traditional handoff of critical information from the current administration more than a week after Mr. Trump won the presidential election. The president-elect criticized a report in The New York Times about his early telephone contacts with foreign leaders. In a post on Twitter , he said he had made and received \u201ccalls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.\u201d The Times reported that Mr. Trump had taken calls from the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Russia and Britain, but said they had been conducted haphazardly and without State Department briefings that traditionally guide conversations with foreign leaders. Of the transition effort, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cIt is going so smoothly.\u201d Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that the effort to fill staff positions in the new administration was \u201cvery calm, it\u2019s very structured.\u201d He said that reports of chaos were being spread by disgruntled former members of the transition or people bitter about the election results. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was put in charge of the transition last Friday, has counseled Mr. Trump not to feel pressured to make announcements rashly, according to people familiar with the deliberations inside Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Miller said Mr. Trump was taking a \u201ca very structured, methodical approach\u201d to staffing. Mr. Miller also rejected as \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d reports that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had been purging the transition team of people allied with Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, who was removed last week as head of the transition effort. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Picking His Cabinet. Here\u2019s a Shortlist. But Mr. Miller confirmed that Mr. Pence had directed that the transition should not include lobbyists, confirming reports that some existing members of the team had been asked to leave. Mr. Miller said that officials were \u201cmaking good on President-elect Trump\u2019s promise that we\u2019re not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts. When we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps. And so, the bottom line is, we\u2019re going to get the transition team where we need it to be.\u201d White House aides said Obama administration officials at agencies across the government remained legally barred from delivering the normal guidance and briefings to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team because essential documents had still not been completed. A wholesale shake-up of Mr. Trump\u2019s team \u2014 replacing Gov. Christie and the transition staff he had assembled \u2014 has forced Mr. Pence to sign a new memorandum of understanding, a legally required document. White House officials said Mr. Pence delivered that document to them on Tuesday. But by Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s team still had not delivered a series of required, supporting documents, including certifications that each transition member would abide by a code of conduct and would not divulge sensitive information about the inner workings of the government. \u201cThe next step is for the president-elect\u2019s transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the White House. \u201cOnce we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts.\u201d Advertisement ",

Despite the dire warning , Hawking also tried to sound a hopeful note about the future of human achievement. \u00a0 \u201cRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet,\u201d Hawking said, according to The Independent. \u201cTry to make sense of what you see, wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don\u2019t just give up.\u201d In recent months, Hawking has used his stature in the sciences to make broad statements about the thorny moral and political dilemmas facing modern societies. In an essay published in The Guardian in July, Hawking argued that in order for humans to survive the massive, serious challenges ahead \u2014\u00a0 climate change , overtaxed food production, and overpopulation, to name a few \u2014 they need to resist the individualism and isolationism that have fueled political movements like Brexit . \u201cWe will need to adapt, rethink, refocus and change some of our fundamental assumptions about what we mean by wealth, by possessions, by mine and yours. Just like children, we will have to learn to share,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we fail then the forces that contributed to Brexit, the envy and isolationism not just in the UK but around the world that spring from not sharing, of cultures driven by a narrow definition of wealth and a failure to divide it more fairly, both within nations and across national borders, will strengthen. If that were to happen, I would not be optimistic about the long-term outlook for our species.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Kushner, who has been married to Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, since 2009, has been a close adviser to Trump and a mainstay at the Trump Tower while the transition teams maps out next year's administration. Like Trump, Kushner is the son of a wealthy real estate developer and has become an extremely successful businessman in his own right. Trump Receives 1st Presidential Daily Brief The request for Kushner's security clearance comes one day after Trump and his Vice President-elect Mike Pence received their first presidential daily brief, or PDB, a highly sensitive rundown of the days most urgent national security issues typically reserved for the president and a handful of his top officials. It is customary for the president to offer that same briefing to the president-elect. Kushner's advisory role within Trump's innermost circle has been elevated since it was announced on Friday that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would be taking over control of the transition process from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who was let go. The 35 year-old Harvard graduate was one of only a handful of advisers Trump brought with him to the White House last week, and he was seen walking the south lawn with President Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough . Ron Sachs/Polaris Jared Kushner and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough walk through the Rose Garden as they discuss the Presidential Transition in the Oval Office of the White House, Nov. 10, 2016, in Washington. Trump denied reports that he had previously requested security clearances for his children, tweeting today that \"this was a typically false news story.\" 0 Shares ",

Jones has regularly and falsely claimed the Sandy Hook shooting was staged and that no one was killed. Erica Lafferty lost her mother, school principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, in the shooting, which also claimed the lives of 20 children and five other adult at the Connecticut school. \"You've appeared on Jones' radio show, praised his 'amazing' reputation and promised him that you 'won't let him down,'\" Lafferty said in a Medium post . \"Now he's claiming you've personally called to thank him after the election, and will be on his show again soon. That's unacceptable.\" Related: Infowars' Alex Jones Says Trump Made Thank You Call Jones, has spread a variety of baseless conspiracy theories, including that the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by the government. His site, Infowars, was a hub for pro-Trump and anti-Clinton conspiracies during the campaign and hosted Trump for an interview last year. Jones also attracted attention in the waning days of the campaign with a rant warning of a \"Jewish mafia\" out to \"scam\" Americans. Trump's ties to fringe media have garnered more scrutiny in recent days with his appointment of former Breitbart president Steve Bannon, whose own site published a variety of inflammatory content , to a senior White House role. Erica Lafferty, daughter of Sandy Hook Elementary School victim Dawn Hochsprung, attends a town hall meeting with Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) in Warren, NH, the first town hall the Senator has held since voting against a bill that would increase background checks for gun buyers. Frank Thorp V / NBC News \"It's unacceptable,\" Lafferty wrote in the same post. \"I'm asking you to denounce it immediately and cut ties with Alex Jones and anyone who subscribes to these dangerous ideas.\" According to Jones, Trump called him after the election and said \"We know what you did early on and throughout this campaign, stand up for what's right, it shows.'\" Trump's transition team did not respond earlier this week to requests to confirm or deny the claim by Jones this week that he called him after his election and also promised to return to show. Trump's team also did not immediately respond to a follow-up email on Wednesday requesting comment on Lafferty's demand. Benjy Sarlin ",

This would bring the transition more in line with Trump's campaign-trail pledge to \"drain the swamp\" of veteran politicians and special interests in Washington. That was the explanation given for the firing of at least one top foreign policy official, Matthew Freedman. A campaign official said Freedman was let go because he works as a lobbyist. But if Pence's directive is fully implemented, it could result in the exit of at least nine current aides, and likely more, according to an organizational chart for the operation obtained by Politico .

Freedman's firing is the latest of a string of shakeups that have plagued Trump's transition process over its first week, beginning with the announcement that Pence would be replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as head of the transition team. Christie was removed, sources told NBC News, because he was seen as insufficiently loyal to Trump during the campaign, and because Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner continues to hold an old grudge over Christie's prosecution of his father when Christie was New Jersey District Attorney. With Christie's demotion came former Rep. Mike Rogers' departure from the team, in what one source described as a \"Stalinesque purge\" of Christie loyalists. Trump spokesman Jason Miller denied Kushner's involvement in staff turnover, while spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway denied any reports of transition turmoil. But speaking on CNN following his departure, Rogers identified the challenge for the transition team as \"some confusion going on, uh, about a chain of command coming out of\" Trump's New York headquarters.

The former has been named chief strategist and the latter chief of staff. \"It doesn't work in a company. Could you imagine having two or three CEOs trying to make a decision? Just the chaos that it creates in an administration just won't work,\" he said. \"You've gotta keep this machine going, and it takes somebody very decisive who can make that decision. The more complicated you make that, I think the worse it gets. Competing and conflicting factions plagued Trump's campaign, causing near-constant turmoil that often overshadowed his message on the trail. That seems to have carried over to the transition process, as campaign loyalists jockey behind the scenes for plum spots in his administration. Perhaps the most prominent clash is the battle for secretary of state, which former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has made clear he'd prefer. But because of his work consulting for foreign governments, Giuliani faces questions over clear conflicts of interest. Already some Republicans have indicated he'd have trouble getting confirmed \u2014 including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who said he'd oppose the former mayor as well as the other reported contender, former UN ambassador John Bolton. Play ",

    "text": "Mitch McConnell Refuses Comment on Bannon, Despite Record of Opining on Obama Personnel Picks By ALI ROGIN Nov 16, 2016, 7:45 PM ET 0 Shares Star Michael Reynolds/EPA Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell speaks at a news conference following a Republican policy luncheon in Washington, Nov. 16, 2016. 0 Shares Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declined Wednesday to comment on president-elect Donald Trump \u2019s appointment of Steve Bannon to be his senior adviser. \"I'm not going to comment on White House personnel selections,\" McConnell said. Bannon is the former publisher of the conservative website Breitbart, which he once described as \"the platform for the alt-right,\" a catchall for a brand of conservatism that contains racist and anti-Semitic elements. Despite his silence on Bannon, over the past eight years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, McConnell has proven more willing to share his opinions on the administration's staffing choices publicly. When then-President-elect Obama announced his intention to nominate Eric Holder as attorney general, McConnell criticized the choice, saying on January 9, 2009, \"I think the attorney general nominee, Mr. Holder, has got serious questions to respond to.\" When longtime Democratic strategist John Podesta joined the administration in December 2013, McConnell suggested he wouldn't make much of a difference in what he considered a White House struggling with policy. McConnell told reporters of Obamacare, \"The issue [Obama] wanted to be most associated with is a failure, and no amount of shifting the chairs around on the Titanic is going to solve that problem.\" In May of that same year, McConnell delivered a 1,000-word-plus floor speech on the dangers of confirming Obama's nominee to be labor secretary, Tom Perez, saying he was \"a committed ideologue who appears willing, quite frankly, to say or do anything to achieve his ideological ends.\" Trump, McConnell and Ryan: Unlikely New Power Trio for DC To be sure, some of McConnell\u2019s previous comments were about cabinet appointments, on which senators also vote. Plus, McConnell has never commented on an Obama \"chief strategist,\" which is what Bannon is to Trump. He did praise the selection of RNC chairman Reince Priebus to be Trump's chief of staff. \"The only personnel decisions he typically comments on are chiefs of staff,\" McConnell spokesman Don Stewart told ABC. This afternoon I met with President-elect @realDonaldTrump . We are eager to get to work on behalf of this great country. pic.twitter.com/99ccQEVc7g \u2014 Leader McConnell (@SenateMajLdr) November 10, 2016 But McConnell's unwillingness to comment on Bannon, citing his aversion to commenting on \"personnel selections,\" is notable not just because he has frequently commented on similar Obama staff picks, but also because Bannon, who is expected to play a key role in the Trump White House, has garnered so much opposition among congressional Democrats - and little active support among Republicans. Rep. David Cicilline garnered 168 other signatures Wednesday on a petition to Trump asking him to rescind Bannon\u2019s appointment, writing, \u201cwhether intentional or not, the appointment of Mr. Bannon sends a disturbing message about what kind of president Donald Trump wants to be.\u201d While McConnell hasn\u2019t held back previously on key Obama appointments, the Kentucky Republican\u2019s opinions on Obama staff and cabinet picks were not always negative. He said having John Kerry as secretary of state would be \u201ca popular choice with the Senate\u201d in December 2012. When former commerce secretary William Daley was pegged as the president\u2019s new chief of staff in January 2011, McConnell praised the choice. \u201cI frankly think it's kind of a hopeful sign,\u201d he said. \"This is a guy who's actually been out in the private sector, been a part of business ... My first reaction is, it sounds like a good idea.\" He also sounded an optimistic note months before Obama\u2019s first inauguration, praising incoming chief of staff Rahm Emanuel for meeting with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill . \"I think the new administration is off to a good start,\u201d McConnell said at the time. 0 Shares ",

Email Federal investigators are blaming air traffic controllers for two midair collisions last year that killed seven people, but there are technologies that can prevent the collisions that happen in the blink of an eye.\u00a0 \u00a0A National Transportation Safety Board animation simulates how fast a deadly midair collision \u00a0can happen, including the limits of \u201csee and avoid\u201d -- a method of flying that teaches pilots how to avoid midair collisions.\u00a0 By the time the pilot of this Cessna was able to spot an F-16 fighter coming in just left of center -- and he had only seconds to respond. The planes collided over South Carolina in 2015. The two onboard the Cessena died. CBS News Weeks later, another midair collision in San Diego killed five.\u00a0 In both cases the NTSB believes available collision avoidance systems could have prevented the crashes, by giving warnings. These systems are not required in general aviation aircraft, but similar systems are required in commercial airliners. \u201cImagine this traffic: A 777 coming at you at 700 mph. I don\u2019t think human eyes can see that fast or process that reaction in the pilots mind fast enough,\u201d says Rusty Aimer, a retired airline captain. ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Republican president-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon stand on stage during the election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) Words of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist \u2014\u00a0\u201cturn on the hate\u201d \u2014\u00a0 trended\u00a0on Twitter Monday, offering something of a Rorschach test for the vitriol increasingly spewed in America\u2019s political landscape. Trump\u2019s strategist, Stephen Bannon, typed the phrase in a 2014 email discussing Republican leadership, as reported in the Daily Beast . At the time he ran Breitbart News, a website popular among\u00a0white nationalists. \u201cLet the grassroots turn on the hate,\u201d Bannon wrote, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty.\u201d Bannon\u2019s call for hatred resurfaced Monday in a the headline of a New York Times editorial that described the adviser\u2019s appointment as a sign that a \u201ctoxic ideology\u201d had found its way into the White House. By the time the phrase crested on Twitter, there seemed to be some confusion over why it was trending and its source. Wow 'Turn On The Hate' is trending...from a group that preaches love and tolerance... \u2014 Caitlin Tierney (@KatieTierneyH) November 15, 2016 Its the title of a news article --> Steve \u2018Turn on the Hate\u2019 Bannon, in the White House https://t.co/jH50DSv7mc https://t.co/JDCY4IGPqT \u2014 Unimpressed (@brownricediva) November 15, 2016 Trump\u2019s supporters accused his detractors of \u201cturning on the hate\u201d amid days-long protests, some of which involved violence. Those detractors said the hatred lies\u00a0with supporters of Trump, who in Bannon appointed a man who once called progressive women \u201ca bunch of dykes,\u201d as the Times noted . Liberals love to turn on the hate when things don't go their way. #RepublicansUnitedForPeaceAndLove \u2014 SaLtY DoGz (@SaLtYdOgZ) November 15, 2016 \"Turn on the hate\" would've never happened, if Trump wasn't a hater! \u2014 Ivy Bliss (@MsiBliss) November 15, 2016 On Tuesday, NPR host Steve Inskeep asked a Breitbart editor to explain\u00a0Bannon's incendiary past. The editor, Joel Pollak, responded by calling NPR's programming \" racist .\" While both sides\u00a0continue to volley accusations, experts who study hatred and public discourse say that Bannon\u2019s appointment stands to only worsen Americans\u2019 blame game until real listening can occur. Gordana Rabrenovic, a sociologist, serves as a director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict at Northeastern University. She co-authored the book, Why We Hate, and said the violent protests and racially charged hate crimes unfolding since Trump\u2019s election provide an all-too-easy, if unfruitful, answer to Americans\u2019 frustrations. \u201cHate and intimidation is meant to silence people, which can push people away from this public discourse about how we\u2019re going to solve our really challenging questions we save as a nation and world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t face them by blaming particular groups of people. Although that\u2019s the easiest way: You don\u2019t have to put forth a particular solution as long as you blame people.\u201d And the high-level White House appointment of a figure like Bannon can only hamper public discourse, said Timothy Shaffer, a researcher with the National Institute for Civil Discourse. The fringe ideas that Bannon peddled at Breitbart don\u2019t represent most Trump supporters, Shaffer noted, and many didn\u2019t know who he was until this week. But that hasn\u2019t stopped accusations of white nationalism from being hurled at Trump\u2019s supporters, he said \u2014 a guilt by association that has to stop. \u201cThis conflation becomes a real obstacle for public dialogue and discussion,\u201d said Shaffer, who teaches communications studies at Kansas State University. Equally important, he added, is for Republicans not on board with Bannon to say so. \u201cThe people I grew up with, in my hometown in Ohio, who voted for Trump for reasons not aligned with Bannon\u2019s rhetoric, those Republicans need to be able to step up and say something,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve exercised your right to vote. But these seemingly intensified elements need to be stood up to.\u201d ",

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Democrats stunned by Election Day losses began the process on Wednesday of trying to reconcile their competing factions, framing the contours of a contentious debate within the party. In the Senate, they elected a new slate of leaders, led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York , that in many ways reflected the divide. That group included Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the best-known figures in the progressive wing, and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist up for re-election in 2018. \u201cThis team is ideologically and geographically diverse, it mixes the wisdom of experience with the vigor of youth, at least in Senate years,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement. \u201cBut from the top to bottom, each of these senators has devoted their lives to fighting for the middle class and those struggling to get there.\u201d Mr. Schumer\u2019s immediate challenge will be to meet the often competing imperatives of those senators, part of Democrats\u2019 larger struggle over whether to try to tailor an appeal to the working-class white voters who left them and led to the election of Donald J. Trump, or to attempt to increase the so-called Obama coalition anchored by minority and younger voters. Mr. Sanders will serve as the conference\u2019s outreach chairman and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. Video Who Is Chuck Schumer? Senator Chuck Schumer, who will take over as the leader of the Senate Democrats after the retirement of Harry Reid, is known as a hard-charging Brooklynite.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cI am going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking working class and not billionaires who are doing phenomenally well,\u201d he told reporters. Democrats also re-elected Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois as minority whip, with Senator Patty Murray of Washington serving in the No. 3 spot as assistant Democratic leader.

Marco Rubio meets with Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas Cuban-American leaders and human rights activists within the island nation are hoping that the incoming Trump administration will scale back President Obama\u2019s efforts to restore relations between the two countries, measures they say emboldened the communist regime and brought the U.S. little in return. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that a top priority for him next year will be to roll back sweeping changes President Obama implemented that significantly eased trade and travel restrictions. Rubio, like many Cuban-Americans who have opposed the normalization of relations, said Obama\u2019s overtures to the Cuban government have not yielded the hoped-for reforms. \u201cBy any objective measure, President Obama\u2019s unilateral policy changes have failed, and they are not in the best interest of the American people or the people of Cuba,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cRolling back President Obama's one-sided concessions to the Castro regime, a key campaign promise shared with President-elect Trump, will be a top priority for me next year.\u201d Rubio met on Tuesday with Guillermo Farinas, one of Cuba\u2019s most prominent human rights activists, during the dissident\u2019s visit to Washington D.C. Farinas, who has been jailed numerous times by Cuban authorities, has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration\u2019s surprise decision two years ago to normalize relations with the Cuban government after more than a half-century of hostilities between the two nations. Farinas and other dissidents, as well as some international human rights organizations, say the Cuban government continues to oppress its critics. Farinas went on a month-long hunger strike earlier this year after he was detained and beaten by Cuban authorities when he asked about a fellow dissident who had been arrested. Farinas, who was in New York Wednesday to meet with Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told FoxNews.com Obama\u2019s U.S.-Cuba policy betrayed the cause of human rights. \u201cI have faith that President Trump will be better for the people of Cuba and press the cause of freedom and democracy,\u201d Farinas said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say no one can possibly be worse than Barack Obama has been for our cause.\u201d During the GOP primary, Trump signaled support for thawed relations, provided the Cuban government reformed its approach to human rights. After he won the nomination, Trump addressed the issue again in Miami, assailing Obama\u2019s approach to Cuba. \u201cAll of the concessions Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,\u201d he said, adding that he intended to \u201cunless the Castro regime meets our demands.\u201d Top officials of the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), one of the oldest and most influential anti-Castro organizations, say they are lobbying members of Trump\u2019s transition team for a meeting with the president-elect. \u201cWe want Donald Trump to understand the reality of the situation faced by Cubans in Cuba,\u201d CANF co-founder Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Hernandez, a Bay of Pigs veteran, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe want a U.S.-Cuba policy that will bring democratic results.\u201d Other Cuban-American groups pressed Trump before he sealed the nomination. Brigade 2506, Miami-based veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion, endorsed Trump for president, the first endorsement in the organization's 55-year history. \u201cFor Donald Trump, it was a great honor to be recognized by the brigade,\u201d said Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cHe was deeply moved by it. This is an important issue to him, he has said you can\u2019t negotiate with human rights.\u201d Rubio is not the only lawmaker waiting to see what Trump will do regarding Cuba. Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton and also sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, told FoxNews.com that he does not know quite what to expect from a Trump administration. \u201cIt depends on which Donald Trump shows up,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cThe Donald Trump who said earlier in his campaign that he thinks it was good to engage Cuba, or the Donald Trump toward the end of the campaign who said he\u2019d consider rolling back much of what Obama did unless there\u2019s advantage for the Cuban people.\u201d Elizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Ahmad Khan Rahimi, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, has been indicted on eight federal counts. He is accused of bombings and other crimes in New York and New Jersey in September. AP A New Jersey man, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, has been indicted on eight federal criminal charges related to bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey earlier this year. According to federal prosecutors, the 28-year-old Afghan-born U.S. citizen was inspired by international terrorists , including al-Qaida. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, \"Prosecutors say he detonated a bomb in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in September that injured 30 people. He is also charged with planting a second bomb in Manhattan that did not explode, and a pipe bomb that did explode along the course of a Marine Corps charity race at the Jersey Shore but did not injure anyone. \"Rahimi was arrested days later in Linden, N.J., after a police shootout. He remained in New Jersey recovering from gunshot wounds until last week, when he made his first appearance in federal court in New York.\" If convicted of all federal counts, Rahimi faces a mandatory life sentence in prison. Joel notes that Rahimi is expected to plead not guilty. The charges against Rahimi include the use and the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, the interstate transportation and receipt of explosives, and the bombing of a place of public use. Article continues after sponsorship According to the Associated Press , Rahimi also is facing 30 counts in New Jersey state court in connection with the Sept. 19 shootout, including attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. Those charges could result in another life sentence if he is convicted. Rahimi's arraignment on those counts was held via video conference between a state courthouse and his Newark hospital bed in October . In his court appearance last Thursday in Manhattan, Rahimi's lawyer, David E. Patton, a federal public defender, questioned whether the defendant can receive proper medical care in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. ",

You do not deserve a place in our country.\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story So she and her fianc\u00e9 looked at their guest list and decided to hold their wedding in Italy, a distance too far for the relatives to travel. \u201cI just don\u2019t want them around me on the most important day of my life,\u201d she said. Some relationships remain intact, of course. Kate Kingery, a Republican in Denver who sells sporting goods, has kept good relations with her Democratic friends, despite their despondence over the election. One is coming to spend a few days in the mountains with her this week. Ms. Kingery, who grew up on a farm in rural Minnesota, said she sympathized with her Democratic friends\u2019 worries.

She would not say whom she had voted for. She added: \u201cI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that bad. I don\u2019t think they are going to change gay rights, women\u2019s rights or other people\u2019s rights.\u201d Conversations on those and other delicate issues can be both important and painful, but the reality of American life is that they are happening ever more rarely. Over the past several decades, the United States has become increasingly segregated by class , with college-educated people marrying, living and socializing apart from less-educated Americans. The result has been that Americans have lost touch with one another, sociologists say, and helps explain why each side is so baffled by the other. \u201cIf you went to Thanksgiving dinner 50 years ago, you\u2019d be very likely to have dinner with people from a different walk of life,\u201d said Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard and the author of \u201c Our Kids ,\u201d an investigation of class divisions in America. \u201cToday, there are far fewer people who are different from us around that table.\u201d For upper-middle-class families like his own, \u201cevery single person will have a college degree or currently be in college,\u201d he said. \u201cThat class homogeneity was not true of my family a generation ago.\u201d As the cultural divide becomes deeper, fewer Americans cross it. Misty Bastian, 61, an anthropologist at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., is originally from rural Tennessee. Since serving in the Air Force in the 1970s, she has lived all over the world and earned her Ph.D., two milestones that have set her apart from most of her extended family. She said that she had sensed a \u201cparting of the political ways\u201d from her family for a long time, but that her support for Hillary Clinton seemed to be \u201cthe last nail in the coffin.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other day, a cousin who had \u201cTrump proclivities\u201d put a post on Facebook that she described as \u201call about Trump triumphalism.\u201d She felt that the post was directed at her and that its message was: \u201cYou\u2019re a liberal elitist and I don\u2019t have to pretend now that I have to listen to you.\u201d Photo Nancy Sundin and Caiden, her son, in their home in Spokane, Wash.

For someone whose poll numbers hit rock bottom earlier this year, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has had a pretty good run. He just signed off on a tentative contract with Chicago Public Schools teachers, avoiding what would have been a disruptive and politically dicey strike. He introduced a budget that sidestepped... (Editorial Board) Emanuel's budget includes a new 7-cent fee for each store-provided disposable bag, designed to raise about $13 million next year. It replaces a city ban on plastic bags that was deemed largely ineffective. People can avoid paying that tax by bringing reusable bags to the store. The mayor also plans to add 685 new parking meters, with 460 in the Loop and surrounding business district and 225 in neighborhoods. The $5.4 million raised by the new meters would partly offset the $12 million the city estimates it will pay to Chicago Parking Meters LLC for meters that are out of service. Parking rates at O'Hare International and Midway airports would rise, with the daily fee going up by as much as $12.25 under a complex system that varies by the type of lot used. The proceeds will be plowed back into city airport improvements and operations. Other fee increases include so-called surge pricing to $4 from $2 at 820 parking meters near Wrigley Field starting two hours before a game or event. Plans to do the same at 670 parking meters near Soldier Field were put on hold so 3rd Ward Ald. Pat Dowell can have further talks with local businesses. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel presents his 2017 budget to the City Council on\u00a0Oct. 11, 2016, at City Hall. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Drivers also would pay to use commercial loading zones with hourly parking rates set at $14 downtown and in two nearby wards. Once fully in place, the administration expects to collect $13 million to $18 million a year. For their money, Chicagoans stand to see 545 new cops added to the Chicago Police Department's ranks next year and $36 million over three years spent on expanding teenage mentoring programs. Five-year tally The series of tax and fee hikes pushed by Emanuel and approved by aldermen adds up to about $1,692 a year once they take full effect. Here's a breakdown: *About $994 in property tax hikes for City Hall and CPS. That's based on a $250,000 home. *$50.40 for the 911 phone tax passed in 2014. That's based on a total of three phone lines, cell or land. *$355 from water and sewer fees that were doubled in 2011. *$134 from the water and sewer tax passed in September. That's for metered service. People without meters can expect to pay $229. *$25 from a 2011 city vehicle sticker hike. The increase was $10 per car and $15 for SUVs. *$19.40 from a cable tax hike approved in 2014. That's based on an $80 monthly bill. *$114 a year for garbage pickup approved in 2015. That's based on $9.50 per unit a month for a single-family home. Much of the money is going to the underfunded government worker pension systems, which are $18.6 billion short. The 911 tax is going to the laborers' retirement fund at about $40 million a year. The city property tax hikes are being poured into the police and firefighters' funds at $543 million a year. Another $250 million or so a year is going to the CPS retirement fund. The new water and sewer tax will result in an additional $239 million a year for the municipal workers' pension fund. All the major tax, fee and fine increases enacted or set in motion by the city and CPS during the past five years approach $1.9 billion. That doesn't include new sales and beverage taxes approved by the County Board under board President Toni Preckwinkle, which are slated to eventually raise another $698 million. Cost containment During Emanuel's tenure, the city budget has increased from about $6.2 billion to about $8.2 billion. Part of that 34 percent increase is due to the city continuing to pay for programs that the federal government stopped funding and more money being spent on water and sewer construction projects. Day-to-day spending for city operations has risen to roughly $3.7 billion from about $3.3 billion, around a 14 percent increase. Much of the increase is covering city worker raises. The mayor has cut the city workforce by about 5 percent. To be sure, Emanuel faced significant financial hurdles when he took office in the aftermath of the Great Recession. To keep the city afloat and avoid tough decisions, former Mayor Richard M. Daley was using one-time revenue, like the $1.15 billion payment to the city for leasing out its parking meters, and relying on costly, frowned-upon borrowing practices. The pension funds were losing money and headed toward insolvency. The bulk of the tax increases enacted under Emanuel are being used to try to fix the pension funds, with much of the rest going to shore up a city water and sewer system that was deteriorating. The mayor also is phasing out costly borrowing practices \u2014 though he's not all the way there yet \u2014 and has nearly eliminated the use of one-time revenue to keep the city afloat. Emanuel also in the final stages of phasing out health care insurance subsidies for most retired city workers to save about $90 million a year, has moved the city to a more efficient grid-based garbage system that his administration says has freed up about $30 million for other city services, and has eliminated or started to phase out special taxing districts that drain city property taxes from day-to-day operations. Chicago Tribune's Bill Ruthhart contributed. ",

    "text": "Trump pushes back against reports of transition turmoil, but there's little indication of progress Kellyanne Conway Kevin Hagen / Getty Images Kellyanne Conway, an advisor to President-elect Donald Trump, denied reports Wednesday that his administration's transition team was in turmoil. Kellyanne Conway, an advisor to President-elect Donald Trump, denied reports Wednesday that his administration's transition team was in turmoil. (Kevin Hagen / Getty Images) Noah Bierman and Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump and his top aides pushed back aggressively Wednesday at accounts of a rocky transition, with Trump attacking the New York Times and his staff making efforts to assure the public that accounts of internal turmoil had been greatly exaggerated. Despite the focus on public relations, there was little indication the team had progressed toward assembling an administration, and questions remained unanswered about the level of influence that Trump\u2019s family would exert in the new White House . Rooms set aside for Trump staffers at the Pentagon, for example, remained vacant Wednesday, an indication that Trump\u2019s team had yet to begin the complicated process of getting up to speed on the details of taking over the military and other sectors of government. The State Department had also heard nothing from Trump\u2019s emissaries, even as Trump\u2019s staff released an extensive roster of foreign leaders who had spoken with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence . Democrats , still absorbing last week\u2019s electoral rebuke, took further steps toward defining how they would operate as an opposition party, voting in a leadership team in the Senate with a few new names, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , aimed at broadening their appeal to white working-class voters who defected the party for Trump. But they were also still reeling from internal party divides; across the Capitol,\u00a0House Democrats postponed their leadership elections until after Thanksgiving. A stream of visitors, including New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, Silicon\u00a0Valley financier Peter Thiel, Trump\u2019s relatives, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u00a0and a few members of Congress streamed in and out of Trump Tower in New York, giving little indication of whether they were coming to give advice, apply for administration roles or simply offer congratulations. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, whose role in the new administration remains undefined, was one of two top aides to speak with reporters in hopes of changing perceptions. \"You don\u2019t form a federal government overnight, and these are very serious issues, very serious appointments, very serious considerations,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Conway said reports of firings and disorganization were\u00a0false. Yet she offered little clarity about who would be taking roles in the administration, including\u00a0Trump\u2019s son-in-law, 35-year-old real-estate investor Jared Kushner.\u00a0She said she did not know whether Kushner would be getting security clearance to attend top-secret briefings, but left open the possibility when asked whether it would be appropriate. \"It's appropriate for whoever's going to get the presidential daily briefing to have a security clearance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not just appropriate, [but] necessary.\"\u00a0 Armand Emamdjomeh Kushner has drawn attention on many fronts, including multiple reports that he orchestrated the ouster of several transition figures with connections to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who successfully prosecuted Kushner\u2019s father on tax evasion and other charges more than a decade ago. Kushner, who lacks government experience, could also face questions about conflicts of interest because Trump has said that his children will run his business empire while he serves in the White House. Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s campaign communications director, tried to answer another set of criticisms, promising that Pence, who abruptly took over the transition team leadership from Christie on Friday, had begun \u201cmaking good on President-elect Trump's promise that we're not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts.\u201d \u201cWhen we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps,\u201d Miller said.\u00a0The team did not name any lobbyists who had been dropped from the group. Despite the lack of apparent progress, Trump received a vote of confidence from an unlikely source:\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden , who met with Pence at the\u00a0U.S. Naval Observatory, the vice president\u2019s official residence, where they dined with their wives. \"No administration is ready on Day One. We weren't ready on Day One. I've never met one that's ever been ready on Day One,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut I'm confident on Day One, everything will be in good hands and they'll be able to handle everything.\"\u00a0 Pence will huddle with House Republicans on Thursday and meet with Democratic leaders as well. Trump took out his frustrations over media accounts\u00a0on the New York Times, angrily tweeting Wednesday morning about the paper\u2019s coverage of his transition. \u201cThe failing\u00a0 @nytimes \u00a0story is so totally wrong on transition,\u201d he wrote in one of several tweets criticizing the paper this week. \u201cIt is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.\u201d The paper did not report that Trump had failed to speak with foreign leaders. Rather, it said\u00a0that prominent allies\u00a0were \"scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump\" and had been, at times, \"patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning.\"\u00a0 Even some Republicans conceded they had\u00a0concerns about the transition, however. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking leader of the Senate, said he had\u00a0received no direct information from the transition team about its work, even as the Senate will be in charge of confirming Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, according to the Texas Tribune. \u201cObviously, this is my impression that the Trump team was not completely prepared for the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd after the election, they\u2019ve had to scramble quite a bit.\u201d Democrats, just as surprised by the election result,\u00a0were doing their best to plot their own path. Sen. Charles E. Schumer\u00a0of New York was elected minority leader, replacing retiring Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada. The move, along with the approval of Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Sen.\u00a0 Patty Murray \u00a0of Washington in the spots behind him, was expected. But Schumer broadened the Democratic leadership tent with the intent of improving the party's\u00a0standing with its progressive wing\u00a0and its\u00a0working-class base, two groups whose frustration with the party and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton contributed to Trump's victory. Joining the leadership team were Sanders, who challenged Clinton for the presidential nomination,\u00a0conservative Sen.\u00a0 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia\u00a0and Sen.\u00a0 Tammy Baldwin \u00a0of Wisconsin. Populist Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also kept a top spot in the group that will help steer the party.\u00a0 \"There's a debate going on about whether we should be the party of the diverse\u00a0 Obama \u00a0coalition\u201d \u2014\u00a0referring to the minority voters, women and independents who helped put President Obama in office \u2014 \u201cor the blue-collar American in the heartland,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 \"We need to be the party that speaks to and works on behalf of all Americans and a bigger, bolder, sharper-edged economic message that talks about people in the middle class,\" Schumer said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California will take over as ranking Democrat\u00a0on the Judiciary Committee,\u00a0a key role as Trump\u00a0moves to nominate a justice to fill the\u00a0Supreme Court vacancy left by the February death of Antonin Scalia.\u00a0 Times staff writer\u00a0W.J.

    "text": "With bans of alt-right users, Twitter tests the limits of free speech Twitter logos Twitter has banned the accounts of several alt-right and white nationalist users. Twitter has banned the accounts of several alt-right and white nationalist users. (AFP/Getty Images) David Pierson and Paresh Dave Contact Reporters Twitter Inc. launched 10 years ago innocently enough with co-founder Jack Dorsey tweeting about having lunch and grabbing tea after yoga. Back then, there was no certainty the micro-blogging platform he designed would become anything more than an outlet for\u00a0sharing\u00a0daily minutiae. But with its core principle that little was too trivial,\u00a0or too outrageous,\u00a0to tweet, Twitter grew over the years into a vibrant and at times abrasive hub for news, ideas and opinions \u2014\u00a0a town square for the digital age.\u00a0 Now, in the aftermath of a bitterly divisive presidential campaign that has given license for hate groups and white nationalists to tout their ideas more openly, Twitter appears to be having second thoughts. Long criticized for allowing bullies, terrorists and bigots\u00a0to run rampant to the detriment of its own bottom line, Twitter made a surprising move Tuesday by banning a slew of accounts belonging to white nationalists and leaders of the alt-right movement \u2014 which holds that traditional conservatives don't sufficiently protect the interests of white people.\u00a0 The San Francisco company declined to comment or identify which accounts were banned, but sent The Times a statement reiterating its policies restricting hateful conduct that targets\u00a0people \u201con the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.\u201d Among recently banned Twitter users are Richard Spencer, head of the alt-right think tank National Policy Institute, and other alt-right leaders, including\u00a0Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers, according to news reports. A\u00a0source familiar with the situation who declined to be named commenting on a private matter shared\u00a0with The Times several of the offending tweets, among the least vulgar of which read:\u00a0\"You are a genocidal, sub-human.\u201d\u00a0It continued:\u00a0\u201cand feminism is cancer, you diseased whore.\" Social media apps have\u00a0become a free-speech battleground over the last five years\u00a0with the companies behind them struggling to figure out how to\u00a0rein in the very thing that makes them so appealing \u2014\u00a0the ability to speak freely, and in some cases\u00a0anonymously, to anyone who also has an account, including celebrities, world leaders and complete strangers. The anything-goes approach can benefit the firms. Moderating content takes time and money\u00a0and is seen as a potential risk to user growth. By largely staying out of the fray, companies also minimize the risk of wading into legal battles over libel or defamation. \u00a0 But with a massive backlash over harassment they are starting to walk this back. Policies continue to evolve as critics assail rules as stringent or too soft.\u00a0Mothers decry takedowns of their breast-feeding photos under anti-nudity policies. And U.S. officials complain not enough is being done to rid social media of\u00a0terrorists, who others might describe as religious activists. What\u2019s clear is the apps are powerful and that they retain significant policing control.\u00a0With nearly 1.8 billion users on Facebook and more than 300 million each on Twitter and Snapchat, the services give anyone the chance to instantly spread a message to millions of people without the need for special equipment or relationships. To keep their platforms havens for discussions, the companies maintain broad discretion to kill users\u2019 accounts whenever they choose. For example, Twitter\u2019s contract with users give it the right to \u201csuspend or terminate\u201d an account \u201cat any time for any or no reason.\u201d In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Spencer\u00a0denied he violated\u00a0Twitter\u2019s user agreement and called his ban a crackdown on free speech. \u201cIt's been a five-year run for me on Twitter,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIt's over. It was the main way I spoke out. They need to issue some kind of apology and make it clear they are not going to crack down on viewpoints. Are they going to now ban Donald Trump's account?\u201d Spencer said he did not engage in harassment, which\u00a0he conceded\u00a0alt-right commentator\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulous was guilty of when he was banned from Twitter in July for sending a string of\u00a0tweets attacking \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actress Leslie Jones. As a result, Spencer believes his 1st Amendment rights \u2014 which ensure freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly\u00a0and petition \u2014 are being violated by Twitter. The 1st Amendment prevents the government from enacting laws that violate free speech.It does not apply to companies \u2014 even ones like Twitter that have come to serve as virtual town halls where anything seems to go. Many an employee has been fired for sending an offensive tweet. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any obligation to have anyone use their technology they don\u2019t want,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s\u00a0Intelligence Project. \u201cWe honor the 1st Amendment as an idea. Only the government is allowed to restrict free speech.\u201d Beirich\u2019s group reported the account of Spencer and others for promoting white nationalist ideas and using Twitter to organize events for\u00a0\u201chate groups,\u201d according to\u00a0Keegan Hankes, managing data intelligence analyst at the center. Hankes pointed to Twitter posts like Spencer's from the day of this year's Super Bowl:\u00a0\"The criminally insane Africans from my geographic region shall defeat those from your metropolitan area!\" Free speech advocates said it was wrong for white nationalists to argue their rights had been violated. They say their discriminatory words work to chill the rights of others. \u201cIf your speech is so hostile or threatening or distressing to me that I go silent, then my freedom of expression has been impinged upon,\u201d said Susan Benesch, adjunct associate professor at American University and director of the Dangerous Speech Project. \u201cEven in the U.S., where we have the most speech protective law, some acts of speech are illegal.\u00a0Nobody has suggested that to fulfill freedom of expression every act of speech has to be allowed. It doesn\u2019t mean you can post absolutely anything. Everyone is figuring out how to draw the lines.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Immigrants becoming citizens before Trump takes office , how to avoid fake news on Facebook , teen birth rates are high in small towns , and an unprecedented step in India causes a cash crunch .

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The campaign for North Carolina GOP Gov. Patrick McCrory, whose reelection bid remains too close to call, is seizing on reports of potential voter fraud to raise questions about the integrity of last week's election.\u00a0 McCrory trails by as many as 5,000 votes against Democratic challenger Roy Cooper -- eight days after the polls closed. The fraud concerns emerged in a separate local election in Bladen County, where officials have acknowledged \u201covertly similar\u201d handwriting on several hundred absentee ballots. \u00a0 While a formal complaint was filed by the winner of that local supervisor race, the McCrory campaign alleges some evidence suggests a group associated with the state Democratic Party may have paid people to cast votes for a write-in Democrat in that race and every other Democrat on the ballot, including Cooper. Campaign official Ricky Diaz on Wednesday cited evidence suggesting potentially similar situations in other counties, though he declined to say whether this suggests voter fraud is widespread enough to impact the gubernatorial election. \u201cIt warrants scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fully expect it will be looked at.\u201d\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 McCrory has faced political headwinds since July, when he signed legislation requiring transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings that are associated with their birth gender, not the gender to which they identify. The passage of the so-called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d resulted in a country-wide backlash, including the NBA moving its all-star game in February.\u00a0 The fresh fraud complaints, while focused on Bladen County, could serve to stoke doubts about the ballot-counting statewide.\u00a0 County election officials sent a letter Nov. 2 to state election officials about finding the similarities in several handwritten ballots. The letter raised the possibility the similar handwriting could be the result of people legally assisting voters in filling out ballots. However, there was no accompanying documentation to verify this. The state board of elections confirmed with FoxNews.com that it is investigating the matter and provided a copy of the complaint filed by McCrae Dowless, the winner of the local Bladen County election. His 53-page complaint argued there are at least 250 questionable ballots connected to five people who were ballot \u201cwitnesses\u201d and paid by the Bladen County Improvement Association PAC. The letter from the county election board to the state election board acknowledges handwriting on the questionable ballots and their envelopes is similar to those of two people cited by Dowless, who ran as an unaffiliated candidate. \u201cA massive voting fraud scheme has been uncovered in Bladen County,\u201d the McCrory campaign said in a recent fundraising email. The state Democratic Party told the News & Observer newspaper that McCrory\u2019s campaign is exaggerating the issue. \u201cAs usual, these claims from the McCrory campaign are over the top and completely false,\u201d said Kimberly Reynolds, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe complaint in question does not even deal with a Democrat.\u201d The Cooper campaign told the newspaper the Bladen County case is \u201cisolated\u201d and it fully supports the investigation. \u00a0 ",

(Nov. 15) AP Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called on President-elect Donald Trump to rescind his offer for Stephen Bannon to serve a key role in his administration. \u201cThis country, since its inception, has struggled to overcome discrimination of all forms: racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia. Over the years we have made progress in becoming a less discriminatory and more tolerant society \u2014 and we are not going backward,\u201d Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cThe appointment by President-elect Trump of a racist individual like Mr. Bannon to a position of authority is totally unacceptable.\u201d \u201cIn a democratic society we can disagree all we want over issues, but racism and bigotry cannot be part of any public policy. The appointment of Mr.\u00a0Bannon by Mr. Trump must be rescinded,\u201d the Vermont senator continued. Sanders is not the only one who is critical of Trump\u2019s promotion of Bannon to chief strategist on Monday. Critics say that Breitbart News, the website Bannon\u00a0headed until he left to join Trump\u2019s campaign, has racist and anti-Semitic content. But Trump\u2019s aides have pushed back. Reince Priebus, who Trump named as his chief of staff, said the criticism of Bannon did not reflect the person he knew. \"I find him not to be the\u00a0way that\u2019 he\u2019s being accused, I find him to be the opposite,\u201d Priebus said.

A new study shows you'll live longer, although it matters how you use the social networking site. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more. Buzz60 Tourists take a selfie on the terraces above Machu Picchu, the most visited travel destination in Peru. (Photo: iStockphoto) If it hasn\u2019t happened yet, it likely will at some point in your online life. Fellow retirees and pre-retirees will post pictures of their travels and adventures to exotic places \u2014 the J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n Glacier Lagoon\u00a0in Iceland, Nature\u2019s Valley in South Africa, Machu Picchu\u00a0and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands \u2014 and you, not wanting to miss out on all the fun,\u00a0might want to do the very same and then some. What say experts about keeping up the with Joneses? \u2022You're not immune. \u00a0One in four adults with social media accounts find themselves envious after seeing other people's vacation photos and pictures of expensive purchases posted online, according to a survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of the AICPA. Also, consider that everyone's at risk of falling\u00a0victim to such stories. \u201cUnderneath every financial decision, there is a story we are telling ourselves,\u201d says Sarah Newcomb author of Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead without Leaving Your Values Behind. Don't jump into retirement,' phase' into it with part-time strategy \u201cEach of us has come to believe certain stories based on our upbringing and our experiences with money; stories about who we are and who we are not, stories about what we can and cannot do in the world,\u201d she wrote in Loaded. \u2022 Your wealth could be in danger. The Galapagos Islands tempt many bucket list travelers. \u00a0(Photo: iStockphoto) Others agree. \u201cWe're highly sensitive to relative comparisons, and how that's pretty much doomed to make us unhappy unless we focus our attention elsewhere,\u201d says Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at Morningstar. So what can you do to protect yourself from social comparisons that might cause you to ruin your best-laid retirement plan? \u2022 Remember, nothing is as it seems. What you see on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter and the like may be a fa\u00e7ade. \u201cKeeping up the Joneses, especially for retirees, has long been a part of the competitive drive fueling financial decision making,\u201d says Sean Stein Smith, a member of the AICPA\u2019s National CPA Financial Literacy Commission. \u201cWith the advent and proliferation of social media, it is easier than ever before to convey an image that might be not accurate. Just because it is on social media does not mean it's 100% true.\u201d For your retirement planning, count on living until age 95 Newcomb agrees. \u201cWhen we see a social media thread or post, we are seeing a \u2018story\u2019 that someone else is telling about their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cThat story is the heavily edited\u00a0highlight reel of their lives, and it doesn\u2019t tell the whole tale: We do not see their debt\u00a0or savings, or the sleepless nights. We don\u2019t see the pit in their stomach when they open their credit card bill, but we see the smiling faces when they treat their kids to a beach vacation. We see a photo and tell ourselves the story of their amazing lives, and then we compare it to our own personal story, and we decide that we fall short.\u201d And what you don\u2019t know is the real story. They may have saved up for years to buy that boat, or they may have maxed out their credit cards to take the family on that trip. \u201cWe see \u2018priceless memories\u2019 and suddenly we are willing to throw away our own security in an attempt to get the emotional bliss we think our friends have achieved,\u201d says Newcomb. Ice chunks at Jokulsarlon Glacial Lagoon at sunset on the southern coast of Iceland. \u00a0(Photo: iStockphoto) \u2022 Focus on your own finances. Enjoy the photos of family and friends on social media, but don\u2019t let jealousy and envy get the better of you. Instead, focus on your finances and what you can do or not do with your money. \u201cSocial media is sizzle,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt fades quickly. Focus on the components that really matter to your finances.\u201d \u2022 Reframe the issue. Instead of looking at how peers and others spend money, look at how they save money. \u201cChange your reference points to friends who are responsible savers and modest spenders,\u201d says Jodi DiCenzo, a partner at Behavioral Research Consulting. \u201cThe effects might serve you well.\u201d \u2022 Use social comparisons to enjoy life as well. Richard Salmen, CEO of Northern Financial Advisors, says it\u2019s possible to avoid financial missteps due to social media comparisons. But you\u2019ll need a retirement spending plan to do so. Determine how much money you\u2019ll need for travel and how much you might need for late-in-life health care costs. Once\u00a0you\u2019ve mapped out a spending plan, you can give yourself permission to travel within your budget. Salem also suggests using other people\u2019s posts for inspiration, as a\u00a0way to rule in or out places you\u2019d like to visit, or things you might want to buy or not. In reality, Salem says far too many retirees delay spending money on trips\u00a0only to regret their decisions later in life when they are no longer physically able to travel. Do's and don\u2019ts to live by Do Be happy that your friends are living well. Remember that every photo is cropped, and often there are many outtakes before the best ones are chosen. Remember that their story is different from yours. They have faced different obstacles, and you only see less than\u00a0half of the picture. Don\u2019t Compare your \"blooper reel\" with their \"highlights.\" Minimize your own strengths, loves\u00a0or adventures. Forget that the brag books of social media are often ways to compensate for feelings of emptiness and isolation. Social media activity is linked to depression\u00a0and the like.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a City Council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a City Council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday said he doesn't think Republican President-elect Donald Trump will cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities, the latest salvo in the mayor's post-election defense of immigrants here without permission against possible deportation by the incoming White House . \"I don't believe they'll do it, because that would mean every major city in the United States would be targeted, and that's not what an administration will do,\" Emanuel said after a City Council meeting. \"When you're in the White House, it is incoming,\" said Emanuel, who worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"When they look at all the things they want to get done and all the battles that will be coming \u2014 whether the battles they initiate and the ones that come to them \u2014 they will make a choice that this is not the battle they want to take on because they have bigger fish to fry, mark my words.\" Trump has pledged to deport millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. The Justice Department released a memo in May saying Chicago could stand to lose nearly $29 million in annual justice grants if found to be in violation of federal laws on detaining people to be turned over for possible deportation. On Wednesday, the mayor declined to say what he would do if Trump takes away that money, calling it a hypothetical that wouldn't happen.

Bruce Rauner to do the same for Illinois. The mayor has taken several opportunities since Trump's Nov. 8 election to reiterate his support for Chicago's large immigrant community, and he did so again Wednesday, hanging around in council chambers after his budget passed to make comments about the symbolic resolution. During the 40-minute council debate on the resolution \u2014 a discussion that lasted much longer than the brief consideration of Emanuel's $8.2 billion 2017 budget package \u2014 the mayor choked up as he recalled the display in his childhood home of his grandmother's passport from when she immigrated to America alongside photos of relatives who didn't make it.

Rahm Emanuel is running for re-election as mayor of Chicago and he's doing it nimbly, with stunts and tricks. He's scrambling to outpace his critics on the angry left by cleaving to Latinos and picking a fight with President-elect Donald Trump over \"sanctuary cities.\" And there was that oh-so-syrupy... (John Kass) \"And it was to remind (my brothers and me) why we were here, why we were fortunate, and why we could not waste our time in this great city and this great country,\" he said. \"And that we needed to do something to honor those eyes that looked upon us, to honor my grandmother and my grandfather who came here.\" And the mayor said Chicago is standing up for immigrants to stop hate speech and anti-immigrant positions, such as those espoused by some Trump supporters, from becoming acceptable. \"We are normalizing a language and a view, that's why this resolution is important,\" Emanuel said. \"Yes, to reaffirm to the children and their families and their parents 'You're safe.' But to stand up for a set of values that does not normalize a sense of identification that 'You are that ... (you are) other.'\" In other City Council business Wednesday, aldermen passed an ordinance prohibiting child sex offenders from spending time in parts of city libraries used for programs for teens or children, unless accompanied by their own children. Violators face expulsion from libraries or arrest, and fines between $500 and $1,000. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com Twitter @_johnbyrne Immigrants' rights advocates speak at a news conference to discuss expanding mental health services for those fearful that Donald\u00a0Trump will deport them or their families when he is sworn in as president.

By Paul Farhi November 16 at 4:30 PM Follow @farhip Donald Trump vilified and condemned reporters when he was a candidate. As president-elect for the past week, he seems to have moved on to simply ignoring them. Defying the usual presidential press protocols, Trump has twice in the past week ditched the pool of reporters who follow him in public. The latest incident occurred Tuesday night, when reporters were led to believe by his staff that he had retired for the night \u2014 only to learn that he was at dinner with his family at a restaurant in New York. Trump has not held a news conference since the election and has not designated a surrogate to brief reporters on his transition. This has left journalists in the dark about key appointments and other developments with his new administration. The cold shoulder has renewed a nagging question for reporters: Will President-elect Trump\u2019s behavior be a preview of his approach, or perhaps non-approach, to his relations with the news media when he takes office? [ Donald Trump ditched the media ] Members of the press await the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump for a meeting with President Obama at the White House on Nov. 10. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) The pool consists of a small group of reporters who follow the president and president-elect to all public appearances and act as proxies for hundreds of other reporters. This \u201cprotective pool\u201d \u2014 which is cleared by the Secret Service \u2014 then shares its observations with fellow journalists. The arrangement enables reporters to know the president\u2019s whereabouts at all times and to report anything newsworthy, from the mundane to an attempt on his life. But Trump has blown off the pool as president-elect twice in the past eight days, the first time in Washington last Thursday when he met with President Obama at the White House and later with Republican leaders. That elicited a worried statement Monday from the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association , which represents reporters in negotiations about press access to the president. The organization said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s decision to reject a protective pool. \u201cThis is all about the public having information,\u201d Julie Pace, the Associated Press\u2019s White House reporter, said Wednesday. \u201cIf there were an emergency or a crisis, would people want to know where the president is? I think most people would say yes.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s episode particularly exasperated reporters because Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, had told them around 6:15\u00a0p.m. that Trump had returned to Trump Tower for the night, placing what\u2019s known in pool parlance as a \u201clid\u201d on further activities. Trump\u2019s subsequent appearance for dinner at a midtown Manhattan steakhouse set off a Keystone Kops-style scramble by reporters to get to the scene. One group set off in a cab but wound up at the wrong restaurant, thanks to an errant report by another journalist. Once they arrived at the proper location, the 21 Club, they found it barricaded by police. Several journalists \u2014 those without New York City press passes \u2014 were ordered by police to stand a block away from the restaurant, where their view of the restaurant was blocked by a dumpster. Donald Trump has had an up-and-down relationship with the media for a long time. He spent much of the campaign calling the press \"crooked\" and \"rigged.\" The Fix's Peter Stevenson explains what the president-elect\u2019s relationship with the press might look like going forward. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Hicks said Tuesday night that she was unaware of Trump\u2019s dinner and that she didn\u2019t intend \u201cto leave the press in the dark.\u201d She said in an email Wednesday, \u201cWe are still in the process of formalizing a protective pool structure and look forward to implementing that as soon as possible.\u201d Once that is set up, she told pool reporters Tuesday, journalists will have \u201call of the access that they have ever had under any president.\u201d However, the signs have not been promising. In addition to repeatedly disparaging reporters at his rallies, Trump has shown few signs of transparency. He declined to release his tax returns during the campaign, making him the first major presidential candidate in 40 years to withhold them. He banned about a dozen news organizations, including The Washington Post, from his rallies and events, and threatened to sue others, including the New York Times. At one point, he traveled to Mexico City without a pool in tow. He has also refused to fly on the same plane as his campaign pool. Since Election Day, Trump\u2019s staff has declined to answer even basic questions about how he is building his new administration. The news blackout has led to much speculation. Perhaps responding to the confusion, Trump sent a tweet Tuesday night reading: \u201cVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d Trump is not required to speak to the news media, but he has dispensed with generations-old traditions and formalities that have framed the relationship between the news media and presidential politicians. \u201cHis combative approach to press relations is not helpful,\u201d said Jeffrey McCall , a communications professor at DePauw University who studies the news media. \u201cHe clearly doesn\u2019t respect the media, which he is certainly allowed to do, but at a certain point he has to find a way to work with them. When he decided to run for president, he stepped into a much higher degree of scrutiny than what he had as a reality-TV star and businessman. Now that he is president\u00ad-elect, that press attention necessarily grows.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t owe it so much to the press to be accessible as he owes it to the citizens who are represented by their press surrogates,\u201d McCall added. \u201cHis prospects for a successful presidency hinge in large part on his ability to keep his message in front of the public. Whether he likes it or not, those messages will go through the filter of the press.\u201d Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. Correction: An earlier version of this article said Trump had traveled to Scotland as a candidate without telling the media. It was actually a trip to Mexico City, which he embarked on without formally telling his press pool. lifestyle ",
