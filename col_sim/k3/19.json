    "text": "\u00a0 RAWANDIZ, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0It would be idyllic if it wasn't so dangerous. Fog swirls over the snow-dusted mountain range as the sunlight fades and the late fall cold settles on this rugged portion of a war-torn country reached only by a single, curling road. With the sprawling Iranian countryside as a distant backdrop, a dozen men trek up the steep mountain path, hunched under the weight of rucksacks laden food, electronics and the most coveted Iranian-bound cargo of all: alcohol. \"Other things are okay to smuggle during the day,\" one local operative said. \"But alcohol? Only in the dead of the night.\" Related Image Expand / Contract Hundreds of men, on foot and on horseback, haul the contraband booze into Iran, risking their lives in the process. (FoxNews.com) One smuggler estimates that 15 men die each month at this very peak, felled by gunfire from an Iranian border patrol tower that looms above, landmines left over from the bloody 1980s war between Iran and Iraq or the harsh elements. The men are traversing one of more than 20 bootleg routes that straddle the border, and they make their deadly jaunt at night. On foot or horseback, hundreds of men meet Kurdish suppliers on the road below, picking up liquor that arrives in the beds of pickup trucks, just before the Iranian border stations and in full view of an enormous checkpoint portrait of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Smugglers, mostly poor farmers from both sides of the border, typically make around $60 per trip, which takes about six hours from pick-up to drop-off. Their suppliers make far more for their role in defying Tehran\u2019s hard line on booze. The demand for alcohol inside Iran has risen steadily since it was outlawed following the 1979 Revolution. Consumption is deemed a \"crime against God,\" and is punishable with lashes or even execution for multiple offenses. Most of the alcohol smuggled in is purchased in bulk from Armenia. Absolut vodka, Johnnie Walker scotch and counterfeit Grey Goose are among the popular labels. By the time it makes it through Kurdish territory and into the Islamic Republic, the price has tripled. Related Image Expand / Contract Trucks like this one bring the alcohol to the men who complete the trip on foot. (FoxNews.com) The nuclear inspection deal that lifted sanctions on Iran and pumped billions of dollars into its economy had no effect on the price of illicit liquor, one smuggler told FoxNews.com. \"The rate remains steady,\" he said. \"After all, we all know it is not the people of Iran that are getting that money to spend.\" Smugglers are not the only source of alcohol for Iranians. Illicit breweries and makeshift stills bubble inside Iranian homes, feeding an addiction second only to opiates. In recent years, Iranian authorities have begrudgingly acknowledged the growing problem, and in 2013 opened Iran's first and only detox center in Tehran. Soon, the alcohol destined for Iran may have to be smuggled in to Iraq, as well. Late last month, Iraq\u2019s Parliament approved a bill to ban alcohol. It's not yet clear when the ban might take effect, or if it will even survive a Supreme Court challenge, but many critics see it as an ominous reflection of Iran\u2019s influence on its neighbor. They predict a ban will lead to the same black market that now quenches Iran\u2019s thirst for alcohol. \"For decades, Iran has wanted to control Iraq and this is their opportunity to bring more conservative Islamic values into Iraq and shape it into its own second Shiite Iran,\" said Juliana Tamoorazi, the founder of U.S.-based Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an Assyrian who fled Iran as a refugee after the revolution. \"A bi-product of this legislation is the further marginalization of persecuted minorities, it appears laws like this want to push minorities out of the country.\" Khalid Rumi, a member of Iraqi Parliament and a leader of the nation\u2019s embattled\u00a0Mandaen religious community, said decrees such as the alcohol prohibition \"choke minorities and force them to leave,\" but are an even more sinister threat. \"This isn't just about suppressing minorities, it is about targeting personal freedoms for everybody,\u201d Rumi said. \u201cThe danger isn't only banning alcohol, there is a bigger goal to target more personal freedoms.\u201d Many Iraqis who spoke to FoxNews.com said they won\u2019t part willingly with alcohol or any of the personal freedoms they now enjoy. If a ban is passed, the smuggling route will begin at Iraq\u2019s own border and lead into the war-torn nation. \"To pass this law is one of the most stupid decisions ever made,\" said 29-year-old Baghdad-based financial expert and author Rusly Almaleky.

Buzz60 In this  2005 file photo, then real estate mogul and Reality TV star Donald Trump, left, listens as Michael Sexton introduces him at a news conference in New York where he announced the establishment of Trump University. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP) In what New York's attorney general called\u00a0a \"stunning reversal,\" president-elect Donald\u00a0Trump agreed Friday to\u00a0settle fraud cases involving Trump University for $25 million. The\u00a0cases involved a\u00a0lawsuit by New York state and two class actions suits in California against the university, which promised to reveal Trump's\u00a0real estate investing \"secrets\" to people who enrolled in the courses. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who filed suit against Trump two years ago\u00a0for what he called \"his phony university,\" said the president-elect agreed to settle the lawsuits for $25 million\u00a0and pay\u00a0an additional $1 million\u00a0in penalties to the state of New York for violating state education laws. The deal does not require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. \"Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cThis would have gone on for a long, long time and would have been a very significant distraction,\u201d said Daniel M. Petrocelli, the attorney who represented Trump in the case. Trump lawyer: lawsuits would have been 'significant distraction' to president Trump had\u00a0publicly vowed not to settle the lawsuits and suggested at one point during his presidential campaign that he might reopen the school, which closed in 2010. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency. \u201cI could have settled this case numerous times, but I don\u2019t want to settle cases when we\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,\u201d Trump said at the time. However, an exclusive analysis by USA TODAY of more than 4,000 lawsuits involving Trump and his companies over the years shows that just isn't true. USA TODAY tracked down the records in thousands of Trump's court battles dating back to the 1980s, in courts coast to coast, and found that the business mogul settled lawsuits at least 259 times. Almost 200 of those were cases where he and his companies were defendants, although the terms of the settlement agreements often are kept out of court records and plaintiffs are required to sign agreements pledging not to disclose details. In hundreds more cases, court records indicate legal disputes were resolved outside court with the details shielded from public view. Also, the USA TODAY database of court records shows today's settlement is unique in its size. While there may be larger settlements in Trump's lawsuits that are shielded by non-disclosure agreements or sealed records -- notably his divorce from Ivana Trump, which remains under seal despite attempts by the media to obtain the records during the presidential campaign -- the $25 million payout is by far the largest Trump's empire has paid out to someone. Dive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits Friday's settlement comes only days before trial was set to begin in\u00a0California\u00a0in one of the class action lawsuits. Trump's lawyers had sought a\u00a0delay in the run-up to his\u00a0inauguration, but the\u00a0judge ruled that the trial go ahead as scheduled and that Trump would\u00a0be required to testify,\u00a0although likely by videotape. Last week, at a pretrial hearing in San Diego, Trump's lawyers said they were open to settlement. U.S. District Court Judge\u00a0Gonzalo Curiel, who is hearing the case in California, brought up the possibility in court of another federal judge, Jeffrey Miller, assisting the parties in trying to find a way to settle the case before trial. \"I can tell you right now I'm all ears,\" Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli told Curiel. The New York attorney general's fraud lawsuit described the \"university\"\u00a0as nothing but a scam designed to fleece would-be real estate developers. The scheme, he charged, lured students with\u00a0false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing \"secrets\" from his \"hand-picked\" instructors. \"More than 5,000 people across the country who paid Donald Trump $40 million to teach them his hard-sell tactics got a hard lesson in bait-and-switch,\" Schneiderman said in a statement at the time. \"Mr. Trump used his celebrity status and personally appeared in commercials making false promises to convince people to spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn't afford for lessons they never got.\u201d Schneiderman\u00a0 alleged \u00a0the teachers were not personally selected by Trump, despite claims in the university's\u00a0ads, and that the students\u00a0did not ever meet the real estate mogul. The state earlier\u00a0forced Trump University to quit referring to itself as a\u00a0university because it was not licensed as such in New York. The political impact of the settlement is unclear, as are its legal implications to future Trump lawsuits. \"Settling these cases will surely help the President-elect as a political matter,\" Chris Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah who spent the year studying the Trump University cases. He had opined that a civil court finding that Trump and his companies were financially liable for defrauding thousands of Trump University students could technically open the door to Congress pursuing impeachment proceedings against Trump. \"That being said, the settlement will likely help the country turn the page on the sordid details of President-elect Trump's alleged fraud and avoid the embarrassment of his testimony and potential loss at trial,\" Peterson said. Trump, who dismissed Schneiderman\u00a0as a \"lightweight,\" vigorously denied the fraud charges and claimed 98% of the people who signed up for the\u00a0courses expressed satisfaction with them. In 2013 tweet, Trump ridiculed the move\u00a0by the\u00a0New York attorney\u00a0general,\u00a0saying: \"Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No Case!\" Contributing: John Kelly 11563 CONNECT TWEET 24 LINKEDIN 501 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fDh66n ",

    "text": "Your story Paying for public retirees has never cost L.A. taxpayers more. And that's after pension reform Retirement benefits now eat up 20% of city\u2019s general fund revenue. Touted cost controls won't have real impact for decades. Mayor Eric Garcetti (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Los Angeles officials often boast about how they stemmed the rising cost of employee pensions, an expense that has hobbled cash-strapped cities throughout California. Former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said changes he oversaw in 2011 and 2012, which included lower pensions for new employees and higher retirement contributions from city workers, were \u201cthe most far-reaching effort in the nation.\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti echoed that assertion this year, saying L.A. had \u201cdone the most pension reform in the country of any big city.\u201d This series is a partnership of Yet the numbers tell a story jarringly at odds with the political rhetoric, a Times analysis found. Today, Los Angeles taxpayers are underwriting retirement benefits that are among the nation\u2019s most generous \u2014 at a cost that has never been higher. The city\u2019s general fund payments for pensions and retiree healthcare reached $1.04 billion last year, eating up more than 20% of operating revenue \u2014 compared with less than 5% in 2002. L.A.\u2019s vaunted pension reforms have not cut the city\u2019s pension costs; at best, they have modestly slowed their rate of growth. Since the changes took effect, general fund contributions to the retirement system have grown an average of $66.6 million a year \u2014 roughly twice as fast as all other spending controlled by the mayor and City Council. City budget analysts say the increases will slow over the next five years, to $36.1 million annually. Even so, retirement costs would continue to consume roughly 20% of operating revenue. The effects can be measured in services forgone and civic ambitions deferred. With the money put into its pension funds over the last two years alone \u2014 nearly $2 billion \u2014 the city could have fixed every one of its broken sidewalks, built or leased housing for more than 25,000 homeless people or restored 11 miles of the concrete-clad Los Angeles River to a natural state. The Pension Gap: Read the story L.A.\u2019s pension burden, while severe by national standards, is not unusual for California. Six  of the state\u2019s 10 largest cities \u2014 Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, Sacramento, Oakland and Bakersfield \u2014 devoted more than 15% of their general fund budgets to pensions and retiree healthcare during the 2015 fiscal year, The Times found.  San Jose contributed the greatest  share \u2014 almost 28%. Those cities face a common obstacle: In California, a stream of court rulings over the last half-century have shielded public employees from cuts to their retirement plans, restricting cost-saving measures to new hires. Those reductions take decades to be fully reflected in a  municipality\u2019s bottom line. L.A.\u2019s taxpayers are also paying the price for questionable decisions made years ago. The city\u2019s annual pension bill has effectively been doubled by the need to pay down debt to the retirement funds created by years of benefit enhancements and overly optimistic financial projections. The resulting shortfall is estimated by independent analysts at more than $20 billion. City officials today continue to use the same bullish accounting, raising doubts about elected leaders\u2019 claims to have lightened the pension burden for future taxpayers. Garcetti, who exercises direct influence over the city\u2019s retirement policy through his appointments to the pension funds\u2019 boards of trustees, declined to be interviewed for this story. ADVERTISEMENT His spokeswoman, Connie Llanos, said the mayor had negotiated labor contracts that slowed the increase in workers\u2019 salaries \u2014 a key determinant of pension costs \u2014 and in some cases scaled back future employees\u2019 pensions. \u201cWe\u2019ve held strong on our commitment to get our finances in order and secured strong and fiscally responsible labor deals with our employees that hold the line on raises and secure pension and salary reforms, saving the city billions,\u201d Llanos said in a statement. City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, L.A.\u2019s top budget official, said the city has been hamstrung by legal limits on the reach of reforms and previous public officials\u2019 financial decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s not a management problem. It\u2019s a math problem,\u201d Santana said. \u201cWe\u2019re the case study of having done all the hard things governments have done to manage our pensions. At the same time, we\u2019re still saddled with this huge obligation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a national, systemic issue, and there really isn\u2019t a simple way out.\u201d 8000000000 Sources: City budget officials, LACERS and LAFPP actuarial reports. Times analysis by Peter Jamison Lorena Elebee / @latimesgraphics City contributions to the Los Angeles City Employees Retirement System and Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions fund have steadily increased, and now eat up one out of every five dollars of the city's operating revenue.

I don\u2019t have a pension. I\u2019m going to have to sell this house when I retire.\u201d Eventually, Tortorici said, the man moved to Arizona. A 71-year-old native of the San Fernando Valley, Tortorici said he feels no embarrassment over his pension. \u201cWhat I\u2019m getting, I\u2019m entitled to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city said, \u2018We\u2019re going to take care of you.\u2019 I expect it to do that.\u201d Yet he doubts that L.A. can sustain such largesse for future generations. \u201cIt\u2019s a hole they dug for themselves, years ago, not knowing,\u201d Tortorici said over coffee near his home in Newbury Park. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to do the way we\u2019re doing it now.\u201d No retirement plan better illustrates the lingering consequences of past financial choices than the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions fund. Since the 1960s the fund\u2019s benefits have been amended five times, creating a kind of fossil record of the gradual enlargement of public-safety pensions. The high-water mark came in 2001 with the retirement plan known as Tier 5. Modeled on a deal state legislators approved in 1999 for California Highway Patrol officers, Tier 5 allowed public safety workers to retire at age 50 with up to 90% of their salaries, including cost-of-living increases of up to 3% a year. The fund\u2019s previous plans had capped pensions at 70% of final salary. Tier 5 was opened to existing police and fire employees as well as new hires. As a result, workers with decades of service were allowed to migrate to the new plan en masse, retroactively taking advantage of its generous provisions. American public safety workers have historically enjoyed sturdy retirement benefits in recognition of their willingness to risk life and limb. Even against that backdrop, however, L.A. is an outlier. For the last 15 years, the police and fire fund\u2019s average pension payments have been among the highest of any state or municipal plan in the country, according to an annual survey by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, the Center for State and Local Government Excellence and the National Assn. of State Retirement Administrators.

Graphics reporting by Peter Jamison Lorena Elebee / @latimesgraphics Pension and retiree healthcare payments (including pension obligation bonds) as a percentage of general-fund revenue in California\u2019s largest cities (2014-15): 0 San Diego figures are budgeted rather than actual. Long Beach San Francisco In 2014 \u2014 the survey\u2019s most recent year of complete data \u2014 the fund\u2019s average pension of $62,964 exceeded those for New York City firefighters ($60,136), New York City police officers ($44,133) and Chicago police officers ($49,535), among others. Members of the Los Angeles City Employees Retirement System, which covers most workers outside the police and fire departments, received an average pension of $40,871. (A third L.A. pension fund, for employees of the Department of Water and Power, is funded by water and electricity sales, not tax dollars.) Corina Lee, who sits on the board of the union representing LAPD officers, said the 2001 benefit expansion was needed to stop the departure of officers for agencies, such as the California Highway Patrol, with more attractive pension plans. \u201cWe had to do something to retain our men and women, and to recruit men and women from across the country,\u201d Lee said. Public employee unions and their allies on the political left have come under frequent criticism for their role in governments\u2019 pension problems. But the circumstances of Tier 5\u2019s creation belie a simple narrative of Democrats abetting Big Labor avarice. The campaign for the 2001 ballot measure that established the new pension plan was led by then-Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican and former venture capitalist. In a recent interview, Riordan, now 86, said he based his support on the city pension funds\u2019 reports of a combined $2.2-billion surplus. He said it was a mistake. \u201cBack then, our pension funds were tremendous. We didn\u2019t owe anything. Putting this in seemed like an easy thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWith hindsight, we shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Others also failed to question the assumptions behind Tier 5. City budget analysts projected, incorrectly, that administrative changes to the pension fund written into the initiative would not only offset the cost of richer pensions, but actually save money. The ballot measure passed with 72% of the vote. Three years after police officers and firefighters began enrolling in Tier 5, the city pension funds\u2019 surplus had turned into a $4.3-billion deficit. Within a decade, that deficit had grown to $9.5 billion, as retirement costs continued to climb while the pension funds\u2019 investments lost money. Marianna Black, a retired librarian, collects a $58,935 pension and lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Mid-Wilshire. (Christina House / For The Times) Limits of Reform L.A.\u2019s deficits were part of a nationwide decline in the health of pension plans whose investment holdings were pummeled by the dot-com and housing busts. Some public officials took dramatic action. Rhode Island suspended cost-of-living increases to retirees\u2019 pensions and shifted investment risk to employees through 401(k)-style retirement plans. Marianna Black worried that such sweeping changes might be coming to L.A. Black, 74, retired in 2002 after working as a city librarian for 35 years. She collects a $58,935 pension and lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Mid-Wilshire. \u201cIf they took away my pension I\u2019d be out on the street,\u201d Black said. \u201cI need it for rent, for groceries, for everything.\u201d In California \u2014 at least for now \u2014 she has no cause for concern. Under the so-called California Rule, which originated in a 1955 state Supreme Court ruling striking down efforts to raise city employees\u2019 retirement contributions in Long Beach, governments cannot make changes to a pension plan that diminish its value for active or retired workers. Judges have forbidden even changes that leave untouched the benefits workers have already accrued, ruling that public employees are entitled for their working lives to whatever pension terms were in place on their first day on the job. By contrast, private-sector pension systems may modify their plans moving forward so long as they preserve accrued benefits. For retired government employees \u2014 who in the city of L.A. do not receive Social Security benefits \u2014 that legal precedent is a vital safeguard in an ever-more-expensive state. (Among other things, the California Rule prevents Rhode Island-style suspensions of cost-of-living increases.) Yet it presents a challenge to cities seeking to reduce their pension burdens, limiting cuts to the pension plans of workers hired after changes are adopted. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take about 30 years for that to matter,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Aubry, associate director for state and local research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cThat\u2019s a trickle.\u201d In 2011, Los Angeles modified its pension plans for newly hired police and firefighters, striking a deal with unions that reduced the minimum pension available after 20 years of service and sought to eliminate \u201cpension spiking,\u201d in which employees contrive to earn unusually large salaries during their final year of work to secure a higher pension. But because those already on the job could keep the plans they had, the changes\u2019 impact so far has been slight. Nineteen out of every 20 active and retired employees covered by the police and fire pension system are unaffected by the reforms, according to the system\u2019s most recent valuation report. After several years of negotiation, city officials and labor leaders agreed late last year to a new retirement plan for civilian workers that cut maximum pensions and increased workers\u2019 contribution rates to 7% of their paychecks from 6%, among other changes. City budget officials say it is too early to measure the effects of those changes. The city has achieved greater savings through a deal struck with its workers to contribute part of their pay toward their future healthcare costs. Until 2011, those costs were picked up entirely by taxpayers. Civilian workers agreed to contribute 4% of their paychecks toward retiree healthcare, while police officers and firefighters could either pay 2% or have their retiree health subsidies frozen at the rate offered in 2010. The contributions have saved $380.4 million since they went into effect, city budget officials say, or an average of $76.1 million a year. (The changes were legal because courts have not interpreted the California Rule as protecting active public employees\u2019 retiree health benefits.) ADVERTISEMENT Politicians elsewhere have been less wary of bucking the California Rule, but their example is not encouraging. San Jose city officials in 2012 gave its workers a choice between accepting less generous pension benefits or pitching in more of their own pay. \u201cWe started with the math,\u201d said former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have an impact quickly, you have to do something about current employees.\u201d San Jose\u2019s pension reforms were approved by 69% of voters in a June 2012 ballot measure. Within 18 months, however, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge struck down key provisions of the measure as a violation of workers\u2019 vested pension rights. The San Jose City Council ultimately renegotiated the package of changes so that it did not affect current employees\u2019 pension plans. Critics of the California Rule glimpsed an opening for change in August, when a state appellate court ruled that active public employees\u2019 pensions could be trimmed as long as the cuts were \u201creasonable.\u201d The ruling is on appeal to the state Supreme Court. \u2018Fix the numbers\u2019 Public pension funds, like their private-sector counterparts, live and die by the success of their investment portfolios. In many years, the return on those investments \u2014 typically a mix of securities dominated by stocks\u2014 provides half or more of a retirement system\u2019s revenue. The rest comes in the form of annual contributions from employees and taxpayers. In many cities and states, including L.A., workers\u2019 contributions are a fixed percentage of their paychecks. That means taxpayers are called on to fill the gap when investment income falls short. That call has come more and more frequently amid the economic tumult of the last 15 years.

Jeff Sessions as attorney general and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser are the latest signal that his cabinet could run much like his unconventional campaign. The president-elect is increasingly relying on figures who have demonstrated loyalty, share his contempt for elite opinion, and who carry a history of accusations of racism or bigotry that will make them polarizing figures before they assume their job. The choices also raise questions about how to evaluate Trump's government in the aftermath of his election, which caught officials in both parties by surprise. Sessions was Trump's earliest supporter in the Senate, where his fiery opposition to illegal immigration and skepticism toward legal immigration lined up well with Trump's campaign message. As a former U.S. attorney, state attorney general, and longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has a relevant background for the job and Senate Republicans \u2014 even several who clashed with Trump in the campaign \u2014 rushed to announce their support. Related: What You Need to Know About Trump's Latest Top Picks for Key Jobs Sessions' earlier career, not his work in the Senate, is likely to draw the most scrutiny in his hearings. He was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 by a rare bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee after hearings revealed disturbing allegations about his views on race. An African-American colleague said he had called him \"boy\" and that Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan ''were OK until I found out they smoked pot,\" which Sessions testified was a joke. Another colleague alleged he called a variety of civil rights groups, including the NAACP Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, \"un-American\" and \"communist-inspired\" and said that they were \"trying to force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.\" Sessions denied any racial animus at the time and has denied it since then, but the pick guarantees a contentious hearing and will further entrench fears among Trump critics that he'll ignore some Americans, especially vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities, frightened by his election. Trump's transition team provided statements Friday from Trump supporter Pastor Darrell Scott and from Alabama U.S. Attorney Kenyen Brown, both African-Americans, attesting to Sessions' \"character\" and \"integrity.\" They also noted that Sessions participated in desegregation lawsuits early in his legal career, voted for a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act as senator (which passed unanimously in 2006), and supported President Barack Obama's appointment of Eric Holder as the first African-American attorney general.

As reported by the Two-Way , the men were traveling with diplomatic passports, but didn't have diplomatic immunity.

By Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima November 18 at 9:44 AM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @nakashimae In December, after presidential candidate Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) introduced a \u201csense of the Senate\u201d resolution affirming that the United States must not bar people from the country because of their religion. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \u2014 a member of the Judiciary Committee, along with Leahy \u2014 voted against the resolution and delivered a 30-minute oration urging fellow senators to join him. The resolution, he warned, would make global migration to the United States a \u201chuman right.\u201d It would mean, he said, that the United States \u201ccould not favor for entry the moderate Muslim cleric over the radical Muslim cleric.\u201d Or that a foreign cleric overseas could demand a tourist visa to deliver a sermon denouncing the U.S. Constitution \u201cand claim religious discrimination\u201d if it was not approved. \u201cI think,\u2019\u2019 Sessions said, \u201cit is a dangerous step.\u201d Although the measure passed the committee, it failed in the full Senate. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet President-elect Trump has chosen Sessions, who has served in the Senate for 20 years, to be the next attorney general \u2014 a position that will give him the platform to shape civil rights policy and to defend the constitutionality of any policies that effectively restrict Muslim immigration, legal and civil liberties experts warn. Sessions has also been dogged with accusations of racism, which sank his nomination to become a federal judge after President Ronald Reagan nominated him 30 years ago. At his Senate hearing, Sessions said he was not a racist, but several Justice Department employees testified that he had used racist language. [ Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fan. Here\u2019s how their relationship began. ] Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, lauded Sessions in a statement Friday as a \u201crespected member and former ranking member\u201d of the committee who has worked with Democrats on major legislation. Grassley predicted that the committee will approve his nomination for consideration by the full Senate. \u201cHe knows the Justice Department as a former U.S. attorney, which would serve him very well in this position,\u201d Grassley said. The appointment of Sessions is expected to bring sweeping changes to the way the Justice Department operated under Loretta E. Lynch and her predecessor, Eric H. Holder Jr., who, when he was nominated to be the first black attorney general, pledged to make rebuilding the Civil Rights Division his top priority. Several former Justice officials and Democratic lawmakers predicted that Sessions would reverse the emphasis on civil rights and criminal-justice reform that Holder put in place. The Department of Justice built up an aggressive civil rights division under President Obama, but under President-elect Trump it would likely take a different approach toward police departments alleged to have overused force. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) [ 10 things to know about Sen. Jeff Sessions ] \u201cFrom his time as U.S. attorney through his service on the Judiciary Committee, he has left serious doubts about whether he would faithfully enforce civil rights laws as attorney general,\u201d former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. \u201cThe Civil Rights Division was gutted during the last Republican administration, and the burden of proof is on Senator Sessions to show that he would not follow that same path.\u201d Sessions voted to confirm Holder as attorney general, but he voted against Lynch, citing her statements that President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration passed legal and constitutional muster. Sessions and other Republicans considered those measures to be presidential overreach. \u201cMs. Lynch has said flat-out that she supports those policies and is committed to defending them in court,\u201d Sessions said at the time. \u201cWe do not have to confirm someone to the highest law enforcement position in America if that someone is publicly committed to denigrating Congress.\u201d Obama\u2019s Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act and successfully argued the historic same-sex marriage case last year before the Supreme Court. Sessions has opposed same-sex marriage and has a zero rating from the nation\u2019s largest LGBT advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, expressed dismay about Session\u2019s nomination. It only adds \u201cto a growing list\u201d of nominees \u201cwith troubling pasts, and troubling histories of bigotry and intolerance,\u201d Hooper said. George J. Terwilliger III, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush and has known Sessions for nearly three decades, disputed the characterization. \u201cI can say unequivocally there\u2019s not a racist bone in the guy\u2019s body,\u201d he said. Democratic lawmakers on Friday promised a tough and thorough vetting and confirmation process. \u201cI know Senator Sessions and we work out in the gym, but the fact that he is a senator does not absolve him from answering tough questions in the confirmation process,\u201d said Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, the incoming minority leader. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and I want to hear what he has to say,\u201d Schumer said. A former aide to Sessions said that, as attorney general, he will make national security and fighting terrorism a top priority. \u201cSessions is of the mind that the most essential duty of government is to protect its citizens,\u201d the aide said. Sessions opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba and bringing terrorist detainees to the United States for trial in federal courts. \u201cHe felt it would needlessly eliminate an important tool in fighting terrorism and would needlessly put our citizens at risk,\u201d the aide said. [ New national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] Jefferson Beauregard \u201cJeff\u201d Sessions, 69, who was born in Selma, Ala., began his career as a prosecutor in 1975 in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Alabama. In 1981, President Reagan nominated him to be the U.S. attorney for that district, where he served for 12 years. In 1986, Reagan nominated him to be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. But at his Senate confirmation hearing, Justice Department lawyers who had worked with him testified that he had made racist and other incendiary statements. One of those lawyers, J. Gerald Hebert \u2014 now the director of the voting rights and redistricting program at the Campaign Legal Center \u2014 said that Sessions had called the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired.\u201d Thomas Figures testified that Sessions said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was \u201cokay until I found out they smoked pot.\u201d Sessions later apologized for the comment, saying he was not serious when he said it. Witnesses also testified that after disagreement between a black and a white member of his staff, Sessions admonished the black staffer to be \u201ccareful what he said to white folks,\u201d and once referred to a black lawyer in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office as \u201cboy.\u201d Sessions denied the allegations, but he was not confirmed. Aides to Session said that he was not insensitive to African Americans and pointed out that as a young Republican at Huntingdon College in the 1966, Sessions campaigned against segregationist candidates such as Lurleen Wallace, who was running for governor to sustain the policies of her husband, then-governor George Wallace, a staunch opponent of desegregation. George Wallace was banned by state law from serving consecutive terms. In 1994, Sessions was elected attorney general of Alabama. He was elected to the U.S. Senate two years later. Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse Trump, in February, first met him in 2005 when Trump was criticizing the United Nations\u2019 plan for a $1.2\u00a0billion renovation of its New York City headquarters. Sessions invited him to testify about it before a Senate subcommittee hearing. After the hearing, they were out of touch until last year, when they had a phone call about immigration policy and Trump tried to get Sessions\u2019s endorsement.

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump walks from Trump Tower on Nov. 14 in New York. Carolyn Kaster/AP The possibility that Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could fill a senior position in the White House raises thorny legal questions \u2013 one of which is whether it would run afoul of a federal anti-nepotism statute. Kushner was a close adviser to Trump throughout his campaign, but to officially employ Kushner in the White House would mean navigating the ambiguities surrounding the five-decades-old law. CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration Congress passed the anti-nepotism law in 1967. It's widely perceived that the lawmakers who wrote the statute were motivated in part by President Kennedy's nomination of his brother Robert as attorney general. But the legislation was also directed at much lower-profile nepotism at the time. For example, it was fairly common for congressmen to hire their wives to work in their offices, and many lawmakers wanted to stop that practice. What the anti-nepotism law says The federal anti-nepotism statute provides: \"A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\" \"Public official\" is defined in the law to include the president, and the statutory definition for \"relative\" includes son-in-law. Based on that alone, you might think it's a slam-dunk case to bar Kushner from working for his father-in-law at the White House. Not so fast. What's not settled law is the definition of \"agency.\" The heart of the debate: Does the White House \u2013 or the Executive Office of the President \u2013 count as \"agencies\" under this statute? Article continues after sponsorship How Hillary Clinton's case could help Kushner Perhaps the legal precedent cited most often to make a case in Kushner's favor is from a 1990s lawsuit involving, of all people, Hillary Clinton. When President Bill Clinton appointed his wife to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, a lobbying group filed a lawsuit in the D.C. courts. The central legal question in that case wasn't actually about the anti-nepotism statute \u2013 it was about whether Hillary Clinton's task force had to publicly disclose records. ",

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Nov 18, 2016 7:06 PM EST Trump University agreed to settle civil fraud lawsuits for $25 million, the New York attorney general announced Friday. Calling it a \u201cstunning reversal by Donald Trump,\u201d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement Friday that under the settlement, \u201cevery victim will receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws.\u201d Trump transition to the White House - live blog Schneiderman said until now, that Mr. Trump had \u201cfought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals, and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.\u201d One plaintiff in the California class action lawsuit who will receive compensation has mixed feelings about the settlement.\u00a0 \u201cHe conned and swindled me and now six years later he is willing to settle because he is taking office on January 20th? Don\u2019t get me wrong, this $20,000 loss has been a big hardship on me,\u201d the former Trump University student told CBS News\u2019 Laura Strickler. \u00a0But I don\u2019t want you to use my name because I\u2019m afraid someone will see that I fell for [Trump University] and will think I am stupid.\u201d Patricia Rodriguez, a former Trump University student from Bronx, welcomed the settlement. \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s good, perfect,\u201d she told Strickler. \u201cWe deserve to get something back, some money, because we didn\u2019t get anything out of the classes.\u201d Students from all over the country will be contacted, or they can also on their own contact the New York attorney general\u2019s office for reimbursement. \u00a0His office plans to hire an administrator to be the point of contact and distribute the settlement money, Strickler reports. Trump lawyer Alan Garten released a statement saying the Trump Organization was \u201cpleased\u201d the lawsuits have been resolved. \u201cWhile we have no doubt that Trump University would have prevailed at trial based on the merits of this case, resolution of these matters allows President-Elect Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation,\u201d Garten\u2019s statement said. In California, a federal judge on Friday was to consider arguments on President-elect Trump\u2019s latest request to delay a civil fraud trial involving his now-defunct Trump University until after his inauguration on Jan. 20, but the announced settlement applies to the both the California and New York lawsuits.

By Greg Miller November 18 at 11:59 AM Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the CIA is a Kansas congressman who is widely respected for his intelligence but also seen as a fierce partisan on polarizing issues including the deaths of U.S. personnel in Benghazi, the leaks of Edward Snowden and the email controversy that engulfed Hillary Clinton. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) has used his perch on the House Intelligence Committee to attack major pillars of President Obama\u2019s foreign policy agenda, including the nuclear deal with Iran . Just hours before his name surfaced as Trump\u2019s CIA nominee, Pompeo tweeted that he looked forward to \u201crolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d [ Iran nuclear deal could collapse under Trump ] In closed-door briefings on Capitol Hill, Pompeo has been an intense critic of a covert CIA program to train and arm moderate rebel forces in Syria, according to U.S. officials who said that dismantling the program \u2014 or at least subjecting it to a major re-evaluation \u2014 would likely be at the top of his agenda if he is confirmed. Pompeo, 52, has no meaningful experience in espionage issues beyond his relatively brief stint as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. But he has earned a reputation as a serious student of national security issues who finished first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served as a cavalry officer in the Army and earned a law degree from Harvard. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that Pompeo is not widely known among the CIA rank and file but that his nomination was greeted at least initially as a reassuring development at a spy agency that has been treated largely with disdain by Trump. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has sparred with Pompeo on Benghazi and other issues, gave the selection tempered praise in a statement released Friday. \u201cMike is very bright and hard-working and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policymakers,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWhile we have had our share of strong differences \u2014 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2014 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA Director.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s congressional background raised early comparisons to that of Porter Goss , who was plucked from the House Intelligence Committee by then-President George W. Bush to lead the CIA and was forced to resign two years later after a turbulent tenure during which one of his principal executives was convicted of corruption charges. Pompeo\u2019s ties to the arch-conservative tea party movement and scant background on intelligence issues were also cited as a cause for concern among some CIA veterans. \u201cThe tea party owns the drones now,\u201d one official said, referring to the agency\u2019s involvement in lethal drone strikes against terrorist groups in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. But former senior CIA officials expressed guarded optimism that Pompeo\u2019s ideological bent can be tempered by the analytic approach he has brought to difficult security subjects. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who has been nominated to lead the CIA by Donald Trump, speaks on Capitol Hill in October 2015. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) \u201cI\u2019m heartened by the choice,\u201d said former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who has been a staunch critic of Trump on security matters. \u201cI would recommend that when he goes to Langley he get out of the car by himself and embrace the workforce,\u201d Hayden said, alluding to the rocky tenure of previous directors who arrived with entourages and agendas that put them at odds with the agency\u2019s powerful and entrenched directorate of spies. In some ways, Pompeo is already part of the intelligence inner circle in Washington. He attended a dinner this week with CIA Director John Brennan at the home of former Republican congressman Mike Rogers, who had previously been seen as a leading candidate for the CIA job under Trump. The gathering included cast and producers of the CIA-themed show \u201cHomeland,\u201d according to a person familiar with the event. Brennan has led a major bureaucratic overhaul of the agency over the past year, a reorganization designed to replicate the structure of the agency\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. Pompeo would face decisions on whether to preserve those changes. Pompeo emerged as a surprise pick for Trump. His name had not surfaced in the flurry of postelection rumors that had largely focused on other potential nominees, including Rogers, who was ousted from the Trump transition team this week, and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the current chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who reportedly turned down a chance at the CIA job. Pompeo reportedly has close ties to the Koch family, Kansas billionaires who have devoted a considerable part of their wealth to advancing a deeply conservative agenda and driving Democrats out of office. Articles in Kansas papers indicate that Pompeo built much of his wealth with investment funds from Koch industries and that his campaigns for Congress have been backed by Koch money. In just five years in Congress, he has built a political following by staking extreme positions in polarizing debates. He has called for Snowden to face the death penalty and for Clinton to be barred from receiving classified information. Pompeo was one of the more outspoken Republican members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, saying that the Obama administration was guilty of a scandal \u201cworse than Watergate.\u201d When the committee concluded its final report in July, Pompeo and a fellow member, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), released a 48-page annex charging \u201cfailure at the most senior levels of government\u201d and calling for additional information on what Pompeo said was the administration\u2019s intentional misrepresentation and concealment of facts. During hearings, his questions to administration witnesses were often among the most accusatory. In October 2015, when Clinton testified for the second time, Pompeo grilled her on her relationship with slain U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. He asked a series of rapid-fire questions about why Stevens did not have her personal telephone number, did not know her personal home address and had never \u201cstopped by your house.\u201d Separately, in remarks that drew sharp criticism from U.S. Muslim organizations, Pompeo said that Muslim leaders who fail to denounce acts of terrorism done in the name of Islam were \u201cpotentially complicit\u201d in the attacks. Pompeo led congressional attacks on the nuclear accord Obama reached with Iran last year, accusing the administration of hiding \u201csecret side deals\u201d from the public, allegations rejected by the White House. At the same time, it is not clear whether Pompeo will be in agreement with the most extreme positions taken by his new bosses, Trump and his designated national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Trump has called for the CIA to resume the use of waterboarding and other interrogation measures widely condemned as torture. Trump has derided the quality of the intelligence from the nation\u2019s spy community, publicly belittling a multiagency conclusion that Russia used cyberespionage methods to interfere in the U.S. election. Pompeo is not known to have publicly backed those positions and in some cases has articulated views that would seem at odds with those of the Trump team. In a speech delivered in Kansas last year after returning from a trip to the Middle East, Pompeo cautioned against equating all Muslims with terrorism, saying that a \u201cline needs to be drawn between those who are on the side of extremism and those who are fighting against them.\u201d Karen DeYoung contributed to this report.

    "text": "Trump Turns to His Right Flank to Fill National Security Posts By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS Continue reading the main story Photo Senator Jeff Sessions at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday. President-elect Donald J. Trump has selected Mr. Sessions to be his attorney general. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump moved quickly on Friday to begin filling national security posts at the top echelons of his administration, selecting a group of hawks and campaign loyalists who reflect the hard-line views that defined his run for president. Mr. Trump said he would nominate as attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has been a fierce supporter of a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The president-elect also moved to install Michael T. Flynn , a retired lieutenant general who has said that Islamist militancy poses a global existential threat, as his national security adviser. And as director of the C.I.A., Mr. Trump selected Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who harshly criticized Hillary Clinton during the House investigation of the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. All three are regarded, in some ways, as outliers from conventional Republican thinking, shunned at times for strident statements, controversial positions or highly partisan moves. The flurry of announcements indicated that Mr. Trump was gaining control over a transition operation that had been entangled in infighting during its early stages. The results were the first seeds of an administration-in-waiting that will break starkly with that of President Obama. Continue reading the main story Transition officials said Mr. Trump would meet over the weekend with a broad array of potential cabinet members and other advisers as a signal that he wanted to build a diverse team, without regard to political affiliation or support for his presidential bid. Among them are Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee and one of his party\u2019s harshest critics of the president-elect\u2019s campaign, who is a contender for secretary of state, and Michelle A. Rhee, a Democrat who pursued sweeping reforms during her controversy-filled tenure as the District of Columbia\u2019s chancellor of schools. Photo Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been tapped as the national security adviser for the incoming Trump administration, at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times But there was no evidence in Friday\u2019s selections that Mr. Trump, who has hinted that he might pursue a more centrist agenda once he sits in the Oval Office, is inclined to moderate his approach on key questions of national security and civil rights. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Sessions a \u201cworld-class legal mind,\u201d and added that Mr. Pompeo would be \u201ca brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Of General Flynn, he said: \u201cI am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.\u201d Both Mr. Sessions and General Flynn were early and fervent supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, even as many establishment Republicans were criticizing Mr. Trump for inflammatory statements and dismissing his chances of winning the nomination. Mr. Pompeo initially supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican primary, but switched after it became clear Mr. Trump would be the nominee. Mr. Pompeo is also close to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is heading the transition effort. In 1986, Mr. Sessions \u2014 who, if confirmed, would be charged with safeguarding civil rights in the United States \u2014 was blocked from becoming a federal judge by the Senate\u2019s Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee because of previous racially charged comments and actions. In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired.\u201d An African-American federal prosecutor, Thomas H. Figures, said at the time that Mr. Sessions had referred to him as \u201cboy,\u201d and testified that Mr. Sessions had said the Ku Klux Klan was fine \u201cuntil I found out they smoked pot,\u201d a remark Mr. Sessions later dismissed as a joke. OPEN Graphic Aides to Mr. Trump dismissed the past statements, and described Mr. Sessions as a champion of civil rights, citing as evidence a number of desegregation lawsuits he filed while serving as a United States attorney in Alabama, his votes to extend the Voting Rights Act and to confirm Eric H. Holder Jr. as the first African-American attorney general, and his efforts to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. \u201cSenator Sessions is someone who\u2019s universally respected across party lines in the United States Senate,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, calling him \u201cvery well qualified for this position.\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said on Twitter that Mr. Sessions was \u201cwell liked and well regarded, even by those who don\u2019t always agree with him.\u201d He added, \u201cI look forward to supporting his nomination.\u201d First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

Privacy Policy Other Republican senators and conservative groups likewise rallied behind Mr. Sessions, while Democrats have pledged to keep an open mind on confirming him. But, in a reflection of the tough questions he is likely to face in his confirmation hearing, civil rights groups and their champions in Congress condemned the choice. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic Senate minority leader, \u201cI am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, and want to hear what he has to say.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of General Flynn, which does not require Senate confirmation, was similarly cheered by conservative organizations and met with alarm by Democrats. He has called Islam a political ideology that has \u201cmetastasized\u201d into a \u201cmalignant cancer.\u201d After building a reputation as a respected military officer, he was fired by President Obama after he had served two years as the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency. General Flynn has since been a vociferous critic of a Washington elite he contends has refused to name radical Islam as the enemy, and is therefore doomed to fall short in defeating it. Photo Representative Mike Pompeo was a harsh critic of Hillary Clinton during hearings by the House Benghazi panel. Credit Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press \u201cHis statements about Muslims are profoundly un-American as well as damaging to the fight against terrorism and national security,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cHe has indicated an openness to torture and the destruction of an entire city, both of which are clearly illegal, not to mention immoral and destructive to America\u2019s global leadership.\u201d Mr. Wyden said that the president-elect, who last week chose Stephen K. Bannon, who has promoted hard-right nationalism as the chairman of Breitbart News, appeared to be building \u201ca White House leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his campaign.\u201d Mr. Pompeo, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and Harvard Law School, was elected to Congress in 2010 with substantial financial backing from a political action committee funded by Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan. He has criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s decisions to shut down the C.I.A.\u2019s black-site prisons and to require all interrogators to strictly adhere to anti-torture laws. In 2014, he accused Mr. Obama of refusing \u201cto take the war on radical Islamic terrorism seriously.\u201d After the House Select Committee on Benghazi found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama administration or Mrs. Clinton, who was the secretary of state at the time of the attack, Mr. Pompeo and another Republican member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, said they were convinced there had been a cover-up, and they filed a 48-page addendum that included far harsher criticism of the administration and of Mrs. Clinton. Other Republicans, including the committee\u2019s chairman, declined to add their names to the document. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, called Mr. Pompeo \u201cvery bright and hard-working.\u201d \u201cWhile we have had our share of strong differences \u2014 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2014 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a C.I.A. director,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.

    "text": "Trump University-related lawsuits settled for $25 million Published               November 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday agreed to settle three fraud lawsuits linked to Trump University for $25 million, FoxNews.com confirmed. The settlement ends a dispute that has followed Trump throughout his presidential campaign and raised questions about how he would handle it after being sworn in as president in January. Students at the now-defunct school claimed they were duped into paying thousands of dollars to learn the secret of Trump\u2019s real estate success. Trump's legal team negotiated the settlement with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the law firm that brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of students who attended the for-profit school. \u201cIn 2013, my office sued Donald Trump for swindling thousands of innocent Americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at Trump University,\u201d Schneiderman said in a written statement. \u201cDonald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes.\u201d Schneiderman said the $25 million to be paid by Trump or one of his business entities includes restitution for students and $1 million in penalties to the state. See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 The settlement comes just days before the class action lawsuit in California was to begin. The deal doesn't require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. Trump has strongly denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he wouldn't settle. A federal judge in California had been set Friday to consider arguments on Trump's latest request to delay a trial until after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump's attorneys said in a court filing last week that preparations for the White House were \"critical and all-consuming.\" Six months ago, when they unsuccessfully sought a delay until after Inauguration Day, lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli said the period between the election and swearing-in is extremely hectic for a president-elect but that it was preferable to a trial during the campaign. \"The task is momentous, exceedingly complex, and requires careful coordination involving the respective staffs and teams of both President (Barack) Obama and President-Elect Trump,\" Trump's attorneys wrote. \"In fewer than three months, the President-Elect must be prepared to manage 15 executive departments, more than 100 federal agencies, 2 million civilian employees, and a budget of almost $4 trillion.\" Trump's attorneys also raised the prospect of having the president-elect testify by video recording before the trial begins in the class-action lawsuit on Nov. 28.

By David Nakamura and Elise Viebeck November 18 at 8:20 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @eliseviebeck President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) as CIA director, a pair of hard-line conservatives who offer early signs of the shape of Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Trump also confirmed the news reported a day earlier that he has selected retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as his national security adviser, a position that, unlike the other two, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate. \u201cThe president-elect is a man of action, and we\u2019ve got a great number of men and women with great qualifications who look forward to serving in this administration,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters in New York. \u201cOur agency teams arrived in Washington D.C. this morning, and I am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward.\u201d [ Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fan. Here\u2019s how their relationship began. ] The announcements were greeted with widespread applause from Republicans, but Democrats and civil rights groups denounced Sessions and Flynn for their hard-line views on Muslims and immigrants that have put them in close alignment with Trump. The criticism could portend a messy Senate confirmation process for Sessions, though several of his GOP colleagues, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), lavished praise on him. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet And Senate Democrats will not be able to filibuster Trump\u2019s nominations to executive branch positions, having eliminated that option in 2013 for all nominations except Supreme Court justices. Flynn has spoken out frequently against radical Islam and clashed with the Obama administration while serving as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, from where he was ousted in 2014. Sessions supported Trump\u2019s call last year for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and has called for deporting millions of people who are in the country illegally. In a statement, Trump called Sessions one of his most trusted campaign advisers and cited his \u201cworld-class legal mind.\u201d \u201cJeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him,\u201d Trump said. Trump said he was pleased to have Flynn at his side \u201cas we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.\u201d Late Friday, Robert L. Woodson Sr., who heads the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington and advises House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on poverty issues, said he is under consideration to be secretary of housing and urban development in Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Woodson is scheduled to meet with Trump in Bedminster, N.J. on Saturday. If selected, Woodson, who is black, would add diversity to Trump\u2019s team. Also Friday, Trump spoke by phone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, and the two men \u201cunderlined NATO\u2019s enduring importance,\u201d according to a statement from a NATO spokeswoman. During the campaign, Trump had said he might reconsider the United States\u2019s commitment to the alliance. Stoltenberg invited Trump to Brussels for the NATO Summit next year. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be CIA director, close allies say. Here's what we know about him. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) GOP officials working with the Trump transition operation said that the president-elect plans to meet Friday with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), amid reports he is being considered to be U.S. ambassador to Israel. Also spotted at Trump Tower on Friday was Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), reportedly a candidate for defense secretary. Among those Trump will meet with on Saturday are former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who has been cited as a possible candidate for secretary of state, former D.C. public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts and retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, whose name also has been mentioned as a potential defense secretary nominee. Meantime, the Trump transition named agency landing teams for the departments of Defense, State and Justice, along with the National Security Council, to help smooth the transfer of power in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration Jan. 20. Sessions, 69, was Trump\u2019s first endorser in the Senate and quickly became the then-candidate\u2019s chief resource on policy, but the fourth-term senator has been dogged by accusations of racism throughout his career. In 1986, he was denied a federal judgeship after former colleagues testified before a Senate committee that he joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were \u201cokay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.\u201d \u201cIf you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,\u201d Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said in a statement. \u201cNo senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions.\u201d The NAACP wrote in a Twitter message that Sessions\u2019s nomination is \u201cdeeply troubling, and supports and old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values.\u201d Sean Spicer, a Republican National Committee spokesman who has been assisting the Trump transition operation, said on a conference call with reporters that the nominees\u2019 personal view \u201cisn\u2019t what matters. You are serving the president-elect of the United States and his views . . . Everybody who serves in a Trump administration will serve Donald Trump and Mike Pence. They will implement their vision and their ideas.\u201d South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), appearing at a Federalist Society convention in Washington, did not mention Trump\u2019s nominees in her remarks. But Haley, whose parents immigrated from India, urged the Republican Party to remind the public that it is the party who will offer opportunities \u201cto all citizens, regardless of their race, gender or where they are born and raised.\u201d Sessions served as a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as Alabama\u2019s attorney general. In a statement, he said there was \u201cno greater honor\u201d than to lead the Justice Department. \u201cI enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump\u2019s vision for \u2018one America,\u2019 and his commitment to equal justice under law,\u201d Sessions said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), a key Judiciary Committee member who had been wary of Trump during the campaign, intends to support Sessions\u2019s nomination, his office said. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), also at the Federalist Society convention in Washington, said that Sessions would make an \u201cextraordinary\u201d attorney general. \u201cHe is a committed and deeply principled conservative,\u201d Cruz said. Several Senate Democrats pledged a rigorous confirmation review. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who will become Minority Leader in January, said Sessions\u2019s rhetoric and opposition to a comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 make him \u201cvery concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division.\u201d But some conservatives suggested it would be politically damaging to Democrats if they attempt to block Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cMr. Trump has a plane and double-digit victories where Senate Democrats are up for reelection,\u201d said Leonard A. Leo, executive vice president of The Federalist Society. \u201cObstructing his nominees will be a political loser.\u201d Pompeo, 52, was elected to the House in 2010 as part of the first wave of so-called tea party lawmakers. A U.S. Military Academy and Harvard Law School graduate, he has a varied background. He served as a U.S. Army cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company, serving as president of an oil-field equipment manufacturing firm and \u2014 in a brief, little-known chapter of his early career \u2014 was an attorney with the Washington, D.C. mega-law firm Williams and Connolly. He currently serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and is a close ally of Pence. \u201cHe has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens,\u201d Trump said of Pompeo in a statement. Notably, Pompeo backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Trump in the Republican presidential primary. In May, a Pompeo spokesman gave a somewhat tepid endorsement, saying the congressman would \u201csupport the nominee of the Republican Party because Hillary Clinton cannot be president of the United States.\u201d Pompeo is a vocal critic of President Obama\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran. \u201cI look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d he tweeted Thursday, before his offer to become CIA director was public. The choices of Sessions and Pompeo follow Trump\u2019s decision to offer the position of national security adviser to Flynn, and confirm the president-elect\u2019s desire to assemble his Cabinet by naming national security and law enforcement leaders first. [ Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] At the same time, Trump is soliciting the help of Romney, a mainstream consensus figure who had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s candidacy, in assembling his government. Trump sought a meeting with Romney, who had fiercely criticized him during the campaign, to broker peace \u2014 and Sessions, a vice chairman of Trump\u2019s transition, told reporters that Trump could consider the 2012 GOP presidential nominee for an administration position, perhaps secretary of state. The presence of Flynn and Romney in Trump\u2019s orbit sends mixed signals to already jittery leaders around the globe, as well as officials in Washington\u2019s foreign policy community, about the tone and substance of the Trump administration\u2019s posture to the world. Flynn, who would hold the most powerful national security position, is a retired three-star general and decorated intelligence officer who established a close relationship with Trump while campaigning at his side this year. His behavior and a string of controversial and dark statements about Islam, among other topics, have alarmed many of his former colleagues. Trump\u2019s selection of Flynn comes after the president-elect enraged Democrats and civil rights groups by appointing Stephen K. Bannon, former chairman of Breitbart News, an alt-right news site that has become a forum for the white nationalist movement, as his chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 18, 2016 7:15 PM EST After the water crisis in Flint, Michigan , the governor put together a team to address lead exposure in children. The board\u2019s new plan calls for testing infants and toddlers not just in Flint, but across the entire state. Nikia Wakes\u2019 son, Jaylon, has been having trouble in school lately. In 2015 he tested positive for elevated levels of lead . Now, the seven-year-old is not only struggling with his school work, he\u2019s had anger issues. Wakes blames the water. Nikia wakes and her son, Jaylon, live in Flint, Michigan. Close CBS News \u201cI started noticing behavioral changes,\u201d Wakes says. \u201cLast year, he was suspended from school over 50 times.\u201d Researchers say lead exposure can cause cognitive and behavioral problems. To prevent those sorts of things from happening to other Michigan families, the board established by Gov. Rick Snyder in May made 100 recommendations.

Record 8:17 p.m. EST November 18, 2016 x Share A humpback whale was spotted swimming up the Hudson River near the George Washington Bridge, the farthest north a whale has been seen in the waterway in recent memory, according to a local group that catalogs marine mammals. USA TODAY NETWORK A whale breaches in The Hudson river as seen from Edgewater, NJ on November 18, 2016. (Photo: Marko Georgiev/staff) WOODLAND PARK, N.J. \u2014 A humpback whale was spotted swimming up the Hudson River near the George Washington Bridge on Friday \u2014 the farthest north a whale has been seen in the waterway in recent memory, according to a local group that catalogs marine mammals. The Palisades Interstate Parkway Police tweeted a photo of a whale breaching the surface of the Hudson just south of the on Friday afternoon. Helicopter footage also showed the whale breaching. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s been documented and there\u2019s no one else keeping these kinds of records,\u201d said Paul Sieswerda, founder of Gotham Whale Watch, a group of \"citizen scientists\" who catalog marine mammals in New York. Sieswerda was concerned that the whale could be hit by a ship in the congested Hudson. Evidence points to great white shark nursery off N.J. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the whale is in good shape and is just chasing fish,\u201d he said. The number of whales swimming around New York Harbor and off the Jersey Shore has increased significantly in recent years. Conservationists have credited cleaner waters for the increase. Less sewage, street runoff and industrial discharges affect the bottom of the food chain, allowing plankton to flourish closer to shore. That in turn provides a food source for small bait fish like menhaden. And whales love to eat menhaden. The presence of more whales has drawn thousands onto whale-watching boats hoping to see the mammals gliding through the ocean and perhaps even glimpse a humpback leaping out of the water. It has also prompted authorities to warn boaters, fearing whales are coming too close to shore. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and New York environmental officials issued alerts to boaters to slow down and watch out for whales following three strikes along the Eastern Seaboard in 2013, including one in May in which a cruise ship dragged a 55-foot finback into the Hudson River. 918 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g6Ou42 ",

The settlement likely means that Trump will avoid becoming possibly the first sitting president to testify in open court. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the settlement \"a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\" Lawyers involved in the cases say the settlement applies to all three lawsuits against Trump University including two cases filed in California. The trial for one of the cases had been scheduled to start Nov. 28. The $25 million figure will be split among the students who sued, minus the legal fees. Trump will also pay up to $1 million in penalties to the state of New York, Schneiderman said. Former students of Trump University say the school fraudulently misrepresented what students would be taught and falsely claimed that instructors were handpicked by Trump.

The deal doesn't require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. Trump has strongly denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he wouldn't settle. \"We are pleased to announce the complete resolution of all litigation involving Trump University,\" the Trump organization said in a statement on Friday. \"While we have no doubt that Trump University would have prevailed at trial based on the merits of this case, resolution of these matters allows President-Elect Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation.\" During the campaign, Trump said Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge in the San Diego case, was hostile to him. \"I believe he happens to be Spanish, which is fine. He is Hispanic, which is fine. And we haven't asked for recusal, which we may do,\" Trump said in May . \"But we have a judge who is very hostile. Should've been thrown out. Wasn't thrown out.\" Phil Helsel ",

At a hearing last week, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, expressed interest in moving toward a settlement. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers were seeking to delay the trial in one of the California cases until after his inauguration on Jan. 20, while also requesting that he be allowed to testify on video. \u201cThe time and attention to prepare and testify will take him away from imperative transition work at a critical time,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli wrote in the request to the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, last week, noting the \u201cthousands\u201d of appointments that President-elect Trump needed to make in the weeks ahead. Judge Curiel, of Federal District Court, who is hearing the two California cases, was thrust into the limelight of the campaign in May when Mr. Trump spent several minutes at a rally denouncing the judge\u2019s decisions in the case, calling him a \u201chater\u201d and questioning his impartiality because of his Mexican heritage . \u201cI\u2019m building the wall, I\u2019m building the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in June . \u201cI have a Mexican judge. He\u2019s of Mexican heritage. He should have recused himself, not only for that, for other things.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story After he faced days of criticism for his remarks on the judge, Mr. Trump released a statement saying his words had been \u201cmisconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.\u201d He also asserted that he was justified in questioning the fairness of his trial, given various rulings in the case that went against him. Still, he concluded, \u201cwe will win this case!\u201d Even before he was in the throes of his presidential bid, Mr. Trump began mounting a vigorous public defense of himself and Trump University. A website, 98percentapproval.com , touted high marks it received from students. A New York Times report in March, though, showed how some students recalled being pressured to give positive reviews. Trump University, which operated from 2004 to 2010, included free introductory seminars across the country, focusing largely on real estate investing and on learning Mr. Trump\u2019s secrets. Students could then purchase more expensive packages costing up to $35,000. Documents made public through the litigation revealed that some former Trump University managers had given testimony about its unscrupulous and exploitative business practices. One sales executive testified that the operation was \u201ca facade, a total lie.\u201d Another manager called it a \u201cfraudulent scheme.\u201d Other records showed how Mr. Trump had overstated the depth of his involvement in the programs. Despite claims that Mr. Trump had handpicked instructors, he acknowledged in testimony that he had not. ",

    "text": "Donald Trump National Security Adviser Mike Flynn Has Called Islam 'a Cancer' By MARIAM KHAN Nov 18, 2016, 2:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Michael Flynn: Everything You Need to Know 0 Shares Email The man whom President-elect Donald Trump picked as his national security adviser has said he doesn\u2019t believe that all cultures are \u201cmorally equivalent\u201d and once described Islam as \"a cancer,\" comments that have many in the Muslim community worried about what his new job might mean for them. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn served as an adviser to Trump on national security and foreign policy throughout the presidential campaign . Flynn has said he agreed with Trump's initial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, but told Al Jazeera earlier this year it likely \"wouldn't work,\" and that he supports the vetting of Muslims coming from Syria and places where terrorism is a major threat. He also accompanied Trump to his first top-secret national security briefing in August this year, and he was vetted as a potential running mate before Vice President-elect Mike Pence was eventually announced, two senior level sources with direct knowledge told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cI am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,\u201d Trump said in a statement today. \u201cGeneral Flynn is one of the country\u2019s foremost experts on military and intelligence matters and he will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration.\u201d The position of National Security Adviser does not require U.S. Senate approval. Here are some of his controversial comments: Flynn on \u2018Radical Islam\u2019 Flynn, a registered Democrat who had a decades-long military career, served under the Obama administration until reportedly being forced to retire early as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The early retirement resulted from \"the stand I took on radical Islam,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby reportedly said at the time that the retirement had \u201cbeen planned for some time\u201d and that then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel \u201cappreciates [his] service.\" For Flynn\u2019s part, he told Fox News in April 2015, \u201cI've been at war with Islam, or a component of Islam, for the last decade.\u201d Flynn earlier this year released a book -- \"The Field of Fight: How We Can Win The Global War Against Radical Islam And Its Allies\u201d -- that he co-wrote sharing his views on what he called the \u201cglobal war against radical Islam,\u201d calling for the United States to develop a deeper understanding of radical ideology. Flynn wrote, \u201cwe\u2019re in a world war against a messianic mass movement of evil people, most of them inspired by a totalitarian ideology: Radical Islam.\u201d He also said in the book, \u201cI don\u2019t believe all cultures are morally equivalent, and I think the West, and especially America, is far more civilized, far more ethical and moral, than the system our main enemies want to impose on us.\" \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to stop feeling the slightest bit guilty about calling them by name and identifying them as fanatical killers acting on behalf of a failed civilization.\u201d Brooks Kraft/Getty Images Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn delivers a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention, July 18, 2016, at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Flynn, who\u2019s chairman and CEO of Flynn Intel Group, is also a board member of ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center calls \u201cfar and away the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in America.\u201d The organization bills itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest non-profit, non-partisan, grassroots national security organization\u201d that\u2019s \u201ccommitted to recruiting, training, and mobilizing citizens community by community to help protect and preserve American culture and to keep this nation safe,\u201d according to its website. ACT for America did not respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment \u201cMr. Flynn's past Islamophobic statements, and his association with the nation's most venomous anti-Muslim hate group, should disqualify him from serving in any public office,\u201d Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations , told ABC News before Flynn\u2019s official selection. In this tweet from February, Flynn said the fear of Muslims is a rational one: Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions ... \u201c he tweeted, referring to an anti-Muslim video from a third party. \u201cRadical Islam\u201d is a designation that President Obama has refused to recognize. Throughout his tenure as president, he has sought to make a clear distinction between Islam built on peaceful teachings and the acts of terrorism carried out by extremists who adhere to radical interpretations of the religion. Flynn did not respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment left with Flynn Intel. But he said in a statement this morning via the Trump Transition team that, \"I am deeply humbled and honored to accept the position as National Security Adviser to serve both our country and our nation's next President, Donald J. Trump.\" Muslims \u2018All on Guard\u2019 Speaking this summer at an ACT for America event in Dallas, Flynn likened Islam to \"a cancer,\" according to the Dallas Morning News , adding that documents taken from terrorist groups tell followers to \"get into the bloodstream of the opposition,\" which Flynn said he interprets as attacks on Western nations. Muslim activists are troubled by the prospect of a Trump administration that might include Flynn. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is carefully curating a senior team that seem to have one thing in common: a deep seated animosity against Islam and Muslims. [Lt.] General Flynn is one of them, and has been on the record about his sentiments towards Islam and Muslims repeatedly,\u201d said Rabia Chaudry, a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace and a board member of the new Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council that was launched to combat Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. \u201cPutting this man in charge of domestic security matters has the potential of great damage to American Muslims, who are certain to be at top of his \u2018enemy within\u2019 list, rather than white nationals, which both studies and authorities show are the real greatest domestic threat we face,\u201d she said before Flynn\u2019s official selection. Hazem Bata, secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America, says Muslim leaders across the United States \u201care all on guard.\u201d \u201cOur community is preparing for an America that has parts of government openly hostile to Muslims,\u201d Bata said before Flynn\u2019s official selection. \u201cWe are hoping for the best, but getting ready for the worst.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Ever Javier Palma Romero, 24, a fish processor from coastal El Salvador, with his daughter, Jackeline, 4, faced gang threats in his home town and decided to flee to the United States. (Josh Partlow / The Washington Post) Joshua Partlow, Nick MiroffThe Washington Post Along the route through Mexico, no one was really sure how to say Trump 's name. Smugglers called him \"El Malo\" (the bad one) or \"El Feo\" (the ugly one) and told the migrants they had better hurry north before his wall went up. The U.S. agents who took them into custody said he would be president, and it was a new day at the border. \"They said it to the whole group: We would all be deported because Trump won,\" said Octavio de Leon, 43, a Guatemalan who was detained with his son while crossing into Texas right after the election. President-elect Donald Trump has promised major change to the U.S. immigration system at a time when Central American families are flowing into the United States in growing numbers, many fleeing warlike conditions and poverty back home. U.S. Border Patrol has captured more migrants over the past three months than during the same period in each of the past five years. Trump has pledged to build a towering border wall and deport millions, proposals that have been sketched out so far only in broad terms. In a \"60 Minutes\" interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration in January.\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members,... In a \"60 Minutes\" interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration in January.\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members,... (Amy B. Wang) By winning the election, Trump may have inadvertently made his job even harder. His plans have become a selling point for the smugglers urging people to cross the border before a wall goes up, according to migrants and officials in the United States and Mexico. Others were hoping Clinton would win and offer them some form of blanket amnesty, according to Border Patrol agents. So many families have arrived in recent weeks that U.S. authorities announced last weekend that they are sending 150 agents to shore up this portion of border in the Rio Grande Valley. Here at the border, the obstacles to Trump's plans appear daunting. To hold, quickly process and deport the tens of thousands of arrivals each month, the Trump administration would have to add scores of immigration judges and dramatically expand detention facilities, which have faced legal challenges. A wall could cost billions. Some here welcome a Trump crackdown. Many Border Patrol agents resent what they see as a \"catch-and-release\" approach to the flood of Central Americans. To them, Trump's win has delivered the morale-boosting equivalent of a Red Bull. \"We're going to be able to do our jobs again,\" said Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol agent and a spokesman for their union, which endorsed Trump for president. \"We've turned into a detention agency,\" he said. \"We're not out there enforcing. We're doing jailer work and sometimes babysitting.\" But analysts, lawyers and elected officials on both sides of the border say it is a place that has always defied easy fixes and expensive barriers. --- What is often lost in the debate about border control is the dramatic change in who is trying to migrate. The number of Mexicans caught trying to illegally cross has been dropping - from more than 400,000 in fiscal 2010 to about 177,000 this year. Meanwhile the number of migrants from violence-plagued El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala has nearly quadrupled in the same period, to almost 179,000. Southwest border apprehensions The Washington Post Southwest border apprehensions over the past five years. August, September and October of 2016 have been higher than anytime for those months in the past five years. Southwest border apprehensions over the past five years. August, September and October of 2016 have been higher than anytime for those months in the past five years. (The Washington Post) Many of the Central Americans do not sneak over under the cover of darkness; they are delivered by smugglers to the banks of the Rio Grande and wade across in broad daylight to turn themselves in to Border Patrol. That's because most of the migrants are asking for some type of asylum and, therefore, are entitled to go before an immigration judge to plead their case, rather than being quickly deported. But it often takes months, if not years, for the backlogged courts to determine whether asylum seekers face danger at home and deserve protection. In the meantime, most of the migrants are released from detention after a few days. Often, they do not appear for their court dates. Of the 20,000 families whose legal proceedings ended with deportation orders between July 2014 and August this year, 85 percent did not show up in court, fueling the perception that migrants are gaming the system and intending to remain in the country illegally. Border Patrol union leaders want more agents and immigration judges, plus longer detention periods for asylum seekers awaiting court dates. Sending a stern message will discourage future migrants, said Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent in the Laredo, Tex., sector and a union representative. \"You do have to take some action,\" he said. \"Right now, it's out of control.\" But U.S. courts have already ruled that asylum seekers can't be held simply to deter other migrants from coming. And \"you can't get rid of the due-process proceedings,\" said Lorilei Williams, director of the immigration unit at Staten Island Legal Services, in New York. Asylum applicants are generally entitled to court hearings under the terms of international law.

Granjero, U.S.: A discarded item of clothing left near the banks of the Rio Grande, at one of the places where many Central American families have been crossing into the United States and turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents. (Nick Miroff / The Washington Post) A big increase in judges would take time and money. Rep. Henry Cuellar , D, who represents the Texas border and received budgetary approval for 55 more immigration judges in fiscal 2016, said it was unrealistic to think the courts could quickly accelerate their processing of cases. \"Right now, we're backlogged half a million [cases] with the current judges that we have,\" he said in an interview. \"Practically, you're talking about years and years\" to process those cases. Two years ago, after a flood of families from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala overwhelmed border authorities, the Obama administration launched a public-relations campaign to discourage migrants from making the trip, stepped up deportations of migrants who were denied asylum and pressured Mexico to crack down on its own southern border. Fewer migrants arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2015, but the figures have been climbing this year. Violence and poverty continue to drive people north, along with election-year factors: Some migrants had expected that it might be more difficult to enter the United States if Trump won. Other hoped that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, would win and offer them some form of amnesty, Border Patrol agents said. In October, Border Patrol apprehended 46,195 migrants, nearly 11,000 more than in the same month during the immigration crisis in 2014. In McAllen, at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, which takes in migrants once Border Patrol agents release them for their immigration court appearances, there were days in October when nearly 500 adults and children arrived, forcing authorities to erect tents to house the Central Americans in the parking lot.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic Mr. Trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of Washington\u2019s establishment in both parties, and his choices reflect that. President George W. Bush established a Republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative ideology, including some officials who challenged him. Mr. Trump\u2019s early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is choosing a national security team that shares his views, and of course every president is entitled to do that,\u201d said Kori Schake, who was the deputy director of policy planning in the State Department under Mr. Bush. \u201cBut the problem is that surrounding yourself with people who share your views tends to reinforce them, leaving you vulnerable to big mistakes.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The people Mr. Trump has selected will thrust the words \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d to the center of American foreign policy in a way that blurs the lines between a war on terrorism and a war on Islam. General Flynn, in particular, has used anti-Muslim language that even the most strident Republicans have avoided. \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL,\u201d he posted on Twitter in February. He has compared Islam to a cancer and described it as a political ideology disguised as religion. Both Mr. Bush and President Obama believed that such language inflamed anti-American sentiment, served as a recruiting tool for terrorists and antagonized countries in the Middle East that the United States needed as allies in the fight against terrorism. Since Sept. 11, 2001, there has been bipartisan consensus that the best way to combat terrorism was to dismantle terrorist networks while avoiding being seen as attacking Islam. Mr. Trump has shown no such qualms. He proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and criticized politicians for tiptoeing around the role religion plays in terrorism. Photo Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, at Trump Tower on Friday. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Mr. Pompeo has said that Muslim leaders contribute to the threat by refusing to repudiate terrorism, though Muslim leaders and advocacy groups have done so repeatedly and often. \u201cSilence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in 2013. \u201cThe thinking here is that, no, religion is the key factor that influences everything else,\u201d said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse.\u201d \u201cThese guys are operating on the assumption that it\u2019s something going on in the religion itself.\u201d An overarching question for the United States government over the past 15 years has been where to set the balance between security and civil liberties. Mr. Trump has said that he gives more weight to security in that balance, and his early staff decisions reflect that view, both in matters of counterterrorism and of traditional law enforcement.

Donald Trump attends the launch of Trump University in 2005. (Bebeto Matthews / Associated Press) Kristina Davis, Greg Moran A $25-million settlement was reached Friday in three fraud lawsuits filed against President-elect Donald Trump and his now-defunct Trump University real estate seminar business. The agreement\u00a0covers two class-action lawsuits filed in San Diego and a third suit brought by the New York state attorney general. The actions had alleged that Trump defrauded customers into thinking they would learn real estate secrets from professors personally selected by him. The students said they learned little and instead were\u00a0subjected to hard-sell tactics urging them to spend thousands on classes. Under terms of the settlement, Trump will\u00a0not acknowledge or admit any liability or wrongdoing;\u00a0$21 million will be spread among plaintiffs in the two San Diego cases, while parties to the New York case will get\u00a0$4 million. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys agreed to work pro bono, maximizing the amount the students can recover. The 7,000-plus eligible class members should be able to recover at least half \u2014\u00a0and possibly 100%\u00a0of the money they spent on Trump University \u2014\u00a0said plaintiff attorney Jason Forge. Some students had paid up to $35,000 on \u201celite\u201d university memberships that offered a year of mentorship. Some said\u00a0they were encouraged to max out credit cards to pay for the instruction. \u201cStudents will be very pleased to be able to pay their credit card bills and move on with their lives,\u201d plaintiff attorney Rachel Jensen said. During the presidential campaign, Trump on several occasions said that he would not settle the cases. His attorney Daniel Petrocelli said outside court Friday\u00a0that he was\u00a0not sure what path the case would have taken if Trump hadn\u2019t been elected, but that Trump was\u00a0a \u201cfighter.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is pleased to have this case behind him so he can focus on every important issue facing this country,\u201d Petrocelli said. \u201cHe was willing to sacrifice his personal interests to put this behind him and move forward.\u201d The settlement terms were reached in the final hours before a 1:45 p.m. hearing\u00a0in San Diego before U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the two class-action lawsuits. Last week, Curiel suggested both sides meet with veteran U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller to see if a last-minute settlement could be worked out before the first case went to trial Nov. 28. Both sides spent all day Wednesday with Miller, and on Thursday worked to include the New York attorney general\u2019s office in the settlement, Petrocelli said. Because it involves class-action litigation, the deal still must be approved by Curiel. The judge said he needs to make sure it is \u201cfair, appropriate and reasonable.\u201d That is expected to take at least a month. If Curiel grants preliminary approval, then notices will go out to the class members, who can object or opt out of the agreement. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

Michael Flynn, his national security advisor; and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's choice for attorney general. (AFP / Getty Images) Evan Halper and David S. Cloud Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump began filling his Cabinet on Friday with stalwarts of the right, signaling with a trio of top national security and law enforcement selections\u00a0that he will aggressively pursue promises he made\u00a0during the campaign that have caused deep anxiety among immigrant and Muslim communities. Trump\u2019s choices dimmed speculation that he would move to the center as he begins to govern a nation still deeply fractured and on edge as voters try to predict what the president-elect\u2019s frequently\u00a0changing policy agenda means for them. On Friday, Trump provided some clarity. Trump\u2019s attorney general pick, Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, is an anti-immigration crusader deeply disliked\u00a0by civil rights activists. The president-elect\u2019s choice for national security advisor, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is an experienced warrior who has suggested Americans should fear all Muslims. Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who got the nod for CIA director, broke with colleagues on the House Benghazi Committee to co-author a minority report accusing Hillary Clinton of a cover-up. One week after Donald Trump won the presidency, the country he will take over in 65\u00a0days\u00a0lacks a\u00a0precise\u00a0idea of what he will do as the nation\u2019s chief executive.\u00a0 President Obama has tried to push Trump in the direction of pragmatism.

One week after Donald Trump won the presidency, the country he will take over in 65\u00a0days\u00a0lacks a\u00a0precise\u00a0idea of what he will do as the nation\u2019s chief executive.\u00a0 President Obama has tried to push Trump in the direction of pragmatism. The president-elect\u2019s colleagues on Capitol Hill are trying... (Cathleen Decker) The picks renewed the rancor Trump set off earlier in the week when he named as his top White House strategist Stephen Bannon, the media executive who has aligned himself with white nationalists. They presaged a contentious start to the Trump administration, with Democrats and civil rights activists already vowing to use Senate hearings to put the spotlight on the controversial pasts of the selections who must be confirmed, which include Sessions and Pompeo. Trump advisors and GOP lawmakers moved quickly to highlight moments in the careers of the men when they worked with colleagues across the aisle, and reiterated that Trump\u2019s Cabinet members are not there to implement their own agenda, but that of Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. They suggested that Friday\u2019s announcements don\u2019t necessarily indicate Trump is heading in a sharply ideological direction, as many more top spots have yet\u00a0to be filled. GOP establishment favorite and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, for example, is slated to meet with Trump this weekend, months after giving a speech arguing that Trump would be an unqualified and dangerous president.\u00a0Trump is also talking with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley , another favorite of moderates. \u201cThe president-elect wants the best and brightest,\u201d said Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer. \u201cHe is going to meet with people who supported him, and didn\u2019t support him\u201d\u00a0 But the positioning did little to quiet an outcry, with the angriest and fiercest response directed at Sessions. \u201cIf you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,\u201d Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.)\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cNo senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions.\u201d\u00a0 Sen. Jeff Sessions tapped to be next attorney general A brief look at Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions's career and past comments regarding race and civil liberties.\u00a0 A brief look at Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions's career and past comments regarding race and civil liberties.\u00a0 See more videos Sessions, 69, was one of the earliest and most enthusiastic backers of Trump\u2019s presidential bid. While he is generally liked by colleagues in both political parties, he is among the hardest liners on immigration in Congress, and his selection ensures that the limits on immigration and expanded deportations that Trump called for during the campaign are likely to be at the forefront of his administration\u2019s policies. Sessions made racially insensitive remarks that cost him a federal judgeship in 1986, when the Senate Judiciary Committee drilled down on the comments.\u00a0During his\u00a0hearings, four\u00a0 Justice Department lawyers testified that Sessions expressed racist views or endorsed them. He acknowledged in testimony that he called the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and American Civil Liberties Union \u201cun-American,\u201d though he denied believing such statements. Armand Emamdjomeh He testified that he believed\u00a0such organizations may have taken positions \"adverse to the security of the United States.\u201d but has since consistently praised the work of the NAACP. A colleague also testified that Sessions had agreed with a statement that a white lawyer was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to his race for handling civil rights cases. A black lawyer testified that Sessions once called him \u201cboy.\u201d Sessions denied making those statements. If confirmed to be\u00a0attorney general, Sessions would lead an agency that under President Obama has waded aggressively into civil rights issues, particularly after the unrest sparked by the killings of black men by police officers in recent years. Sessions has also opposed strengthening federal enforcement powers under the 1965\u00a0 Voting Rights Act \u00a0and is one of a handful of GOP senators blocking a bipartisan bill to loosen sentencing rules for low-level offenders. Sessions\u2019 Republican colleagues quickly closed ranks around him Friday, suggesting a confirmation is likely. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky praised him, pointing to how Sessions has collaborated with some of the Senate\u2019s most liberal lawmakers on legislation and noting that Obama\u2019s first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., was approved by the Senate without delay. Incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York warned that his cordial relationship with Sessions, with whom he exercises at the gym, does not give the attorney general nominee\u00a0a pass on tough questioning. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,\u201d Schumer said.

(Jazmine Ulloa and Melanie Mason) Flynn has also been criticized for aligning with Trump in calling for a thaw in relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin . In 2015, he was paid to\u00a0attend a dinner in Moscow hosted by Russia Today, Russia's government-sponsored English-language news channel, and sat at the same table as Putin. But he also wrote critically of Putin and the dangers Russia presents to the U.S. in his book published this year. Flynn spent 33 years in the Army as an intelligence officer, rising to the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, a job that he was forced to leave\u00a0in 2014 after clashing with Obama administration officials, who\u00a0he has said lacked a strategy for taking on a global militant enemy with its roots in a radical interpretation of Islam. From 2004 to 2007, Flynn was head of intelligence at the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command, the secretive organization that\u00a0conducted the most sensitive capture and kill operations against Al Qaeda operatives in Iraq and elsewhere. He was the senior military intelligence officer in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010 and a top advisor to Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. \u201cHe is familiar with the complex set of security challenges we face,\u201d Sen Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \u201cAnd President-elect Trump does not have a lot of experience in this arena.\u201d But Reed also expressed concern with comments Flynn made \u201cin the heat of the campaign.\u201d And Schumer told MSNBC that Flynn\u2019s comments about Muslims are \u201cvery, very troubling.\u201d Donald Trump selects Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA Director Rep. Mike Pompeo. President-elect Donald Trump selected a\u00a0Republican congressman and harsh critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks to be the head of the CIA, according to an official close to Trump's transition team. Rep. Mike Pompeo. President-elect Donald Trump selected a\u00a0Republican congressman and harsh critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks to be the head of the CIA, according to an official close to Trump's transition team. See more videos Pompeo, an Orange County native and former Army officer and aerospace executive, was elected as part of the 2010 tea party wave election. He would take over an agency that was revamped to focus on fighting terrorism after the 9/11 attacks. He has defended as legal the CIA\u2019s waterboarding and other torture, which Trump has said he wants to bring back over the objections of military and intelligence leaders. Pompeo\u2019s nomination to run the CIA \u201cis profoundly disturbing,\u201d Glenn Carle, a former senior officer who was involved in the CIA\u2019s interrogation and detention program, said in a telephone interview from Dubai. Carle, who spent 23 years as a spy before retiring in 2007, has criticized the agency\u2019s brutal treatment of detainees and believes the George W. Bush administration should never have authorized waterboarding and other interrogation techniques. \u00a0 Pompeo\u2019s vocal defense of the legality of the CIA program and criticism of the Benghazi investigation demonstrate a troubling willingness to ignore the facts, Carle said. \u201cMost of my former colleagues are rational people. We serve the executive, but the executive has to be in touch with reality,\u201d he said. Democrats took a less hostile posture toward Pompeo than Trump\u2019s other selections. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of Burbank, called Pompeo \"very bright and hardworking\" even though the two clashed on the Obama administration's handling of the 2012 attacks against a U.S. diplomatic compound and a CIA safehouse in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. Pompeo has harshly criticized Obama\u2019s deal with Iran to freeze its nuclear program \u00a0and has helped block Obama\u2019s plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He fought pitched partisan battles over national security while serving on the House Intelligence Committee, but nonetheless earned a reputation for seriousness and a quick grasp for the complex details of spycraft. \"While we have had our share of strong differences \u2013 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2013 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. Democrats may not be alone in sparring with the Trump Cabinet. Bannon predicts \u201cthe conservatives are going to go crazy\u201d when they see the plan he is pushing for public works spending on the scale of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.\u00a0 \u201cI'm the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter.\u00a0\u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s.

    "text": "What to Know About Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump's Pick to Lead CIA By ALANA ABRAMSON Nov 18, 2016, 1:51 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Names Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo His Pick for CIA Director 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald J. Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas to serve as his CIA director. \u201cI am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside President-elect Donald J. Trump to keep America safe,\u201d Pompeo said today in a statement. \u201cI also look forward to working with America\u2019s intelligence warriors, who do so much to protect Americans each and every day. Pompeo, who supported Sen. Marco Rubio during the GOP primaries, is so far the only person named to the Trump administration, other than Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who supported another candidate during the 2016 election. Here are a few things to know about Pompeo: The Basics Date of Birth: Dec. 30, 1963 Age: 52 Birthplace: Orange, Calif. What He Does Now Pompeo represents Kansas\u2019 4th Congressional District. He has accepted Trump's offer to direct the CIA, but needs to be confirmed by the Senate. What He Used to Do Before his 2010 election to represent the district, Pompeo was president of Sentry International, a Midwest company that sells imported pumping units to U.S. gas and oil distributors. Before that, he founded a Wichita, Kansas, company originally known as Thayer Aerospace, which manufactures components for the commercial aerospace, defense and space industries. After graduating from West Point, Pompeo served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army. Education Pompeo attended West Point, where he graduated first in his class, and Harvard Law School, where he was an editor on the Harvard Law Review. Key life-career moments As a congressman, Pompeo served on the House Intelligence Committee, conducting oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies, and the House Select Committee on Benghazi . Pompeo and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, released in June their own addendum to the House Benghazi Committee report that condemned Hillary Clinton 's leadership of the State Department during the deadly Benghazi, Libya, attack, and accused the administration of misleading the public about events there. The supplement was far more critical than the GOP majority report led by the committee chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. Pompeo opposes the Iran deal, arguing in a summer op-ed that it hasn't helped make the United States safer. \"Congress must act to change Iranian behavior and, ultimately, the Iranian regime,\" he wrote on Fox News\u2019 website. He is opposed to closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba , and has also advocating for strengthening U.S. surveillance capabilities. \"Robust surveillance, drawing on a variety of technical and human intelligence and backed up by rigorous investigation of all leads, is the best way to mitigate the threat,\" of terrorism , he wrote in a January 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed. Pompeo also serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 0 Shares ",

Donald Trump attends the launch of Trump University in 2005. (Bebeto Matthews / Associated Press) Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump agreed Friday to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits against his now-defunct Trump University for real estate investors, averting a trial in a potentially embarrassing case that he had vowed during the campaign to keep fighting. The settlement came 10 days before jury selection was scheduled to begin in one of the three cases. The complaints accused Trump University, which wasn't an accredited school, of defrauding students who paid up to $35,000 a year to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's real estate secrets. If the proposed settlement is approved by a federal judge, about 6,000 students covered in two-class action lawsuits in San Diego would share $21 million, and Trump will pay $4 million to settle a complaint filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in 2013. Under the terms, Trump admitted no wrongdoing. The settlement lifts what would probably be a major obstacle for Trump as he works to fill key executive branch positions and get acquainted with foreign leaders. The San Diego trial, on a case filed in 2010, was expected to last several weeks, guaranteeing daily news coverage of a controversy that dogged him during the campaign. Trump's political rivals seized on the lawsuits to try to portray him as dishonest and deceitful. Trump brought more attention to them by repeatedly assailing Indiana-born judge Gonzalo Curiel, who oversaw the two San Diego cases. Trump claimed the judge's Mexican heritage exposed a bias. The thousands of former students covered by the San Diego lawsuits will be eligible to receive at least half and possibly all their money back, as much as $35,000, said Jason Forge, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' attorneys waived their fees. Trump has denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he would not settle. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency. \"I could have settled this case numerous times but I don't want to settle cases when we're right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,\" Trump said at the time. Two days after the election, Trump's lead attorney in the San Diego cases, Daniel Petrocelli, said he was \"all ears\" to settlement talks and accepted an offer to have U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller of San Diego broker negotiations. Forge said the agreement was reached an hour before a hearing for Curiel to weigh Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the Jan. 20 inauguration. The plaintiffs' attorney said he \"definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach\" from Trump's camp after the election. \"We were at each other's throat for 6 \u00bd years and were able to find the common ground with them and do something good there,\" Forge told reporters. Schneiderman called the agreement a \"stunning reversal\" for the president-elect, saying Trump \"fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes.\" ",

The news comes on the heels of\u00a0Anthony\u2019s\u00a0 headline-making appearance at the 17th annual\u00a0 Latin Grammy Awards , during which the multi-hyphenate entertainer received the Person of the Year award \u2013 as well as a much-talked-about kiss from his ex-wife, singer/actress\u00a0Jennifer Lopez.

Following a brief split in January 2013, Anthony and De Lima reconciled, eventually marrying in a private ceremony in the Dominican Republic in November 2014. They do not have any children together.

(Chicago Tribune) Many of Chicago\u2019s immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal permission express concern for the future following\u00a0president-elect Donald Trump's pledge this week to immediately deport as many as 3 million people. (Chicago Tribune) Marwa Eltagouri , Tony Briscoe and Nereida Moreno Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Lily Martinez had never been involved in activism. But after Donald Trump was elected president, the 20-year-old Little Village resident felt an immediate call to action, determined that his stance on unauthorized immigrants \u2014 saying he intends to immediately deport millions \u2014 would not define her community's future. So the day after the election, she took a train to Trump Tower, joining thousands in protest. Trump's win has prompted alarm in the immigrant community, but it's also sparked a sense of duty among many to actively fight his proposed policies, including those who have never been involved in immigration advocacy. \"I've never been a part of anything like this. It feels like I'm living in a different time period,\" said Martinez, who is a U.S. citizen. \"The fact that I have to stand out on the streets and cry and scream and lock hands with people beside me, it feels like I'm living through the civil rights movement.\" Martinez's own predominantly Latino neighborhood, typically vibrant, is now \"gloomy,\" she said. Elders no longer sit outside on the streets. People fear deportation and don't think they have the resources to obtain the documents they need, so they \"just don't want to show their faces.\" Although Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised Chicago would continue to be a sanctuary city, where local law enforcement cannot ask about residents' immigration status, families and activists are uncertain whether that protection is enough. Trump vowed during his campaign to block federal funding to sanctuary cities, ramp up deportations, increase prison sentences for those who re-enter the country and build a wall along the Mexican border. (John Byrne, Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart) The immigrant community as a result feels powerless, unable to predict either the swiftness or severity of the enactment of Trump's plans. For example, those who've found relief through President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers legal protection to about 742,000 people who were brought to the U.S. as children and stayed here illegally, now fear Trump will rescind the executive order that created DACA. Various pro-immigrant groups are urging unauthorized immigrants to avoid applying for government programs such as DACA, concerned their information could be used to tip off enforcement agencies. About 450,000 unauthorized immigrants lived in Illinois in 2014, compared with about 500,000 in 2009, according to a study released in September by the Pew Research Center. Unauthorized immigrants make up 3.5 percent of Illinois' population and 24 percent of all foreign-born residents. About 71 percent of the state's unauthorized immigrants are Mexican. \"We don't know how to even get ready because we don't know how (Trump's) politics are going to look,\" said Laura Mendoza, a 27-year-old who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 6 and does not have legal protection. \"But we're not gonna go ahead and leave, and do what they want us to do \u2014 'go home' \u2014 because this is home for us.\" It's not clear what Trump's policies, once in office, will be. But before the election, most Trump supporters viewed immigration as a \"very big problem\" in the U.S. and overwhelmingly support his proposed border wall, according to an August survey by the Pew Research Center. Local Trump supporters, such as 32-year-old Adam Keene, of Palatine, still stick with those beliefs but say the issue is complex. It's important to note, he said, that Trump said he plans to immediately deport unauthorized immigrants with criminal histories, something Keene supports. But when it comes to dealing with unauthorized immigrants without criminal backgrounds, there should be an easy path to citizenship \u2014 which could help unite the country, he said. Laura Mendoza Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune Laura Mendoza, 27 is a volunteer with the Resurrection Project and is a DACA recipient. At the Resurrection Project in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood they are giving workshops for people worried about the the Trump presidency.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) \"These aren't easy conversations we're having right now \u2026 there's a lot of opposing viewpoints on this,\" Keene said. \"But I think everyone would agree that if people don't love America, if they don't respect American values and American laws, then they don't have a place in America.\" Futures in flux A 26-year-old Chicago attorney, who asked not to be identified by name for fear of legal repercussions, has kept her legal status a lifelong secret, anxious about the stigma that came with the truth. She was born in Saudi Arabia, where her Indian father had been working, and she and her family moved to the U.S. three months later on a visitor's visa. They overstayed, and her younger brother was born in the U.S. The attorney didn't learn she was an unauthorized immigrant until she was a teenager. But her status posed one obstacle after another: Her options for college were limited, even though she graduated at the top of her class, and she had to build her resume off unpaid internships and minimum-wage jobs. If she were deported, she said, she would be sent to India, a country she has never stepped foot in. Trump's election has her thinking about other options, such as moving to Canada and practicing law there. Or, she said jokingly, she could \"aggressively date\" and marry a U.S. citizen. She finally revealed her status to a friend after the friend mentioned how all unauthorized immigrants \"clean bathrooms and work the fields.\" Video: Mayor Emanuel on immigrants' rights Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at Lurie Children's Hospital about protecting immigrants' rights in wake of Donald Trump's presidential election win.

My dad has had more than half his life in the U.S. They are still undocumented, and they are getting older. And they can't work forever. And they are not getting some sort of help when they retire.\" Now, she's assisting families through the Pilsen-based nonprofit The Resurrection Project, which aids Chicago's Latino community through organizing, education and community development. \"President-elect Trump ran on the deportation of us, and people elected him,\" Rendon said. \"I just don't understand how you ... vote to tear families apart and deport people that are in your communities. That's what a vote for Trump was. That's what a vote for Trump meant to me.\" Those anxieties were shared by many of the two dozen people who attended an informational workshop Thursday at The Resurrection Project's resource center in Pilsen, where the organization's leaders answered immigrants' legal questions and a licensed clinical counselor walked the group through a breathing exercise to ease their stress. The organization's managing attorney, Julie Reiter Pellerite, fielded a salvo of questions in Spanish: What do I do if I'm detained? If I applied to DACA, will an immigration official come to my home? Should I apply for a renewal? Since the election, she's been screening unauthorized immigrants to see whether they might be eligible for a certain visa or immigrant visa petition for battered spouses. ",
