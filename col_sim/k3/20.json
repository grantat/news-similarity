News that the park named in honor of Yauch had been vandalized caused outrage and heartbreak on social media Friday, with photos shared on social media by New York Councilman Brad Lander and others showing children playing on equipment that had been defaced by spray-painted swastikas and a \"Go Trump\" message. Yet more hatred & anti-Semitism from Trump supporters. Swastikas on the playground equipment in Adam Yauch Park in BK Heights. #NeverIsNow pic.twitter.com/Xbcwo4enfF \u2014 Brad Lander (@bradlander) November 18, 2016 City workers removed the graffiti last night, and police are investigating the crime at the Brooklyn Heights park that in 2013 was renamed to honor Yauch, who was known as MCA in his role as a founding member of the Beastie Boys. Yauch had played in the park as a child ; he died of cancer in 2012. Images from Saturday show the park's rightful occupiers \u2014 kids \u2014 playing on the equipment. Residents brought flowers and notes. A new message was chalked onto the playground's rubber mat: \"Love Trumps Hate.\" Another said that the playground's train is a machine that stops fascists. A \"Stand Up Against Hate\" rally will take place in the park at 11:30 a.m. Sunday, with Lander and other elected officials, including Rep. Nydia Velazquez, attending alongside religious leaders and at least one of Yauch's former bandmates.

Danny Davis, right, and his son Stacey Wilson speak Nov. 18, 2016, at a news conference about the fatal shooting of Wilson's 15-year-old son, Jovan. (Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Grace Wong , Elvia Malagon , Rosemary Regina Sobol and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Chicago police Saturday called the shooting of a U.S. congressman\u2019s 15-year-old grandson a targeted attack stemming from an argument over gym shoes. Jovan Wilson, whose paternal grandfather is U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, was killed about 7 p.m. Friday while his mother was out picking up dinner for the family, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. The incident originally was believed to be a home invasion, he said, but police later learned that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cThere was a history between the young people involved and it was a dispute over gym shoes,\u201d Guglielmi said. \u201cThis was not random but was egregious and senseless to use a gun over a fight for clothes.\u201d Jovan, of the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue in the city\u2019s Englewood neighborhood, was a Perspectives Charter High School sophomore. Calls to the school weren\u2019t immediately returned. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, took to Twitter on Saturday morning, saying: \u201cThe murder of Congressman Danny Davis\u2019 15 year old grandson in a Chicago home invasion is reminder we need a federal strategy to save lives.\u201d Guglielmi corrected Gingrich, tweeting: \u201c@newtgingrich not a home invasion but a dispute among teens over gym shoes that ended in senseless shooting.

The teen\u2019s mother had left the home to pick up food. During the argument, one of the assailants, a 15-year-old boy, pulled out a gun and shot Jovan in the head. A 17-year-old girl was the other assailant, Davis said. \u201cHe was a typical 15-year-old,\u201d the Democratic congressman said. \u201cHe liked basketball. If you listened to him he was a basketball star, but he liked basketball and music. All those kinds of things. He was an avid sports fan, he knew all about, you know, the stats of different players.\u201d Congressman's grandson killed in Englewood Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune Charles Raymond, 74, of the Hyde Park neighborhood, walks away from the scene in the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue where the 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis was killed\u00a0Nov. 18, 2016, in the Englewood neighborhood. Raymond, a family friend, drove the teen's grandmother to the scene.

Danny Davis was killed\u00a0Nov. 18, 2016, in the Englewood neighborhood. Raymond, a family friend, drove the teen's grandmother to the scene. (Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Davis had just returned to Chicago from Washington, D.C., and was in his office when his son Stacey Wilson, the boy\u2019s father, called him with the news of the shooting. He said he might never know the answer to those questions or if there was anything, such as better education, that could have prevented his grandson\u2019s homicide. \u201cI do know that I grieve for my family,\u201d Davis said at a news conference. \u201cI grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger. I grieve for his family, his parents, his friends, some of whom will never see him again.\u201d Davis said gun violence is a problem society deals with every day and reflected on how he\u2019s attended multiple funerals for other slain teenagers. \u201cI guess that I always knew that the possibility existed that it could happen close to me,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I thought it was so unfortunate because Jovan had just reached a point, 15, his grades had improved at school. His father had just told me about how proud of him that he was because he was catching on and realizing that all of his life was in front of him.\u201d The family had talked to the teen about staying at home at night. Still, that didn\u2019t spare him from violence, Davis said. \u201cUnfortunately, here he was in the house at home, minding his own business, and some intruders would come and snuff his life away.\u201d The boy\u2019s father, teary-eyed, stood next to Davis during the news conference. He had just given his son money to get a haircut, and he thought the next time he would talk to him would be about an appropriate haircut to get. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take me some time to grieve,\u201d Wilson said. Violence has spiked this year in Chicago to levels not seen since the 1990s, and several people with prominent connections have been killed in addition to Davis\u2019 grandson. Police reported no arrests as of Saturday evening. ",

James Mattis eyed as Trump's possible pick for defense secretary Published               November 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 In a sign that Donald Trump was zeroing in on his choice for defense secretary Saturday, a senior transition team official told Fox News the retired Marine Gen. James Mattis was a \"very strong candidate\" for a Cabinet post. TRUMP, ROMNEY MEET FOR 'FAR-REACHING CONVERSATION' AFTER LOBBING SHOTS DURING CAMPAIGN The retired general was one of several people who met with Trump in New Jersey during the day on Saturday.\u00a0Trump wouldn't say whether he was offering Mattis a job, saying \"we'll see.\" But as they posed for cameras before sitting down for their meeting, Trump pointed to Mattis and called him \"a great man.\" Earlier, an official with the transition team confirmed the retired general was under consideration to lead the Pentagon. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 If nominated and approved,\u00a0Mattis would be the highest-ranking officer to become defense secretary in more than half a century. When asked about a rule prohibiting those who served in active duty within the past seven years, the senior official told Fox News, \"There are waivers around that.\" Known as \"Mad Dog Mattis,\" the retired general was credited with a string of colorful quotes over the years, including: \"Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\"\u00a0 Also:\u00a0\"You are part of the world's most feared and trusted force. Engage your brain before you engage your weapon.\" The president-elect also was considering retired Army Gen. David Petraeus to serve as defense secretary, The Wall Street Journal reported .\u00a0 Trump is said to have a strong interest in having a former general run the Pentagon, with the interest in Mattis coming after retired Army General Jack Keane, citing personal reasons, withdrew his name from consideration. The Trump team is also weighing options for pairing the general with a CEO-like figure as deputy secretary, an individual who could bring needed reform to the Pentagon's spending and management systems. Trump also met with Mitt Romney and Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, among others, at the billionaire's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., during the day on Saturday. Trump signaled a sharp rightward shift in U.S. national security policy Friday with his announcement that he would nominate Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism. Sessions and Flynn were ardent Trump supporters during the campaign, and their promotions were seen in part as a reward for their loyalty. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for \"ending our interrogation program\" and said intelligence officials \"are not torturers, they are patriots.\" Fox News' Serafin Gomez, Doug McKelway, John Roberts, James Rosen and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Kim, Chicago Tribune) Protesters march toward Trump International Hotel and Tower Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016, in Chicago. (John J. Kim, Chicago Tribune) Marwa Eltagouri , William Lee and Grace Wong Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune More than a week after Donald Trump was elected president, at least 200 protesters and onlookers crowded Federal Plaza at noontime ahead of a milelong march to Trump Tower as families waited for the evening's Festival of Lights parade on the Mag Mile. Speakers said demonstrations are important after the election, and that it's vital their voices be heard so what they view as racist, sexist and xenophobic rhetoric of Trump's campaign would not become a new normal. Those who led reminded protesters of the importance of demonstration even after the election, and how vital it was that their voices be heard, so that what they believed was the racist, sexist and xenophobic rhetoric of Trump's campaign would not become a new normal. Trump's presidency and recent Cabinet appointments, they promised the crowd, would be met by resistance and organization every day. People march through Chicago on the weekend of Nov. 18, 2016 to protest the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.\u00a0 While most of the protesters\u2019 ire was focused on the president-elect, whom speakers denounced as a racist and homophobe, the crowd also spoke out against Democrats who they said took them for granted. \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests rose up largely against Democratic mayors and then you have an open racist running on the other side against a woman who played a key role in the mass incarceration boom \u2014\u00a0what sort of choice is that,\u201d said local activist Andy Thayer, who was one of the speakers at Federal Plaza. \u201cMy point is we don't just have to take this crap,\u201d he said, adding that activists can force change when they unite. Chanting in unison, they pumped the air with handmade signs, and passers-by downtown often stopped to read the messages: \u201cOur voices are stronger than Trump's hate.\u201d \u201cI deserve a president who leads by example.\u201d \u201cPrivilege: Thinking something is not a problem because it's not a problem to you personally.\u201d One sign was crafted by 5-year-old Johanna Gierut, and its pink scribbled letters formed a simple message, reading, \u201cDonald Trump is mean.\u201d Trump protesters in Federal Plaza Marwa Eltagouri / Chicago Tribune A young protester holds up a sign in Federal Plaza on Nov. 19, 2016. A young protester holds up a sign in Federal Plaza on Nov. 19, 2016. (Marwa Eltagouri / Chicago Tribune) Johanna said she thinks Trump is selfish, too \u2014\u00a0something she conveyed to her father, 35-year-old Nick Gierut, during a lesson on selfishness. Gierut said the protest offers his daughter a valuable lesson: That a hateful attitude toward minority groups, even if displayed by her future president, is not acceptable. Gierut said he personally tried to give Trump a chance when he realized he would be the nation's next president. But Trump's recent Cabinet appointments, such as his choice for attorney general, Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, set Gierut back. Sessions is an anti-immigration crusader deeply disliked by civil rights activists. \u201cI was hoping (Trump would) name more moderate Republicans to this Cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we march and only a couple people read about it, they might go and read about (Stephen Bannon) and Sessions. And that helps.\u201d Other speakers talked of opposing Trump and his agenda at every turn in his fledgling presidency.

But no, the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d had to demonstrate they were self-centered left-wingers without courtesy or discretion when they stepped forward after a Friday night performance to have one of their number directly address Vice-President Elect Mike Pence, who had attended the show. It was ironic that that Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor portraying Vice President Aaron Burr, who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, delivered the rebuke. Burr was later suspected of having conspired to traitorously divide the western states and territories from the nascent United States. \u201cWe, sir,\u201d Mr. Dixon said, \u201cwe are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.\u00a0 We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\u201d It is a measure of Mike Pence\u2019s basic decency that after being booed by a few self-righteous New Yorkers in the audience, who probably don\u2019t know anyone who voted for Trump except maybe their doorman, that Mr. Pence stayed, patiently listened to Mr. Dixon\u2019s supercilious lecture, and then gently took his leave. Imagine if Mr. Dixon has not displayed such anger at the election but instead found just a few ounces of grace and delivered something along these lines. \u201cWe, sir, are the part of the diverse nation that is America. With the election now past, we all hope for your administration\u2019s success in defending our planet, our children, and the inalienable rights of every American. We are grateful you came and hope this show inspires you as you work on behalf of all the people of our common country.\u201d Mr. Dixon would have made his point but without being condescending or rude. It is a measure of Mike Pence\u2019s basic decency that after being booed by a few self-righteous New Yorkers in the audience, who probably don\u2019t know anyone who voted for Trump except maybe their doorman, that Mr. Pence stayed, patiently listened to Mr. Dixon\u2019s supercilious lecture, and then gently took his leave.

Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful) On Friday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended a performance of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d triggering\u00a0a firestorm. First, Pence was greeted by both cheers and boos upon his arrival at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York. After the show, the famously diverse cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d paused during its curtain call to deliver a message to Pence. \u201cWe, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,\u201d said\u00a0Brandon Victor Dixen, the actor who portrays Aaron Burr, to raucous applause. \u201cBut we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations.\u201d [ Trump demands apology from \ufffd?Hamilton\u2019 after cast\u2019s message to Pence ] Pence reportedly left the auditorium before Dixon finished speaking, but a show spokesman told the Associated Press that the vice president-elect stood in the hallway and heard the full message. Social media accounts for \u201cHamilton\u201d posted the address online shortly after the end of the show, and videos of Dixon\u2019s speech soon went viral, getting shared tens of thousands of times.

The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 The responses were, well, nonstop. Some\u00a0cheered the cast for voicing their concerns so directly. Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) responded to Trump and said \u201cthe reality is that LGBTQ people, people of color, women and others have faced harassment since the election.\u201d That isn't harassment. The reality is that LGBTQ people, people of color, women and others have faced harassment since the election. \u2014 Sarah Kate Ellis (@sarahkateellis) November 19, 2016 The American Civil Liberties Union, which has been on high alert since Trump won the presidency last week , also chimed in on Twitter , saying Americans did not need to apologize \u2014 \u201cnot even to presidents or vice presidents\u201d \u2014 when lawfully exercising their constitutional rights. Americans don't need to apologize-not even to presidents or vice presidents-for the lawful & proper exercise of their constitutional rights. https://t.co/daN147yjkM \u2014 ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016 \u201cPresident-elect Trump needs a refresher on his high school civics class,\u201d ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero told The Washington Post in an email. \u201c\u2026 The First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy, and Democratic and Republican presidents alike have understood that freedom of speech makes our country stronger \u2014 even if it sometimes make our leaders uncomfortable. The apology should instead come from\u00a0President-elect Trump for calling into question the appropriateness of the Hamilton cast\u2019s statements.\u201d [ Why Trump gets theater completely and utterly wrong ] Still others found the incident \u201crude\u201d and argued that the theater was not an appropriate place \u2014 the modern-day equivalent of crying out, \u201c For shame! \u201d (Peter Marks, theater critic for The Post, offered his take \u00a0on that argument.) Many of Trump\u2019s top supporters \u2014 including a press aide, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \u2014 joined the chorus of those who derided the cast\u2019s speech.

The irony of the #BoycottHamilton movement is that it's mostly folks who already boycott both hip-hop and knowledge of history. \u2014 John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) November 19, 2016 I love that #BoycottHamilton is trending as if that show hasn't been sold out for more than a year.

John McCain, R-Arizona, speaks during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol Feb. 5, 2015, in Washington, D.C.</p> Close Win McNamee/Getty Images HALIFAX, Nova Scotia\u00a0-- A leading Republican voice on national security matters says he doesn\u2019t care what President-elect Donald Trump says, the United States will not reinstate waterboarding. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Saturday at the Halifax International Security Forum that any attempt to bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court.\u00a0 McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, says extreme interrogation techniques are banned under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding used against suspected terrorists during the George W. Bush administration. Donald Trump: We need to change law to allow torture, waterboarding \u201cWe have an enemy in the Middle East that\u2019s chopping off heads and drowning people in massive steel cages,\u201d Mr. Trump\u00a0 said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in March , speaking of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very tough to beat enemies that don\u2019t have any, that don\u2019t have any restrictions, all right? We have these massive restrictions. Now, I will always abide by the law, but I would like to have the law expanded.\u201d \u201cI happen to think that when you\u2019re fighting an enemy that chops off heads, I happen to think that we should use something that\u2019s stronger than we have right now,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now, basically, waterboarding is essentially not allowed, as I understand it. ... I would certainly like it to be, at a minimum, at a minimum to allow that.\u201d In another interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in July, Mr. Trump and then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence doubled down on enhanced interrogation techniques, saying that they have \u201csaved lives.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThose techniques get information,\u201d Mr. Trump told \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat I can tell you is enhanced information gleaned information that saved American lives and, I was informed, prevented incoming terrorist attacks on this country from being successful,\u201d Pence added at the time. \u201cThe American people expect the president of the United States to be prepared to support action to protect the people of this nation, and I know Donald Trump will.\u201d McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, says waterboarding doesn\u2019t work and makes it hard for the U.S. to claim moral superiority. The president-elect has publicly derided McCain for his capture during the Vietnam War.\u00a0 During the Republican primary campaign last July, Mr. Trump said the Arizona senator was only considered \u201ca war hero \u2018cause he was captured.\u201d\u00a0 At the time, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: MARTIN BERNETTI, AFP/Getty Images) President Obama said he doesn't expect major changes in Latin American policy under the Trump administration, and urged people to \"not make immediate judgments\" until the president-elect puts his team together. \"Don't just assume the worst. Wait until the new administration\u00a0is in place, is putting its policies forward, and then you can make your own judgments,\" Obama told a group of 1,000 young leaders from around the Americas in Peru on Saturday. \"There are going to be tensions that arise, probably more about trade more than anything else,\" he said. But even there, Obama said he's not convinced Donald Trump would tear up trade deals, as the president-elect promised on the campaign trail. \"Once they look at how it's working, I think they\u2019ll conclude that it\u2019s working both for the United States and its trading partners.\" Obama urges Trump not to cut deals with Russia Obama's comments Saturday, during his final stop on what's scheduled to be the last foreign trip of his presidency, followed a pattern of trying to give Trump space to adopt what Obama hopes are more conventional policies. In Europe this week, Obama reassured allies Trump would maintain the U.S. commitment to NATO, and he'll likely have a similar message for Pacific Rim leaders at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru on Sunday. Obama reassured NATO allies over Trump. So why aren't they buying it? \"How you campaign is not always the same as how you govern,\" Obama said. \"When you\u2019re campaigning, you're trying to stir up passions. When\u00a0you govern, you have reality in front of you, and you have to figure out how to make this work.\" On trade, for example, Obama said the 2009 Peru Trade Promotion Agreement has benefited the United States by ensuring that workers aren't undercut by abusive labor practices in Peru, but also allowing Peruvian workers to be customers for U.S. products. \"We did it also because that will help lift\u00a0the wages and benefits and protections that workers here in Peru have,\" he said. \"Then they have more money in their pockets, then they go\u00a0out an spend that money, which is good for business and everybody is better off.\" Trump's new tone needs to be reflected in staff picks, Obama says Obama also met Saturday with the 11 other leaders from countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement in limbo now that its largest signatory, the United States, appears unlikely to ratify. But the White House said Obama used the meeting to urge the other countries to press forward on \"high-standard trade agreements.\" 166 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 79 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g8RnBv ",

Taking a softer tone, Trump and Romney seemed to bury the hatchet at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey \u2014 where the businessman-turned-politician moved his White House transition team for the weekend \u2014 in a meeting that lasted about an hour and a half. Trump is considering Romney for secretary of state, a source close to Trump told NBC News , although the president-elect has not publicly said what role, if any, Romney could play.

Romney was then whisked away by his white Buick. Trump returned outside and greeted former Washington, D.C., schools chancellor Michelle Rhee for another private meeting. Related: Mike Flynn, Jeff Sessions, Mike Pompeo: Meet Trump's Latest Top Picks Such a move to incorporate Romney would be a stark reversal following the name-calling over the past year \u2014 and one that would build out Trump's inner circle that includes retired Gen.

Drew Angerer / Getty Images Before the meeting started, Romney shook hands with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and entered what was sure to be a difficult and awkward meeting. The two sides came together after feuding during the presidential election. Romney had ripped Trump as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud,\" and said a presidential nominee should be disqualified for not releasing his tax returns \u2014 criticism he wrote in a Facebook post in May. The former governor also wrote that given Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, there was certain to be a \"bombshell\" within them. Post by NBC News . Trump responded on the campaign trail, claiming that Romney was \"irrelevant\" and \"a choke artist.\" The president-elect also routinely took to Twitter to share his blustery criticism.

Richard Spencer, chairman of the National Policy Institute, a prominent alt-right organization. (Joshua Roberts) Lisa Mascaro Inside a\u00a0beige meeting room at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead. Like countless others who travel to Washington, they had come\u00a0to position their interests at the forefront of the political agenda. Their sponsor\u00a0had a\u00a0wonky and\u00a0nondescript name, National Policy Institute. They cradled cups of morning coffee. But on closer look, this group Saturday\u00a0was different:\u00a0They were almost entirely young men, many sporting\u00a0the same haircut of\u00a0short sides and back with a familiar flop on top. The agenda topics: \u201c Trump and the New White Voter,\u201d \u201cAmerica and the Jewish Consciousness,\u201d \u201cThe Future of the Alt-Right.\u201d \u00a0 This was the white nationalist lobby \u2014 the alt-right \u2014 \u00a0coming to town for a victory lap after Donald Trump\u2019s election, assuming what they see as their rightful place influencing\u00a0the new administration. \u201cAn awakening among everyone has occurred with this Trump election,\u201d Richard Spencer, president of the white nationalist think tank,\u00a0said during opening remarks. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite the establishment now, but I think we should start acting like it.\u201d The National Policy Institute held a conference Saturday in Washington. Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times The National Policy Institute held a conference Saturday in Washington. The National Policy Institute held a conference Saturday in Washington. (Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times) Several hundred pro-white nationalists showed up for the day-long confab, buoyed by Trump\u2019s popularity and the role they now intend to play in bringing white identity politics to Washington. Sitting around conference tables, the formally dressed\u00a0men more resembled Washington lobbyists \u00a0than\u00a0the robed Ku Klux Klansmen or skinhead toughs that often represent white supremacists, though they share many familiar views. This new generation is aiming to influence Washington in Washington\u2019s own\u00a0ways: churning out position papers, lobbying lawmakers and, and perhaps most importantly, removing the cloak of anonymity to fully join the national political conversation. Heidi Beirich, who monitors hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said today\u2019s nationalists are picking up where David Duke left off when the former Klan imperial wizard shed his robes to enter politics in the early 1980s. \u201cThis is how you sneak these ideas into the mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guys in the suits are the ones we have to worry about.\u201d Spencer looks like many young staffers on Capitol Hill. And Beirich noted that even the newer white nationalist label, \u00a0alt-right, removes the reference to \u201cwhite,\u201d while positioning the nationalists on the \u201cright\u201d as part of the conservative movement. \u201cBeneath the benign-looking guy and the benign-sounding name, the purpose of the National Policy Institute is to push the idea that all men are created unequal,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cSadly, in American history, there\u2019s nothing new with that idea.\u201d Trump has said he \u201cdisavowed\u201d support from white supremacists, but many in the alt-right believe his tough talk on immigrants and Muslims shows that their efforts to preserve a white majority in the United States are ready for a wider audience. They were heartened by his selection of Breitbart News executive Stephen K. Bannon, who has called his site a platform for the alt-right. \u201cWe are the epicenter of the right now in terms of intellect,\u201d said 30-year-old Nathan Damigo\u00a0of California. \u201cWe are the culture creators of the right.\u201d Nathan Damigo, right, at a National Policy Institute conference in Washington.

(Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times) At Saturday\u2019s event, organizers were holding an \u201cask us anything\u201d news conference inside the Reagan building downtown as protesters filled the streets outside\u00a0on Pennsylvania Avenue. Vendors were hawking T-shirts and stickers as conferees milled about between sessions. A band was scheduled for entertainment.  Hors d\u2019oeuvres would be served before a\u00a0social hour at\u00a0a local bar \u2014\u00a0though some said they were accosted by protesters at a restaurant the night before.\u00a0 As the up-and-coming intellectual voice of the movement, Spencer is credited with popularizing\u00a0 the term \u201calt-right.\u201d Twitter banned his account and those of other leaders last week in a clampdown on hate speech. A father who splits his time between his home in Montana and an office in the Washington suburbs, he organized the conference before Trump won the election.\u00a0 But now, with Trump preparing for the White House, the National Policy Institute is planning to seize the opening with a series of policy papers on immigration, foreign and domestic policy to offer pro-white ideas.\u00a0 The\u00a0views span left and right. The group advocates\u00a0paid family leave, for example, but also requiring immigrants in the country illegally to leave and giving preference to white arrivals from Europe. \u201cIn terms of policy, Trump\u2019s movement was a little bit half-baked,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cMoving forward, the alt-right as an intellectual vanguard can complete Trump.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

(Photo: Getty Images) If there was one thing General Motors' old Saturn car company had going for it, it was its no-haggle pricing policy. You simply paid the price on the sticker, and you couldn't go across town to another dealer and try to get something better. That was a popular policy, except it was applied to subpar cars such as the Outlook, Sky\u00a0and Vue, which all got low reliability ratings from consumer-survey outfits such as Consumer Reports. Car buyers don't like haggling, but they're willing to do it if it means they'll save money on a good quality car. Still, car companies haven't made the car shopping experience a pleasant one. A few years ago, Ipsos Public Affairs conducted a study for used-car retailer CarMax to discover what was their greatest car-buying regret. The No. 1 decision they made that they ultimately wished they could get a mulligan on was paying too much for a car that didn't hold its value. Other mistakes car buyers made include: Not doing enough research. Buying one from an untrustworthy dealer. Not getting an extended warranty. Not reading the fine print on the contract they signed. For certain, there are very few cars that can retain their value over the years, and every car buyer has heard the saying that a new car drops in value as soon as it's driven off of the dealer's lot. Let your fingers do the walking But it doesn't have to be this way. Car shoppers have a number of tools readily available to them to determine the value of a vehicle, new or used, and whether those values will hold up over time. Kelley Blue Book (KBB) and Edmunds.com may be two of the most recognized names in the industry that consumers turn to when shopping for a car, but the National Automobile Dealers Association trade group has its own \"book\" that used to be available exclusively to dealers, though it's since created a website consumers can peruse, too. Recently, Kelley released its third-quarter 2016 survey on retention values for manufacturer-suggested retail prices when a car that's anywhere from one to three years old goes to auction. The results are not encouraging. According to KBB analyst Sean Foyil, even though the cost of such vehicles has remained stable over the past few years, retention values fell by almost 5% in the third quarter, or by roughly $807. Even though the cars come loaded with better equipment packages than vehicles in the past, prices are still falling. He says this is a sign \"buyers at auction are not willing to pay a premium for these vehicles due to the saturation of vehicles available in the market.\" While 4% or so is the average decline in MSRP at auction, some cars performed much worse than average. Here are the five worst cars for model years 2013 to 2015 for retained value in the third quarter, as compiled by KBB. \u00a0(Photo: Flickr via Petey) 5. Acura RDX (-14.3%) The RDX was Acura's first compact luxury crossover SUV that showed up on dealer floors in 2006. While the vehicle has earned top ratings for safety from places such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sites such as Consumer Reports found it to be something of a mixed bag, highlighting its safety features such as lane-departure warnings, but also saying its dashboard controls are \"an exercise in needless stupidity.\" 4. Lexus HS (-14.6%) Another compact luxury vehicle, the Toyota (NYSE: TM)-family Lexus HS is a dedicated hybrid vehicle first introduced in the U.S. in 2009 with a goal of selling as many as 30,000 cars a year. Despite being seen as an upscale version of the Toyota Prius, it never really caught on with car buyers despite its popularity in Japan, perhaps because of its much lower highway MPG ratings than its rival. \u00a0After selling about 6,700 cars in 2009 and over 10,000 the following year, in 2011 Lexus sold fewer than 3,000 of them and officially killed the car off in 2012. 3. Ford C-MAX Hybrid (-14.7%) \u00a0(Photo: Flickr via Jason Lawrence) Ford\u00a0(NYSE: F) introduced the C-Max as its first hybrid-only line of vehicles in 2003, but only to European car buyers. It wasn't until the 2013 model year that U.S. buyers had a chance to drive one. Its most notable feature was its gasoline-electric powertrain that had a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine working in conjunction with an 88-kilowatt permanent magnet AC synchronous motor.\u00a0It's gotten mixed reviews, however, with KBB and Edmunds giving it four stars, but\u00a0Car & Driver\u00a0giving it just three. 2. Infiniti Q60 (-14.7%) A Nissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY)-family vehicle,\u00a0the Q60 was the\u00a0successor to Infiniti G-series, but it never really caught on with buyers of high-end luxury cars. Models such as the 2013 lineup earned only three stars or so from the price-guide services, though later models did better. But it also offered upgrades to it that served to confuse people. The IPL model, for example, which stands for \"Infiniti Performance Line,\" charged more for what seemed like very little actual or even practical increase in performance. 1. Mitsubishi Galant (-17.8%) \u00a0(Photo: IFCAR) The granddaddy of the group, the Mitsubishi Galant was first introduced back in 1969, but much like the Lexus HS, it saw its lineage come to an end with the 2012 model year. It was originally sold in the U.S. in 1971 as a Dodge Colt and ended its existence as Mitsubishi's ninth-generation sedan built on a midsize front-wheel-drive platform. While it might not have earned stellar reviews from professional car sites, owners seemed to like it, and on Cars.com the 2012 model year actually has a 4.5-star rating. The loss in value the Galant suffered, like the Lexus, probably has more to do with the fact the cars have been discontinued, meaning it becomes much more difficult to get parts for a vehicle. Regular service and routine maintenance may be easy enough, but when a manufacturer stops making a Saturn, Saab, or Galant, it means the time involved and expense in tracking down replacement parts is going to increase. That will serve to undermine any residual value a car may hold. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends CarMax.

Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News hide caption toggle caption Freida Lockaby says she has benefited from access to health care coverage through Medicaid. Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News For Freida Lockaby, an unemployed 56-year-old woman who lives with her dog in an aging mobile home in Manchester, Ky., one of America's poorest places, the Affordable Care Act was life altering. The law allowed Kentucky to expand Medicaid in 2014 and made Lockaby \u2013 along with 440,000 other low-income state residents \u2013 newly eligible for free health care under the state-federal insurance program. Enrollment gave Lockaby her first insurance in 11 years. \"It's been a godsend to me,\" said the former Ohio school custodian who moved to Kentucky a decade ago. Lockaby finally got treated for a thyroid disorder that had left her so exhausted she'd almost taken root in her living room chair. Cataract surgery let her see clearly again. A carpal tunnel operation on her left hand eased her pain and helped her sleep better. Daily medications brought her high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol level under control. But Lockaby is worried her good fortune could soon end. Her future access to health care now hinges on a controversial proposal to revamp the program that her state's Republican governor has submitted to the Obama administration. Article continues after sponsorship Next year will likely bring more uncertainty when a Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress promise to consider Obamacare's repeal, including a potential reduction in the associated Medicaid expansion in 31 states and the District of Columbia that has led to health coverage for an estimated 10 million people . What Happens If Kentucky Dismantles Its Health Insurance Exchange? Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015, has argued his state can't afford Medicaid in its current form. Obamacare permitted states to use federal funds to broaden Medicaid eligibility to all adults with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, now $11,880 for individuals. Kentucky's enrollment has doubled since late 2013 and today almost a third of its residents are in the program. The Medicaid expansion under Obamacare in Kentucky has led to one of the sharpest drops in any state's uninsured rate, to 7.5 percent in 2015 from 20 percent two years earlier. Kentucky's achievement owed much to the success of its state-run exchange, Kynect, in promoting new coverage options under the health law. Kynect was launched under Bevin's Democratic predecessor, Steve Beshear, and dismantled by Bevin this year. Bevin has threatened to roll back the expansion if the Obama administration doesn't allow him to make major changes, such as requiring Kentucky's beneficiaries to pay monthly premiums of $1 to $37.50 and require nondisabled recipients to work or do community service for free dental and vision care. Budget pressures are set to rise next year in the 31 states and the District of Columbia where Medicaid was expanded as the federal government reduces its share of those costs. States will pick up 5 percent next year and that will rise gradually to 10 percent by 2020. Under the health law, the federal government paid the full cost of the Medicaid expansion population for 2014-2016. In a state as cash-strapped as Kentucky, the increased expenses ahead for Medicaid will be significant in Bevin's view \u2014 $1.2 billion from 2017 to 2021, according to the waiver request he's made to the Obama administration to change how Medicaid works in his state. Trump's unexpected victory may help Bevin's chances of winning approval. Before the election, many analysts expected federal officials to reject the governor's plan by the end of the year on the grounds that it would roll back gains in expected coverage. A Trump administration could decide the matter differently, said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voice for Health, an advocacy group that opposes most waiver changes because they could reduce access to care. \"I think it's much more likely that a waiver could be approved under the Trump administration,\" she said. \"On the other hand, I wonder if the waiver will be a moot point under a Trump administration, assuming that major pieces of the [Affordable Care Act] are repealed.\" Lockaby is watching with alarm: \"I am worried to death about it.\" Life already is hard in her part of Kentucky's coal country, where once-dependable mining jobs are mostly gone. In Clay County where Lockaby lives, 38 percent of the population live in poverty. A fifth of the residents are disabled. Life expectancy is eight years below the nation's average. Clay's location places it inside an area familiar to public health specialists as the South's diabetes and stroke belt . It's also in the so-called \" Coronary Valley \" encompassing the 10-state Ohio/Mississippi valley region. About 60 percent of Clay County's 21,000 residents are covered by Medicaid, up from about a third before the expansion. The counties uninsured rate for nonelderly adults has fallen from 29 percent to 10 percent. Still, the increase in insurance coverage hasn't made Clay's people healthier yet. Local health officials here say achieving that will take a decade or more. Instead, they cite progress in smaller steps: more cancer screenings, more visits to mental health professionals and more prescriptions getting filled. Harder lifestyle changes that are still ahead \u2014 such as eating better, quitting smoking and regular exercise \u2014 will take more than a couple years to happen, said Aaron Yelowitz, associate professor of economics at the University of Kentucky. At the Grace Community Health Center in Manchester, Ky., psychologist Joan Nantz meets with patient Ramiro Salazar, who gained Medicaid under the expansion. Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News hide caption toggle caption Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News At the Grace Community Health Center in Manchester, Ky., psychologist Joan Nantz meets with patient Ramiro Salazar, who gained Medicaid under the expansion. Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News One hopeful spot is the Grace Community Health Center in downtown Manchester, where patient visits are up more than 20 percent since 2014. Those without insurance pay on a sliding scale, which can mean a visit costs $50 or more. That was too much for Ramiro Salazar, 47, who lives with his wife and two children on a $733 monthly income. With Medicaid, he sees a doctor for his foot and ankle pain, meets regularly with a psychologist for anxiety and gets medications \u2014 all free to him. Medicaid even covers his transportation costs to doctors, vital because a specialist can be 40 miles away. Salazar is worried about Bevin's plans, especially the additional costs. \"I probably couldn't afford it as I'm unemployed,\" he said. \"It would hurt me pretty bad.\" Any development that could take away health coverage from people with mental health issues worries Joan Nantz, a psychologist who works part time at Grace and whose appointment calendar is booked three weeks out because of patient demand. More than 90 percent of her clients are on Medicaid. \"If something happens to this program, I can't begin to think what impact it would have on society,\" she said. Without counseling, people with mental health issues will resort to illegal drugs and be more likely to commit crimes and domestic violence, Nantz said. Just five primary care doctors in Manchester treat adults in Clay and surrounding counties. Manchester Memorial Hospital has tried to recruit more without success. \"We had a painful primary care shortage here five years ago and now it's worse,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Newswanger, an emergency room physician and chief medical officer at the hospital. \"Just because they have a Medicaid card doesn't mean they have doctors.\" The emergency room is busier than ever seeing patients for primary care needs, he said. Newswanger sees both sides to the debate over Medicaid. The hospital gained because more patients are now covered by insurance, and the ER's uninsured rate dropped to 2 percent from 10 percent in 2013. \"Eliminating the expansion altogether would be painful for the hospital and a disaster for the community,\" he said. But, Newswanger also appreciates some of Bevin's proposals. \"No one values something that they get for free,\" he said, and incentives are needed to make people seek care in doctors' offices instead of expensive ERs. Christie Green, public health director of the Cumberland Valley District Health Department that covers Clay County, said making the poor pay more or scrapping Medicaid's expansion would be a setback to improving people's health. Last year, Green helped Manchester build a three-mile trail along a park and install a swinging bridge across a small creek. Both additions were intended to promote physical fitness in a place where more than a third smoke \u2014 both far above national averages. Progress is slow. The path is used regularly. But drug addicts congregate daily by the bridge and it rarely gets traffic. \"There is a lot to overcome here,\" Green said.

There is no indication how he will fare in by the president-elect, he said. However, experts say it's also become clear with agency leaks of the investigation that Comey's lost control of the FBI. That could erode confidence on both sides of the aisle. Further, the FBI, which has historically tried to steer clear of the optics of politically motivated decisions, appeared to take an unprecedented step in the direction, Charles said. \"The FBI was seen as separate from the discourse of politics,\" said Athan Theoharis, an emeritus professor of history and the FBI at Marquette University, \"with Comey thrusting himself into a political election, that reputation is now tarnished.\" FBI Director James Comey is sworn-in before a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on July 7, 2016. YURI GRIPAS / AFP - Getty Images Democrats skewered Comey for his poor timing on rehashing the Clinton investigation while Republicans questioned if any of his investigations were ever conducted in good faith. But there was no political malice involved with Comey's decision to re-examine Clinton's emails, said Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who has been a close friend of Comey's for 30 years and was a former colleague of his at the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York. In this Sept. 28, 2016 file photo, FBI Director James Comey testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP \"When you have an obligation to disclose or to qualify, you do it full-stop. You don't worry about timing, you don't worry about how it will be read or spun by others,\" Richman told NBC News before the election. \"And in this case, when he learned that what he said to Congress about the review of emails being complete turned out to be dated and requiring correction, he did it. There's no calculus involved.\" Safia Samee Ali ",

    "text": "Donald Trump duels with cast of 'Hamilton' Nov. 19, 2016, 6:33 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now:Trump does not appreciate how Mike Pence was received at 'Hamilton'White nationalists in jackets... (W.J. Hennigan) Trump also met with Rhee, presumably to discuss\u00a0education issues. Rhee\u00a0was the controversial chancellor of the public schools in Washington, D.C., and now lives in Sacramento where her husband, former basketball star Kevin Johnson , is the\u00a0city\u2019s mayor. Rhee declined to speak to reporters as she left the club.\u00a0 Among others on Trump\u2019s dance card for the day was\u00a0retired Gen. James Mattis, a former war commander who has been critical of some Obama administration policies and has the nickname of \u201cMad Dog Mattis\u201d and is being considered to lead the Pentagon. Patrick\u00a0Soon-Shiong, who made his fortune developing an anti-cancer drug, also met\u00a0with Trump. Soon-Shiong, a vice chairman of the Los Angeles Times\u2019 parent company Tronc,\u00a0has been closely involved with Vice President Joe Biden 's cancer moonshot initiative, which is designed to accelerate scientific efforts to find cures for cancers. The meetings were designed to highlight\u00a0the administration\u2019s efforts \u201cto pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration,\u201d said Trump spokesman Jason Miller. Trump, however, started the day off on a different note \u2014 by sparking\u00a0a feud on social media over what happened when his vice president-elect attended the critically acclaimed\u00a0Broadway musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d When Pence arrived at the Richard Rodgers Theatre\u00a0on Broadway for the night\u2019s performance of \u201cHamilton,\u201d he was both cheered and loudly jeered by the audience. After the show, actor Brandon Victor Dixon spoke to Pence from the stage: \u201cWe, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.\" Pence had\u00a0left the auditorium before Dixon finished, but reportedly heard all the remarks over speakers in the hallway. Trump didn\u2019t appreciate the lecture. \u201cOur wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d Dixon responded on the social media platform:\u00a0\u201cconversation is not harassment sir,\u201d adding that he appreciated Pence for showing up. Trump also took to Twitter in the morning to brag\u00a0about settling fraud claims aimed at\u00a0his defunct university. A day earlier, Trump had settled two class-action lawsuits filed in San Diego and a third suit brought by the New York state attorney general for $25 million, something he had repeatedly said he would never do. The lawsuits alleged that Trump had defrauded customers into thinking they would learn real estate secrets from professors he had \u201chandpicked\u201d at his for-profit Trump University. The students said they learned little and instead were subjected to hard-sell tactics urging them to spend thousands of dollars on classes. \u201cI settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

Gerry Broome/AP hide caption toggle caption Gerry Broome/AP Democratic challenger Roy Cooper has a lead of more than 6,000 votes over Gov. Pat McCrory. He's seen here with his wife, Kristin, at an election night rally in Raleigh. Gerry Broome/AP More than a week after initial returns showed him narrowly beating Gov. Pat McCrory, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper has added to his lead, while several counties have rejected Republicans' complaints and calls for a recount. The final tally is ongoing. Cooper, a Democrat, leads the Republican incumbent by 6,600 votes \u2014 2,288,867 to 2,282,267 \u2014 with both candidates hovering just below the 49 percent mark, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections . Libertarian Lon Cecil captured 101,574 votes, for just over 2 percent. The elections board in Durham County rejected McCrory's call for a hand recount of 94,000 early ballots, and two other counties rejected complaints that included an allegation that computer issues had created improper voting conditions, member station WFAE reports . WFAE spoke to reporter Jeff Tiberii (of another member station, WUNC), who said, \"We should note that all local boards across the state are comprised of two Republicans and one Democrat.\" Before a winner is declared, more counties will have to certify their final tallies \u2014 and roughly half of North Carolina's 100 counties are also contending with election complaints registered by Republicans. Article continues after sponsorship For now, the race has the same status it gained on Nov. 8: too close to call. But citing Cooper's lead, Marc Elias, an election specialist for the Democratic challenger, tells the Raleigh News Observe r that Cooper will likely lead the state. While Cooper's lead has grown since election night, the tally has fluctuated, and it may not surpass the 10,000-vote threshold that would prevent McCrory from calling for a recount, Elias tells the newspaper. Voter turnout was relatively strong in North Carolina, where Donald Trump edged Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Before midnight on Election Day, the state election board reported more people had voted in 2016 than in 2012. North Carolina has been in national headlines this year for its controversial HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms. The law prompted businesses, sports groups and celebrities to boycott the state; McCrory dropped a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice in September, \"after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state.\" Now voters are awaiting word on who won the governor's race. As WUNC's Tiberii reports : \"Meanwhile, nearly 60,000 provisional ballots are being considered and thrown out or counted by local election boards. These ballots are cast when there are questions about voter eligibility. Political scientists say about half of all provisional ballots are thrown out and those counted tend to lean Democratic or mirror the general election outcome.\" \"This has been a hard-fought race,\" Cooper said on election night. \"But the people of North Carolina have spoken, and they want a change in leadership.\" He concluded that speech by saying that he was \"confident these results will be certified, and that they will confirm victory.\" But at nearly the same time, McCrory told supporters, \"The process is continuing right here in North Carolina; the election is not over in North Carolina.\" ",

    "text": "Young Immigrants Who Came Out of Shadows Now Fear Having to Go Back In By Serena Marshall Nov 19, 2016, 9:57 AM ET 0 Shares Star Juan Gallegos Juan Gallegos, center, participating in non-violent civil disobedience outside the Federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, CA, June 2012. 0 Shares Email They remember exactly where they were when it was announced. President Obama in the Rose Garden on June 15, 2012, talking directly to the camera as he gave young people who were brought to the U.S. as undocumented immigrant children a way to get free of the constant fear of deportation. \u201cIt makes no sense to expel talented young people, who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans -- they\u2019ve been raised as Americans; understand themselves to be part of this country -- to expel these young people\u2026because of the actions of their parents -- or because of the inaction of politicians,\u201d Obama said. He then announced the program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) under which, in the president's words, \"eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.\u201d Trump said on the campaign trail that he plans to reverse Obama\u2019s executive actions and orders, which would include DACA. A Fateful Day \u201cI just stopped everything I was doing and was fixated on the news and then I went back into the kitchen and started crying,\u201d recalled New Jersey resident Renata Muariz of that day. Muariz, now a student at Brown University in Rhode Island, was 12 when she was brought to the U.S from Brazil by her mother who had fallen into financial hardship in her home country and could no longer provide for her family. Juan Escalante also vividly recalls the day of Obama's announcement. \"I remember turning on the TV and watching the ticker and remember thinking my life was about to change,\u201d said Escalante, of Tallahassee, Florida, who was 11 when his parents brought him to the U.S. from Venezuela. Escalante, now 27, said his parents arrived legally in the U.S. on work visas and were in line to follow a legal path toward citizenship but were forced out of the process after the family lawyer gave them incorrect advice that left them undocumented and with no legal mechanism forward. \u201cI had just finished my degree and was very uncertain about my future,\u201d Escalante said of when his family suddenly became undocumented. \u201cIn the country that refused my contributions and talents, when deferred action was announced I felt immediately validated. It allowed me to demonstrate I am going to work hard I am going to contribute to my economy.\u201d Juan Gallegos of Denver also knows where he was on that fateful date -- protesting for immigration reform on what became \"one of the most amazing days of my life.\" Gallegos remembers just as clearly the day he arrived in the U.S. \u201cI was 12 years old, it was the 4th of July, 2001. I remember so vividly there were fireworks. Children outside playing sports. It felt like such a welcoming space,\u201d he said. But as time passed in his new home country, the feeling of being welcomed faded. As an undocumented immigrant, Gallegos found that after he graduated college he couldn't get jobs in his field. \"I worked as a waiter or anywhere that would take me,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the summer, I was building irrigation pipes in the cornfield. And I remember thinking -- with every turn of the wrench -- I have a college degree and can\u2019t make use of it.\u201d Coming out of the Shadows Gallegos, Escalante and Muariz are among roughly 750,000 young people given temporary protected status and, separately, work authorization under DACA. Applicants to the program had to prove they were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012; came to the U.S. before age 16; lived here for at least five years continuously; attend or graduated from high school or college; and have no criminal convictions. Undocumented youth who had learned to be careful about calling attention to themselves thought twice about applying to the program out of fear of making themselves vulnerable to deportation. But ultimately many decided to take the risk. \u201cI figured the government already had most of [this information] since I had gone to school and been part of the public school system,\u201d Gallegos said. Muariz said, \u201c[It\u2019s a] scary thought to know the government now has your information and has access to \u2026 to deporting you. But the benefits of it just sounded like it surpassed whatever consequences and seemed safe.\u201d Before the deferred-action program, Muariz didn\u2019t think college was possible for her. She had avoided even talking to her high school guidance counselor and did not take college-entrance exams so as to not draw attention to herself. But on the day of Obama's announcement, she decided to \u201cjust try a little harder and see what happens.\u201d Now, the 23-year-old is a student at Brown University. \u201cDACA made me more confident in terms of dreaming of higher goals,\u201d she said. But Trump's election \"has brought a lot of uncertainties for me ... The thought of having DACA revoked -- it will completely change the path I take.\u201d New Fears Muariz plans to apply to law school, but now is uncertain if the future she imagined for herself is possible. She, like others who had come out of the shadows under DACA, now has, as Escalante said, \u201ca lot of anxiety and a lot of questions and a lot of concern.\" \"We are operating under the assumption that the Trump administration is surrounding itself with names of people\u2026that are anti-immigrant -- [Kris] Kobach, [Jeff] Sessions, all of these players coming together to advise the Donald Trump administration,\u201d Escalante, who works as digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, an immigrant rights group, told ABC News. Kobach, known as the architect of a stringent and controversial immigration enforcement law in Arizona, SB 1070, has been brought on to the Trump team as an immigration adviser. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who on Friday was named as the president-elect's pick for U.S. attorney general, was a vocal critic of a comprehensive immigration reform bill by a bipartisan group of eight senators in 2013. Matt McClain/ The Washington Post via Getty Images Supporters of DACA/DAPA outside the Supreme Court, April 18, 2016 in Washington, DC. They and others were there to show support of Obama's immigration policy as the court heard a case that focuses on the President's executive action on immigration. Now as the future Trump administration takes shape, Escalante said many undocumented young people who applied to the deferred action program are concerned about the personal information they released that could now possibly be used against them. \u201cWhen we as a community decided to move forward and apply for this program we did it with good will \u2026 also understanding information wasn\u2018t going to be used as a massive database to target our community,\u201d Escalante said. \u201cA lot of people bracing for what may come next.\u201d Muariz said she can't imagine what she would do if the program were terminated and she was deported to Brazil. \u201cAt this point my English is better than my Portuguese,\u201d she said. \u201cA life back there is really hard to imagine at this point, especially after everything we\u2019ve built here. It would be starting from scratch, which is a scary thought.\u201d Gallegos has similar fears. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most afraid of is going to a Mexico where the economy is worse and worse every day,\u201d he said. But he said that through the deferred action program, \u201cI lived the American dream. I was able to go to school and do a lot of things with my life that don\u2019t think would have been possible in Mexico. All of those experiences, the education that I got, nobody is going to be able to take away from me.\u201d Hoping for the Best While Bracing for the Worst Short of deportation, if the program is eliminated and Gallegos has to go back to living the tenuous life of an undocumented immigrant in the U.S., he said he can deal with it. \u201cI grew up undocumented in this country,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cI remember living in Hastings, Nebraska, and there was a raid at the meatpacking plant. I remember seeing all those children left at school with nobody to pick them up from school. It\u2019s not new. It\u2019s happened before. We deal with it; we cope.\u201d But he said no one should expect young undocumented immigrants to stop fighting for the right to live freely and without fear. \u201cYou can lash at us you can detain us. Do whatever you want to us but we are going to come back and stronger every time,\u201d he said. Muariz echoed this, saying she's not pinning her hopes on possible new legislation or action by the incoming Trump administration. \u201cMy hope comes from, really, the community and people power that I\u2019ve witnessed in the past week,\" she said. 0 Shares ",

But he's scored a win with Donald Trump RNC in Cleveland 2016 Brian Blanco / European Pressphoto Agency Radio host Alex Jones speaks to crowds near Quicken Loans Arena, the venue for the 2016 Republican National Convention. Radio host Alex Jones speaks to crowds near Quicken Loans Arena, the venue for the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Brian Blanco / European Pressphoto Agency) Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Steve Padilla Contact Reporter Alex Jones was telling his listeners on YouTube about his visit to scenic Mt. Bonnell, the highest point in Austin, Texas, where he had gone to record a message about the dark forces threatening the republic \u2014 one of his favorite topics. As is often the case, he got sidetracked \u2014 this time by the president-elect of the United States. \u201cOn my way here, Donald Trump gave me a call ,\u201d Jones recounted on one of his latest videos, posted last week. \u201cAnd I told him, \u2018Mr. President-elect, you\u2019re too busy;\u00a0we don\u2019t need to talk.\u2019 But we still spent over five minutes [on the phone], and he said, \u2018Listen, Alex. I just talked to the kings and queens of the world, world leaders, you name it.\u2019 But he said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter. I want to talk to you to thank you and thank your audience. And I\u2019ll be on in the next few weeks to thank them.\u2019\u201d These are heady times for Jones, the Austin-based documentarian, radio and online television host known for his epic rants about the new world order and efforts by powerful globalists to enslave the masses. His \u201cInfowars\u201d program is a mainstay of the far-right media landscape, gaining new currency as the Trump campaign has sidelined the mainstream press in favor of more receptive outlets. Jones takes Trump\u2019s \u201csome people say\u201d style of interpreting the world and doubles down. The Texas Internet host likes to talk about secret armies. Mind control. \u201cKleptocrat corporate-run media.\u201d The 9/11 attacks, he says, were carried out by the U.S. government. Six days\u00a0before the Nov. 8 election, Jones uploaded another scoop: \u201cThe Truth About the Clinton\u00a0Pedophile Ring Exposed.\u201d When officialdom and the media are calling him crazy, that\u2019s when Jones figures he\u2019s hit his stride. \u201cWhen they\u2019re attacking you,\u201d he said in a 2013 interview with The Times, \u201cyou\u2019re winning.\u201d Trump\u2019s rise, Jones says, can be attributed to \u201cliberty and freedom\u00a0and common sense.\u201d \u201cWe finally have people in Washington that actually listen to the people and don\u2019t buy the propaganda of the big mainline corporations that are using weaponized media to mind-control simple-minded people,\u201d Jones told his listeners. Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead. Like countless others who travel to Washington, they had come\u00a0to position their interests at the forefront... Inside a\u00a0beige meeting room at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead. Like countless others who travel to Washington, they had come\u00a0to position their interests at the forefront... (Lisa Mascaro) Like most successful purveyors of conspiracy theories, Jones gets it right just enough to keep people listening. He early on warned the public about National Security Agency cellphone spying, domestic drones and the perils of genetically modified food. He is a Texan with enough of an accent to prove it, and his baritone voice commands attention in person and on the air. Jones broadcasts from his headquarters in an unmarked building at a location he prefers not to disclose. His default setting is distrust. When a reporter visited his studio in 2013, a staff member alerted Jones during a commercial break that the FBI had just foiled a bomb plot in Wichita, Kan. Jones ducked out of the studio to scrutinize a bank of network television monitors, then scoffed at the FBI\u2019s announcement. \u201cExplosion plot \u2014 like they\u2019re so pleased to have something to run around and get people excited about,\u201d he said. One caller that day, a man who identified himself as Ryan from Kentucky, said he had witnessed nearly 3,000 Russian troops and United Nations forces secretly training nearby. Jones appeared unfazed. Over the years he has shared similar reports of covert armies preparing to subjugate the American people. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the place \u2014 they\u2019re just acclimating us for occupation,\u201d he replied, \u201cYou should shoot video of that \u2014 post it on YouTube.\u201d During his show, he has been known to sing along to Black Sabbath, Johnny Cash, Blue Oyster Cult and George Strait. He loves \u201cStar Wars\u201d and peppers his commentary with references to \u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d He\u2019s friends with Dave Mustaine, former lead guitarist for the heavy metal band Metallica, now with Megadeth. The band named its 12th studio album after one of Jones\u2019 films, \u201cEndgame.\u201d Jones graduated from Austin\u2019s Anderson High School in 1993 \u2014\u00a0the same year the FBI\u00a0raided the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, a confrontation that left dozens of sect members dead and sparked endless debate over the FBI\u2019s account of events. He went on to attend Austin Community College, where he hosted a show on the college\u2019s public access channel that became the basis for his current radio show and website. Jones is not without detractors. Glenn Beck has accused him of being a fascist madman (Jones dismisses Beck as an effeminate globalist lackey). The Southern Poverty Law Center , which monitors extremist groups, said Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was among Jones\u2019 listeners; Southern Poverty Law Center spokesman Mark Potok has called Jones \u201cthe single most prolific patriot conspiracy theorist in the country.\u201d\u00a0 On Wednesday, a woman whose mother died in the 2012 massacre\u00a0at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut released an open letter calling on Trump to disavow Jones , saying he \u201chas fanned the flames of a hateful conspiracy theory claiming that the shooting that took my mother never happened.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable. It\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Erica Lafferty wrote to Trump. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to denounce it immediately and cut ties with Alex Jones and anyone who subscribes to these dangerous ideas.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday met with an eclectic mix of potential Cabinet picks, including a high-profile Republican foe, even as he launched a Twitter storm boasting about settling a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and criticizing the cast of a hit Broadway musical for lecturing his vice... President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday met with an eclectic mix of potential Cabinet picks, including a high-profile Republican foe, even as he launched a Twitter storm boasting about settling a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and criticizing the cast of a hit Broadway musical for lecturing his vice... (Del Quentin Wilber) In a video released Friday, \u201cAlex Jones\u2019 Final Statement on Sandy Hook,\u201d Jones denied saying that no one died. He then went on to suggest, however, that the official account by police and everyone else who has looked into the tragedy \u2014\u00a0that a single gunman had slaughtered six adults and 20 first-graders at the school \u2014 was open to question. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I\u2019m not sure about what really happened,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anomalies. And there has been a coverup of whatever did happen there.\u201d For all the people Jones infuriates, he also draws enthusiastic audiences. That was vividly on display three years ago when he and listeners gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy\u2019s assassination. On\u00a0a Dallas street, he gestured wildly with his free hand to his camera crew and the crowd surrounding him at the foot of the grassy knoll that had become such a famous landmark associated with the shooting. \u201cA year ago the mayor said we won\u2019t have any conspiracy theorists [at the anniversary observance] \u2014 that means anyone who questions the official story,\u201d Jones shouted. \u201cThis is an act of defiance!\u201d Supporters wearing Infowars T-shirts cheered, while others carried signs Jones had made bearing Kennedy\u2019s image and the words: \u201cThe establishment killed me 50 years ago, now they\u2019re killing free speech.\u201d As he hit his stride, Jones\u2019 gravely voice rose to an urgent crescendo. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a bunch of offshore corporations running our country and trying to get rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution, and banker bailouts of trillions of dollars, trying to take our guns and impoverish us for political control!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018OK, you want a fight? You\u2019re going to get one, you bastards!\u2019\u201d The crowd erupted in cheers. \u201cHe\u2019s counterintuitive. He shines a light in the darkness,\u201d said Joe Krupa, a retired teacher from San Pedro who had come for the anniversary and stumbled upon Jones. Jason Phillips, an engineer from San Diego, thought Jones sounded pretty wild when he first saw his show on YouTube. But the more he listened, he said, the more he believed. \u201cThe official story,\u201d he said, \u201cis a farce.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

    "text": "Got it The cast of \"Hamilton\" delivered a message to Vice President-elect Mike Pence from stage after he watched the show at Richard Rodgers Theatre on Nov. 18. Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful) By Philip Rucker November 19 at 8:32 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Mike Pence was elected vice president by a coalition of mostly white voters nostalgic for what they thought of as the good old days in America and galvanized by promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. On Friday night, Pence came face-to-face with a symbol of the new America: A hit musical called \u201cHamilton\u201d that celebrates the principles of the nation\u2019s founding but reimagines the revolutionary period with multiracial actors playing the statesmen and the contributions of immigrants central to the story. As he took his seat in New York\u2019s Richard Rogers Theatre, Pence heard an impassioned, sustained boo. He sat through a performance celebrating the country\u2019s multiculturalism. And when the show was over and he headed for the exits, the cast was not quite finished. \u201cWe, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,\u201d said Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who played Aaron Burr, reading a statement the cast members had drafted together. \u201cBut we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us,\u201d he continued. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, top center, leaves the Richard Rodgers Theatre after a performance of \"Hamilton\" in New York on Friday. (Andres Kudacki/AP) The remarkable moment crystallized the cleavage wrought by a toxic presidential campaign, in which millions of aggrieved white Americans propelled Donald Trump and Pence to the White House and left millions of others \u2014 blacks and Latinos, gays and lesbians, Muslims and Jews \u2014 fearful of what might become of their country. \u201cIt was this collision of two different Americas and two different visions and two different sets of experiences, happening at once, and happening in a rather dramatic way,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter to President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. By Saturday morning, Trump decided to respond. He could have chosen to offer assurances that he would be a president for all Americans \u2014 that he would respect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed. But Trump being Trump, the president-elect punched back. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place,\u201d Trump tweeted . \u201cThe cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d There was a certain irony to Trump\u2019s demand, considering that as a candidate he rarely if ever apologized for the blizzard of insults he sprayed across the country. \u201cHave you ever apologized? Ever? In your lifetime? Close your eyes, think back to Baby Donald . . . ,\u201d Jimmy Fallon asked Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d in September 2015. President-elect Donald Trump, left, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, right, with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis at the Trump International Golf Club in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Saturday. (Aude Guerrucci / Pool/European Pressphoto Agency) \u201cI fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,\u201d Trump replied. He added, with a laugh, \u201cI will absolutely apologize sometime in the hopefully distant future, if I\u2019m ever wrong.\u201d Trump did apologize in October for the comments he made in 2005 to \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush bragging about having grabbed women by their genitals. As a candidate, Trump set off hand grenades with provocative tweets at moments of his choosing to attract the attention of the news media. Regardless of whether this was Trump\u2019s intent Saturday morning, his shot at the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast served to distract from a negative news story that broke late Friday: The president-elect had agreed to a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against Trump University, his defunct real estate seminar program. Trump tweeted Saturday that he had settled the case because he had to \u201cfocus on our country.\u201d \u201cThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\u201d Trump tweeted, although there was no clear indication whether he would have prevailed had the case gone to trial. In many ways, \u201cHamilton\u201d has become a touchstone in America\u2019s ongoing culture wars. Hillary Clinton embraced the musical \u2014 its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, openly supported her candidacy \u2014 and recited its lyrics in her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. Talk about \u201cHamilton\u201d is different in Trump\u2019s orbit, however. Last Thursday at Trump Tower, when a reporter asked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) how long he intended to be in New York, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway interjected: \u201cHave you seen \u2018Hamilton\u2019?\u201d \u201cI have not,\u201d replied Sessions, who the next day would be announced as Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee. Trump\u2019s handling of the Pence incident is in keeping with how he confronted past cultural controversies and could presage how he will act in the White House. Although he is a billionaire who lives in a three-story apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, he long has felt excluded and shunned by the New York and Washington elite. Trump is sensitive to perceived snubs \u2014 and has mastered the art of snapping back at criticism from coastal liberals as a means of ingratiating himself with his middle-America base. On Saturday, Trump\u2019s defenders rushed to condemn the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast and voice outrage at perceived disrespect. His supporters started a \u201c#BoycottHamilton\u201d campaign on Twitter \u2014 although \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets are such a hot commodity that the production is sold out well into next year. \u201cThe arrogance and hostility of the Hamilton cast to the Vice President elect (a guest at the theater) is a reminder the left still fights,\u201d tweeted former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser. Gingrich went on to liken Trump to former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher: \u201cLady Thatcher aroused the same bitter hostility because like Trump she was a threat to the establishment\u2019s claim to moral superiority.\u201d Presidential historian Robert Dallek said Trump\u2019s Twitter retort was a striking act of divisiveness by an incoming president struggling to heal the nation after a bitter election. \u201cInstead of doing what a Franklin Roosevelt or a John Kennedy or a Lyndon Johnson would have done, he\u2019s exacerbating the differences by saying they owe him an apology,\u201d Dallek said. \u201cFor what? What were they asking for? They were asking for a kind of regard for minorities. It wasn\u2019t as if they were asking him to give up the office.\u201d Said Wehner: \u201cHe\u2019s not the sole reason that the campaign was ugly and divisive, but he\u2019s the main reason it was. . . . And now, having won, it falls on him to bind up the wounds. Even if you feel what happened by the cast of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 was wrong or inappropriate or indecorous, he\u2019s the leader of the country.\u201d Although Trump won a clear majority in the electoral college, he garnered just 47 percent of the popular vote \u2014 more than 1 million votes short of Clinton, with millions of votes still to be counted in primarily liberal states. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump understands that beneath the surface of his electoral college victory, there\u2019s a lot of people who simply are not willing to accept the rhetoric of his campaign as the language of government,\u201d veteran Democratic strategist Tad Devine said. \u201cTrump has opened Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re looking for hope at the bottom.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Apologize! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 I\u2019m not sure what kind of \u201csafe and special\u201d theater\u00a0the president-elect is alluding to in his tweet on Saturday, following the imbroglio involving Vice President-elect Mike Pence at the Friday night performance of Broadway\u2019s \u201cHamilton.\u201d Maybe by \u201csafe and special\u201d he means the theater is supposed to be docile,\u00a0an innocuous\u00a0landscape filled exclusively with chorus girls and holiday pageants. But let\u2019s be clear:\u00a0\u201cSafe\u201d theater is dead theater. Conflict is what drives drama, and sometimes, emotions in that public space become intense and things get messy. Some of that exuberance spilled over into the peanut galleries Friday night: As he returned to his orchestra seat after intermission, Pence was greeted with applause \u2014 and boos. Broadway protocol would dictate that\u00a0an incoming vice president go backstage after a performance and greet the cast. In this case, though, Pence reportedly was being ushered out of the theater as Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor portraying Aaron Burr in the acclaimed musical about the life of Alexander Hamilton, began his curtain-call remarks. According to media reports, Pence stood just outside the auditorium door, listening to the full speech. It is rare indeed for a company of actors\u00a0\u2014 and especially those in what amounts to one of the biggest hits in Broadway history\u00a0\u2014 to address a single public official at the end of a performance. [ Trump demands apology from \u2018Hamilton\u2019 after cast\u2019s message to Pence. ] \u201cThank you so much for joining us tonight,\u201d\u00a0Dixon said, on behalf of the production. \u201cYou know, we had a guest in the audience this evening. And Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments. There\u2019s nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There\u2019s nothing to boo here. We\u2019re all here, sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir, and we hope that you will hear us out. And I encourage everybody to pull out your phones and tweet and post, because this message needs to be spread far and wide, okay? Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us at \u2018Hamilton: An American Musical.\u2019 We really do.\u00a0We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir.\u00a0But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of all\u00a0of us. All of us.\u00a0Again, we truly thank you for sharing this show, this wonderful American story, told by a diverse group of men, women, of different colors, creeds and orientations.\u201d Some observers on social media see Trump\u2019s tweet as an attempt to grab hold of a minor\u00a0culture-war\u00a0issue and deflect attention from objections being lodged against several of his initial appointments. Indeed, he seems to be trying to make the case here that it\u2019s not the incoming administration that poses the greatest threat; it\u2019s the dissenters who are threatening him. Still, the\u00a0challenging words by the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast and the contretemps surrounding them portend a contentious\u00a0relationship between the Republican-led government and an arts community that may be preparing to take it on publicly. In the context of\u00a0a musical about a revolution, the events of Friday night look like life imitating art. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "World Leaders at APEC Summit Take Aim at Trump Over Trade By joshua goodman and ben fox, associated press LIMA, Peru \u0097 Nov 19, 2016, 5:38 PM ET 0 Shares Email Several U.S. allies took aim at Donald Trump's views on global trade, while China's president made an impassioned call against the sort of protectionism favored by the president-elect at a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders on Saturday The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is taking place in Peru as world leaders are on edge over Trump's campaign pledges to protect U.S. jobs by backing out of the not-yet-implemented Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said NAFTA benefits workers and companies on both sides of the border. Still, he expressed concern that the U.S. could be turning its back on a bilateral trade relationship responsible for moving $1 million worth of goods every minute. \"In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,\" Pena Nieto told business leaders. \"Mexico, like the entire world, is about to initiate a new stage with the U.S. and in commercial terms we want to give the right value to this strategic relationship between Mexico and the U.S.\" New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key spoke more bluntly, saying the \"tremendous despair\" triggered by Trump's trade views can't be allowed to slow down economic integration by the rest of the world. \"Even if the United States doesn't want to engage in free trade, President Trump needs to know other countries do,\" said Key. He said it's still possible to save the 12-nation TPP negotiated by the Obama administration by introducing cosmetic changes making it acceptable to Trump or carving out a less ambitious pact among TPP signatories that leaves out the U.S. \"I personally think that President Trump will be very much like chairman of the corporation Trump is,\" he said. \"He's a flexible business guy. He's going to realize he has a role to play.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered perhaps the most-forceful defense of free trade, given the size of his economy. In his kickoff speech from Peru he said the best response to rising protectionism would be for APEC's 21 members to negotiate a free trade area encompassing the entire Pacific Rim. \"Closed and inclusive arrangements are not the right choice,\" Xi said, taking a veiled stab at the TPP, which excludes China and is widely seen as an attempt to reassert U.S. dominance in Asia. \"Building a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for long-term prosperity.\" Xi's remarks came as Chinese state media blasted Trump for \"trade-bashing\" rhetoric that threatens global economic stability. \"The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,\" official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary piece published Saturday. President Barack Obama warned against a rush to judgment on Trump, saying at a town hall on the margins of the summit that it's too early to conclude that the new administration will wipe out trade deals and create international problems. \"Don't just assume the worst,\" he said. \"Wait until the administration's in place\" before drawing conclusions. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Franklin Briceno and Paul Traynor contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Afterward, both men exited the clubhouse and shook hands for the cameras. \u201cWent great,\u201d Mr. Trump said, cupping his hands at his mouth to project his voice. Mr. Romney then briefly addressed reporters, declining to say whether he was interested in a cabinet position. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe had a far-reaching conversation with regard to the various theaters of the world with interest to the United States of real significance,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cWe discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics. A very thorough and in-depth discussion over the time we had. I appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and look forward to the coming administration.\u201d Mr. Romney did not answer reporters\u2019 questions about whether he had apologized to Mr. Trump for his criticism of him during the campaign. Photo Reporters on Friday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., where the president-elect was spending the weekend. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Among the others who sat down with Mr. Trump were Michelle A. Rhee, a Democrat who served as the chancellor of public schools in the District of Columbia from 2007 to 2010, and Robert L. Woodson, an African-American conservative who works on community-based anti-poverty programs. Mr. Trump also met with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general who headed United States Central Command and is being considered for the post of defense secretary. The president-elect strongly praised General Mattis, who was an assertive presence on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, after talking with him for about an hour. \u201cAll I can say is he is the real deal \u2014 the real deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Asked whether General Mattis would join the administration, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s just a brilliant, wonderful man. What a career \u2014 we are going to see what happens, but he is the real deal.\u201d On Sunday, the president-elect is scheduled to meet with a similarly wide-ranging group, including Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whom he removed as the chairman of his transition team days after the election; Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has also been a contender for the secretary of state post; and Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, who has pressed aggressive measures to crack down on undocumented immigrants. The meeting schedule, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said on Saturday, \u201creally shows the reach and the depth to which we are going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAs we\u2019re working to bring the country together and move forward,\u201d Mr. Miller added in a conference call with reporters, \u201cthis shows really where his head is as the next leader of our country.\u201d On Friday, Mr. Trump moved to install Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general bent on destroying Islamic extremism, as his national security adviser, and he selected Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an immigration hard-liner, as his attorney general. Both were early supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Photo James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, after meeting with Mr. Trump on Saturday. General Mattis is being considered for the post of defense secretary. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Mr. Romney fits a decidedly different mold. Earlier this year, he said that if Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, \u201cthe prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,\u201d and he suggested that Mr. Trump was dangerous and unstable. He deplored Mr. Trump\u2019s personal qualities: \u201cthe bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics.\u201d But if he took a cabinet post, Mr. Romney could serve as a moderating influence on the hard-liners Mr. Trump has already selected, including Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas as C.I.A. director and Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist. It could also force Mr. Romney to defend administration policies he did not believe in. John Feehery, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Trump was showing \u201cgreat magnanimity\u201d by talking to Mr. Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 nominee and a former governor of Massachusetts. \u201cI think it is meant to reassure some of the establishment that he is going to reach out to them, and that\u2019s an important part of healing the party.\u201d First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

(Photo: AP) Not since Ford's Theater has so much furor erupted from a politician attending a play. With Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage who has supported diverting federal funding from HIV and AIDS groups to conversion therapy, seated in the audience for Friday night's performance of Hamilton, certain lines resonated even more than usual. Trump asks 'Hamilton' cast who 'harassed' Mike Pence to apologize Audience member Christy Colburn tweeted that when Alexander Hamiton and the Marquis de Lafayette quipped, \"Immigrants, we get the job done during The Battle of Yorktown , the crowd gave them a standing ovation. And later, during the song What Comes Next? , King George III actor Rory O'Malley had to stop the song briefly after the crowd \"went nuts\" at the line \"When your people say they hate you, don't come crawling back to me\" and ask them to stop booing. I'm at #Hamilton and so is Mike Pence. Crowd booed him like crazy, and gave a standing O at the line \"immigrants we get the job done\" 1/2 By now, you've likely seen the video from the curtain call, when\u00a0Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr,\u00a0 addressed\u00a0Pence on behalf of \"diverse Americans \u00a0who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us\" and asked the vice president-elect\u00a0to\u00a0 \"uphold our inalienable rights and work on behalf of all of us.\" President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump demanded the cast apologize for harassing Pence, but by all accounts, both Dixon and the vice president-elect were respectful of one another. In fact, Dixon even\u00a0 thanked the Indiana governor for listening \u00a0to what he had to say. @realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen. \u2014 Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016 Mike Pence actually stood and listened.  It is Trump who took to Twitter with his foolishness - typical. #BoycottHamilton \u2014 Ella-Writer (@Ella_writer) November 19, 2016 None of it persuaded Trump, who jumped on Twitter again Saturday night after a day of meetings with his transition team and high-profile guests \u00a0at his golf club in New Jersey. \"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!\" Trump wrote.\u00a0But within minutes, he deleted it. The president-elect of the United States just deleted a tweet going after a Broadway play for the 12th hour straight https://t.co/SU17q2pMBd pic.twitter.com/DPTyZsG2Q8 \u2014 Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) November 20, 2016 Even creator Lin-Manuel Miranda weighed in during a break from doing\u00a0Moana interviews in the U.K., complimenting the cast for how they handled the situation and agreeing with Trump that everyone should be welcome at the theater. Proud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016 And original cast member Christopher Jackson, who gives his last performance as George Washington Sunday , summed up his cast's statement as \"citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS with respect and clarity.\" Just LISTEN to the words! Ain't nothing but Citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS! WITH RESPECT and CLARITY! #AMENandAMEN https://t.co/J6UhrwW1FP \u2014 Christopher Jackson (@ChrisisSingin) November 19, 2016 But social media has not settled down since, erupting with hashtags like\u00a0 #BoycottHamilton . (Proponents of that movement will have to be very patient: the show is sold until September 2017.) Here is a sampling of the most viral comments on Twitter. Desperate times, desperate measures Frozen star Josh Gad , who originated the role of Elder Cunningham in The Book of Mormon, provided some context in a Twitter statement. \"I know the booing upsets some of you,\" he wrote. \"But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.\" While he says he personally wouldn't boo someone at a theater, \"this feels different. There are swastikas popping up everywhere, a cabinet of civil-rights offenders and deniers being built, and a leader who has placed a white nationalist by his side. These aren't attempts at unity. These are warning shots to everyone who isn't white, straight and extreme.\" If we're talking about apologies ... Americans don't need to apologize-not even to presidents or vice presidents-for the lawful & proper exercise of their constitutional rights. https://t.co/daN147yjkM \u2014 ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016 An apology should instead come from President-elect Trump for calling into question appropriateness of @HamiltonMusical cast's statements. \u2014 ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016 It's called misdirection Garden State's Zach Braff chalked the whole controversy up as a win for Trump, who successfully distracted the country from Friday's $25 million Trump University settlement . When you settle a fraud lawsuit for 25 million dollars but everyone's talking about Hamilton. pic.twitter.com/KFgqMJsxul \u2014 Zach Braff (@zachbraff) November 19, 2016 Anyway, doesn't the president-elect have better things to do right now? My story on Trump's fight with Hamilton https://t.co/xCX7xoPK35 pic.twitter.com/ahyPWPmNZX \u2014 Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) November 19, 2016 Psst, that's not how a boycott works Are you going to #BoycottHamilton like you Boycott Starbucks? If so, enjoy the show! \u2014 Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) November 19, 2016 But if you're looking to unload tickets you already have, there are plenty of takers So uh if you're gonna #BoycottHamilton , can I have your tickets?  I didn't realize speaking with respect was considered harassing in 2016. ",

The rocket is scheduled to launch at 5:42 p.m., on Saturday.

The rocket is scheduled to launch at 5:42 p.m., on Saturday. (Malcolm Denemark / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The most advanced weather satellite ever built rocketed into space Saturday night, part of an $11 billion effort to revolutionize forecasting and save lives. This new GOES-R spacecraft will track U.S. weather as never before: hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, lightning storms, even solar flares. Indeed, about 50 TV meteorologists from around the country converged on the launch site \u2014 including NBC's Al Roker \u2014 along with 8,000 space program workers and guests. \"What's so exciting is that we're going to be getting more data, more often, much more detailed, higher resolution,\" Roker said. In the case of tornadoes, \"if we can give people another 10, 15, 20 minutes, we're talking about lives being saved.\" Think superhero speed and accuracy for forecasting. Super high-definition TV, versus black-and-white. \"Really a quantum leap above any satellite NOAA has ever flown,\" said Stephen Volz, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's director of satellites. \"For the American public, that will mean faster, more accurate weather forecasts and warnings,\" Volz said earlier in the week. \"That also will mean more lives saved and better environmental intelligence\" for government officials responsible for hurricane and other evacuations. Weather Satellite Malcolm Denemark / AP Cell phones light up the beaches of Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, Fla., north of the Cocoa Beach Pier as spectators watch the launch of the NOAA GOES-R weather satellite, Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. It was launched from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a ULA Atlas V rocket.

Improved forecasting will help pilots avoid bad weather and help rocket scientists know when to call off a launch. The first in a series of four high-tech satellites, GOES-R hitched a ride on an unmanned Atlas V rocket, delayed an hour by rocket and other problems. NOAA teamed up with NASA for the mission. The satellite \u2014 valued by NOAA at $1 billion \u2014 is aiming for a 22,300-mile-high equatorial orbit. There, it will join three aging spacecraft with 40-year-old technology, and become known as GOES-16. After months of testing, this newest satellite will take over for one of the older ones. The second satellite in the series will follow in 2018. All told, the series should stretch to 2036. GOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The first was launched in 1975.

    "text": "Rep. Danny Davis' grandson shot dead over shoes in Chicago Published               November 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print FILE 2009: U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill. announces that he will run for re-election to this 7th congressional seat in Chicago. \u00a0(AP) A dispute over shoes led to the fatal shooting of the grandson of Illinois U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, Chicago police said Saturday. At least two attackers went to the home of 15-year-old Jovan Wilson in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago on Friday night and shot him in the head after an argument, police said. \"This stems from a dispute over shoes, basketball shoes,\" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Guglielmi said Wilson knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point. The shooting was not, as previously reported, a home invasion. \"Young people are using guns to settle petty disputes over clothes,\" Guglielmi said. Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides, with August being the deadliest month in the city in two decades. There have been 673 homicides so far this year, including the fatal shootings of the cousin of Chicago Bull Dwyane Wade, a Chicago police officer's son and the son of a famed percussionist. Davis said in a statement that Wilson's mother was not at home, but Wilson's uncle and three siblings were. \"I grieve for my family. I grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger,\" Davis said in a statement. \"I grieve for his family, his parents, his friends.\" Police have not arrested anyone or named any suspects, but Guglielmi said investigators have good leads. Davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th Congressional District and is a former Chicago alderman, was in Chicago on Friday and spoke with reporters after talking to police. He wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he'd continue to try to combat gun violence. Davis described his grandson to the newspaper as a \"typical 15-year-old\" who liked music and basketball, someone who \"knew all about ... the stats of different players.\" But Davis also said he recognized that Chicago's violence problem could affect his family.

He said he will convene a hearing at the earliest opportunity. \"Since Admiral Rogers was appointed as NSA Director in April 2014, I have been consistently impressed with his leadership and accomplishments,\" Nunes said in the letter, adding \"I know other members of Congress hold him in similarly high esteem.\" Current and former intelligence officials have previously told NBC News that Rogers is extremely unpopular among the NSA workforce because of a re-organization he has implemented, and also because he is frequently away from the office. Morale at the spy agency, which was crushed by the Snowden leaks, slipped further over the last year, say people familiar with the situation. The NSA director took personal leave and traveled to Manhattan on Thursday, where he met with Trump at Trump Tower. Afterward, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was a leading candidate to be the next director of national intelligence. Related: Top Officials Want to Split Cyber Command From NSA NBC News has reported that Carter and Clapper are in favor of a plan to split NSA from Cyber Command. It's unclear whether the Obama administration will seek to carry out that split in the time it has remaining. While the CIA gets more attention, the majority of intelligence that goes to the president each day, officials have long said, comes from NSA eavesdropping and hacking around the world.

The easiest way to forge ahead, many are finding, is to disassociate the man from the policy. \u201cI will do everything I can to help him,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina, who has refused on numerous other occasions to help Mr. Trump, including voting for him or attending the Republican National Convention . Mr. Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill this week that he believed he could work with Mr. Trump on issues like the military budget, which both men support expanding. Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group supported by David and Charles Koch that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help Mitt Romney in 2012, is also cracking the door to Mr. Trump. The group, however, declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the Republican Congress working with the new president,\u201d said Tim Phillips, Americans for Prosperity\u2019s president, citing the prospect of repealing some of President Obama\u2019s energy policies along with the Affordable Care Act. But as with any period of grief, acceptance comes in different ways. Some find catharsis in writing. Others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong. Then there are those who still talk as if they are in mourning: They have good days and bad days. \u201cLife goes on,\u201d said Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor and leading \u201cNever Trump\u201d stalwart, who has written columns about his coming to terms with President-elect Trump.

And they are already preparing for battles over Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cunleash\u201d coal, oil and gas production \u2014 much of it on public land. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the unknowns and political variables are huge, too. Mr. Trump himself, while promising to push resource extraction, has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations. History also suggests that changing lands policy is not so easy. President George W. Bush, a Republican, tried to change direction with new agency rules, only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions. Automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their blue-collar glory. And the cost of managing federal lands, especially in fighting wildfires \u2014 $2.1 billion last year , a record total, matched by the most acres burned in at least 30 years \u2014 continues to soar, threatening communities even as many of them look for new direction from the White House in how those lands are managed. \u201cWe have a huge and growing inventory of timber in the forests, and they\u2019re going to decompose or burn, and nobody has addressed that,\u201d said Robert H. Nelson, a professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and a former economic analyst for the Interior Department. \u201cThere\u2019s bipartisan consensus that the federal lands system is dysfunctional,\u201d he said. Photo A lumber yard outside Sweet Home, Ore. Logging industry officials said that employment could grow under a Trump administration, but that changes at the federal level would have to be profound to make a difference. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times But the hopes, and the fears, about how that system might now change are boundless. \u201cMy big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in San Juan County and these rural areas,\u201d said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner in southern Utah, where antigovernment feelings run as deep as the slot canyons. \u201cYou just feel like everything has been stifled with regulations.\u201d At the Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group focusing on the Rocky Mountain region, legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready for an onslaught of anti-environmental policy, and we\u2019re arming up to litigate,\u201d said Erik Molvar, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe Trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past 40 years.\u201d In the decades-long struggle for control of America\u2019s public lands, the Obama years were a flush time for conservation groups. The administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the Grand Canyon and blocked new coal leases. Public lands were also adapted for new uses on Mr. Obama\u2019s watch, notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical significance, and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in Nevada. Conservatives who loathed those regulations \u2014 or new uses \u2014 are now hoping Mr. Trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor. Republicans in Congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect wilderness, water quality, endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments. Some conservatives hope Mr. Trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to states, which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals. To see where change may come the quickest, look to the edges of Glacier National Park in Montana, at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. In March, the Obama administration capped a three-decade fight over oil and gas drilling in the area, called the Badger-Two Medicine, by canceling a Louisiana energy company\u2019s lease on 6,000 acres.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 19, 2016 1:09 PM EST Steve Bannon, the chief strategist and right-hand man to President-elect Donald Trump, denied in an interview that he was an advocate of white nationalism -- and gave hints instead about how his brand of \u201ceconomic\u201d nationalism will shake up Washington. In The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon, the controversial former head of Breitbart News who went on to chair Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, discussed why he believed his candidate won the election. \u201cI\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist,\u201d Bannon told the news outlet earlier this week. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f\u2014ed over.\u201d Bannon\u2019s appointment to the White House has drawn criticism from Democrats and several civil liberties groups, in part because of his (and Breitbart\u2019s) strong association with the alt-right , a political movement with strains of white supremacy. In the past, the former Breitbart CEO has admitted the alt-right\u2019s connections to racist and anti-Semitic agendas. \u201cLook, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,\u201d Bannon told Mother Jones in August. \u201cAre there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that\u2019s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.\u201d In the Reporter interview, Bannon challenged the notion that racialized overtones dominated the Trump campaign on the trail. He predicted that if the administration delivered on its election promises, \u201cwe\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s everything related to jobs,\u201d Bannon said and seemingly bragged about how he was going to drive conservatives \u201ccrazy\u201d with his \u201ctrillion-dollar infrastructure plan.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up,\u201d he proposed. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\u201d Bannon, in the Reporter interview, also gave some insight into how he viewed his political foes (presumably, liberals and the media) -- and the \u201cdarkness\u201d he touts in fighting against them. \u201cDarkness is good,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cDick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That\u2019s power. It only helps us when they...get it wrong. When they\u2019re blind to who we are and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Trump Holds Meetings With Mitt Romney, Michelle Rhee and Others By Katherine Faulders BEDMINSTER, N.J. \u0097 Nov 19, 2016, 3:29 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President-elect Trump Expected To Meet with Mitt Romney 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is at his estate and golf club in Bedminister, New Jersey, this weekend for a string of appointments with high-profile figures, including the former GOP presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney . Romney arrived for his meeting with Trump and members of his transition team at the Trump National Golf Club about 1 p.m. and left shortly before 2:30 p.m. As he and Trump emerged from the meeting, the president-elect did not approach the press, but, responding to shouted questions, told reporters the meeting \"went great.\" Romney made a brief statement to the media, saying the meeting focused on foreign affairs. He said he \"looks forward\" to a Trump administration, but would not comment on whether he wants to be a part of it. \"We had a far-reaching conversation with regard to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance. We discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics,\u201d Romney said. Romney did not respond to shouted questions regarding potential cabinet positions and would not answer questions regarding his previous statements calling Trump a \"con man\" and a \"fraud.\" Sources on Trump\u2019s transition team told ABC News on Thursday that Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is under consideration for secretary of state. One senior-level source directly involved in the transition efforts said that Saturday\u2019s meeting is also about \u201cmending fences,\u201d as Trump and Romney have had a contentious relationship. Trump also met with well-known education activist Michelle Rhee and her husband, Kevin Johnson, mayor of Sacramento; Betsy DeVos, another education activist; and with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis. Meetings were also set with Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts; anti-poverty advocate Bob Woodson; restaurant executive Andy Puzder; Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg; and biotechnology billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, according to transition officials. After the meeting with Mattis, who is viewed as a possible contender to be nominated for defense secretary, Trump said, \"He is the real deal, a brilliant wonderful man, what a career. We'll see what happens. He is the real deal.\" Rhee is a possible contender for nomination as education secretary. Mike Segar/Reuters President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence stand together as they arrive at the the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Nov. 19, 2016. President-Elect Donald Trump Taps Michael Flynn for National Security Adviser Trump is meeting with people under consideration for cabinet posts and individuals from whom the president-elect is simply seeking advice and counsel, transition officials said. ABC News was told that senior members of Trump\u2019s transition team will join him in the meetings at the Trump National Golf Club, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence; Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , who will be Trump's chief of staff; Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway; Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer; transition team communications director Jason Miller; and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. Transition officials also said there may be an announcement this afternoon on a nomination for a cabinet post in the area of national security . When Trump and Pence arrived at the golf club at around 11 a.m., a reporter shouted a question asking if the president-elect was looking forward to the meetings today. Both Trump and Pence answered in the positive. It was the first question from the press that Trump has answered since his interview on CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" on Nov. 10, two days after the election. Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo The clubhouse of Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey, is pictured, Nov. 18, 2016, before the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s meetings are expected to continue Sunday with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, among others, transition officials said. Kobach, one of the president-elect\u2019s advisers on immigration, is known as an immigration hardliner. He told Reuters recently that Trump's policy advisers had discussed drafting a proposal for the president-elect\u2019s consideration that would reinstate a national registry for visitors and immigrants from Muslim countries. Kobach also said in the interview that Trump's immigration team has discussed drafting executive orders \"so that Trump and the Department of Homeland Security hit the ground running.\" But on Friday, the spokesman for the transition team on Friday emphasized that Trump is not advocating any kind of broader registry for Muslims. \u201cPresident-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false. The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama Administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the president-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in,\u201d said Jason Miller, the transition team's communications director. ABC News\u2019 John Santucci and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. 0 Shares ",
