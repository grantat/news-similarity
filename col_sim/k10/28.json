(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports) San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick attempted to clear the air over remarks he made about Fidel Castro. Kaepernick had been questioned by the Miami Herald 's Armando Salguero a little more than week ago on why he wore a shirt with Castro\u2019s image on it during a news conference in August. In the postgame press conference following the 49ers\u2019 31-24 loss to the Miami Dolphins, Kaepernick was asked about his remarks, which were interpreted by some as a sign of support for the longtime leader of Cuba. \"What I said was I agree with the investment in education,\" Kaepernick said. \"I also agree with the investment in free universal health care, as well as the involvement in helping end apartheid in South Africa.\" NFL playoff picture: How Sunday's action will shape field Kaepernick continued by saying some people misinterpreted his comments. \"Trying to push the false narrative that I was a supporter of the oppressive things he [Castro] did is just not true,\" Kaepernick said. \"I said I support the investment in education, I never said I support the oppressive things he [Castro] did.\" Kaepernick was quoted by the Herald as saying Castro did help create the \"highest literacy rate because they invest more in their educational system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here [United States] even though we're fully capable of doing that.\" Castro died Friday, just a week after Kaepernick spoke with Salguero. When Kaepernick took the field in Miami on Sunday, he was booed. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 12 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives at the government palace in Lima, Peru, on Nov. 21, 2016. (Ernesto Arias / European Pressphoto Agency) Jonathan Kaiman and Jessica Meyers Contact Reporter Just months ago, world leaders were fretting over the threat posed by an increasingly assertive China. The country\u2019s\u00a0government oversaw the worst crackdown on dissent in nearly three decades. The Chinese\u00a0built, then militarized, islands in disputed waters of the South China Sea. They tightened controls over the Internet, freezing out foreign firms while allowing their domestic competitors to prosper.\u00a0 Then the United\u00a0States\u00a0elected Donald Trump as president. Now some of those same countries are looking to Beijing to defend international cooperation on matters as diverse as trade and climate change, propelling\u00a0China to new heights on the world stage. And yet China doesn\u2019t sound particularly enthused about its elevation. The Global Times, a Communist Party mouthpiece, this week called it \u201cbeyond imagination to think that China could replace the U.S. to lead the world.\u201d\u00a0 The 21st Century Business Herald, China\u2019s leading business newspaper, referred to the country as \u201ca promoter, a reformer, not a revolutionary.\u201d\u00a0 China \"wants to be a force of stability,\u201d said Min Ye, an associate professor at Boston University\u2019s Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. \u201cBut it\u2019s not into changing the global order. It's a big responsibility \u2026 China still sees itself as a growing power.\u201d \u00a0 Donald Trump comes under unusual pressure to choose his secretary of State Nov. 27, 2016, 7:29 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now: Trump warned supporters will feel betrayed if he picks Mitt... (Matt Pearce) China, whose leaders\u2019 greatest concern is domestic stability, is also battling a slowing economy and rampant income inequality at home. \u201cFactor one is whether China has the capacity to be leader, and factor two is whether China has the willingness to be leader,\u201d said Chen Dingding, professor of international relations at Jinan University in Guangzhou.\u00a0 \u201cIf the U.S. \u2014\u00a0No. 1 power \u2014 not interested in global leadership, why should China be?\u201d \u00a0 The election of a U.S. president who takes an inward and sometimes\u00a0contradictory approach to foreign policy has already handed China major geopolitical wins, analysts say.\u00a0 The president-elect\u2019s vow to block President Obama \u2019s signature trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, has drawn some countries\u00a0closer to\u00a0China\u2019s economic orbit. Malaysia, once a backer of the 12-nation free trade deal, is shifting its focus to a Chinese alternative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Vietnam recently decided not to ratify the U.S.-backed agreement, leaving an opening for China\u2019s pact. Even longtime American ally Australia plans to seek out other\u00a0trade options. Obama saw the TPP \u2014 which excluded China \u2014 as vital to expanding America\u2019s influence in the region. China considered it a blatant attempt to contain its growing economic and political clout. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the pact \u201cleaves a gap,\u201d said Claire Reade, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u00a0\u201cIs China going to walk into that gap to encourage regional and global integration? I think the answer is yes.\u201d President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria.

In a brief, presumably\u00a0final, face-to-face encounter, President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria. The night before, Obama sat with his Chinese... (Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons) The region\u2019s pivot toward China on economic matters\u00a0hurts the\u00a0United States\u2019\u00a0ability to shape developments on the political front.\u00a0The U.S. typically ties its international aid and loans to causes such as gender equality, government transparency and\u00a0human rights\u00a0\u2014 issues on which China\u2019s authoritarian leaders rarely engage. \u00a0 \u201cU.S. hegemony is not great, but it's the best hegemony we've had in a long time,\u201d said David Zweig, a Canadian who researches Sino-American relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. China has reason to defend globalization. Although Beijing has chafed at perceived U.S. incursions, including criticism of its human rights record and U.S. naval operations in the South China Sea, it\u00a0has benefited greatly from closer economic cooperation with the rest of the world.\u00a0The struggling country that entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 has grown\u00a0into the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u00a0 While Trump has been promoting his \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform, China has\u00a0sought to reassure world leaders about its reliability and consistency on international matters. \u201cChina will not shut the door to the outside world but will open it even wider,\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping said Nov. 20 at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.\u00a0 Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin last week dismissed Trump\u2019s assertion that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d invented by China to destroy U.S. competitiveness and pledged to defend a landmark agreement to fight global warming \u201cwhatever the circumstances.\u201d This year, China opened the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Beijing-based rival to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country has also greatly expanded its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, which aims to revive ancient Silk Road trade routes by building roads, ports and other infrastructure across\u00a0Asia, Europe and North Africa.\u00a0 Nations far outside China\u2019s regional\u00a0sphere of influence are paying heed.

Negotiators from nearly 200 countries wrapped up two weeks of talks Saturday vowing to press ahead with the fight against climate change \u2014 with or without the help of the next U.S. president.

(Alexandra Zavis and Mythili Sampathkumar) In 2012, China struck a deal with 16 Central and Eastern European countries\u00a0to deepen\u00a0economic, tourism and education ties. That framework has encouraged Eastern European countries\u00a0to see China as \u201csort of a savior\u201d\u00a0in difficult economic\u00a0times,\u00a0when there is a need for investment that the West cannot provide, said Anastas Vangeli, a sociologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences. China\u2019s economic rise, combined with the shock of the recent global financial crisis and the wave of populism now sweeping the U.S. and Europe, has\u00a0some\u00a0people in the region\u00a0questioning the virtues of Western-style democracy. \u201cWhen you take a lot of people who don\u2019t know much about China, and you show them snatches of Beijing and Shanghai, they get fascinated with it,\u201d Vangeli said. \u201cOften in their statements, they say things like, \u2018Maybe China got some things right.\u2019\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

Ted Cruz , reflecting on his Republican primary fight against now President-elect Donald Trump , emphasized that he wants to help the incoming administration succeed but did not disown his claim during the campaign that Trump was a \"pathological liar.\" ABC News' Martha Raddatz asked Cruz today on \"This Week\" about his remark during the GOP primary that Trump \"lies\" with \"practically every word\" out of his mouth and is \"utterly amoral.\" Asked about those comments, Cruz said, \"I'm not going to re-litigate the past. I\u2019m going to focus on the future. I\u2019m going to focus on what\u2019s in front of us.\" \"It was a hard-fought campaign,\" Cruz said of the primary race. \"It was hard-fought on all sides and it was vigorous until the end. But at the end of the day, the people have spoken. He won the election. He won the nomination and he won the general election in convincing manner. And my focus is on the country. My focus is we have a new president. We have a mandate,\" Cruz said. Cruz ended his presidential bid May 3 and has taken steps to mend a relationship with Trump. He ultimately endorsed the Trump-Pence ticket and campaigned for them. Last week, he met in Trump Tower with the president-elect and some speculated he was on the short list to be Trump's pick for attorney general. Trump ultimately chose Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions . Cruz told Raddatz that he is committed to helping the Trump administration. But the Texas senator cautioned that with Republicans about to control both the White House and Congress, they must deliver on their promises to voters or \"there'll be pitchforks and torches in the street.\" \"What I\u2019m going to work to do every day is to try to work closely with the new president, with the new administration and with my colleagues in Congress to deliver on what we promised. I've got to say, if we don\u2019t, if we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there\u2019ll be pitchforks and torches in the street, and I think quite rightly,\" he said. \"This election was a mandate [for] change and the most catastrophic thing Republicans could do is go back to business as usual,\" Cruz said. Cruz called Trump's picks so far for top administration posts an \"impressive, serious team.\" Asked if former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani or former GOP presidential nominee and Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney would be a better secretary of state, Cruz praised both. \"That\u2019s a question for the president-elect to decide. Obviously, whoever he nominates is going to be subject to confirmation in the Senate , and we\u2019re going to consider fairly any nominee who comes forth. I think both Rudy and Mitt are good capable serious men. I know them both. I respect them both, and I think the fact that we are talking about two individuals of that caliber really reflects what we\u2019re seeing in the Trump administration which is this is a team of all stars that are coming together,\" Cruz said. 0 Shares ",

Conway says she will support whomever Trump picks, but continues to argue that the grass-roots supporters who backed his improbable victory feel let down about Romney, considering he called Trump a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d \"People feel betrayed to think that \u2026 Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump \u2026 would be given the most significant Cabinet post of all,\u201d Conway said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\u201d Trump, a Republican, and his team of advisers appear to be split on whether Trump should pick Romney, a former GOP presidential nominee, or former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, an early Trump loyalist. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d downplayed rumors over vicious infighting over who will lead the State Department, saying that Trump's \"going to make the best decision for the American people.\u201d However, Conway, openly talking outside the confines of transition headquarters in New York\u2019s Trump Tower, suggests a clear divide.

But I'm not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position. I think there are concerns that those of us that are loyal have, and we want a secretary of state who's loyal to the president.\" This is not the first time that Conway, who emerged late in the White House race to lead the Trump campaign to victory, has made her thoughts known about Romney. On Thursday, she tweeted: \u201cReceiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state.\u201d On Sunday, Conway, now a senior adviser for the Trump transition team, said on Twitter that she has privately expressed her thoughts to Trump and that she\u2019ll respect his decision. However, the larger \u201cpoint is the volume & intensity of grass-roots resistance to Romney is breathtaking,\u201d she also tweeted. Advertisement ",

(Suffolk County Police Department) A suburban New York family\u2019s happy Thanksgiving celebration turned into a horror when a man broke into their home and assaulted an elderly relative, WCBS-TV reports. The family had just gone to bed Thursday when cops say Jeffrey Rice slipped into the home in Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island\u2019s north shore through an unlocked door and grabbed a knife. Police said Rice then sneaked upstairs, where he attacked the homeowner\u2019s 85-year-old aunt with his fists. The woman had just fallen asleep in a bedroom she was sharing with her 7-year-old grandniece, the daughter of the 37-year-old homeowner and his wife. The wife, 35, told the station what happened. GUN-TOTING GRANDMOTHER FOILS HOME INVASION; 3 ARRESTED \u201cMy daughter was in the room and escaped, ran downstairs and told my in-laws to call 911, which I had already done from upstairs,\u201d she said. The woman said she and her husband tried to grab the knife. She said they eventually subdued the intruder with the help of her brother and brother-ion-law. \u201cHe was definitely on drugs, maybe PCP or something,\u201d she told the station. \u201cHe was completely hallucinating.

    "text": "Trump Makes Baseless Claim That 'Millions' Voted Illegally, Costing Him Popular Vote By Katherine Faulders Nov 27, 2016, 10:36 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Lashes Out at Election Recount Efforts of Jill Stein 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump spent his Sunday lashing out against the movement to force general election vote recounts in three states that were critical to his Electoral College victory, but he is now alleging that \"millions of people\" voted illegally, costing him the popular vote. \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump inaccurately claimed in a tweet, alleging -- without any factual basis to make the claim -- that millions of people voted for Hillary Clinton illegally. Clinton currently leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes. In subsequent tweets Trump said \"It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 -- states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" In one tweet, he named Virginia, New Hampshire and California as three states with \"serious voter fraud.\" In none of the tweets did Trump point to any evidence of voter fraud to account for his claim and no other evidence of his assertion has emerged since the election. ABC News reached out for comment to election officials in the three states Trump named, but had not received a response Sunday evening. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla denied Trump's claim about illegal voting in his state, calling them \"unsubstantiated allegations\" in a tweet Sunday night. \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect,\" he tweeted. The Trump transition team had not responded Sunday evening to a request for evidence Trump may be citing in his claims. Kay Stimson, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State, said they \"have no information that can help to explain what sources or information are behind the basis of the tweets\" by Trump. Kellyanne Conway Slams Mitt Romney: He Went 'Out of His Way' to Hurt Trump The Clinton campaign's general counsel Marc Elias tweeted Sunday night that \"We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn't ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud.\" Elias announced Saturday in a post on Medium that the campaign would participate in the recount efforts, but is not seeking to cast any doubt on the Electoral College results, adding they have not found \"any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,\" after looking into the matter. In a tweet-storm Sunday morning, Trump attacked the Green Party-backed efforts to recount the vote in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania this weekend, calling the effort 'sad,' while criticizing the Clinton campaign's participation in the effort. \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\" Trump tweeted. A senior administration official told ABC News Saturday there did not appear to be any malicious activity related to the vote count, and remained confident regarding the overall assessment of the election's integrity. \"The Federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting out electoral process on election day ,\" the official said. \"As we have noted before, we remained confident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out on election day. As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.\" Jill Stein and the Green Party said Friday they raised more than $4 million in three days to support recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three key battleground states where Trump narrowly defeated Clinton. Stein has maintained her activities are in no way intended to benefit Clinton, whom she leveled strong criticisms against during the 2016 election. George Martin, a former co-chair of the Wisconsin Green Party who's involved in Stein's recount effort, said the party has been approached by computer scientists, election lawyers and other experts advocating vote recounts because of what they see as persuasive evidence of tampered election results.

He said the recounts are not to change the outcome of the results but are rather a check and balance on the process of counting votes.

Telesis Academy Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times Teacher Maryellen Whittingham was worried about Giuliana Tapia, 5, who entered her kindergarten class at the Telesis Academy in West Covina far behind other students, unable to recognize letters or sing the alphabet. Teacher Maryellen Whittingham was worried about Giuliana Tapia, 5, who entered her kindergarten class at the Telesis Academy in West Covina far behind other students, unable to recognize letters or sing the alphabet. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Teresa Watanabe Giuliana Tapia was way behind her classmates. She was just 5 years old, starting kindergarten at Telesis Academy of Science and Math in West Covina. At\u00a0a\u00a0kindergarten screening\u00a0two months before her first day,\u00a0she happily chattered about her dog Toodles, her favorite color pink, her Santa Claus pajamas, her nickname Gigi, her outings with dad to see SpongeBob SquarePants movies. But many of her 21 classmates already knew most of the alphabet, colors and shapes. Two of them could even read all 100 words\u00a0\u2014 at, the, there, like\u00a0\u2014 that\u00a0kindergartners are expected to know by the end of the year. About half\u00a0had been to preschool; Giuliana had not. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she\u00a0said when she was asked to identify letters on a sheet of paper.\u00a0 Kindergartner Giuliana Tapia struggles to write her name on the first day of school in Maryellen Whittingham's class at the Telesis Academy.

(Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Then, anxiously, \u201cBut that\u2019s OK, right?\u201d Giuliana is not atypical\u00a0of Latino children, who have the lowest rates of preschool attendance among all racial and ethnic groups. A 2015 UC Berkeley study of 4,550 children nationwide found that although\u00a0Latino children\u00a0showed roughly the same level of language comprehension as their\u00a0white peers at 9 months old, four-fifths had fallen up to 5 months behind by the time they were 2. The study found that\u00a0only 28% of the Mexican American mothers who spoke\u00a0English at home, as Giuliana\u2019s mother does, read to their children daily, compared with 59% of white mothers. No preschool. No daily stories read out loud.\u00a0Could Giuliana catch up? *** Giuliana is the firstborn child of Arturo and Anna Tapia, who have showered her with love and family time \u2014\u00a0outings to beaches and mountains, Disneyland and SeaWorld, movies and the zoo.\u00a0And they worked to\u00a0develop\u00a0her social and verbal skills, eschewing baby talk.

(Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) But the Tapias did not read to her at home, take her to the library or teach her the alphabet. A relative who teaches kindergarten had urged preschool for Giuliana, but the Tapias were\u00a0protective.\u00a0\u201cWe thought she was going to stay little forever,\u201d Arturo Tapia said. The La Puente couple \u2014 she a debt collector, he a salesman\u00a0\u2014 had not gone\u00a0to preschool themselves or finished college; their\u00a0own\u00a0parents are immigrants from Mexico with middle-school educations. \u201cI just didn\u2019t realize how important it was to introduce her to [literacy]\u00a0prior to starting kindergarten,\u201d Anna said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, she\u2019ll learn as she goes.\u2019 \u201d On the first day of kindergarten last year, they\u00a0saw their mistake. Other children were writing their names and reciting the alphabet. Giuliana only recognized X, learned from watching \u201cDora the Explorer.\u201d She could count\u00a0only to 14. She didn\u2019t know all of her shapes and couldn\u2019t recognize her written name. Giuliana stands at the head of the line, ready to lead her fellow students back to the classroom.

Giuliana stands at the head of the line, ready to lead her fellow students back to the classroom. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) The Tapias\u00a0felt guilty\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and anxious. Would the other children make fun of their girl? Giuliana\u00a0seemed happy\u00a0in her purple school uniform and hair bow.\u00a0Her\u00a0classroom was cheerful, with shelves of\u00a0books\u00a0and stuffed animals.\u00a0There were bins filled with plastic dinosaurs, Lego pieces and toys\u00a0for counting; colorful\u00a0bulletin boards featured numbers, letters, days of\u00a0the week and months of the year.\u00a0Maris, Crystal and Giana seemed like they\u2019d make nice friends. Giuliana\u2019s\u00a0teacher, Maryellen\u00a0Whittingham, was soft and smiley and told the kids to call her Mom or Grandma if they forgot her long name. She read them a\u00a0book in a singsong voice about a teacher named Miss Bindergarten, taught them a counting rhyme\u00a0with an alligator puppet\u00a0and let them get up and wiggle when they got restless. But when the children sang their ABCs, Giuliana did not join in, even when a classmate said, \u201cSing!\u201d She\u00a0played\u00a0with her hair and wandered away\u00a0from her spot in the group. Months later, she\u00a0said she\u2019d been scared.\u00a0 \u00a0*** Whittingham thought Telesis Academy could help Giuliana catch up to her classmates, but not on its own \u2014 her parents would have to step it up, she told them.

Whittingham thought Telesis Academy could help Giuliana catch up to her classmates, but not on its own \u2014 her parents would have to step it up, she told them. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Whittingham is a literacy specialist with more than two decades of\u00a0experience.\u00a0She\u00a0quickly spots children who need extra help.\u00a0 Giuliana worried her a bit. \u201cYikes,\u201d she thought, \u201cthat\u2019s a blank slate.\u201d The kindergarten class was about 80% Latino and overwhelmingly low-income, and relatively few parents had gone to college. About half the children were learning English. Giuliana wasn\u2019t the only one behind, but many\u00a0of her classmates at least knew most of the alphabet. In the six years since Telesis opened,\u00a0a\u00a0top-notch staff had transformed what had been\u00a0a struggling middle school with declining enrollment into an award-winning K-8 campus. The Rowland Unified School District campus \u2014 a member of a national network called called \u201cNo Excuses University\u201d \u2014\u00a0was\u00a0committed to high expectations, teaching\u00a0values\u00a0and college preparation.\u00a0Staff collaborated and used testing and data to shape teaching. Telesis could help Giuliana,\u00a0Whittingham felt,\u00a0but not on its own. At her first parent meeting a few months into the school year,\u00a0she\u00a0told the Tapias they needed to step up.\u00a0Giuliana still\u00a0was lagging behind. She\u00a0knew only three target words and could not write sentences. Her parents were ready\u00a0for\u00a0drastic action. \u201cI said I was going to stop going out,\u201d Anna\u00a0Tapia recalled. \u201cAll I\u2019m going to do is sit down and read to her and study high-frequency words.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Whittingham\u00a0said.\u00a0Keep living your life, but\u00a0also create\u00a0a richly literate environment. \u00a0 Put alphabet magnets on the refrigerator. Make word flashcards to read in the car. Write letters and have\u00a0Giuliana\u00a0trace them. Point out words on menus: \u201cH in hamburger.\u201d Spell on\u00a0outings: \u201cz-o-o.\u201d Read every night. It seemed\u00a0straightforward, but the new regimen was challenging.\u00a0 Giuliana watches and listens with her classmates during story time. Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times Giuliana watches and listens with her classmates during story time. Giuliana watches and listens with her classmates during story time. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Giuliana got frustrated. She\u00a0wrote her letters backward. She\u00a0let her younger brother distract her.\u00a0She said, bursting into tears,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u00a0 Sometimes, Arturo Tapia lost patience and began to raise his voice.\u00a0But not his wife, he says.\u00a0 Anna quizzed Giuliana everywhere they went \u2014\u00a0\u201cWhat is s-t-o-p?\u201d \u2014\u00a0and made her write down the words when she got home. She\u00a0insisted\u00a0her daughter write in\u00a0a journal every day. She bought her books and school supplies instead of toys.\u00a0 \u201cI honestly felt it was my fault she was at that level,\u201d Anna said. \u201cSo now I had to do my part to help her.\u201d A breakthrough came\u00a0in December, when Giuliana came home singing several new songs she had\u00a0learned for the school\u2019s winter concert. Her mother noticed her ease in remembering the words. At\u00a0Whittingham\u2019s suggestion, she came up with a song to help Giuliana memorize how to spell her name. It worked beautifully. Later that month, Giuliana began writing sentences: \u201cI see stocking full of toys.\u201d\u00a0At the sight of them, her mother cried. A breakthrough came in December for Giuliana, when she used a song to memorize how to spell her name and began writing sentences.

(Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) *** In class, Whittingham was teaching kindergartners what used to be first-grade work: three-to-five sentence essays that stay on topic and give details, with correct punctuation and words spelled phonetically.\u00a0 Two years ago, the school district nearly tripled the number of words it expected them to\u00a0know from 36 to 100. The more ambitious learning goals are driven by the Common Core academic standards \u2014\u00a0adopted by more than 40 states since 2010 \u2014\u00a0that are\u00a0supposed to better prepare\u00a0students for college and careers. Now when Whittingham\u00a0reads\u00a0a book to her kindergartners, she questions them\u00a0about the cover and title, the author and illustrator, the problem and solution, the setting and characters. During one visit, she read two versions of \u201cThe\u00a0Three Little Pigs\u201d\u00a0so they could compare and contrast the texts. \u201cTwenty\u00a0years ago, we read books just for the joy of reading,\u201d Whittingham said wistfully. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re rushing kids to grow up.\u201d She\u00a0works to raise performance but not anxiety.\u00a0She models everything: using scissors, drawing figures, writing letters, even\u00a0making mistakes. Once, she deliberately messed up a letter. \u201cI can cry. I can make a big X. Or I can be proud and keep going,\u201d she told the class. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make a mistake, you\u2019re not learning anything new.\u201d Parents who expect perfection hold their children back, she said, by making them afraid to try new things and so\u00a0develop skills.\u00a0 *** In class, Whittingham was teaching kindergartners what used to be first-grade work: three-to-five sentence essays.

Whittingham\u2019s entire class \u2014 including those who started as limited English speakers \u2014\u00a0had moved from the lowest two of four reading levels to the highest, an achievement Telesis Principal Johan Schmitz\u00a0called \u201cphenomenal.\u201d By June, 90% had reached English fluency, and every\u00a0student had reached or exceeded grade level for all\u00a0other milestones in reading and math.\u00a0 Whittingham credits\u00a0their parents\u2019 willingness to take\u00a0her suggestions to heart and diligently work with their children. \u201cWhat makes the biggest difference is parent support and enforcing high expectations,\u201d Whittingham says. \u201cIf we have that, we can overcome language barriers and socioeconomic differences.\u201d That message appears to be\u00a0spreading. A new\u00a0Stanford University study\u00a0found that the stubborn\u00a0academic gap between white\u00a0and Latino kindergartners had narrowed between 1998 and 2010. A companion study suggested\u00a0why: Low-income\u00a0parents\u00a0in that time\u00a0had started reading more to their children, taking them on more enriching outings\u00a0and\u00a0getting them\u00a0books\u00a0and\u00a0home computers.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Nov 27, 2016 5:12 PM EST President-elect Donald Trump is alleging that he would have won the nation\u2019s popular vote if it weren\u2019t for the \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally,\u201d during a series of tweets in which he panned the recount efforts that could take place soon in three states . Mr. Trump expressed his feelings Sunday afternoon on the \u201cso-called popular vote\u201d on Twitter: In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-- \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 The president-elect has not provided any evidence for these claims. Mr. Trump won the electoral vote earlier this month by a wide margin, beating out Clinton with 290 votes compared to her 232. But according to the latest count by the Cook Political Report, which regularly updates its popular vote tally, Mr. Trump is currently losing that vote by over 2.2 million. The president-elect\u2019s tweetstorm comes as he continues to criticize the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein for her attempts to initiate vote audits in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Stein\u2019s vote recount efforts are motivated, in part, because of fears that illegal votes were cast for Trump due to hacking or other fraudulent activity. Earlier this weekend, the Clinton campaign announced it would participate in the recount effort in Wisconsin, where paperwork has already been filed, and would do the same in the other two states if they follow suit. The president-elect\u2019s latest claim seems to contradicts his previous assertions in the days immediately following the general election, when he called the contest \u201cvery open and successful.\u201d Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Matt Rourke/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers her concession speech in New York on Nov. 9. Her campaign announced Saturday it will back recount efforts in three states. Matt Rourke/AP Hillary Clinton's campaign said Saturday it will participate in the recount efforts in Wisconsin spearheaded by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. If Stein also pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, as she has pledged, the Clinton campaign will participate in those efforts, as well. The recount in Wisconsin could begin as early as next week . In a post on Medium , Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Erik Elias wrote that \"regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented\" in any recount proceedings. It was the first time anyone from the Clinton camp had publicly weighed in on the potential recounts. As the Two-Way reported Friday , Stein and another third-party candidate filed for a recount in Wisconsin, and she plans to do the same in Pennsylvania and Michigan. President-elect Donald Trump's narrow victories in those states gave him enough electoral votes to cinch the election. After launching a fundraising campaign Wednesday, Stein \u2014 whose website explicitly says the recounts are not aimed at helping Clinton, but in preserving the integrity of the election \u2014 has raised nearly $6 million to pay for recounts. Article continues after sponsorship Elias explained in his post that Clinton campaign directors had not pursued a recount themselves because they \"had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology.\" But, he said, \"now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" He said that the campaign would do the same in Michigan and Pennsylvania if Stein files for recounts there, too. Elias said the Clinton camp is \"fully aware\" that the outcome of the election is unlikely to change, noting that \"the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states \u2014 Michigan \u2014 well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount.\" In an interview with NPR's All Things Considered on Saturday, Stein said her goal in pushing for a recount wasn't to change the results of the election but to make sure U.S. elections are \"fair and reliable.\" \"We need a system that empowers voters, and that needs to start with a voting system we can trust,\" she said. Still, Elias wrote, the Clinton campaign believes it has \"an obligation\" to the 64 million people who voted for Clinton to \"participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported.\" Trump issued a statement Saturday calling the recount efforts \"ridiculous\" and pointing out that Clinton had already conceded. It also said: \"This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing.\" Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tweeted Saturday about the Clinton campaign's decision to back the recounts. Where is the media outcry?  Clinton campaign to join Wisconsin recount https://t.co/BNWSSQTI6X pic.twitter.com/kMFWptMM3k \u2014 Corey R. Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) November 26, 2016 Amid the snowballing recount efforts, The Hill reported that President Obama called Clinton on election night and urged her to concede to Trump. Without his urging, she may have waited for the final results, according to anonymous sources from her camp. The Hill's Amie Parnes wrote: \"Obama's call left a sour taste in the mouths of some Clinton allies who believe she should have waited longer, and there's now a fight playing out between the Obama and Clinton camps over whether to support an effort to force the Rust Belt states to recount their votes.\" This post has been updated with Trump's statement. Clarification Nov. 26, 2016 Subsequent to posting, NPR reached two officials with the Clinton campaign. They are not supporting the recount effort. They are participating in it. ",

    "text": "Long after 'The Life Aquatic,' Seu Jorge still has David Bowie on his mind Seu Jorge Seu Jorge performs Saturday at the Theatre at Ace Hotel. Seu Jorge performs Saturday at the Theatre at Ace Hotel. (Timothy Norris) Mikael Wood, Pop Music Critic Red knit ski caps adorned many a head in the crowd gathered Saturday night at the Theatre at Ace Hotel, where Brazilian singer and actor Seu Jorge performed a stirring concert tribute to the late David Bowie . The accessory, which Jorge himself wore, along with a pale blue shirt and pants,\u00a0was a nod to his memorable character in \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,\u201d director Wes Anderson \u2019s 2004 film starring Bill Murray as an eccentric, Jacques Cousteau-like ocean explorer. In the movie, now  a cult classic, Jorge plays a member of Zissou\u2019s crew who turns up intermittently to sing Bowie songs in Portuguese while accompanying himself on delicate acoustic guitar. (To ask why is to misunderstand the insular logic of a Wes Anderson movie.) And those red caps weren\u2019t the only visual reminder of the film in Jorge\u2019s show, which he\u2019s scheduled to repeat Sunday and Monday at the Ace. A large ship\u2019s wheel sat at the front of the stage and clips from the movie played on a large screen positioned over the singer\u2019s head. But all that seemed secondary to Jorge\u2019s real mission, which was simply to demonstrate his deep admiration for Bowie\u2019s music in wake of the pop icon\u2019s shocking death in January. Indeed, though he released an album of his distinctive Bowie interpretations in 2005 \u2014 with \u201cQueen Bitch,\u201d \u201cSuffragette City\u201d and \u201cRock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Suicide,\u201d among others \u2014 Jorge didn\u2019t feel compelled to tour behind it until this year. As on the album, his performance here had a minimal sonic setup: just Jorge, seated on a stool, strumming and plucking his guitar as he sang. Film clips accompanied Jorge's performance of David Bowie's music. Timothy Norris Film clips accompanied Jorge's performance of David Bowie's music. Film clips accompanied Jorge's performance of David Bowie's music. (Timothy Norris) Yet he brought what felt like infinite detail and emotion to the songs. \u201cLife on Mars\u201d was tender and vulnerable, while \u201cZiggy Stardust\u201d throbbed with yearning \u2014 a rebel yell comprehensible in any language. For \u201cSuffragette City,\u201d Jorge transformed the swagger of Bowie\u2019s glam-rock original into something moodier, almost eerie. Some of Bowie\u2019s songs hadn\u2019t been familiar to Jorge prior to \u201cThe Life Aquatic,\u201d he recalled,\u00a0including \u201cChanges,\u201d which blew his mind when Anderson played it for him. And it was fascinating to watch him demonstrate how he\u2019d reconfigured the music to suit his style, as he also did with \u201cRebel Rebel,\u201d where he opted to sing the crunching guitar riff over a syncopated lick of his own. In \u201cOh! You Pretty Things,\u201d which he called his favorite Bowie tune, his uncluttered arrangement called attention to the ingenious architecture of Bowie\u2019s song; he was showing you the bones instead of the trademark decoration. Near the end of the show, Jorge reminisced about the week that Bowie died \u2014 about how tough it had been to lose him yet how proud he\u2019d felt to hear from friends who\u2019d found comfort in Jorge\u2019s album. Then he revealed that his father had died just three days after Bowie. \u201cHe made me the man I am today,\u201d he said, bringing the room to a standstill with his warm remembrance. Jorge was referring to his dad, of course.\u00a0But it was clear he meant Bowie too.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton\u2019s truce and efforts to \u201ccome together\u201d after their bitter White House race appeared to fray this weekend when Clinton joined in a vote recount effort that the President-elect assailed in a series of Tweets Sunday. In the posts, Trump claimed that \"millions\" of people cast illegal votes in this month's presidential election, and claimed that the press was covering the matter unfairly.\u00a0 In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump further contended that if the popular vote determined the presidency, \"It would have been much easier for me to win\" it because he would have altered his campaign to pile up overall vote totals, not Electoral College votes. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 The real estate mogul also tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she told supporters they must accept that \"Donald Trump is going to be our president,\" and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nominee for refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict. There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting or hacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. It's that very lack of evidence that suggests Trump is likely to prevail in recounts. Trump's social media storm came one day after a Hillary for America lawyer said that Clinton would join in a vote-recall effort by Green Party Candidate Jill Stein. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 The attorney, Marc Elias, said Clinton was taking the step \u201cto ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" Stein has already raised at least $5.4 million in her effort to recount votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- states that were the key to Trump's upset victory. She began the process Friday by officially requesting a review in Wisconsin. Stein has argued the recount is intended to test the integrity of the U.S. voting system, amid so-far unfounded speculation that Russia tampered with the process. However, the effort also could undo the 70-plus electoral votes by which Trump beat Clinton. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and, as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost 11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday. Stein received only about 1 percent of the national vote, which has prompted Trump to call her effort a fundraising \u201cscam.\u201d \u201cI would say (Trump) has been incredibly gracious and magnanimous to Secretary Clinton at a time when for whatever reason her folks are saying they will join in a recount,\u201d senior Trump transition team adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cShe congratulated him and conceded to him on election night. \u2026 The idea that we are going to drag this out now where the president-elect has been incredibly magnanimous to the Clintons and to the Obamas is incredible.\u201d Meanwhile, Conway refused to rule out the possibility of further investigating Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state between 2009 and 2013.\u00a0 Conway made clear that Trump said only that he wouldn\u2019t rule out another possible email probe because new evidence could emerge and he wouldn\u2019t want to undercut the authority of federal and congressional investigators. The FBI this summer concluded its one-year investigation into Clinton using the private server by saying she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and that some of the emails included classified information. However, the investigation was effectively closed without criminal charges being recommended to the Justice Department. Trump, in his presidential debates with Clinton, also suggested that if elected he would appoint a special prosecutor for the matter. Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgiving weekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said the president-elect had scheduled a series of meetings Monday with prospective administration hires. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times \u201c\u2018We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald Trump is going to be our President,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, quoting Mrs. Clinton. One person who spoke with Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend said the president-elect had appeared to be preoccupied by suggestions that a recount might be started, even as his aides played down any concerns. Another friend said Mr. Trump felt crossed by Mrs. Clinton, who he believed had conceded the race and accepted the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team\u2019s general counsel, said the campaign would participate in Ms. Stein\u2019s recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result, partly out of a sense of duty to the millions who voted for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states \u2014 Michigan \u2014 well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount,\u201d Mr. Elias said, noting that Clinton campaign officials had found no \u201cactionable evidence\u201d of hacking or attempts to tamper with the vote. Late Sunday night, Mr. Elias responded on Twitter to Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations, writing , \u201cWe are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn\u2019t ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud.\u201d In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22,177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10,704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70,638 votes. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides echoed his concerns about the recount effort in appearances on Sunday morning television news programs. Ms. Conway, who was his campaign manager, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Mrs. Clinton and her campaign advisers would have to decide \u201cwhether they\u2019re going to be a bunch of crybabies.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for the debate over Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway, echoing comments she posted last week on Twitter, made clear that she opposed choosing Mr. Romney as secretary of state. \u201cThere was the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement, and then there was Gov. Mitt Romney,\u201d she said on ABC. During the primaries, Mr. Romney called Mr. Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d Ms. Conway said it was important for Mr. Trump to seek to unify the Republican Party by making gestures to those who opposed his candidacy. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think the cost of party unity has to be the secretary of state position.\u201d Moments after appearing on the show, Ms. Conway, who is under consideration to be Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, wrote on Twitter that she had told Mr. Trump her opinion privately, \u201cand I\u2019ll respect his decision.\u201d On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d she said people felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the idea that Mr. Romney could get a top cabinet job. \u201cI\u2019m not campaigning against anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just a concerned citizen.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if he voted for Donald Trump,\u201d she added.

By Chris Cillizza November 27 at 11:09 AM Follow @thefix By Election Day, ambitious Democrats had already resigned themselves to an eight-year wait for their chance in the national spotlight. Hillary Clinton was an overwhelming favorite against Donald Trump and, assuming she won, running a primary challenge against her in four years would be a fool\u2019s errand. Then Clinton lost. Although this most stunning upset in modern presidential history has produced (and will produce) a thousand aftershocks, one of the most unlikely and important is that the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 is now open. That opening is made all the more remarkable by the fact that there is simply no logical heir (or even heirs) to President Obama or Clinton \u2014 no obvious candidate waiting in the wings to step forward and rebuild the party. Vice President Biden appears to have decided that he is done running for office. As a two-time loser, Clinton is done, too. And after that, the bench is, well, pretty thin. Politics, of course, abhors a vacuum. So candidates will run. Here is a look at who they might be: Sen. Cory Booker: Booker has been a national figure since the mid-2000s, when he was elected mayor of Newark. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 football at Stanford University, a Rhodes scholarship \u2014 is impressive, and many Democrats see the young (he\u2019s 47), charismatic, African American U.S. senator from New Jersey as the second coming of Obama. But the campaign that Booker ran for the Senate in 2013 was more competitive than it should have been largely because of his shaky performance. He may start the 2020 race as the front-runner, but he still has lots of questions that need answering. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: Gillibrand may be the most logical heir to Clinton in the 2020 field, but it remains to be seen whether that is a good thing. When Obama chose Clinton to be secretary of state, Gillibrand was appointed to her Senate seat in New York and then won two subsequent elections to hold the seat, thanks to rock-star-level fundraising. Gillibrand, according to the New York Post , is already feeling out some of Clinton\u2019s major donors about what comes next for the party. At 49, Gillibrand is one of a handful of women primed to be the next generation of female leaders for Democrats. Sen.-elect Kamala Harris: Harris will not officially become a U.S. senator from California for more than a month, but she is already regarded as national-candidate material in four years. It is not hard to see why. She is the first African American woman elected to the Senate since Carol Moseley Braun in 1992. Harris also represents the largest and most Democratic state in the country, a huge financial launchpad to a presidential bid. (Through mid-October, Harris had raised more than $13\u00a0million for her Senate candidacy.) Her law-and-order background \u2014 she was elected and reelected attorney general in California \u2014 also will appeal to many Democrats. Whether Harris wants to \u2014 or will be ready to \u2014 run for national office so soon after being elected to the Senate remains to be seen. Gov. John Hickenlooper: The Colorado governor was almost Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential pick this time around. And in a field filled with Washington types, the governor of a swing state in the West could have real appeal. Hickenlooper also has a terrific life story \u2014 a Denver brewery owner who became mayor and governor \u2014 and a down-home demeanor that screams,\u00a0\u201cI am not a politician.\u201d Hickenlooper\u2019s biggest problem as a candidate may be that he is viewed as too moderate for the current Democratic Party . But some governor (Missouri\u2019s Jay Nixon? Delaware\u2019s Jack Markell?) will run for president, and, at the moment, Hickenlooper seems first among equals for that role. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Like Gillibrand, Klobuchar is an accomplished and ambitious senator who cuts the sort of profile that should put her in the mix for 2020. Unlike Gillibrand, however, Klobuchar represents Minnesota \u2014 not exactly a fundraising hotbed for a national candidate. But she has a very interesting legislative background \u2014 she worked with Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) on ensuring veterans got the leave benefits they were promised before deploying, and she is a leading voice on adoption in the Senate. First lady Michelle Obama: Let\u2019s say this first: The soon-to-be-former first lady has never run for elected office and, to date, has shown absolutely no interest in doing so. But let\u2019s also say this: She gave the two best political speeches of the past two years \u2014 the first at the Democratic National Convention in July, the second in New Hampshire in the fall, an emotional condemnation of Trump\u2019s America. Obama has one thing \u2014 with the possible exception of Booker \u2014 that the rest of the people on this list lack: true star power. She would start the race not only totally known by base Democrats but also absolutely beloved. The issue for Obama is that being a candidate in your own right is very different from being a surrogate for a candidate. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The victim killed in the shooting was identified as 25-year-old tattoo artist Demontris Toliver of Baton Rouge, according to the New Orleans police department. Demontris Toliver, 25, of Baton Rouge Facebook with permission of the family Two arrests were made after the shooting for illegal carrying of a firearm, police said. Neither of those individuals are suspects in the incident, but were picked up in a concerted sweet for illegal firearms. \"One of the victims was in possession of a firearm ... another subject, who may or may not be affiliated with this event, was arrested for possession of a firearm,\" Harrison told WDSU , adding to eleven total arrests for the same offense in the two days after Thanksgiving. \"This is the wrong place to bring firearms, we've made that clear,\" he added. \"We are going to pursue this to the fullest extent of the law.\" Update: A total of 10 victims were shot in the incident on Bourbon Street. One victim has died from his injuries. #NOPDAlert \u2014 NOPD (@NOPDNews) November 27, 2016 Five of the victims had already been released from the University Medical Center where they were being treated. Four remain in the hospital, but they are expected to make a full recovery. The Bayou Classic is the annual college football game between the Grambling State University Tigers and the Southern University Jaguars. The police department later issued a statement saying detectives were \"gathering evidence from the area, including surveillance video footage, as well as interviewing victims and witnesses.\" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu called the shooting senseless and tragic, WDSU reported . \"We're going to pursue these individuals very, very aggressively,\" Landrieu said. \"Totally unacceptable. The violence continues to spin out of control with people brandishing weapons whenever they think they can. It's really unfortunate.\" The shooting mirrors another that occurred on Bourbon Street in June 2014. In that incident, a nursing student was killed and nine others were injured. One of the shooters, 22-year-old Trung Le, was sentenced to 60 years in that case. The other suspect remains unidentified. Mayor Landrieu stressed that gun violence is a longtime issue in the United States, an issue he often discusses. The solution, he said, is an engaged citizenry \u2014 an idea of vigilance that he hoped would comfort prospective visitors. If you want a safe community, you have got to step up to the plate,\" he said, adding that the city and investigators would do everything possible to arrest the two suspects. \"We will find them, and we will go to the ends of the earth to bring them to justice,\" he added.

GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images BEIRUT --\u00a0Simultaneous advances by Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces into eastern Aleppo on Sunday set off a tide of displacement inside the divided city, with thousands of residents evacuating their premises, and threatened to cleave the opposition\u2019s enclave.\u00a0 Rebel defenses collapsed as government forces pushed into the city\u2019s Sakhour neighborhood, coming within 0.6 miles of commanding a corridor in eastern Aleppo for the first time since rebels swept into the city in 2012, according to Syrian state media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group. Kurdish-led forces operating autonomously of the rebels and the government meanwhile seized the Bustan al-Basha neighborhood, allowing thousands of civilians to flee the decimated district to the predominantly Kurdish Sheikh Maqsoud, in the city\u2019s north, according to Ahmad Hiso Araj, an official with the Syrian Democratic Forces. The government\u2019s push, backed by thousands of Shiite militia fighters from Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran, and under the occasional cover of the Russian air force, has laid waste to Aleppo\u2019s eastern neighborhoods. Relentless bombing decimates Syria's largest city An estimated quarter-million people are trapped in wretched conditions in the city\u2019s rebel-held eastern districts since the government sealed its siege of the enclave in late August. Food supplies are running perilously low, the U.N. warned Thursday, and a relentless air assault by government forces has damaged or destroyed every hospital in the area.\u00a0 Residents in east Aleppo said in distressed messages on social media that thousands of people were fleeing to the city\u2019s government-controlled western neighborhoods, away from the government\u2019s merciless assault, or deeper into opposition-held eastern Aleppo.\u00a0 \u201cThe situation in besieged Aleppo (is) very very bad, thousands of eastern residents are moving to the western side of the city,\u201d said Khaled Khatib, a photographer for the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group, also known as the White Helmets.\u00a0 \u201cAleppo is going to die,\u201d he posted on Twitter. A tweet sent from an\u00a0 account described as belonging to\u00a0 7-year-old Aleppo resident Bana Alabed and managed by her mother said on Sunday that Alabed\u2019s home was destroyed and reduced to rubble. The account says Alabed and her mom are tweeting live from inside eastern Aleppo. Tonight we have no house, it's bombed & I got in rubble. I saw deaths and I almost died. - Bana #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/arGYZaZqjg \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) November 27, 2016 The tweet followed two frantic posts attributed to her mother, Fatemah. The army got in, this could be our last days sincerely talking. No Internet. Please please please pray for us.- Fatemah #Aleppo \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) November 27, 2016 Last message - under heavy bombardments now, can't be alive anymore. When we die, keep talking for 200,000 still inside. BYE.- Fatemah \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) November 27, 2016 The Britain-based Observatory, which monitors the conflict through a network of local contacts, said around 1,700 civilians had escaped to government-controlled areas and another 2,500 to Kurdish authorities. More than 250 civilians have been killed in the government\u2019s bombardment of eastern Aleppo over past 13 days, according to the Observatory. Locals reported thousands more were moving within the eastern neighborhoods, away from the front lines, but staying inside areas of opposition control. \u201cThe conditions are terrifying\u201d said 28-year-old Modar Sakho, a nurse in eastern Aleppo. Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher in eastern Aleppo and outspoken government opponent, said some families would stay put in the face of advancing government forces. Syrian state media reported government forces had seized the Jabal Badro neighborhood and entered Sakhour Sunday after it took control of the Masaken Hanano neighborhood Saturday. Syrian state TV broadcast a video Saturday showing a teary reunion between a soldier and his family after nearly five years apart, according to the report. It said the family had been trapped in Masaken Hanano. The Lebanese Al-Manar TV channel reported from the neighborhood Sunday morning, showing workers and soldiers clearing debris against a backdrop of bombed-out buildings on both sides of a wide thoroughfare. Al-Manar is operated by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group aligned with the Syrian government. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces\u2019 advance into Bustan al-Basha dealt the opposition a further blow. Rebels and opposition figures have long accused the SDF and its predecessor groups of conspiring with the government to quash a nationwide revolt. Araj denied there was any coordination between government and Kurdish-led forces. \u201cWe were responding to calls from residents in Bustan al-Basha to secure the neighborhood,\u201d he said. He added the SDF had entered the area handily as rebel militants fled. Aleppo used to be Syria\u2019s largest city and commerce capital before its neighborhoods were devastated by the country\u2019s more than five-year-long civil war . The U.N.\u2019s child agency warned Sunday that nearly 500,000 children were now living under siege in Syria, cut off from food and medical aid, mostly in areas under government control. That figure has doubled in less than a year. Many are now spending their days underground, as hospitals, schools and homes remain vulnerable to aerial bombardment. \u201cChildren are being killed and injured, too afraid to go to school or even play, surviving with little food and hardly any medicine,\u201d said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. \u201cThis is no way to live - and too many are dying.\u201d Civilian casualties growing in Syria Activists also reported Sunday tens of civilian casualties from a presumed government or Russian airstrike on a village outside Aleppo. The Local Coordination Committees activist network in Syria reported 15 civilians killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Anjara, controlled by the opposition in the western Aleppo countryside, and tens of others wounded. Activists usually identify planes by their silhouettes and home base. The Observatory said the strike was accompanied by raids on other opposition-held villages in the Aleppo countryside. Meanwhile, Anadolu also reported Sunday that the Islamic State group had used chemical weapons against Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters in northern Syria, wounding 22. The report cited a statement by the chief of general staff\u2019s office. The report could not be immediately verified independently. Later Sunday, Turkey\u2019s emergency relief directorate, which investigated the claim, said it found no trace of chemical warfare. The military was not available for further comment. Elsewhere in Syria, Israeli aircraft struck a machine gun-mounted vehicle inside the country Sunday, killing four Islamic State-affiliated militants on board after they opened fire on a military patrol on the Israeli side of the Golan Heights, according to the Israeli military. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "This year's Black Friday shoppers went online more \u2014 and spent less (Los Angeles Times) Shan Li Consumers increasingly turned online during the Black Friday weekend, boosting traffic during the crucial start of\u00a0the holiday shopping season. Nearly 109 million people shopped from their computers and mobile devices from Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, while about 99 million hit the sales in brick-and-mortar stores, according to a survey from the trade group National Retail Federation. That\u2019s compared to last year, when shoppers were more evenly split, with 103 million browsing online and 102 million in stores. \u201cThe story of the weekend was online increasing over in-store,\u201d said Pam Goodfellow, principal analyst at Prosper Insights and Analytics, which crunches data for the trade group. Some shoppers, of course, did both. That put the total number of shoppers during the four-day weekend at more than 154 million \u2014 up from 151 million in 2015, the survey said. Shoppers spent an average of $289.19, down from $299.60 last year, the survey said. Matthew Shay, chief executive of the trade group, said some promotions were steeper than in\u00a02015. This year, 36% of shoppers reported that all of their purchases were sale items; last year, 11% of consumers said so. The holiday season is vital to retailers, which can make up to 40% of their annual sales during that time. The National Retail Federation forecasts that sales during November and December will climb 3.6% to $655.8 billion, up slightly from the same period in 2015. Although Black Friday has evolved, it continues to be the biggest day of the year in terms of shopper traffic, according to a separate report from consumer analytics firm ShopperTrak. In-store visits dropped 1% over the two days of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, but that decline came from slower traffic on Turkey Day. \u201cWe found that Thanksgiving Day store openings were increasingly pulling shopper visits from Black Friday over the past few years,\u201d said Brian Field, senior director of advisory services for ShopperTrak. \u201cThis year, we saw a reversal of that trend, which can be attributed to several factors including fewer store openings on Thanksgiving Day, as well as online shopping.\u201d Field said that eight of the 10 biggest shopping days of the year have yet to come, including Super Saturday on Dec. 17. Retailers should get a boost from Christmas falling on a Sunday this year, Field said. The Friday before Christmas and the day after, which is a Monday, should also be top shopping days as well.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story More quietly, Mr. Bannon systematically courted a series of politicians, especially those who share his dark, populist worldview: at home, a corrupt ruling class preying on working Americans; globally, \u201cthe Judeo-Christian West\u201d in a \u201cwar against Islamic fascism.\u201d They were views that placed him closer to the European right than to the Republican mainstream. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He made flattering films about Michele Bachmann , the former congresswoman from Minnesota, and Sarah Palin , the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate; repeatedly pressed the television host Lou Dobbs to run for office; and flirted with a range of Republican presidential hopefuls, including Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Finally, in Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon found his man. Mr. Bannon told a colleague in multiple conversations during the presidential campaign that he knew Mr. Trump was an \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d for the revolution he had in mind. But the upstart candidate and the media entrepreneur bonded anyway. In August 2015, Mr. Bannon told Ms. Jones in an email that he had turned Breitbart, where employees called certain political stories \u201cBannon Specials,\u201d into \u201cTrump Central\u201d and joked that he was the candidate\u2019s hidden \u201ccampaign manager.\u201d He hosted Mr. Trump for friendly radio interviews and offered tactful coaching. This August, with the Trump campaign foundering, Mr. Bannon took over as chief executive. Like Reagan, Mr. Trump addressed the people he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d \u2014 the white working and middle class. He vowed to take on Islamic radicalism, as Reagan had faced off against communism. Echoing the sole-savior theme of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d Mr. Trump declared of the nation\u2019s predicament, \u201cOnly I can fix it.\u201d Ms. Jones, for one, had no trouble seeing the parallels. \u201cTrump,\u201d she said, \u201cis Steve\u2019s Reagan.\u201d Trailer of the 2004 documentary \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d which Mr. Bannon helped write. YouTube Mr. Trump, of course, is not Mr. Bannon\u2019s creation, and the president-elect would not take kindly to any such implication. (Asked on Tuesday by New York Times journalists about Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump praised him but said , pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m the one who makes the decisions.\u201d) But Mr. Bannon understood better than any other 2016 campaign strategist how many voters were seeking dramatic change, said Patrick Caddell, a veteran pollster, who all but predicted a Trump victory on election eve as most pundits were calling the race for Hillary Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s been the forerunner intellectually of this moment,\u201d Mr. Caddell said. \u201cHis ideology is that of the outsider and the insurgent.\u201d To understand what to expect from the Trump administration means in part to fathom the driven, contradictory character of Mr. Bannon, whom the president-elect has named senior counselor and chief White House strategist. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a president-elect, thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities and many other Americans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story How did this son of Richmond, Va., who attended Harvard Business School, spent years at Goldman Sachs and became wealthy working at the intersection of entertainment and finance come to view the political and financial elites as his archenemy? Why does a man who calls himself a \u201chard-nosed capitalist\u201d rail against \u201cglobalists\u201d of \u201cthe party of Davos\u201d and attack the Republican establishment with special glee? As a filmmaker, Mr. Bannon, 63, has cited both the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl and the left-wing documentarian Michael Moore as models. In top physical shape as a young Navy officer, and for years wearing the banker\u2019s uniform of expensive suits, Mr. Bannon has in recent years sported flannel shirts and cargo pants. With a paunch and a sometimes scraggly beard, Mr. Bannon has a rugged look that Stephen Colbert described as \u201cRobert Redford dredged from a river.\u201d He is an avid reader of history, fond of citing Plutarch and Plato, and his career reflects a restless, eclectic mind. He has conceived a rap musical based on Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cCoriolanus\u201d (never completed); overseen the troubled Biosphere 2 project, an experiment in the Arizona desert meant to mimic the earth\u2019s ecosystem; acquired partial rights to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d before it became a megahit; moved to Shanghai to run a company marshaling Chinese computer gamers to earn points for Western players; and produced films on Washington corruption, Occupy Wall Street and Phil Robertson of \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d Vociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an anti-Semite and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable self-confidence and striking intensity.

Fans and foes agree that he is a \u201cscreamer,\u201d a volcanic personality who sometimes resorts to offensive or hyperbolic language. One of his three former wives claimed in court papers that he had said he did not want their twin daughters to go to school with Jews who raise their children to be \u201cwhiny brats,\u201d a claim Mr. Bannon denies. In a 2011 radio interview , he dismissed liberal women as \u201ca bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools.\u201d Photo At a rally on Nov. 16 in Los Angeles, people protested the appointment of Mr. Bannon as the chief strategist of the White House.

Saying he is an economic nationalist and not a white nationalist, Mr. Bannon has dismissed such devotees as the kind of marginal characters who turn up in every political movement, but he has only mildly denounced the bigots among his admirers.

Mr. Bannon\u2019s backers note that several of Breitbart\u2019s top editors and managers are Jewish \u2014 as was Mr. Breitbart himself \u2014 and the site is staunchly pro-Israel.

Still, he said, Mr. Bannon was popular with the sailors he led in the engineering department, nearly 50 men, the majority of them African-American, Hispanic or Asian. Though his family had Democratic roots, Mr. Bannon, like most of his fellow officers, was scornful of President Jimmy Carter and entranced by Ronald Reagan. At Mr. Masso\u2019s condo, while they watched the two candidates\u2019 debate on television in 1980, Mr. Bannon could hardly contain his excitement. \u201cHe was pacing my living room, and whenever there was a point-counterpoint, he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 like we were watching a boxing match,\u201d Mr. Masso said.

Got it By Gayathri Vaidyanathan November 27 at 8:00 AM Experts revealed side-scan sonar image of fabled British explorer ship, HMS Erebus, on the sea floor in northern Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the find on Sept. 9, 2014. (AP/Parks Canada/The Canadian Press) Almost two centuries ago, 134 men set sail on two British naval ships to discover the fabled Northwest Passage, a trade route through the Arctic linking Europe to the riches of the East. They never returned. The Inuit, native residents of the North, tell tales of the three-masted ships caught in ice and of men afflicted by scurvy and going hungry, until finally they broke the biggest taboo of humankind: cannibalism. Despite search efforts, neither ship was found. It was not until 2014 that the first traces of the expedition emerged, when divers located a shipwreck that they identified as HMS Erebus, named after the spiritual limbo between Earth and hell. Last month, the second big piece of the mystery fell into place when an Inuit ranger and a team of explorers announced that they had located HMS Terror \u2014 in near-pristine condition, not far from the Erebus \u2014 at the bottom of the Northwest Passage. The story of the ships\u2019 loss and eventual finding reveals how much the Arctic, and our relationship with this frontier, has changed in just a few decades. The ice is no longer what it once was; scientists think that the Arctic will be reliably ice-free and navigable in the summer by the middle of the century, if not earlier. A cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 tourists traversed the northern ocean of North America for the first time this year. [ The remote Alaskan village that needs to be relocated due to climate change ] The conditions today are balmy in comparison to what the expeditioners faced in the middle of the 19th century, at the height of the British Empire. The admiralty asked John Franklin, a 59-year-old polar explorer, to find a northern sea path linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. No one knew for certain that such a passage existed, but finding it would be yet another jewel in the British crown. Europeans thought of the world as perfect and symmetrical, according to \u201c Franklin\u2019s Lost Ship ,\u201d a book by John Geiger and Alanna Mitchell. Explorers had discovered a passage at the bottom of South America that linked the Atlantic and the Pacific. And so people reasoned that a similar one must exist in the north. Franklin knew how to navigate through ice, said Tom Zagon, a physical scientist with Canadian Ice Services. He chose two military vessels \u2014 the Erebus and the Terror \u2014 for the journey and reinforced their hulls with iron to withstand the crushing force of ice. He filled his hold with three years\u2019 worth of canned food in case the voyage took longer than the expected two years. On May 19, 1845, Erebus and Terror, both painted a menacing black with a yellow stripe , set off down the River Thames and into the Atlantic Ocean. Londoners thronged the banks and cheered the might of their empire. Success seemed assured. But Franklin was heading into a frontier that science had not mastered. Compasses did not work properly because their magnetic readings were impaired by proximity to the North Pole. There were no weather reports. It was much colder than today, and there were years with no summer ice melt at all, said Ryan Harris, an underwater archaeologist at Parks Canada. Ships can quickly get trapped in cement-like ice. [ Scientists say it\u2019s threatening the lifeblood of Canada\u2019s native people ] The expedition entered the Arctic Ocean before the end of May and picked through the labyrinth of the Canadian Arctic archipelago. Franklin and his men reached as far north as 77 degrees, about 850 miles from the North Pole, before wintering on a tiny uninhabited island. The sea ice must have been unusually light for the ships to get as far north as they did, Zagon said. The landscape there is flat and desolate, with storms bringing 60-miles-per-hour icy winds from the North Pole. There is almost no wildlife, and the only flora are stubborn Arctic mosses that cling to black rocks littering the frozen ground. The region is vast; even today, only 10 percent of the Canadian Arctic has been mapped. The only way to survive is by listening to the Inuit, said Adrian Schimnowski, chief executive of the Arctic Research Foundation, who spends five months every year in the North. \u201cWhen the Inuit give you advice on weather, hunting grounds, the best route to take to get somewhere, I follow 100 percent what they say,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know the land better than anyone else.\u201d The detached bell of HMS Erebus as found on the deck: The ship disappeared in the Arctic more than 160 years ago. (Thierry Boyer/Parks Canada) Inuit oral history suggests that Franklin and his men, however, did not consult with them. In September 1846, the British made a fateful decision to sail through a dangerous channel, the Victoria Strait. The strait is only 200 miles from the Canadian mainland, and yet it routinely experiences heavier ice conditions than areas farther north, Zagon said. Zagon thinks a storm crept up on the expedition, icing Victoria Strait within hours and trapping the ships. The men huddled onboard for nearly two years, waiting for the ice to clear. But even in summer, it remained unyielding, said Edward Carmack an emeritus oceanographer with the Institute of Ocean Sciences in British Columbia. Two dozen men, including Franklin, died of illness. [ He lost the race to South Pole but made discoveries for science ] The remaining men abandoned the ships on April 22, 1848, in a mad effort to walk south, across King William Island, to the Canadian mainland. It was a dangerous plan; in biting winds, it took them three days just to trek across the 15 miles of ice to the island. We know this because five years later, a note written by Erebus\u2019s commander was found under a stone landmark on King William Island. Search parties dispatched from Britain did not find the ships or any survivors, but the Inuit told them of having seen men starving, their faces blackened possibly by scurvy. The survivors ate their comrades after boiling body parts in their boots , the Inuit said. The oral history seemed to be confirmed in 2014 when scientists examined human remains from King William Island and found hack marks apparently left on skeletal remains by desperate butchers . Franklin\u2019s ships had been considered lost to history. But in the 2000s, as the summer sea ice began to clear because of global warming, nations jostled to access the Arctic\u2019s riches. In 2008, Canada began searching for the Erebus and the Terror as one way to prove a centuries-long link to the North. \u201cFranklin\u2019s ships are an important part of Canadian history given that his expeditions laid the foundations of Canada\u2019s Arctic sovereignty,\u201d Stephen Harper, who was then Canada\u2019s prime minister, said in 2014 . An illustration of the position of the HMS Terror at sunrise on July 14, 1837. (Owen Stanley/Library and Archives Canada) Sir John Franklin, the Arctic Explorer, did not consult with the Inuit before traversing the dangerous strait. (Library and Archives Canada) A coalition of Canadian government agencies and the Arctic Research Foundation, a nonprofit backed by BlackBerry founder and Ontario native Jim Balsillie, began sweeping the Northwest Passages for Franklin\u2019s ships using sonar. In 2014, the Erebus showed up on the sonar. When divers examined it, they found a nearly intact ship. Off to one side was a massive bell, cast in 1845 to honor the expedition. On the lower decks are intact chests where the men had stored their personal effects, said Harris of Parks Canada. Underwater archaeologists are carefully recovering artifacts. [ The mysterious shipwreck that swallows deep-sea divers who try to find it ] A second breakthrough came in September, when Sammy Kogvik, an Inuit ranger who lives in Gjoa Haven, the only settlement on King William Island, boarded an Arctic Research Foundation vessel, where he told Schimnowski an odd story: Seven winters ago, he and a friend had been snowmobiling off King William Island, on the secluded and frozen Terror Bay, when they saw a pole sticking out of the ice. They went closer and saw that it was a six-foot-tall wooden mast. Kogvik wrapped his arms and legs around it and hung off it while his friend snapped a photo. But Kogvik lost the camera during the trip and never told anyone about the incident, although he had thought of Franklin\u2019s doomed expedition. Schimnowski immediately set course for Terror Bay, which was ice-free this past summer. His team used a side-scan sonar, which images the ocean floor, to peer through the turbid waters. Just as they were about to give up, they passed right over an ancient three-masted ship at the bottom of the ocean, 80 miles north of the Erebus. Divers examined the ship a week later and confirmed that it is the Terror. The ship is tightly sealed and probably contains documents and other artifacts in pristine condition. \u201cAll in all, it makes for a rather dramatic visual to see this steely ship lying at rest on the sea floor,\u201d Harris said. Scientists say it is doubtful that the Erebus and the Terror would have been found if they had been hidden under the ice common during Franklin\u2019s time or even the ice found in the 1970s and 1980s. Until recently, Victoria Strait thawed only once every 10 years, but now it usually clears every summer, Zagon said. Instruments such as a side-scan sonar are best used in open water. Over the next few years, Parks Canada scientists will study the ships, photograph them and excavate the site to learn as much as they can about the expedition\u2019s fate. They will look for bodies, and perhaps even the coffin of Franklin. They will recover artifacts, documents, charts and other materials to answer old questions and new ones: Why is the Terror so far north of the Erebus? Did the men sail her there? And why did so many men fall ill so rapidly? Why did they decide on a treacherous trek that claimed their lives? \u201cThese were trained men, and they didn\u2019t just sit on the boat and starve to death,\u201d Carmack said. \u201cThey looked for ways out. What was the trail of death, and what will we uncover to complete the story of that survival epic?\u201d Read more: ",

Video provided by AFP Newslook FILE-- Elian Gonzalez is held in a closet by Donato Dalrymple, right, as government officials search the home of Lazaro Gonzalez for the young boy, early Saturday morning, April 22, 2000, in Miami. The armed Border Patrol agent who confronted Elian in this photo said in written after-action debriefing reports released by the Justice Department,  ``While my weapon was being pointed in the general direction I was searching, I never purposely pointed my weapon at Elian Gonzalez or Mr. Dalrymple.'' (Photo: Alan Diaz, Associated Press) An emotional Elian Gonzalez warmly remembers Fidel Castro as a second father\u00a0who became a friend in the 16 years since U.S. officials returned the young boy\u00a0to Cuba in a controversial decision that drew international headlines. Cuban state TV aired an interview with Gonzalez as Havana prepared for hundreds of thousands of mourners to to descend on a downtown square Monday for two days of homage to Castro, the revolutionary hero and\u00a0hard-line dictator who ruled Cuba for five decades. He died Friday at age 90. \"He is a father to me and, like my father, I wanted to show him everything I achieved,\" Gonzalez, now 22, said in the interview Sunday. \"There are still things I wanted to show him, to make him feel proud.\" Gonzalez said he considered it an \"extraordinary honor\" when Castro attended his sixth-grade graduation. They last spoke a few years ago when Gonzalez was finishing high school, he said. Castro stepped aside as president in favor of his brother, Ra\u00fal,\u00a0in 2008 because of illness. Gonzalez was 5 years old in November 1999 when his mother, her boyfriend and about a dozen others fled Cuba on a small fishing boat lashed to inner tubes, bound for Florida. The tiny flotilla was caught in a storm that killed his mother and most of the group. Voices: Castro's death hits home for my family Fishermen rescued Gonzalez and two others from waters off Miami.\u00a0That set off an international custody battle, with family members in Florida demanding they be allowed to raise Elian. The boy's father, who was divorced from Elian's mother,\u00a0wanted his son returned to Cuba. Courts sided with the father, but family members in the United States\u00a0refused to give up the boy. The dispute drew large protests in Havana as well as Miami, where hundreds surrounded the house\u00a0where Elian was living.\u00a0Five months after Elian's arrival, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno ordered federal law enforcement officials to seize him. A photo of a Border Patrol agent apparently aiming a semiautomatic rifle at the teary-eyed tot circulated around the world. Elian, however, was quickly flown back to his homeland. Gonzalez, in the broadcast,\u00a0said he will always be grateful to Fidel Castro for aiding his return to Cuba. He said Castro's legacy continues to be the revolution, and that it is now up to Cubans to \"fulfill\" that revolution. ",

In a string of television interviews, Conway referred to Romney's attacks on Trump as a \"fraud\" and a \"phony,\" and stressed the opposition to Romney's potential nomination by numerous Trump backers. She told NBC, \"I'm reflecting what the grassroots are saying.\" Conway also said the decision belongs to one person -- Trump -- and will back his nominee. \"We're all for party unity,\" Conway said on ABC's This Week, but she added that \"I don't think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position.\" Trump has interviewed Romney for the job.\u00a0A prominent Trump campaign supporter, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, is also seeking the State Department post. There are others in the mix, officials said, including John Kelly, a retired general, and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. There is also talk of retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus, though he pleaded guilty in a case involving the sharing of classified information with his mistress/biographer. .

(Photo: Rob Carr, Getty Images) The Baltimore Ravens weren\u2019t taking any chances. With a 19-12 lead on the Cincinnati Bengals and only 11 seconds left on fourth down, John Harbaugh, a former special teams coach, went to his bag of tricks\u00a0to make sure there would not be a blocked punt or a return. The Ravens coach had his players block, hold and even tackle the Bengals so they couldn\u2019t get near punter Sam Koch, who retreated to the back of the end zone. Ravens win by holding Bengals intentionally and delaying safety, there's no time extension for the flags pic.twitter.com/cL9AdJaIwv \u2014 Vikings Blogger (@firstandskol) November 27, 2016 Koch held the ball until the clock ran out, at which point he stepped out of the back of the end zone for a safety to secure a 19-14 win. Harbaugh was able to pull this off because a game can end on an offensive penalty. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 12 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: Fidel Castro's death offers new opportunity for 'freedom and democracy' 3:49 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161128004235if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/817988163652\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> But Obama is leaving office in January, and further change in Cuba may depend on President-elect Donald Trump. Early in the campaign, Trump said he supported Obama's policy on Cuba, but he retreated later, saying he would reverse Obama's executive orders and concessions until freedom is restored in Cuba. For Arturo L\u00f3pez-Levy, who formerly worked with the Cuban government, it's important to see what course the United States takes once Trump is sworn in. But \"I don't think the death of Castro will alter the pace of the reform,\" said L\u00f3pez-Levy, a Cuba expert and lecturer in political science at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley. L\u00f3pez-Levy expects significant change to begin when Raul Castro, 85, steps down, which he has said he will do in 2018. Although various names have been floated around as potential successors, most analysts agree that the likely next leader of Cuba will be First Vice President Miguel Mario Diaz-Canel, who's 56. \"The clock is ticking to pass the presidency to a new generation,\" L\u00f3pez-Levy said.

Advertisement Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged \u201ca separation\u201d from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years\u2019 time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial , prompting criticism from the Obama administration. Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America\u2019s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite. \u201cIt is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,\u201d said Michael J. Green , who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department. Continue reading the main story The Trump Brand Around the World Donald J. Trump has business interests in at least 20 countries, in addition to extensive hotel and real estate holdings in the United States, according to an analysis of his financial disclosure report . Each dot represents a city where he has at least one enterprise. The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What\u2019s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders. In an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business \u2014 and his family\u2019s ability to keep it running after he takes office. \u201cI\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it.\u201d In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings. \u201cVetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies. In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake \u2014 is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India \u2014 where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America \u2014 are being built through companies with family ties to India\u2019s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans. In Ireland and Scotland , executives from Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail\u2019s habitat \u2014 a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States. And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump\u2019s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan \u2014 suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup \u2014 the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests. Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It\u2019s two.\u201d These tangled ties already have some members of Congress \u2014 including at least one Republican representative \u2014 calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them. \u201cYou rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,\u201d Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. \u201cIf you have contracts w/foreign govts, it\u2019s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story David J. Kramer , who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump\u2019s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency \u2014 and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad. \u201cThis will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president\u2019s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials. \u201cThe working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,\u201d said Michael H. Fuchs , who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cThey will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies. Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president? What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization\u2019s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders \u2014 of Turkey, Argentina and Japan \u2014 having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide. Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause , appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels. \u201cI mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in. \u201cLet\u2019s listen and not prejudge,\u201d said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI want to see what he does as president.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Trump\u2019s project in Rio de Janeiro. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a Brazilian federal prosecutor, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. Credit Lianne Milton for The New York Times BRAZIL Nation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect\u2019s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish 171-room beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a 4,000-square-foot nightclub. \u201cThis is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time. But just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the president-elect in their dealings in Latin America\u2019s largest country. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds \u2014 Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State \u2014 put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra. Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil\u2019s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries. But Brazil\u2019s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades. The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic. The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of \u201chighly suspicious\u201d potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. \u201cIt is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,\u201d Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October. In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies. Mr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil\u2019s 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently. In a statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Alan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company \u2014 given that it does not own the hotel \u2014 and \u201chas no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.\u201d The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Serra, Brazil\u2019s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect. Even if Brazil\u2019s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent. \u201cBrazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that\u2019s about all they can do,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Trump Tower Mumbai is one of five Trump Organization projects in India, a country where connections between developers and officials are common. Credit Asmita Parelkar for The New York Times INDIA Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles On the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing. In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state\u2019s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization\u2019s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed. The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump\u2019s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were \u201crequesting a concession that could not be given.\u201d By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,\u201d Mr. Chavan said. Kalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai , the Trump Organization\u2019s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor. \u201cThe notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,\u201d Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. \u201cThe Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.\u201d This example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians \u2014 officially or unofficially \u2014 to push projects through the bureaucracy. Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats \u201cwhose main goal in life is to attract rent,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, Trump Towers Pune , is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country\u2019s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad. In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs. It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans. Top officials might \u201cthink in some way the U.S. president will help them,\u201d and \u201ccan put in a friendly word with the banks\u201d to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure. \u201cIf the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will think the president is meeting them.\u201d Photo Donald J. Trump\u2019s real estate partners from India met with him in New York on Nov. 15 as the presidential transition was underway. Another pitfall is that Donald Trump\u2019s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits. ",

GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images Syrian pro-government forces walk past damaged houses in eastern Aleppo, near Masaken Hanano, on November 23. GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images In the Syrian city of Aleppo, forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad have established full control of the largest rebel-held district, Masaken Hanano, according to Syria's state news agency. The government fighters are moving to take back the battered eastern side of Aleppo that has been largely under rebel control since 2012. NPR's Alison Meuse reports Assad's forces are \"pressing to split the besieged side of Aleppo in two.\" The BBC said , \"Syrian forces regained [Masaken Hanano] on Saturday \u2014 a move making it easier for them to isolate the northern districts of east Aleppo from the southern ones.\" Alison reports: \"A Syrian rebel spokesman confirmed the advances and said he anticipated a regime push to capture the adjacent districts, and sever the siege in two.\" On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported airstrikes on those area. NPR is working to confirm reports that a second rebel-held district may have fallen to government forces. Article continues after sponsorship After Rocky Pause, Airstrikes Resume On Syria's Aleppo Earlier this month, the Syrian government renewed its offensive to take back the besieged eastern half of Aleppo, where more than 250,000 civilians \u2014 desperate for food and supplies \u2014 have been trapped for months. The government forces have tried to cut off supply lines to rebel-held parts of the city. The BBC wrote that capturing the entire city of Aleppo \"would be a major victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after six and a half years of conflict.\" Capturing Masaken Hanano is an important strategic and symbolic victory for the government forces. Alison says: Masaken Hanao was the first district the rebels captured when they launched their Aleppo offensive in 2012. At the time, they vowed to take the whole city. But after four years of brutal stalemate, Assad's forces have managed to encircle the rebel-held side of the city\u2014which the UN says is home to a quarter of a million people. Only a trickle of families have managed to escape the siege and local residents say they're paying $500 a person to flee. Since government forces took control of Masaken Hanano, more than 400 people fled to the regime-held area overnight, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ",

That's a legal right. They do it. I don't think that Hillary Clinton, who got two million more votes than Mr. Trump in the popular election, thinks that it's going to transform the election.

Remarking on the death of Fidel Castro, Sanders maintained on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday morning that he had no praise for the dictator and that \"the Cuban economy is a disaster.\" However, the self-proclaimed socialist asserted that it was important for the United States to maintain relations with the Communist country, even if it meant issuing condolences to the Castro family. \"The goal right now is to see if we can improve our relationship with the people of Cuba to do what we can to improve their economy and to make sure that the younger generation does better than the older generation,\" Sanders said on CNN. Related: Three Big Questions About the Race for Democratic Party Chairman On the subject of rebuilding the Democratic Party, Sanders reiterated that he supported Minnesota Rep.

He said he agreed with Ellison's grassroots approach to \"open the doors to working people\" and thought his priorities of \"less emphasis on raising large sums of money\" and \"more emphasis on bringing new blood\" were apt. However, Sanders would not opine whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is facing a challenge from Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in the upcoming leadership elections, should be replaced. \"Nancy is a friend of mine and I think she has done a very good job,\" Sanders said. \"But I think that is an issue the people in the House will have to decide.\" Christina Coleburn ",

    "text": "Close CBS News DALLAS -- The exclusive Dallas boys\u2019 prep school that Richard B. Spencer attended is denouncing the activities and ideas of its white nationalist alumnus. St. Mark\u2019s School of Texas headmaster David Dini issued the statement of criticism after a Nov. 19 rally in Washington where Spencer, a member of St. Marks Class of 1997, shouted \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\u201d as supporters raised their arms in Nazi salutes. Without referring to Spencer by name, Dini said his activities have \u201cbeen deeply troubling and terribly upsetting to our whole school community. We reject racism and bigotry in all its forms and expressions.\u201d In his statement, posted on the school\u2019s Facebook page, Dini hailed other St. Mark\u2019s alumni for \u201cexpressing their outrage and disgust\u201d toward the National Policy Institute , which Spencer heads, and the ideas that group promotes. Spencer\u2019s classmates have raised about $40,000 so far in a fundraising campaign to settle refugees in Dallas. One of them is Ben Kusin, former \u201cShark Tank\u201d contestant and chief executive of deodorizing wipes company. \u201cThis issue hits deep -- not just for me but for everyone,\u201d he told WFAA-TV of Dallas-Fort Worth, adding about the rally, \u201cWhen you see something like this, you have to say something.\u201d\u00a0 Alt-right movement makes momentum with Trump presidency The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes Spencer as \u201cone of the country\u2019s most successful young white nationalist leaders -- a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.\u201d \u201cHe wants to expel all these non-white Europeans from this country,\u201d Kusin said. \u201cOur countermeasure was supporting refugees coming into this country.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer spoke with CBS News\u2019 Jericka Duncan last week about how Donald Trump\u2019s election was giving the alt-right a big boost. \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? Duncan asked him.\u00a0 \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 An email message to Spencer from The Associated Press drew no response Sunday. Other school alumni include folklorist/musicologist Alan Lomax, rock stars Steve Miller and Boz Scaggs, actors Tommy Lee Jones and Luke and Owen Wilson, and investigative journalist Kurt Eichenwald. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Your sacrifice will NEVER be forgotten.\" He concluded, \"Today, there is a new dawn filled with hope for our beloved Cuba.\" 0 Shares ",

We are a sinking ship,\" Department of Corrections Director Joe Allbaugh said after the state Board of Corrections approved his nearly $1.65 billion budget request for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and sent it to state lawmakers for their review. \"I've had several legislators ask me if I'm serious. I'm deadly serious about this,\" Allbaugh said. \"Corrections is a core function of state government. Our No. 1 priority is public safety, and public safety at our facilities is currently at risk.\" The budget request seeks about $10 million to pay for a 5 percent salary increase for corrections workers to help recruit and retain staff and more than $123 million to repair defective equipment and structures at 17 state prisons and six community corrections centers. It also looks ahead, seeking almost $850 million to build two 2,000-bed medium security prisons to accommodate what the Oklahoma Justice Reform Task Force estimates will be 25 percent growth over the next decade \u2014 more than 7,500 inmates \u2014 to an already-overcapacity population of almost 27,000. \"The Oklahoma taxpayer has a right to know what kind of shape their property is currently in,\" Allbaugh said. Among other things, the electronic panels that control locking devices on individual cells \"malfunction all the time,\" Allbaugh said. \"Our turnover rate with correctional officers is about 39 percent annually. We have a sizable proportion of our population that have mental health issues.\" But state lawmakers and Gov. Mary Fallin say the request is unrealistic following successive years of budget shortfalls due to declining revenue largely from low energy prices. Another $600 million shortfall has been projected for the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Fallin said Allbaugh has correctly pointed out \"that for many decades his department's needs have been neglected, which has left our prisons with old buildings and overcrowding. \"However, with a two-year downturn in the energy industry, it has been difficult to make many of the changes Oklahoma needs,\" Fallin continued. \"Despite these economic challenges, I approved $27.6 million of emergency funding earlier this year to the Department of Corrections, which helped prevent drastic cuts that would have jeopardized the safety, security and operations of our prison facilities and our citizens.\" Allbaugh, who took over in January and was director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President George W. Bush, said a critical concern is that the underfunded, understaffed condition of state prisons could lead to loss of life in a violent incident that threatens inmates, correctional officers and the public alike. \"It's not if we're going to have one, it's just when,\" Allbaugh said. Part of the reason the prison population has swelled is the recent adoption of sentencing guidelines that require many offenders to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for parole. The Justice Reform Task Force, established by Fallin to conduct a comprehensive review of the state prison system, projects that women and nonviolent offenders will be the bulk of the growth in the next 10 years \u2014 both of whom already comprise a large portion of the prison population. \"We've got to have shorter sentences,\" said Rep. Bobby Cleveland, R-Norman, vice chairman of the House Public Safety Committee that oversees the state prison system. \"This 85 percent thing has got to change. That's keeping our prisons full.\" Correctional policy professionals said they agree that state's prisons need a massive infusion of money to stop their downward spiral. \"I don't think they've always gotten it over at the Capitol,\" said Sean Wallace, policy director for the Oklahoma Public Employees Association. \"If you don't tell them the real needs, you won't get the real help.\" Former Republican state Rep. Gus Blackwell, who is now director of government relations for Oklahoma Corrections Professionals, which represents state corrections and Pardon and Parole Board workers, believes the state \"fiscally starved DOC to death because we've basically kept appropriations the same while the number of inmates has gone up drastically.\" Starting pay for a correctional worker is $12.78 an hour \u2014 lower than what many convenience store workers earn \u2014 and about one third of that workforce qualifies for food stamps, Blackwell said. \"Across the board, pay is low. And they are part of law enforcement,\" he said. \"It all falls apart without them.\" 0 Shares ",

Typically, the group of women, who are primarily composed of the wives of jailed dissidents, attend Mass each Sunday wearing white dresses. They then follow the occasion by marching through Havana's streets to protest the detention of political prisoners and support human rights in Cuba . \"We have decided, as fighters of human rights groups, to respect the pain, which we don't share. We will respect and have taken a recess on a national level, wherever the Ladies in White are, to not take to the streets today, to avoid provoking the government,\" Berta Soler, leader of the Ladies in White, told The Associated Press. The BBC noted that this is the first time the women have cancelled their protest in 13 years. Ha muerto Fidel Castro , que Dios lo perdone, YO NO pic.twitter.com/yFp3n8WJkv \u2014 Damas de Blanco (@DamasdBlanco) November 26, 2016 The group tweeted \"Ha muerto Fidel Castro , que Dios lo perdone, YO NO,\" in response to Castro's death, words that translate to \"Fidel Castro has died, may God forgive him, I WON'T.\" Soler said she did not expect Fidel Castro's death to change the human rights situation in Cuba. \"Now that Fidel Castro is not on the earth it doesn't mean we are going to start a new era, a new stage in which Fidel is not physically here in Cuba. We are going to continue with a dictator, Raul Castro, who will do the same thing Fidel did, those two did the same things together. And so in Cuba, the only thing that will change in this new stage is, it will be without the physical presence of Fidel Castro,\" she told the AP.

Dozens of veterans and other demonstrators held American flags and chanted \"U.S.A.\" at Hampshire College in Amherst on Sunday, in what organizers called a \"peaceful demonstration of freedom.\" College officials decided to indefinitely stop flying flags earlier this month after the main flag in the center of campus was burned after students lowered the banner to half-staff. Officials replaced the flag, but it was lowered again. School officials say they welcome peaceful discussions about the flag decision. Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno and others at the rally said the school's decision disrespects veterans and current military members. 0 Shares ",

Kamil Zihnioglu/AP hide caption toggle caption Kamil Zihnioglu/AP Francois Fillon waves before delivering a speech after the conservative presidential primary on Nov. 27, in Paris. Kamil Zihnioglu/AP In France's presidential primary election for the mainstream conservative party, Alain Jupp\u0102\u00a9 conceded defeat to Francois Fillon. The 71-year-old Jupp\u0102\u00a9 congratulated Fillon, 62, on a \"wide victory,\" according to The Associated Press. The AP reported the election results showed Jupp\u0102\u00a9 winning 32 percent of the vote compared to Fillon's 68 percent. Fillon had surged \"in popularity in recent weeks over longtime favorite\" Jupp\u0102\u00a9, the news service said. Fillon, whose policies fall further to the right than those of Jupp\u0102\u00a9, will face candidates from the left and the extreme right in the French presidential election next May. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, \"With the left in disarray and the far right still too marginal, analysts say the winner of the conservative primary, Fillon, will likely become the next French president.\" Current French President Francois Hollande's own prime minister, Manuel Valls, has said that he hasn't ruled out opposing the president in next month's left-wing primaries, reports Jake Cigainero for NPR. He tells our Newscast unit: \"The left-leaning Socialists have lost so much public support under Hollande that the Republicans are expected to win the presidential elections. Republicans see Marine Le Pen and her extreme National Front as their biggest opponent and are already preparing for a showdown next spring.\" Article continues after sponsorship Eleanor said both Fillon and Jupp\u0102\u00a9 served as ministers in the government of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, and both pledged to \"drastically reform the French economy.\" But they differ in their approaches to multiculturalism and foreign policy. She said: \"Fillon is more socially conservative and has won the backing of traditional family values Catholics. Fillon also wants to reestablish working relations with president Vladimir Putin and drop sanctions against Russia. Jupp\u0102\u00a9 stresses a harmonious France based on respect for religious freedom and ethnic diversity.\" Jupp\u0102\u00a9 says he will support Fillon in the national election. French Conservatives Fear Populist Wave That Carried Trump Will Foreshadow Primary \"I finish this campaign as I began it, as a free man who did not compromise what he is or what he thinks,\" Jupp\u0102\u00a9 said in Paris on Sunday night, according to the AP. The news service added: \"Jupp\u0102\u00a9 is calling for unity and calm after an unusually harsh campaign in which he accused Fillon of pandering to the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam far right.\" ",

    "text": "Syria Forces Advancing in Aleppo, Sending Hundreds Fleeing By PATRICK REEVELL Nov 27, 2016, 5:19 PM ET 0 Shares Star GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images Syrian pro-government forces inspect an area in the Masaken Hanano district in eastern Aleppo, Nov. 27, 2016, a day after they reseized it from rebel fighters. 0 Shares Email Russia's military said today that Syrian government troops have pressed into rebel-held areas of the besieged city of Aleppo, as a two week-long offensive there grinds forward, sending hundreds of civilians fleeing and appearing to push rebel defenders closer to defeat. Syrian state-controlled media announced that troops loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad had seized two keys neighbourhood in the city, threatening to split the rebel-held east of the city into two parts. Syrian troops captured the Jabal Badro neighborhood a day after they took another, Hanano, bringing them close to being able to drive a wedge that would separate the southern areas held by rebels from those they control in the north, the BBC reported. Russia's defense ministry said Syrian government troops had taken Hanano, as well as four other neighborhoods. Journalists in Aleppo reported that shelling and airstrikes were hammering rebel defenses in new areas and that hundreds of civilians were fleeing the government advances, moving to the regime-controlled West the city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a UK-based group that monitors the conflict, said 500 civilians had fled the rebel-held east of the city over the weekend; Russia's military claimed more than 900 had left from one area alone. The Observatory said 219 civilians had died since the offensive began, including 27 children. \"Thing in eastern Aleppo very, very bad,\" Khaled Khatib, a photographer for the White Helmets group that rescues people in Syria from buildings collapsed by airstrikes, wrote on Twitter. \"Aleppo will die,\" he wrote. The government gains bring the Assad regime another step closer to re-taking Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city, the eastern part of which has been held by rebels since 2012 and which has been under siege for months. Around 275,000 people are trapped in the city, according to the UN, living under daily government bombing and enduring acute shortages of food and medical supplies. Backed by heavy Russian air strikes, government forces along with fighters from Lebanon and Iran have encircled the eastern part of the city and are now tightening the noose, breaking through rebel front lines and taking areas controlled by the opposition since 2012. A mixture of more moderate opposition groups are fighting alongside radical jihadists militants to try to halt the advance. On Sunday, opposition groups said government troops were now moving on the Sakhur neighborhood, which if it falls would cut the rebel-held zone in two. Yasser al-Youssef, from the rebel group Nour al-Din al-Zenki, told AFP that opposition fighters were shoring up defenses in the area. \"We are strengthening our positions to defend the city and residents, but the aircraft are destroying everything methodically, area by area,\" he said. Eastern Aleppo has been under total siege since late summer and residents are now living in increasingly dire conditions, with food and medical supplies running out. A week ago, the World Health Organization said the last hospitals in Aleppo had been forced to stop operating after they were bombed. The UN, which was last able to distribute rations on November 13, has pleaded to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to the city, but has been refused by the Syrian government. Asked by reporters if there was any Plan B if the aid was not resumed, a UN relief adviser, Jan Egeland, said: \"In many ways Plan B is that people starve.\" Egeland said that must not happen. The fall of Aleppo would be a major victory for Assad and his ally Russia, whose intervention in September last year has pulled the Syrian president's regime back from the brink of collapse. Since November, Russia has intensified its bombing campaign across Syria, as the government has appeared increasingly emboldened. Efforts by the U.S. to broker ceasefires for Aleppo fell apart in September and Moscow and the Assad regime appear determined to retake the city, despite protests from Western countries that they are committing war crimes by indiscriminately bombing civilians and targeting hospitals. The Obama administration has warned Russia no military victory is possible in Syria, but Assad has repeatedly said he will take back all areas of the country. A representative of an opposition group that Moscow backs in now stalled peace negotiations, said no further talks were possible until Aleppo had been retaken. Qadri Jamil, a member of the so-called Moscow-Astana Opposition, which contains former Syrian government figures and closely follows Russia's public positions on the conflict, said he expected the city to fall before the end of the year. The UN has condemned the government offensive, with the head of its emergency relief program, Stephen O'Brien saying the bombardments were exceptional in their brutality. \"Let me be clear: we are not just seeing a resumption of violence in Aleppo, this is not business as usual,\" O\u2019Brien said in a statement last week. \"What has been unleashed on civilians this past week is yet another low in an unrelenting inhuman onslaught.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Email COLUMBUS, Ohio - Curtis Samuel swept in for a 15-yard touchdown after Ohio State barely converted a fourth-and-1 and the second-ranked Buckeyes beat No. 3 Michigan 30-27 in double overtime Saturday. CBSSports.com\u2019s Ben Kercheval writes : \u201cNo play will be more closely examined and scrutinized than Ohio State\u2019s one-yard fourth-down run by quarterback J.T. Barrett in the second overtime that netted the Buckeyes a first down.\u201d With Ohio State (11-1, 8-1 Big Ten, No. 2 CFP) facing fourth-and-1 from the 16, coach Urban Meyer decided not to kick a potential tying field goal with a kicker who had already missed two short ones in regulation. J.T. Barrett kept it on fourth down and slammed into the back of his blocker, A.J. Alexander, right at the line to gain. The first-down call stood up to video review. On the next play, Samuel, who had made a swerving, change-of-direction run to set up the fourth-and-1, raced into the end zone to win it. Here\u2019s the play in question. \u2014 SB\u272fNation CFB (@SBNationCFB) November 26, 2016 The call on the field was a first down and referees determined there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to overturn the call. Kercheval writes: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Ohio State getting a break or Michigan getting jobbed as much as it is getting the call right on the field. Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was infuriated at the officials\u2019 call, and he was probably standing right at the line of scrimmage watching the play develop. Nevertheless, this is a huge win for Ohio State and its playoff hopes. The question of whether the Buckeyes should have won is something that will be debated heavily for a long time.\u201d The first matchup to go to overtime in the 113-game history of the rivalry likely eliminated Michigan (10-2, 7-2, No. 3 CFP) from the playoff race and could have locked up a spot for the Buckeyes. The Buckeyes missed out on a spot in the Big Ten title game, with Penn State heading to Indianapolis instead to face Wisconsin. Michigan could end up in the Rose Bowl, but the biggest prizes are still eluding the Wolverines in their second year under coach Jim Harbaugh. He\u2019s 0-2 against Meyer and the Buckeyes. Ohio State wiped out a 10-point third-quarter deficit and dominated the fourth quarter, but Tyler Durbin missed a 20-yard field goal that would have tied it with 7:01 remaining. Barrett and the Buckeyes gave him another chance, this time from 23 yards with a second left in regulation and Durbin nailed it. Barrett scored on a quarterback draw and Ohio State\u2019s first possession of OT to give the Buckeyes the lead, but Michigan tied it on a 5-yard touchdown pass on fourth down from Wilton Speight to Amara Darboh. Full NCAA football coverage at CBSSports.com NO. 1 ALABAMA 30, NO. 16 AUBURN 12 TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - Jalen Hurts rebounded from two early interceptions to pass for 286 yards and Alabama\u2019s defense did the rest asgainst Auburn. The Crimson Tide (12-0, 8-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 1 CFP) led 13-9 at halftime, dominating the stat sheet but only taking over the scoreboard in the second half. The defense pushed its string of quarters without allowing a touchdown to 14-plus. Auburn (8-4, 5-3, No. 15) failed to muster much offense for the second straight SEC game, this time playing without injured quarterback Sean White. Hurts displayed the same poise in overcoming two first-half interceptions that have helped him lead the Tide into the SEC championship game. He completed 27 of 36 mostly short and mid-range passes and threw for two touchdowns. Alabama has won three straight Iron Bowls for the first time since 1990-92. Hurts also ran for 37 yards and a touchdown, leading two straight touchdown drives in the third quarter to all but put the game away after a mistake-filled first half. NO. 4 CLEMSON 56, SOUTH CAROLINA 7 CLEMSON, S.C. - Deshaun Watson tied his career high with six touchdown passes, three to Mike Williams, and Clemson took another, strong step to the College Football Playoff. If the Tigers (11-1, No. 4 CFP) don\u2019t stumble against Virginia Tech next week in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship, they\u2019ll be off to college football\u2019s final four for a second straight season. The Gamecocks (6-6) were little more than speed bump on that road that Clemson got past quickly, jumping out to a 21-0 lead in the opening quarter and cruising to a third straight win in the Palmetto State\u2019s biggest sporting event. Watson finished with 347 yards and matched the six TDs he threw in his first college start against North Carolina in 2014. He also likely crept a bit closer in the Heisman Trophy race to Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson, whose team lost for a second straight week. Watson and the Tigers also wiped out memories of their last Death Valley game, a stunning, 43-42 loss to underdog Pitt - Clemson\u2019s first home loss in more than three years. NO. 5 WISCONSIN 31, MINNESOTA 17 MADISON, Wis. - Corey Clement ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns, a big-play defense pitched a second-half shutout, and Wisconsin beat Minnesota for its 13th straight win in the annual border rivalry. The Badgers triumphantly lifted Paul Bunyan\u2019s Axe again, the trophy that goes to the victor in the most-played rivalry in major college football. Wisconsin (10-3, 7-2 Big Ten, No. 6 CFP) turned in a stalwart defensive effort in the second half after getting outplayed in the first and falling behind by 10 points at halftime. The comeback served as an exclamation point for an already momentous weekend. Wisconsin had wrapped up the Big Ten West and a spit in the league title game after Nebraska lost to Iowa on Friday night. Mitch Leidner threw four interceptions in the second half for Minnesota (8-4, 5-4). NO. 8 PENN STATE 45, MICHIGAN STATE 12 STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - Trace McSorley completed 17 of 23 passes for 376 yards and four touchdowns and Penn State beat Michigan State to win the Big Ten East on Saturday. Penn State (10-2, 8-1 Big Ten, No. 7 CFP) edged No. 2 Ohio State for the East title, setting up a conference championship game against West winner Wisconsin next week in Indianapolis. The Nittany Lions beat Ohio State 24-20 at home Oct. 22. McSorley set single-season school record for total offense and sparked the Nittany Lions with multiple deep passes in the second half when Penn State outscored Michigan State 35-0. He threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Chris Godwin down the sideline on Penn State\u2019s first second-half possession and followed it with a 45-yarder to Mike Gesicki on the next drive. Godwin got loose down the middle minutes later and McSorley hit him in stride for 59 yards to give Penn State a 31-12 lead. Andre Robinson added a 14-yard touchdown run and caught a 40-yard pass from McSorley to complete the scoring in the fourth quarter, and Barkley scored on a 1-yard run in the second. Barkley left in the third quarter with an apparent right leg injury and did not return. Michael Geiger kicked four field goals for the Spartans (3-9, 1-8). NO. 9 COLORADO 27, NO. 21 UTAH 22 BOULDER, Colo. - Ninth-ranked Colorado won the Pac-12 South title with a victory over Utah thanks to a senior-laden defense that forced two huge fumbles by Utes star running back Joe Williams. Cornerback Chidobe Awuzie also had a touchdown-saving tackle after a 93-yard kickoff return. The Buffaloes (11-2, 8-1, No. 9 CFP) will face No. 6 Washington in the conference championship next weekend. The Utes (8-4, 5-4) pulled to 27-22 on Demari Simpkins\u2019 7-yard TD catch with 1:34 remaining The 2-point conversion toss by Troy Williams was incomplete, and the Utes\u2019 onside kick failed when Kabion Ento recovered for Colorado. Linebacker Kenneth Olugbode scooped up Joe Williams\u2019 second fumble and returned it 10 yards for a TD that made it 27-16 early in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Awuzie recovered when Joe Williams fumbled at the Colorado 2. KENTUCKY 41, NO. 11 LOUISVILLE 38 LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Austin MacGinnis made a 47-yard field goal with 12 seconds left to give Kentucky the upset victory over Louisville and Heisman Trophy favorite Lamar Jackson. Louisville (9-3, CFP No. 11) appeared headed for a late go-ahead score when Jackson\u2019s fumble at Kentucky\u2019s 10 was recovered by the Wildcats\u2019 Courtney Love with 1:45 left. Stephen Johnson led Kentucky (7-5) into position for MacGinnis\u2019 winning kick. Jackson\u2019s desperation heave from deep in Louisville territory was intercepted by Mike Edwards, his second of the game. The Wildcats ended a five-game losing streak in the series. Jackson likely could have wrapped up the Heisman with his record-setting day, but a second consecutive loss might impact the race. The sophomore struck a Heisman pose after a tying touchdown in the fourth quarter. He had his school-record eighth 100-yard rushing game and broke the Louisville mark for rushing yards. He scored four times to break the Atlantic Coast Conference single-season record with 51. No. 12 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 45, NOTRE DAME 27 LOS ANGELES - Adoree Jackson returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns and also caught a scoring pass to help lift Southern California to its eighth consecutive victory, a romp ovre Notre Dame on in the 88th edition of their famed intersectional rivalry. Jackson, the Trojans\u2019 do-everything cornerback, put on a dazzling athletic display in perhaps his final home game while USC (9-3, No. 12 CFP) persevered through rain at the Coliseum to claim the Jeweled Shillelagh for the 11th time in 15 years. Sam Darnold passed for 205 yards and two TDs, and Ronald Jones II rushed for 134 yards and an early score to keep the surging Trojans in line for a New Year\u2019s Day bowl berth. Josh Adams ran for 180 yards and DeShone Kizer passed for 220 yards and two scores for the Fighting Irish (4-8). NO. 15 FLORIDA STATE 31, NO. 13 FLORIDA 13 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Dalvin Cook rushed for 153 yards and a touchdown and Florida State beat Florida for the fourth straight year. Cook\u2019s 17-yard score in the first quarter was his 45th career rushing touchdown, which broke Greg Allen\u2019s 32-year-old school mark. The junior also is the first Seminoles running back since Sammie Smith (1986-88) with three straight 100-yard games against Florida (8-3, No. 15 CFP). The Seminoles (9-3, No. 14 CFP) rushed for 249 yards and averaged 6.2 yards per carry against the nation\u2019s fifth-ranked run defense. Freddie Stevenson had a 27-yard touchdown run on his lone carry during the fourth quarter to make it 24-6 and put the game out of reach. The victory ties the Seminoles\u2019 longest winning streak in the Sunshine State Showdown series. They also won four straight from 1977-80 and 1987-90. NO. 19 WEST VIRGINIA 49, IOWA STATE 19 AMES, Iowa - Skyler Howard threw for 330 yards and tied a career high with five touchdowns and West Virginia rolled past Iowa State. Freshman Martell Pettaway burned his redshirt and ran for 181 yards in his debut for the Mountaineers (9-2, 6-2 Big 12). They outscored Iowa State 28-3 in the second half. Howard\u2019s 71-yard TD toss to Shelton Gibson and Pettaway\u2019s 4-yard touchdown run, the first of his career, made it 35-19 late in the third quarter. Gibson followed with a 40-yard TD catch to make it a 23-point cushion. Justin Crawford, who ran for 331 yards against Oklahoma last week, was replaced by Pettaway after two series. Kene Nwangwu had a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and Cole Netten kicked four field goals to lead Iowa State (3-9, 2-7). VANDERBILT 45, NO. 24 TENNESSEE 34 NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Kyle Shurmur threw for a career-high 416 yards, and Vanderbilt scored the final 21 points in an upset victory over Tennessee. The Commodores (6-6, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) earned a bowl berth for the first time since 2013 thanks to their Academic Progress Rate (APR) score before kickoff. Then they went out and turned in the best offensive performance yet in picking up their sixth win this year and improving coach Derek Mason\u2019s best record in his third season. Vanderbilt scored its most points against an SEC opponent since scoring 49 against Mississippi State on Sept. 25, 1971. The Commodores outgained Tennessee 608-516 in beating the Vols (8-4, 4-4) for the third time in five seasons. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "AP November 27, 2016, 10:47 AM Israeli military kills 4 ISIS militants in Syria after ambush Israeli soldiers on a tank monitor the area near the Israel-Syria border in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, on November 27, 2016, following an attack by gunmen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group. JALAA MAREY/AFP/Getty Images Email JERUSALEM -- Israeli aircraft struck a machine gun-mounted vehicle inside Syria Sunday, killing four militants affiliate with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) inside after they had opened fire on a military patrol on the Israeli side of the Golan Heights, the Israeli military said. Israel has been largely unaffected by the\u00a0 Syrian civil war raging next door, suffering only sporadic incidents of spillover fire over the frontier that Israel has generally dismissed as tactical errors of the Assad regime. Israel has responded to these cases lightly, with limited reprisals on Syrian positions in response to the errant fire.\u00a0 But Sunday\u2019s event, in the southern part of the Golan Heights, appears to be a rare case of an intentional shooting ambush by Islamic militants targeting Israeli troops.\u00a0 Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the Israeli patrol came under machine gun and mortar fire early Sunday. They returned fire toward Syria before an Israeli aircraft engaged, striking the vehicle in question and killing its passengers. He said all were suspected militants from an IS offshoot that controls the area. No Israeli troops were harmed.\u00a0 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended the troops for thwarting the attack.\u00a0 \u201cWe are well prepared on our northern border and will not allow Islamic State elements or any other hostile elements to use the war in Syria to establish themselves close to our borders,\u201d he said at his weekly Cabinet meeting.\u00a0 Rebel shelling killed eight school children in Aleppo on Sunday, while a barrel bomb launched by regime forces killed a family of six. The number... Though Israel has generally stayed on the sidelines of the fighting, fearing being sucked into a clash between forces that are all hostile to it, it is widely believed to have carried out airstrikes on arms shipments said to be destined for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, a close ally of the Syrian government.\u00a0 Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and the two countries remain enemies. Amos Yadlin, a former military intelligence chief and current director of the Institute for National Security Studies, an independent think-tank, said it was too early to determine whether the attack marked a shift in ISIS policy or just a local initiative by some of its fighters. He said ISIS has been very careful to avoid attacking Israel to this point since it has been engaged with so many other adversaries. But with its back against the wall in Syria and Iraq, he said they may be looking for a propaganda victory by targeting Israel. He said they were capable of far worse than a routine ambush. \u201cWe will have to watch closely in the future to see if this is a change of policy,\u201d Yadlin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a planned strategy.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

The sixth victim died in a hospital on Saturday night from medical complications stemming from a wild thunderstorm that struck Melbourne on Monday night, a Health Department statement said. Five patients remained in intensive care units and three of those were in critical condition, the statement said. Another 12 patients were in hospitals with less serious respiratory and related conditions. Monday\u2019s storm caused rain-sodden ryegrass pollen grains to explode and disperse over the city, with tiny pollen particles penetrating deep into lungs. Around a third of patients who suffered asthma attacks on Monday reported never having asthma before. The storm overwhelmed emergency services and hospitals in this city of 4.5 million people, with 8,500 receiving hospital treatment. The world\u2019s first recorded thunderstorm asthma event occurred in Melbourne in 1987, when hospitals reported a five-fold increase in asthma cases. Similar events have happened in the United States, Canada, Britain and Italy. The last major event in Melbourne was in November 2010. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

By Paul Kane November 27 at 6:36 PM Follow @pkcapitol President-elect Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud. As his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretary of state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton\u2019s tally of 64\u00a0million votes \u2014 more than 2\u00a0million beyond what he garnered \u2014 by suggesting without evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election. \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\u201d Trump tweeted late Sunday , one of more than 10\u00a0tweets on the recount issue. [ Fact Checker: Donald Trump\u2019s bogus claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton ] But Trump\u2019s embrace of the claim created even more instability around the election results from both ends of the political spectrum, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein leading calls among liberal activists for recounts in key battleground states to make sure voting fraud did not give the election to Trump. The charges and countercharges could present a highly toxic issue for the Justice Department, including Sen. Jeff Sessions \u00ad(R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, whose tenure, if confirmed, comes amid a long-running battle over renewal of the Voting Rights Act. The two parties are already locked in fights over ballot access, with Republicans advocating ID requirements and other limitations that Democrats say are aimed at suppressing the votes of minorities and others more likely to vote Democratic. Trump spent the Thanksgiving weekend out of the public spotlight, holed up inside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and continuing his private deliberations about building the next administration. Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now senior adviser to the transition team, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump and President Obama spoke by phone for about 45\u00a0minutes on Saturday, the latest in a series of conversations the two men have had since the bitter campaign concluded. Conway also led a remarkable rear-guard attack on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a possible secretary of state, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor was disloyal to Trump and should not be considered for the post. The remarks highlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whether Romney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment or instead whether a loyalist such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should get the nod. Rather than referee that dispute, however, Trump\u2019s only public proclamations came over Twitter \u2014 his favorite means of communication \u2014 beginning at 7:19\u00a0a.m. Sunday, when he lambasted the Clinton campaign for agreeing to take part in a recount of votes in Wisconsin spearheaded by Stein. \u201cHillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump then composed five tweets quoting parts of Clinton\u2019s responses at the third presidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator Chris Wallace that he would \u201ckeep you in suspense\u201d rather than outright promise to accept the election results. At the debate, Clinton had called Trump\u2019s answer \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201ca direct threat to our democracy.\u201d On Saturday, Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias said Clinton\u2019s advisers had been monitoring voting patterns in critical states to see whether there were any signs of foul play, particularly in the wake of hacking of emails at the Democratic National Committee and of senior campaign officials earlier this year. Elias wrote that no evidence of wrongdoing had emerged in their preliminary review. But once Stein\u2019s campaign formally started the recount process in Wisconsin, Elias said Clinton\u2019s campaign would join the effort even if her top advisers did not expect the outcome to change in any of the Midwestern states that tipped the electoral college balance to Trump. \u201cWe had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\u201d he said. Clinton\u2019s campaign plans to do the same if Stein, who has raised more than $5\u00a0million to help fund the recounts, follows through on plans to ask for the same process in Michigan and Pennsylvania. The total margin in those three states was 107,000 votes out of nearly 13.8\u00a0million cast, with a combined 46\u00a0electoral votes among them \u2014 enough to give the race to Clinton had she won those three battlegrounds. Clearly irritated by losing the popular vote, Trump suggested that the math to getting to the 270-vote margin in the electoral college made him come up short. \u201cIt would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited,\u201d he tweeted. Meanwhile, the extraordinary feud over his pick for secretary of state hit a fevered pitch when Conway took to three Sunday television shows to attack Romney\u2019s credentials to be the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidants who are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence the \u00adpresident-elect\u2019s decision. Romney\u2019s supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents \u2014 Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trump loyalists \u2014 have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt. Those opposed to Romney have been advocating Trump to reward Giuliani with the secretary of state position, stressing his loyalty vs. Romney\u2019s refusal to publicly say whom he voted for in the presidential race. \u201cI don\u2019t think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position,\u201d Conway said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d suggesting Romney went too far in questioning Trump\u2019s character and intellect during the presidential race. \u201cThere was the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.\u201d The Conway offensive, which began Thursday on Twitter and continued in her three appearances Sunday, led the echo chamber of opposition to the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich said most Trump supporters could not countenance Romney\u2019s selection for any high-profile posting in Trump\u2019s new administration. \u201cI think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority,\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News. Others inside Trump\u2019s orbit, particularly Vice President-elect Mike Pence, are viewed as Romney supporters, believing he has a steady hand that would benefit Trump in the turbulent world of diplomacy, according to people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also has a long-standing relationship with Romney since he served as Republican National Committee chairman during Romney\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid. Infighting over such a prominent position is not unusual. Four years ago, President Obama faced internal division over his choice to succeed Clinton as secretary of state, with one possibility being Susan E. Rice, who had been a longtime Obama confidant. Senate Democrats preferred their colleague, John F. Kerry, and eventually Obama made Rice his national security adviser and gave Kerry the State Department. However, that internal Democratic feud played out in the traditional Washington manner \u2014 behind closed doors and in anonymous background quotes to news outlets. Today\u2019s Republican battle has been carried out in an unusually public fashion that left some old Washington hands stunned and wondering whether this would be the new normal over the next four years. \u201cI have never, ever, seen any aide to a POTUS or PEOTUS publicly try and box the boss in like this. Extraordinary,\u201d David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns, wrote on Twitter, using the acronyms for president and president-elect. Axelrod later questioned whether Conway was assigned the job of trashing Romney, or else it was an \u201cunbelievable breach\u201d for a staffer to do so while Trump was still making his choice.

Marco Rubio called the death of Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro a \"historical milestone\" and recommended President-elect Donald Trump not retroactively remove protections for undocumented immigrants established by the Obama administration in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. Rubio, R-Fla., also weighed in on Trump's transition to the White House and declined to publicly support Trump's nominee for Attorney General. Additionally, he commented on the need for a congressional look into the WikiLeaks hacks. CUBA A Cuban-American himself, Rubio reacted to the death of Fidel Castro over the weekend, saying it was a \"historical milestone\" and a \"psychological\" milestone \"for a lot of people.\" Rubio, who has been critical of Pres. Obama's actions on Cuba, said he wants to \"look at all the changes that were made,\" while adding that \"our goal is not to punish\" Cubans. A portrait of Fidel Castro is surrounded by flowers outside Cuba's embassy in Santiago, Chile. Esteban Felix / AP \"I have never said that I'm against all changes to Cuba policy,\" he added. \"I'm just against unilateral changes from which we get nothing in return for our country or for the freedom or liberty of the Cuban people.\" DACA President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back many of President Obama's executive orders, drawing concerns from undocumented immigrants who have been protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Rubio said he would recommend that Trump not \"retroactively remove their status\" but he also said people should not be allowed to apply for renewal. \"People already have it, so someone has that DACA permit but it is not indefinite, it expires,\" he said. \"And what I would say is if you have it, then you have it for the remainder of that period of time but you will not be able to renew it.\" That time is needed, Rubio said, for \"border security, modernization\" and to then move to a more \"reasonable\" system \"for people like those who came here as children, or those who have been here for a long time who are not criminals, to allow them to attain some legal status through a legal way \u2014 not an unconstitutional way, which is what DACA is.\" Related: Professors, Students 'Uncertain' About Futures of Undocumented Peers TRANSITION APPOINTMENTS On appointments to President-elect Trump's incoming administration, Rubio has offered public praise of Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director and Gov. Nikki Haley as UN Ambassador, but not for fellow Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. Rubio explained Pompeo's and Haley's nominations will both come through committees he sits on, before they reach the full Senate, while Sessions' nomination will not. Rubio was not ready to say publicly if he'll support Sessions' confirmation: \"No, I never do, until that person works their way through the process.\" Play ",

Trump currently has 290 Electoral College votes according to the Associated Press, well more than the 270 he needs to win the presidency. That total is expected to grow when Michigan certifies its vote on Monday. Trump leads in that state by more than 10,000 votes and the state's 16 Electoral College votes would push Trump's total over 300. Trump started tweeting on Sunday amid a push for recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Those states essentially delivered Trump victory in the presidential election, as they had made up the Democrats' so-called \"blue wall\" \u2014 industrial states that secured victories for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Trump's tweets over the weekend have both criticized the calls for recounts in the three key industrial states he won, while simultaneously raising questions about the integrity of the vote nationwide. Trump tweeted another claim without evidence on Sunday evening, regarding voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California \u2014 all states Clinton won. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla responded with a statement: \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\" As the recount proceeds in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton's legal team will participate, citing concerns from supporters over the integrity of the vote, though the campaign says it has not seen any evidence to support those concerns. Jill Stein told NPR that she does not expect the outcome to change. Trump's margins in the states in question measure in the tens of thousands. Recounts have generally only had an impact on the result of an election when the margins are in the range of several hundred. Stein and Clinton's teams cited concerns over the integrity of voting systems, which Trump himself discussed during the campaign. He would often say that the only way he could lose would be if the election was \"stolen\" and Clinton called Trump's remark in a debate that he might not accept the results if he lost \"horrifying.\" Clinton conceded the race to Trump in the early morning hours of Nov. 9 and gave a speech later that day declaring, \"Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" The former Democratic nominee is not pulling back from that position, and her campaign is trying to distinguish between its decision to have legal representatives participate in the Wisconsin recount and actually promoting it, which the campaign says it has not done. \"Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,\" Marc Elias, the general counsel for Clinton's campaign, wrote on Saturday . But Elias also said the campaign had received \"hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton.\" No evidence has emerged to support those claims. Wisconsin granted the request for a recount on Friday. It's expected to start at some point this week. It will have to be completed by Dec. 13, in compliance with federal law that requires any recounts to be finished 35 days after the election. In Wisconsin, the request came from Stein and independent candidate Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, and they will have to cover the costs of the recount. Stein has raised more than $6 million in support of these efforts. The deadline to formally request a recount in Pennsylvania, where Trump had his biggest margin of victory of the three states in question, is Monday. Michigan appears to be Trump's closest margin of victory, and the state is set to certify the results at 2 p.m. ET on Monday, and then a request for a recount must be submitted by Wednesday. ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Nick Miroff November 27 at 9:07 PM Follow @nickmiroff HAVANA \u2014 Fidel Castro once called George W. Bush a \u201cfunctional illiterate.\u201d President Ronald Reagan was \u201cthe worst terrorist in the history of mankind,\u201d Castro said, with ideas \u201cfrom the Buffalo Bill era.\u201d Castro thrived on confrontation with U.S. leaders, and he almost surely would have enjoyed facing off against America\u2019s next one. In his statement Saturday on Castro\u2019s death , President-elect Donald Trump denounced him as \u201ca brutal dictator,\u201d and that\u2019s the sort of dig that wouldn\u2019t have gone unanswered in the past. But brinkmanship and barb-throwing are not the forte of his successor, Ra\u00fal Castro, who replaced his elder sibling as president a decade ago. Ra\u00fal Castro, 85, has refrained from criticizing Trump and even sent congratulations after his win. Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s plans to secure the legacy of his brother\u2019s 1959 Cuban Revolution appear to be on a collision course with the incoming Trump administration, whose top members said Sunday that Cuba would have to make significant \u201cchanges\u201d in order for the normalization path charted by President Obama to continue. Both Castros have long insisted they would never kneel to American pressure. If tensions between Cuba and the United States ratchet up again under a Trump presidency, it would be a new stress test for Ra\u00fal Castro and his quieter, more austere leadership style. Cuba will enter the Trump era with Fidel Castro\u2019s one-party socialist state firmly in command but without the supercharged politics and nationalist fervor he relied on to sustain it. The Washington Post's Karen DeYoung explains Fidel Castro's legacy in Cuba, and how it will affect the country politically. (Peter Stevenson,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) A return to more hostile relations with the United States could also bring a new crackdown in Cuba and further slow the pace of Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s modest liberalization measures at a time of stalling economic growth. Hard-liners in Cuba\u2019s Communist Party would gladly take the country back to a simpler time, when the antagonism of the United States \u2014 not the failure of government policies \u2014 was to blame for the island\u2019s problems, and the threat of attack, real or imagined, was used to justify authoritarian political control. On Fox News Sunday, Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, said , \u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some movement from Cuba in order to have a relationship with the United States.\u201d Castro would have to take steps to allow more political, economic and religious freedoms, Priebus said. \u201cThese things need to change in order to have open and free relationships, and that\u2019s what President-elect Trump believes.\u201d Obama announced in December 2014 that the United States would reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were severed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1961. Obama insisted that engagement with Cuba, including fewer restrictions on U.S. travel and trade, would facilitate the type of long-term democratic changes Washington had failed to bring about during a half-century of punitive sanctions. [ Facing new test, Cuba\u2019s revolution circles back ] But Trump said during his campaign that Obama didn\u2019t get a good \u201cdeal,\u201d and Cuba must do more. While only the U.S. Congress can lift the Cuba embargo, Trump could reverse many of the executive orders that have brought a surge of U.S. visitors here and a rush of new interest from U.S. companies. If Trump moves to roll back those measures and attempts to apply more economic pressure, the Castro government could dig in. During the last major peak in U.S.-Cuba tensions in March 2003, when Fidel Castro was still in charge, he ordered the roundup of 75 dissidents, sentencing them to harsh prison terms. A few weeks later, Castro crushed a spate of boat and airplane hijackings by Cubans trying to get to the United States, executing three men who commandeered a Havana passenger ferry and tried to steer it to Florida. But Cuba was a tighter-run ship then, where few dared to criticize the government in public. The government\u2019s security services are still pervasive, allowing no organized opposition, but the constant marching and mass rallies of Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba have mostly disappeared under the rule of his younger brother. Also, the government\u2019s monopoly on information has been broken. Millions of Cubans have cellphones, and more than 100 new WiFi hotspots across the island allow Cubans to go online and chat with friends and relatives abroad. Foreign television shows and news programming circulate widely on portable memory sticks. Fidel Castro\u2019s soaring rhetoric is no longer the soundtrack of Cuban public life. Ra\u00fal Castro delivers a speech every few months, choosing his words carefully and reading from a prepared text. A lifelong military man, he praises planning, modesty and preparation, and uses the word \u201cimprovisation\u201d as a pejorative. Those qualities helped facilitate the secret negotiations with the Obama administration on restoring relations, but they may not help him counter more aggressive language from President Trump. Ra\u00fal Castro doesn\u2019t tweet, doesn\u2019t give media interviews and shows no enthusiasm, unlike Fidel, for being in the spotlight. He could have a hard time leading younger Cubans back into the trenches of his older brother\u2019s \u201canti-imperialism\u201d with calls for more sacrifice and obedience. [ Cubans worry about what comes next after Fidel Castro\u2019s death ] Then again, Cuban national pride remains a powerful force on the island, and nothing stirs it like a perceived threat from a swaggering American leader, said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a former Cuban intelligence analyst who teaches at the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley. \u201cEven if there is no Fidel, do not underestimate the power of mobilization of Cuban nationalism,\u201d Lopez-Levy said. Intense Cuban nationalism \u201cpreceded Fidel,\u201d he said, \u201cand it will survive as a major actor in Cuban politics well beyond his passing.\u201d At a small snack bar called \u201cLos Afortunados\u201d (\u201cthe Lucky Ones\u201d) a group of young Cubans said Sunday that they feared Trump would take U.S.-Cuba relations into the past just as it seemed as though their lives were getting easier. If he restricted travel and the ability of Cubans in the United States to visit their relatives, \u201cit would be terrible for our families,\u201d said Yosbel Benitez, 30. His friend Ricardo Marrero, 28, who emigrated to the United States in 2013, was back for a visit. Marrero hadn\u2019t seen his wife and 4-year-old daughter in a year. But with the WiFi hotspots, he now sees them every day using the popular video chat app IMO. Two years earlier, it would have cost him $2 a minute to talk to them on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s what gives me the strength to keep working hard to bring them over,\u201d Marrero said. Air travel is easier, too. On Monday the first commercial flight from Miami in 50 years will land in Havana, and fares are less than half the price they are on the restrictive charter flights that have been the only option until now. Marrero wasn\u2019t eligible to vote in Florida, but he said he liked Trump and told his friends and family members not to fear the president-elect\u2019s plans for Cuba. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understands.\u201d The snack bar, one of the types of privately run businesses permitted under Ra\u00fal Castro, is directly across from the U.S. diplomatic compound, which Obama restored to full embassy status last year. Canada, Mexico and other nations had lowered the flags Sunday at their embassies in Havana in tribute to Fidel Castro, but the U.S. flag was snapping in the wind at the top of the pole. Read more: ",

Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog I\u2019ve been on vacation for a week and was expecting Bears titular general manager Ryan Pace to surface to explain this mess and what it means going forward. But no. He didn\u2019t he didn\u2019t come up for air. Publicly, at least. He didn\u2019t act like a GM who\u2019s in charge might act, and perhaps he\u2019s not. Maybe John Fox told him to stay hidden. Maybe the head coach actually is in charge of football operations. After all, Fox is the only one we\u2019ve heard from, and yeesh, has he ever sounded like a goof at times. Whatever happens with injuries and idiot players getting popped for performance-enhancing\u00a0drugs, here was Fox at his embarrassing worst: When asked why the Bears didn\u2019t run more against the Giants, Fox said the Giants had eight men in the box. When then asked why he didn\u2019t pass more, Fox said receivers were covered. Good game plan. Good adjustments. Good talk. Halas Hall Pass: Jay Cutler and the Bears QB situation The Tribune's Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell talk about Jay Cutler and the Bears' quarterback situation in this week's Halas Hall Pass.\u00a0 The Tribune's Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell talk about Jay Cutler and the Bears' quarterback situation in this week's Halas Hall Pass.\u00a0 See more videos Can you believe the Bears are paying this guy? Something has to change, or at least be answered for, and in theory the titular GM is the guy who can make those changes or provide those answers, although George McCaskey, the alleged driver of ownership\u2019s McClown car, could ask mom if she\u2019s \u201cpissed off\u2019\u2019 and maybe that would clear the tracks of this train wreck. Short of that, Pace was the person to find to answer for refusing to draft a quarterback, the inability to stock the roster with quality depth, the head coach\u2019s standing after a year of painful regression, the head coach\u2019s standing after choosing an ineffective offensive coordinator, the decision to dump such productive players as Martellus Bennett and Matt Slauson , and pages of injuries that might make you wonder about the team\u2019s sports science department or practice and training methods. So, because I\u2019m a pleaser, not a teaser, I checked around the city while on a week\u2019s vacation to see if I could find Pace. I went to O\u2019Hare to pick up my daughter on Tuesday, but I did not see him in United\u2019s baggage claim walking out of the concourse or, closer to what I was expecting, waiting there holding a sign with somone\u2019s name on it. When the season ends and the Bears get down to the business of evaluating not just what went wrong but how they can fix it, everything should be on the table. From the club's poor performance in the red zone \u2014 the Bears rank 23rd entering Sunday's game against the Titans \u2014 to how they tape ankles,...

(Brad Biggs) During a trip to Portillo\u2019s, the new one that opened on Lake-Cook Road in Deerfield, the woman taking my order said she had not seen him, but did I want hot or sweet peppers on that beef sandwich? On Wednesday, the woman working the register at Target didn\u2019t know who Pace was, and our waitress at Wildberry brought us more coffee and a box for the leftover Oreo S\u2019Mores pancakes (to die for, people). Thursday, Pace was not at our Thanksgiving dinner, nor was he at the Little Goat Diner on West Randolph Street on Friday evening, which is surprising when you consider the way the whole goat thing would fit him these days if, I don\u2019t know, such a thing as a Bears GM in fact existed. One last shot came Saturday, but Pace was not at Mio Caro, a restaurant on Wilson that apparently is BYOGM. Rich Campbell Marcus Mariota had graced the cover of Sports Illustrated four times before, so the attention was nothing new. But the fifth time was not like the others.

(Rich Campbell) So, maybe he doesn\u2019t really exist. Maybe he was just a\u00a0 hologram the Bears dragged out because a real-life GM like Phil Emery was too much of a joke. I didn\u2019t ask around Halas Hall because if such a person as this Pace character existed, he would\u2019ve surfaced there and addressed the disastrous state of the franchise and how he planned to change it, starting with the coach\u2019s future, the quarterback\u2019s future, everybody\u2019s future. But no. No dice. No Pace, presuming he actually exists as a carbon-based life form. If only this supposed Pace person were as good at making a football roster as he is at playing hide-and-seek. ",

    "text": "CBS News Francisco Lopera: They were getting disease very early in the life. It all began many years earlier, back in the 1980s when Lopera was a young medical resident. \u00a0He had read about small numbers of people scattered around the world who\u2019d developed Alzheimer\u2019s in their 40s.\u00a0 So when a 47-year-old man came into his Medellin clinic with Alzheimer\u2019s-like symptoms, he was intrigued and decided to investigate. Lesley Stahl: You met this one man and you decided to go to where he was from? Francisco Lopera: I decided to go to the town where he was living. Lopera learned that the man\u2019s father and grandfather had also lost their memories in their 40s.\u00a0 Then, a few years later, another similar patient came into the clinic, this time a 42-year-old woman from a town 40 miles away. \u00a0Dr. Lopera\u2019s then-nurse, Lucia Madrigal, asked if any of her relatives also started losing their memories when they were young. Lucia: They told us yes, that the father, the uncles, the grandfather, the great grandfather, so I started making a little family tree, on one page, and I showed it to Dr. Lopera and I told him \u201cLook what we have here. What is this? So many with the same disease\u2026\u201d And so began a detective hunt that lasted more than a decade. Lopera and Madrigal traveled all over the region, finding more and more people afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and compiling family trees.\u00a0 They thought it might be genetic, so Madrigal spent days at parish churches, poring over heavy ledgers where priests for generations had recorded village births, marriages, and deaths.\u00a0 Thanks to these meticulous records, she was able to trace the disease back hundreds of years, and to make an important discovery -- the different families were actually one huge extended family, connected generations back by common ancestors who had died young, with an unusual cause of death written down by the priest: \u201csoftening of the brain.\u201d This is what \u201csoftening of the brain\u201d looks like in real life.\u00a0 Fernando is 46 years old, a descendant of that second patient years ago. He started forgetting things when he was in his late 30s, and now can no longer speak, feed himself, or do just about anything on his own. His aunt takes care of him round the clock just as she did with his mother when she got the disease at the same age. Norelly is at an even later stage of the disease.\u00a0 Despite her appearance, she is just 58 years old. Patients were going from mild symptoms to complete dementia and then death within about a decade -- as Dr. Lopera showed us in these cognitive test results. Francisco Lopera: You can see, at 38\u2026 Even at age 38, this man struggled -- as many older Alzheimer\u2019s patients do -- to copy a complex drawing accurately. Francisco Lopera: At 45.\u00a0 And things got worse from there.\u00a0 Francisco Lopera:\u00a0 He lost more. At 50. Lesley Stahl: Ah! Oh! Francisco Lopera: At 51. Lesley Stahl: Oh! Dr. Lopera was convinced that what he and Madrigal were discovering was scientifically important, but even as they found more patients and more related families, he couldn\u2019t get anyone outside Colombia to take notice. Until 1993, when a Harvard professor came to give a talk about Alzheimer\u2019s in Bogota, several hours away. Ken Kosik: There was a person in the audience, Francisco Lopera, who came up after the talk and said, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s-- I have a family here that w-- has-- early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d Ken Kosik, now at UC Santa Barbara, was that professor. Lesley Stahl: A family. Could\u2019ve been four people. Ken Kosik: It could\u2019ve been just four people. But he started to tell me how many it was. And as I listened to him, I became just so absorbed and taken with what he was telling me that I changed all my plans, went with him to Medell\u00edn. And, we began a collaboration that goes on to this day. They showed Kosik what Lucia Madrigal showed us -- the family tree they had compiled based on all that searching through church records, for just one of the affected families, going back all the way to the 1800s. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: This is one family? Lucia: Una sola! (Only one!) It just kept unfolding and unfolding. Covering these pages are small squares representing men, circles for women. The colored-in squares and circles mean the person got sick with Alzheimer\u2019s at an early age.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Look, she had these sons and a daughter. And then it just kept going down-- through the generations\u2014 Lucia:\u00a0 Si. Ken Kosik: When we looked at the family trees, about 50 percent of the offspring were getting the disease. That\u2019s a clear signature of a gene. But what gene? Kosik connected Dr. Lopera with leading geneticists in the U.S., and they started collecting blood samples and searching.\u00a0 Within a year, a major breakthrough. They found a specific mutation in a gene on chromosome 14 \u2013 one tiny flaw in the DNA responsible for all this family\u2019s suffering.\u00a0 The discovery was published in 1997 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Lopera had identified the largest concentration of early onset Alzheimer\u2019s cases in the world. Lesley Stahl: If a person has that mutation, do they get Alzheimer\u2019s? Ken Kosik: Yes, they do. Lesley Stahl: If they have it, they definitely get the disease. Ken Kosik: Right. There are some mutations where you don\u2019t definitely get it. But this is a bad one. And if you have this mutation, you get it. For families like Alonso\u2019s, discovering the mutation was a blessing \u2013 a crucial first step toward finding a way to fight the disease.\u00a0 But it was also a curse, because it meant that anyone whose parent had the mutation has a 50/50 chance of having inherited it too. Lesley Stahl: Do any of you know if you have that mutation? Do you know? Victor: No. Freddie: Nobody knows. Lesley Stahl: Nobody knows. Well, somebody knows.\u00a0 Dr. Lopera and his team have been testing for the mutation and compiling a database, but their policy is not to tell family members if they have the mutation or not -- and not even to reveal the results to Dr. Lopera -- since at this point there is nothing that can be done to help.\u00a0 Cecilia: Sometimes I ask, which one will get it? But I throw that thought away, because I don\u2019t want to think about that. I pray a lot to God that none of them gets it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see my children with that disease. Lesley Stahl: Each one of you knows, because of your father, that you have a 50/50 chance. So what kind of a weight does that put on you, day in and day out? Julio: I\u2019ve even prayed to God that if there\u2019s one person who has to have the disease, I say to God, \u201cLet it be me.\u201d Sara: I thank God that I\u2019m a nurse and that I would be able to take care of them, but I tell myself, \u201cFirst I had to go through it with my dad, the experience of the disease, and I may have to go through it with one of my siblings, or with several, we don\u2019t know.\u201d Sara told us she would love to have children of her own, but given her risk of developing the disease, she\u2019s decided against it. Sara: So that my children don\u2019t have to go through my same experience. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019ve been working on this 30 years. How do you cope with all this pain? Francisco Lopera: [breaks down] It was not the response we had expected.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: It\u2019s that hard? It\u2019s that hard. But Dr. Lopera knew that even in the midst of all this tragedy, there might just be a glimmer of hope.\u00a0 Because what he had discovered in these families -- hundreds of people destined to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, and easily identifiable with a simple genetic test -- presented a unique scientific opportunity to test whether it\u2019s possible to step in and stop early-onset, and maybe all, Alzheimer\u2019s disease before it starts. That part of the story, when we come back. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.\u00a0 More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s right now, and given the aging baby boomer population, that number is projected to nearly triple by mid-century.\u00a0 Yet unlike many other leading killers, there is no effective treatment. An Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is essentially a prescription for a slow descent into oblivion -- an inexorable loss of the memories, spatial skills, and ability to think that make us who we are. \u00a0 Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patients like the hundreds of family members in Colombia are a tiny fraction of the whole, but to scientists, they could be everything.\u00a0 Because they are offering researchers something they have never had before -- a way to test whether intervening years before people start having symptoms, might halt the disease in its tracks. Answers are still years away, but with more than a thousand Americans developing Alzheimer\u2019s every day, a way to prevent it can not come soon enough. The scene we witnessed in Dr. Pierre Tariot\u2019s exam room at the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute in Phoenix is one that plays out in neurologist\u2019s offices every day. Dr. Tariot: So if I asked you what city we\u2019re in right now, what would you say? Norm: Uh, you know, right, I don\u2019t know at this moment. Norm, age 72, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s -- the typical, late-in-life form so many of us fear. It begins with mild memory and thinking problems and spirals into full-on dementia. Dr. Tariot: Who is that young lady over there? Norm: Betsy. Dr. Tariot: Betsy. And is she a friend? Norm: Yes. Dr. Tariot: How do you know Betsy? Norm: Because I\u2019ve been loving her for a long time. Dr. Tariot: OK. Is she your sister? Norm: A little bit of both. Dr. Tariot: Uh-huh. Is she your wife? Norm: I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I think you\u2019re-- somebody.\u00a0 I wish I was, but\u2026 They\u2019ve been married 51 years. Unlike early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, there\u2019s been no single gene identified that causes this. No way to know who among us is destined to get it. Lesley Stahl: What percentage of all people are going to be get Alzheimer\u2019s? Pierre Tariot: One percent of us 60 or older will have a dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But by the time you hit 85\u2014 Lesley Stahl: What percent? Pierre Tariot: --that-- that percentage is approaching 40ish percent. Norm: That\u2019s a Dogan and these are Gogans. Pierre Tariot: Alzheimer\u2019s disease has been called out by the World Health Organization as the coming pandemic of the West. We have to do something to put it behind us. Claudia to female patient: Can you draw the numbers for a clock? But Dr. Claudia Kawas, a leading Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and clinician at the University of California Irvine, says she\u2019s frustrated that she can\u2019t offer her patients any hope. Claudia Kawas: I have to say I\u2019ve been doing this now for a third of a century. And when I started, I just never would have believed we would still not be closer than we are now to making a real difference. It has been a little disappointing. It hasn\u2019t been for lack of trying. Kawas gave us a quick primer on the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in the brain after autopsy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Claudia Kawas: Every place you see a brown spot, that is a senile amyloid plaque. In contrast, you see these black things that tend to be triangular shape. Those are what we call neurofibrillary tangles. The relationship between plaques and tangles isn\u2019t completely understood, but because it\u2019s been shown that amyloid plaques build up in the brain before tangles -- and years before patients develop symptoms -- pharmaceutical companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars since the early 2000s developing drugs to remove amyloid from the brain, and hundreds of millions more to test those drugs in patients like Norm. Lesley Stahl: Of all the trials that have been done, what percent have succeeded? Pierre Tariot: About one percent. In other words, a resounding failure.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So what does that say, do you think? Claudia Kawas: Well, it says either amyloid is not the right thing to go after. Or it says we need to remove it earlier on in the process before it\u2019s made all the other things cascade after it. You know, if you give a polio vaccine once somebody has polio, you can understand why it doesn\u2019t work. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re saying that maybe those drugs haven\u2019t worked because the person already had Alzheimer\u2019s? Claudia Kawas: Exactly. And maybe if we give \u2018em early enough, it might work. But how can you test drugs on people before they develop the disease, when you don\u2019t know who among us is going to get it?\u00a0 Dr. Tariot and the executive director at the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute, Dr. Eric Reiman, realized there was a place where you could know who was going to get Alzheimer\u2019s --- Antioquia. Ken Kosik: And that\u2019s when my phone began to ring. By then, Ken Kosik had been studying the Colombian extended family for 15 years.\u00a0 Ken Kosik: Received a call from the people at Banner. And they said, you know, \u201cYou have this family. We know when they\u2019re gonna get it. We know who\u2019s gonna get it. Can we start treating before the disease strikes?\u201d Kosik connected Tariot and Teiman with Dr. Lopera, who by that time had identified hundreds of people who carried the gene mutation, guaranteeing they would be struck with Alzheimer\u2019s in the prime of their lives. Reiman and Tariot traveled to Medellin and met with both healthy and sick members of the extended family. Lesley Stahl: Is this particular family, in the world-- extraordinary? Pierre Tariot: There\u2019s nothing else like it. The idea that there\u2019s this concentration within roughly 100 miles of each other is-- just an extraordinary phenomenon. And a perfect scientific laboratory. To lay the groundwork for a large clinical trial, Banner flew a group of extended family members from Medellin to Phoenix for PET scans.\u00a0 One goal: to compare the brains of those with and without the mutation years before any memory loss began, when they were in their 30s.\u00a0 Dr. Reiman showed us the results. Eric Reiman: This is somebody who doesn\u2019t have the gene. They have no plaques in the brain. But in members of the family with the mutation, it was a different story.\u00a0 \u00a0 Eric Reiman: Extensive amyloid deposition in the brain. Lesley Stahl: That\u2019s the red. Eric Reiman: Red is more amyloid. But yellow is also amyloid. This brain had even more. The images showed that amyloid plaques build up in the brain more than a decade before memory loss begins. So if a drug could remove that red and yellow, maybe the disease could be prevented.\u00a0 Banner developed a plan for a multimillion dollar drug trial and convened a meeting with leading scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and representatives of the NIH.\u00a0 Pierre Tariot: The end of the meeting, each scientist was allowed to say one closing thought. And Francisco had the last word. Lesley Stahl: Lopera? Pierre Tariot: And he paused a long time. And you could hear a pin drop in the room. Francisco Lopera: I said to them-- \u201cWe w-- the families are waiting for you.\u201d Lesley Stahl: They\u2019re waiting for you. Pierre Tariot: That\u2019s the point when, you know, the goose bumps came, and we said, \u201cWe really have to make this work. We really do.\u201d And they did.\u00a0 With a commitment of $15 million from NIH, another $15 million from philanthropists, and the rest from drug company Genentech, the trial -- on an immunotherapy drug to remove amyloid plaque -- enrolled its first patient three years ago, and they\u2019ve been enrolling more people ever since. \u00a0 Freddie: They told me about the study and I said yes. I\u2019ll go right away, and anything that you need it, I am here. Freddie and all his siblings signed up.\u00a0 The plan is to enroll a total of 300 members of the extended family who are healthy and have no memory loss yet -- 200 who have the mutation and another 100 who don\u2019t.\u00a0 That way, no one will learn their genetic status just by being accepted into the study. Of the 200 with the mutation, half will get injections of the drug; the other half will be injected with a harmless placebo.\u00a0 The study is double-blind: neither patients nor investigators will know who\u2019s getting what. They have to come in every two weeks, for at least five years -- long enough to see whether the group taking the drug does better than the group taking placebo. Final results aren\u2019t expected until 2021. Lesley Stahl: Is this the first time in all these years of seeing these patients that you can actually offer them hope? Dr. Lopera: Yes, this is the first time. Because in the past we only offer them education-- better quality of life but no hope to have a solution.\u00a0 And now they have hope, a big hope. Lesley Stahl: What would be the best outcome? Pierre Tariot: Nobody who receives the immunotherapy experiences any worsening of their thinking or memory ability. Doesn\u2019t change at all. Doesn\u2019t decline. That would be fabulous. That\u2019s a stretch goal. And that would be just the beginning. Claudia Kawas: If it makes a difference for them, I think there\u2019s a reasonable chance it could make a difference for all the rest of the people who get Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And that of course is the ultimate goal: to help prevent the late in life form of Alzheimer\u2019s that we\u2019re all susceptible to. The hope is that one day every one of us could be screened and when necessary, treated before problems begin. Claudia Kawas: It might be the case that just like when you go to your doctor to get your cholesterol checked in your blood to see if you need drugs to lower your cholesterol, you would go, and get an amyloid PET scan, and-- it would be part of\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Routine. Claudia Kawas: --routine prevention. Lesley Stahl: What if the drug removes the amyloid, and they still get the disease? Claudia Kawas: I think that\u2019ll mean that there are other things we need to be targeting besides amyloid. Lesley Stahl: But will you say that the drug test was successful? Claudia Kawas: Hard as this is to say, yes. I think that we need to know the answer. The answer to whether the field\u2019s focus on amyloid plaque removal for the last 15 years has been a failure.\u00a0 If this test doesn\u2019t work, they will at least know they need to go in a different direction. Lesley Stahl: You know, Victor, all the other drug trials that have gone on for years have all failed. Lesley Stahl: You know that. Victor: But this is going to be the exception. This is the exception. Lesley Stahl: If it does work, this saves this community. Ken Kosik: Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing? Lesley Stahl: That would be amazing. Ken Kosik: To me, I am always impressed that these families that come from such a remote area of the world-- have the potential for informing all of us, globally, about a path forward for conquering Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The U.S. Supreme Court this week examines whether the nation's busiest state for capital punishment is trying to put to death a convicted killer who's intellectually disabled, which would make him ineligible for execution under the court's current guidance. (Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP) 0 Shares Email The U.S. Supreme Court is set to examine whether the nation's busiest state for capital punishment is trying to put to death a convicted killer who's intellectually disabled, which would make him ineligible for execution under the court's current guidance. Lawyers for prisoner Bobby James Moore, 57, contend that the state's highest criminal court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, ignored current medical standards and required use of outdated standards when it decided Moore isn't mentally disabled. That ruling removed a legal hurdle to Moore's execution for the shotgun slaying of a Houston grocery store clerk in 1980. The Texas court is a \"conspicuous outlier\" among state courts and \"defies both the Constitution and common sense,\" Clifford Sloan, Moore's lead lawyer, told the justices in written briefs submitted ahead of Tuesday's scheduled oral arguments. Such a \"head-in-the-sand approach ... ignores advances in the medical community's understanding and assessment of intellectual disability over the past quarter century,\" he wrote. Moore's lawyers want his death sentence set aside, contending his punishment would violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the Supreme Court's 2002 ruling in a North Carolina case that prohibited execution of the mentally disabled. The Texas attorney general's office says the state \"fully complies\" with Supreme Court precedents. The state points to its use of 1992 clinical definitions for intellectual disability as cited by the high court in its 2002 decision. And the office says it has consulted and considered more recent standards. The question before the high court \"rests on a false premise,\" Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller said, arguing that Moore's claim of intellectual disability is refuted \"under any relevant standard.\" Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Florida law that barred any other evidence of intellectual disability if an inmate's IQ was over 70. Texas uses a three-pronged test to define intellectual disability: IQ scores, with 70 generally considered a threshold; an inmate's ability to interact with others and care for him or herself; and whether evidence of deficiencies in either of those areas occurred before age 18. The state says Moore had a troubled childhood with little supervision and scored 57, 77 and 78 on IQ tests before dropping out of school in the ninth grade. He'd been convicted four times of felonies by age 17 but never was diagnosed with an intellectual disability as a youth, the state argues. It describes him as living on the streets, playing pool for money and mowing lawns. During the fatal robbery of 72-year-old Houston supermarket clerk James McCarble, Moore wore a wig and fled to Louisiana afterward, and had represented himself in legal actions, showing the required intellectual capabilities, the state contends. Moore's lawyers argue the state \"cherry-picked\" specific higher IQ scores, and that at age 13 Moore had no basic understanding of the days of the week or seasons of the year, couldn't tell time and couldn't read or write or keep up in school. Since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976, Texas has carried out 537 executions, far more than any other state. Moore arrived on death row in July 1980, and only five of the state's some 250 condemned inmates have been there longer. In 1999, an appeals court threw out his death sentence, ruling that the legal help at his trial was deficient. At a new punishment hearing two years later, a Harris County jury again sentenced him to die. In an appeal of that verdict, the Court of Criminal Appeals returned the case to the trial court for a hearing, where the judge decided Moore was mentally disabled and ineligible for execution. But the appeals court rejected that recommendation, saying the trial judge had disregarded case law. Eight of the appeals court's nine members participated in the case, and two of them disagreed with the majority. 0 Shares ",

The president-elect did not elaborate on his illegal voting claim. Clinton topped Trump by more than 2 million votes in the election, but her support was not distributed in key states. Trump captured more states and claimed victory in the Electoral College. As he has in post-election interviews, Trump said he would have campaigned differently if the popular determined the presidential winner. In a series of two tweets, Trump said \"it\u00a0would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College\" if he had focused on three or four big states rather than the 15-state strategy he employed against Clinton. \"I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!\" Trump tweeted. Trump's claim\u00a0of illegal voters drew derision. William Kristol , editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, said on Twitter: \"Every time you decide that maybe a Trump Administration could work out ok, you're reminded (as by his tweets today) of one obstacle: Trump.\" In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J.

    "text": "By Philip Bump November 27 at 5:15 PM Follow @pbump Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Charleston, W.V., on May 5. (Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Something has clearly been gnawing at Donald Trump. Sure, he won the electoral vote and therefore the presidency, but he lost the popular vote by 2.2 million votes \u2014 and counting. (Counting mostly in California, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won easily and where there are 1.4 million more ballots to tally.) Trump's victory is marred by that fact: He will be the president, but more people voted against him. With news that Clinton's campaign would join the Green Party's Jill Stein to review ballots in key Midwestern states, Trump went on a Twitter tirade, dismissing Clinton's decision as hypocritical and that it would end with the same result . (\"Sad!\u201d he added.) That's probably true. But he couldn't resist taking the idea one step further in another tweet Sunday afternoon. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Clinton didn't really win the popular vote, he's arguing, because millions of votes were invalid. This is one in a series of efforts to dismiss Clinton's popular-vote victory, efforts that have hinged on misreading CNN election results or random tweets underpinned by no actual data. In fact, this claim that millions of illegal immigrants voted is itself the result of a random tweet. On Nov. 13, Gregg Phillips, a former Texas Health and Human Services Commission deputy commissioner, tweeted about there being 3 million votes that were cast by noncitizens. We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens. We are joining . @TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged \u2014 Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 13, 2016 Phillips claims in another tweet that his organization (it's not clear which organization, but it may be VoteStand ) has a database of 180 million voter registrations and he confirms that 3 million of the people in that database who voted are noncitizens. He has been asked to provide evidence for that claim repeatedly, without having done so. Regardless, the story was quickly picked up by the conspiracy-theory hawking site InfoWars , a story that was linked out at the top of the Drudge Report on Nov. 14. When Matt Drudge qualifies something with \u201cClaim:,\" it's worth treating it with skepticism. The rumor-debunking site Snopes looked at Phillips's claim and found no evidence for it. (It also noted that Phillips has a history of implying that Obamacare will lead to the registration of millions of immigrants here illegally.) Phillips replied on Twitter, \u201cOne might imagine someone would have called me.\u201d That's easier said than done; when I was looking at this earlier this month I couldn't find a way to contact Phillips. An email to True the Vote , a conservative group focused on the issue of voter fraud (for which Phillips claims to be a board member), did not receive a reply. Phillips has said that he will release evidence of his claims at some point in the future \u2014 but not to the media . As of writing, there simply isn't any data to that effect. What's more, Phillips made his claim on Nov. 13, only five days after the election. Meaning that his data apparently came in before any number of states certified their results. One of the first to do so was Vermont , which certified its results on Nov. 17 \u2014 four days after Phillips was able to determine that his 180-million-person database included the votes of 3 million immigrants here illegally. Republicans and Democrats react to the announcement that Hillary Clinton's campaign plans to join a vote recount in Wisconsin initiated by former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Paul Mitchell of the California voter data firm Political Data explained by phone that it was possible that Phillips's group piped numbers from early voting into its database. About 47 million people voted early , including about 5.2 million in California. Mitchell notes, though, that in the nation's largest state, only about 15 percent of the early votes cast were by Latinos, meaning that if Phillips's data suggests that most of the immigrants voting illegally are from Central and South America, nearly all of those early votes would have had to have been from illegal voters. This is a massive undertaking infrastructurally, it's worth noting, requiring reaching out to individual counties in every state. What's more, Phillips could have blown the whistle before Election Day if the numbers were early voting data. He didn't. But again: There's no evidence at this point that this is the case, and the only claim to the effect that it is comes from a person who refuses to provide any evidence. When PolitiFact analyzed it , it noted past studies claiming that large percentages of immigrants voted illegally \u2014 but that the study in question was based on flawed data. One examination of a database of voter fraud found 56 cases of noncitizens voting, over 11 years. The irony of Trump's claim about illegal immigrants, of course, is that one way to determine whether thousands of noncitizens voted in this election \u2014 for which, again, there's no evidence -- is through a recount and audit of ballots, the very thing he was criticizing Clinton for embracing. (He also didn't win the electoral vote in \u201ca landslide,\u201d by the way.) But this isn't rooted in logic. Trump has been complaining about the voting process for years, and apparently winning the presidency isn't going to change that. That's the broader point that's worth raising. The president-elect of the United States is willing to embrace unproven and highly questionable data to raise questions about the electoral process even after he won simply to soften the blow of losing the popular vote. Trump has repeatedly suggested, including in his Thanksgiving message, that the country must unite behind his presidency. Casting the votes of millions of Americans as somehow suspect seems like an odd way to achieve that goal. Anyway, there's also this: \u2014 Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 16, 2016 Okay. ",

(George Ourfalian / AFP/Getty Images) Nabih Bulos There may be little common ground among Syria's fractious opposition groups, but they have long agreed that the country's largest city, Aleppo, is vital to their plans to overthrow the government of President Bashar Assad . With the city divided between the government and the opposition since 2012, its eastern neighborhoods emerged as the rebels\u2019 most important bastion, and a full takeover was to be the launchpad for a victorious march to the capital, Damascus, almost 200\u00a0miles to the southwest. But  Sunday, that scenario appeared more remote than ever, as pro-government troops expanded their hold on vital sections of eastern Aleppo, burrowing farther into the rebels\u2019 enclave even as thousands of civilians escaped into government-controlled areas to flee the violence, state media and opposition activists said. A day earlier, the Syrian army announced that it had seized a key neighborhood on the outskirts of the city\u2019s eastern flank, 13 days into an all-out government offensive to finish off the rebels. The takeover carried symbolic weight -\u00a0 the neighborhood, the Hanano Housing district, was the first to fall to the rebels in 2012.\u00a0 A damaged mosque and buildings in eastern Aleppo, Syria, are seen in a picture provided by the official Syrian Arab News Agency on Nov. 27, 2016. SANA / European Pressphoto Agency A damaged mosque and buildings in eastern Aleppo, Syria, are seen in a picture provided by the official Syrian Arab News Agency on Nov. 27, 2016. A damaged mosque and buildings in eastern Aleppo, Syria, are seen in a picture provided by the official Syrian Arab News Agency on Nov. 27, 2016. (SANA / European Pressphoto Agency) But it was also the beachhead from which government troops, on Sunday, were able to consolidate their control on the nearby neighborhood of Jabal Badro, according to SANA, the state news agency. Pro-government activists on social media reported troops also breached three adjacent neighborhoods. Later on Sunday, SANA reported the army had established fire control over the Hellok and Sakhour districts, which lie on the front line separating rebel areas from government-controlled parts of western Aleppo. The move effectively split the rebel enclave in two, while a ferocious rocket barrage pummeled other opposition areas near the center of the city. Even as troops advanced from the east, the Quds Brigade, a Palestinian paramilitary group fighting alongside the government in Aleppo, advanced on the besieged rebels\u2019 northeastern flank, according to the group\u2019s official account on social media. Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitor based in Britain with a network of activists in Syria, acknowledged the government\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In recent months, a large-scale campaign, backed by Russian air power and thousands of Shiite militiamen from Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, established a punishing siege on the estimated 250,000 residents living in the rebel enclave. Despite several counteroffensives, the rebels failed to punch through government lines.\u00a0 As the rebels retreated deeper into their enclave, thousands of civilians escaped to government-controlled areas through Hanano. State media said the armed forces had \u201csecured the exit\u201d of 1,500 people. The \u00a0Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number at 4,000, saying that an additional 6,000 had made their way to Sheikh Maqsoud, a northern Aleppo neighborhood controlled by a Kurdish militia, which has forged an uneasy alliance with the government in the area.

(George Ourfalian / AFP/Getty Images) Syrian state television beamed images of uniformed fighters running through thoroughfares near an important mosque in Hanano, as well as video of ragged-looking civilians riding on buses provided by the government to shelter areas in western Aleppo.\u00a0 In recent weeks, the government, along with its ally, Russia, had opened up humanitarian corridors for eastern Aleppo residents during unilaterally imposed cease-fires.\u00a0 Rebels who laid down their arms were promised an amnesty allowing them to return to government areas. Those who refused could take their personal weapons and receive passage to join other rebels in the opposition-held province of Idlib, west of Aleppo.\u00a0 In one bizarre initiative, the government even invited east Aleppo residents to a \u201cfriendly soccer game\u201d as a way to build confidence. Despite the government repeatedly exhorting the rebels through leaflets and phone messages to abandon their positions inside the city \u201cbefore it was too late,\u201d very few heeded its call.\u00a0 Instead, rebels shelled the checkpoints the government had set up to receive those who left. Meanwhile, the  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported gunfire near the rebel side of the passageways, and said it had prevented roughly 100 families from leaving. It did not specify who had fired the weapons. The government said the rebels had prevented civilians from escaping, and accused them of using residents as human shields. On Nov. 19, the U.N. special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, proposed that the government stop its offensive after more hard-line Islamist elements inside the city leave their positions, while the opposition\u2019s administrative bodies continue managing the city. Damascus refused, effectively sidelining the U.N.\u2019s political efforts in Aleppo, said regional expert Mouin Rabbani, a former member of the envoy\u2019s staff. \u201cI think it's fair to say that the U.N. under De Mistura's stewardship has been reduced to an incoherent spectator,\u201d Rabbani said in an interview from Amman on Sunday. \u201c[It] has largely forsaken its political role and responsibilities to focus on humanitarian issues.\u201d The speed of the opposition\u2019s fall in eastern Aleppo surprised pro-opposition activists, who accused the rebels on social media of betraying residents there. Commentators on Syrian television, meanwhile, exulted in what they said was an impending victory of the government. Pro-government activists, meanwhile, quoted a statement from what they called a \u201csecurity source\u201d in the army\u2019s operations room in Aleppo. \u201cWhoever thinks for one moment that the army and its allies will renege on their goal to liberate all of Aleppo city is delusional,\u201d said the source. \u201cThis is a final decision and there is no turning back from it.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

This is a bogus claim with no documented proof. Our colleagues at Snopes.com and PundiFact have already examined this claim, back when it was hot in the right-wing blogosphere, not a statement made by a future U.S. president.

One article described Phillips as being affiliated with VoterFraud.org but in reality he says he is the founder of VoteStand.com, supposedly an app that detects vote fraud. Phillips also has claimed that Obamacare is the \u201cbiggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world\u201d because it provided opportunities for voter registration.

Trump, who himself implied that he would not concede the election during the campaign if he had lost, used his Twitter account to declare that \"Nothing will change.\" He also reiterated that Clinton had already conceded the election. Related: Clinton Campaign Backs Jill Stein's Election Recount Effort: Lawyer Trump, however, also effectively offered his own support for the recount, providing a seemingly baseless allegation that he would have won the popular vote \"if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" In another tweet, he said without evidence that there was \"serious voter fraud\" in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat charged with ensuring the state's vote goes smoothly, called Trump's claims \"absurd\" and \"reckless.\" \"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,\" Padilla said in a statement tweeted on his personal account . \"His unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\" \u2014 Alex Padilla (@AlexPadilla4CA) November 28, 2016 It was unclear Sunday night where Trump got the ideas for his tweets or why he waited until Green Party Candidate Jill Stein's recount request in Wisconsin to raise the issue. Voting illegally is difficult, as Trump illustrated in a 2004 video in which he was turned away from three voting locations. It's hard to vote illegally. Trump himself was turned away from 3 polling places in 2004 b/c he wasn't on the rolls. https://t.co/tAW366jr7F \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) November 27, 2016 The president-elect said he could have had an easier campaign had he pursued the popular vote instead of the Electoral College. According to his Twitter account, the future commander-in-chief said he would have only had to campaign in three or four states instead of the numerous states he visited. It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-- \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 In the past, Trump has come out against the Electoral College. Previously, on Twitter of course, he called the institution \"a disaster for democracy.\" He also told Mitt Romney supporters via tweet in 2012 to \"fight like hell\" after Romney's loss, as he incorrectly believed the Electoral College had allowed President Obama to win. The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 President Obama won both the popular vote and the Electoral College by large margins in 2008 and 2012. Earlier Sunday, Trump directed his tweets at Clinton, quoting three instances via six tweets in which Clinton slammed Trump for suggesting he would not accept the election results. Hillary's debate answer on delay: \"That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free -- \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a - \u2014 Donald J.

I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind -- \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy.\" She then said, \"We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald -- \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump was responding to the Clinton campaign's announcement that they intend to back the statewide presidential election recount effort taking place in Wisconsin, which was led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Marc Elias, a Clinton campaign lawyer, said they would involve themselves to ensure a \"fair\" process for all involved. Related: What Happens if Donald Trump Loses and Won't Concede? Stein said she also intends to pursue recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, though she also stated on Twitter that she would \"do a recount in any state where the deadline has not passed.\" I will do a recount in any state where the deadline has not passed. Help my staff find state deadlines: https://t.co/VsruD0r8FR #Recount2016 \u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 26, 2016 Stein's campaign is trying to raise as much as $7 million for the effort online \u2014 and it had garnered more than $6 million as of Saturday evening. Stein also took some shots at Clinton's interest in the election recount, tweeting: \"Why would Hillary Clinton \u2014 who conceded the election to Donald Trump \u2014 want #Recount2016 ? You cannot be on-again, off-again about democracy.\" Why would Hillary Clinton\u2014who conceded the election to Donald Trump\u2014want #Recount2016 ? You cannot be on-again, off-again about democracy. \u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 26, 2016 Donald Trump's top aides on Sunday also denounced the recount effort. \"It is a total and complete hypocritical joke that the group of people that thought that they were nervous about President-elect Trump not conceding are the people that are conducting recounts in states where we won by over 68,000 votes,\" said incoming Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also slammed the recount effort on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" where she referenced the backlash over Trump's refusal to say he'd accept the election results during the third general election debate as evidence of hypocrisy on the part of Democrats now supporting the recount. Multiple media analysts have opined that president-elect might be using his Twitter account to distract from more serious news, such as the New York Times investigation into Trump's potential conflicts of interest around the world.

    "text": "Trump aide: Cuba has work to do to 'meet our demands' Jayne O'Donnell , USA TODAY 2:43 p.m. EST November 27, 2016 286 Shares A top aide to President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday\u00a0that Cuba must make some significant changes\u00a0if it wants to continue on the path of\u00a0normalized relations with the U.S. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, will be chief of staff in the Trump administration. \u00a0(Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA) Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman tapped as Trump's chief of staff, said that if a\u00a0deal for better relations by the Obama administration were to continue, the\u00a0Castro regime would have to \u201cmeet our demands.\" In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Priebus cited\u00a0Cuba opening up its economic markets and ending\u00a0human rights violations as\u00a0among the issues Cuba needs to show progress on. The U.S. severed ties with Cuba in\u00a01961\u00a0in opposition to Castro's communist regime. President Obama announced in December 2014 that he had ordered the full restoration of diplomatic ties to Cuba. In March, he\u00a0became the first president in more than 50 years to visit the island nation. The U.S. still has an economic embargo against Cuba that only a vote of Congress can lift. Trump didn't mention the embargo in his comments following the death of former Cuban president Fidel Castro nor has he been specific about how he would reverse Obama's diplomatic overtures. Former Trump campaign director Kellyanne Conway said on \u00a0ABC's\u00a0This Week with George Stephanopoulos that Trump is \"open to researching and, in fact, resetting relations with Cuba.\" Castro dominated the Sunday morning talk shows, and\u00a0politicians showed\u00a0less space between them on the dictator's legacy than most any\u00a0issue in the news lately. Senator Ted Cruz, R-TX, is shown during a November 2016 conference in Washington, DC. \u00a0(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) Republican politicians with Cuban heritage reiterated their disdain for Castro and all he stood for. \"This ought to be a moment where Cubans are dancing in the street because they\u2019re being liberated, but instead ... if you dance in the street, you\u2019re going to be thrown in jail,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on This Week. \"Cuba is not a free society.\" Obama: History will judge Castro's impact on Cuba, world Cruz said his father, aunt and her two closest friends in high school were all imprisoned and tortured under Castro, adding, \"and what they did to girls in Cuban prisons was \u2014\u00a0was unspeakable.\" To avoid any doubt about where he stands on Castro, Cruz said he is not going \"to be one of those people romanticizing him as a hero.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban-American, made similar remarks on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. He didn't, however, say he'd support undoing\u00a0\u00a0Obama's efforts\u00a0to normalize relations between the two countries. \"I'm just against\u00a0unilateral changes from which we get nothing in return for our country or for the freedom or liberty of the Cuban people,\" Rubio said.

Gerald Herbert/AP hide caption toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP People gather Sunday night for a vigil at Bourbon Street and Iberville Street for Demontris Toliver, 25, who was killed early Sunday morning in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Gerald Herbert/AP Updated 1:45 a.m. ET Monday: Police in New Orleans are searching for two male suspects in a deadly shooting early Sunday morning in the heart of the city's famous French Quarter. At a news conference, police said the two men knew each other and had had an earlier dispute. When they ran into each other on Bourbon Street, they began arguing again and then the shooting started at approximately 1:30 a.m. Update: A total of 10 victims were shot in the incident on Bourbon Street. One victim has died from his injuries. #NOPDAlert One person was killed and nine others were injured. Police say none of the victims \u2014 ranging in age from 20 to 37 \u2014 was an intended target. Eight of the victims are males, including the deceased, and two victims are females. The Times-Picayune in New Orleans reports: Demontris Toliver, a 25-year-old Baton Rouge tattoo artist in town to celebrate his birthday, has been identified as the man slain in the shooting. Toliver's brother, Joshua Davis, said Toliver was gunned down shortly after he and his fiancee left their Canal Street hotel. Aaron Washington, who worked with Toliver at Effum Underground, said Toliver was a devoted apprentice at the shop, often arriving early to work and constantly refining his skills in a mission to become a full-time tattoo artist. \"He was a very laid-back, carefree individual,\" Washington said, adding that Toliver was most always laughing, smiling and \"trying to show you his artwork.\" Article continues after sponsorship The Associated Press reports: About 25 people who said they were friends and relatives of Toliver gathered late Sunday and lit candles at the scene of the shooting. They hugged each other, some crying. Several men in the group appeared to pray. Five of the injured victims have been released from the hospital and four remained hospitalized \u2014 but officials say they do not have life-threatening injuries. The violence happened despite an increase in patrols. Authorities had prepared for a large number of people visiting the city because of two football games. The Bayou Classic between Southern and Gambling Universities was played Saturday night. And the NFL's New Orleans Saints were scheduled to play the Los Angeles Rams in the Superdome on Sunday. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu called the violence \"completely unacceptable.\" He told The Associated Press, that authorities will find the suspects. \"We will go to the ends of the earth to make sure that we bring them to justice,\" Landrieu said.

Sad\" Trump said in one Twitter post . Trump, who spent Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., expressed his recount\u00a0displeasure before his planned return to New York City early Sunday evening. More interviews for jobs in the Trump administration are planned for the coming week. Among the slots Trump is looking to fill: secretaries of State, Treasury, and Defense. The president-elect's comments about the recount capped a series of tweets in which he quoted Clinton's criticism of a Trump debate comment that he might not recognize the results on the election should he lose. At one point, Trump noted, Clinton described refusal to accept the results of an election as \"a direct threat to our democracy.\" The Clinton campaign announced Saturday it would participate in a Wisconsin recount sought by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and may join Stein-backed efforts in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Officials cited voter concerns about Russian hacking and other forms of alleged voting problems. While Clinton officials said they have seen no evidence of vote tampering, and do not expect the results in any state to change, they believe their campaign needs to be represented during any recount process. In a post on Medium ,\u00a0Clinton general counsel Marc Erik Elias wrote: \"Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" While Trump carried the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by a total of only around 107,000 votes, Elias noted that \"the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states \u2014 Michigan \u2014 well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount.\" Clinton supporters raised concerns about possible Russian hacking of the election, though the Democratic team and the Obama administration have said there is no evidence of it. Trump, meanwhile, charged the Clinton campaign with hypocrisy. \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in,\" Trump said in one post. \"Nothing will change.\" Trump made some appointments and worked on other transition issues during his time at Mar-a-Lago, including what aides described as a 45 minute phone conversation Saturday with President Obama. \"They've been talking regularly on any number of issues,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on NBC's Meet The Press. While Trump enjoys his\u00a0conversations with Obama and \"they\u00a0get along nicely,\" Conway also told NBC that \"they disagree on many things. That's not going to change.\" During a series of Sunday show interviews, Conway said Trump is also working with aides on how to avoid potential conflicts of interests between his actions as president and the many business interests he and his family have across the world. \"He has been talking to his lawyers, he's been talking to ethics compliance folks,\" Conway told Meet The Press. \"Everything will be done the way it needs to be done.\" ",

Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump's consulted the president on his Cuba policy and the two spoke this weekend. \"He's even been talking to President Obama. You know, beyond the sit-down they had 30 hours or so after President-elect Trump won the election, they've been talking regularly on any number of issues. They talked just yesterday,\" she said. The latest conversation went on about 40-45 minutes, she said, though she wouldn't offer details on what was discussed. But the two \"get along nicely,\" Conway added, despite their differences. A Trump transition team official later told NBC News that the president-elect and his predecessor have spoken several times since they met in the Oval Office two weeks ago. \"I can tell you from President-elect Trump's side that he very much enjoys speaking with President Obama, talking about the serious issues that face this country and the world,\" Conway said. \"They get along nicely. They disagree on many things. That's not going to change.\" In response, the White House would only refer to previous comments made by press secretary Josh Earnest noting that the Trump and Obama have talked since the first Oval Office meeting \u2014 and a desire to keep those conversations private. Play Conway: I'm 'Not Campaigning Against' Romney for Secretary of State 1:10 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161128010637if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/818427971969\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> It's one of many shifts in tone and sentiment from Trump following his election victory just weeks ago. Conway also suggested Trump was disinclined to pursue an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use, despite the fact that \"lock her up\" was a rallying cry for his supporters on the campaign trail. \"He said he wouldn't rule it out,\" Conway said on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" referencing Trump's recent sit-down with the New York Times, but \"he said it's not his focus right now.\" During her interview on CNN, Conway also wouldn't rebut reporting from the Washington Post, confirmed by sources to NBC News, that Trump has received only two intelligence briefings since the election and turned down others. Asked outright if he'd turned briefings down, Conway replied: \"I can't discuss that publicly.\" Related: Donald Trump Has Attended Only Two Intelligence Briefings \"What I can tell you is that he is the most engaged individual I've ever met, and brilliant to boot, and he is certainly availing himself of the information that is provided to him from a number of sources, including those intelligence briefings,\" she added. Conway insisted Trump is receiving \"a steady stream of information\" to prepare him to become commander-in-chief, including dozens of meetings he's held with elected officials and business leaders over the past few weeks as he's been interviewing candidates for his cabinet. One particular cabinet slot has taken center stage as a handful of contenders have waged a behind-the-scenes battle for the position. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former UN Ambassador John Bolton, among others, are all reportedly under consideration for secretary of state, but Romney in particular has faced public opposition from Conway and other Trump loyalists who believe his fierce criticism of the president-elect during the campaign disqualifies him. Related: Mitt Romney Lays Out Scathing Critique of Donald Trump Conway has made no secret of her concerns with Romney, tweeting out veiled critiques and going even further in television interviews. Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Conway insisted that \"I'm not campaigning against anyone. I'm just a concerned citizen.\" But she then went on to warn that Romney's consideration for the position has some feeling \"betrayed,\" noting the former Massachusetts governor still hasn't publicly said who he voted for, and aggressively criticized Trump during the presidential campaign. \"People feel betrayed to think that Governor Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump, now our president-elect, would be given the most significant cabinet post of all, Secretary of State,\" she said, adding she's simply reflecting what she's hearing from the \"grassroots.\" In another appearance, however, on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Conway did acknowledge that it wasn't \"wrong to say\" that she has personal concerns with Romney. Conway continued: \"I'm all for party unity, but i'm not sure that we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position.\" Romney infamously called Trump a \"phony, a fraud\" and unfit for the presidency during the GOP primary. But the two met last week and Romney has emerged as a leading contender for the secretary of state position. Alexandra Jaffe ",

    "text": "Rishard Matthews The  Bears\u2019 season continued its downward spiral with a 27-21 defeat at the hands of the Tennessee Titans on Sunday at Soldier Field. During their third consecutive defeat that dropped their record to 2-9, the Bears were outplayed on both sides of the ball for much of the game before mounting a fourth-quarter comeback. Marcus Mariota was 15-for-23 for 226 yards and two touchdown passes for the Titans, who improved to 6-6 on the season. On the flipside, Matt Barkley\u2019s first NFL start ended in defeat before a crowd of 48,408 on the lakefront. Playing in place of injured starter Jay Cutler, Barkley was 28-for-53 for 316 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Key drops by Bears receivers didn\u2019t help Barkley\u2019s bid for his first career victory. The Bears took the lead in the game when Barkley found Daniel Brown for a 7-yard score late in the first quarter. But the Titans reeled off 27 consecutive points starting with a Derrick Henry 11-yard run to tie it.Mariota then hit Delanie Walker with a 4-yard TD pass and followed that with a 29-yard scoring strike to a diving Rishard Matthews. Ryan Succop then booted two field goals to extend the Titans\u2019 lead to 27-7. The Bears cut the deficit to 27-14 midway through to the fourth when Barkley connected with Marquess Wilson on an 8-yard TD pass. A Barkley to Deonte Thompson 6-yard TD pass got the Bears to within 27-21 but they couldn\u2019t finish off the comeback. \u2014 Chris Kuc ",

(WFAA-TV) A former Marine who stole a combat veteran\u2019s story of valor and scammed the government out of a house and benefits is facing 21 years in jail for his crimes, WFAA reported. The family of Casey Owens, a Marine who lost both of his legs in 2004 when his Humvee hit an anti-tank mine and then killed himself after a decade of pain and fighting the Veterans Administration, tells the station that Brandon Blackstone is no hero for what he did. \u201cIt took my breath away that someone would do something like that,\u201d his sister Lezleigh Owens Kleibrink of Trophy Club, Texas, said. Blackstone, of Arlington, recently pleaded guilty to defrauding the government. He faces sentencing in February. Blackstone and Owens were in the same unit in Iraq. His deception unraveled when he showed a picture of the mangled Humvee to one of Owens\u2019 Marine buddies who witnessed the explosion. \u201cThe only thing I can figure out is that he convinced himself,\u201d Kleibrink told the station, referring to Blackstone. She said she will attend the sentencing with her mother. \u201cI just want it to be a closed case so that these guys know their Marine is OK,\u201d she told the station, referring to her brother's unit pals. \u201cHe's standing at the gates of Valhalla. And he's proud of them. And they're proud of him. That's what matters most to me.\u201d WFAA reports that for years Blackstone told audiences how he earned a Purple Heart when his Humvee ran over a land mine, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury. The VA paid him monthly disability benefits and a charity bought him a house, the station reported. In truth he left Iraq with appendicitis. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP November 27, 2016, 12:45 PM Veterans protest Hampshire College decision to stop flying U.S. flag A worker takes down a flag at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., in 2006. CBS Boston Email Last Updated Nov 27, 2016 3:34 PM EST AMHERST, Mass. -\u00a0Veterans protested Sunday at a western Massachusetts college facing criticism from around the country for its decision to stop flying U.S. flags after students allegedly burned a flag in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election. Dozens of veterans and other demonstrators held American flags and chanted \u201cU.S.A.\u201d at Hampshire College in Amherst on Sunday, in what organizers called a \u201cpeaceful demonstration of freedom.\u201d Local veterans and others intended to place hundreds of U.S. flags on the streets around the college. College officials decided to indefinitely stop flying flags earlier this month after the main flag in the center of campus was burned after students lowered the banner to half-staff. Officials replaced the flag, but it was lowered again. School officials say they welcome peaceful discussions about the flag decision. In a statement about their decision to remove the flag, college officials said: \u201cThis decision is not and was never a commentary on the presidential election.\u201d Clarifying the statement, Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash told CBS Boston he knows it\u2019s a controversial decision to remove the flag, but he wanted to create a dialogue among those with differing opinions about the symbol. \u201cThere were a range of views on campus, including people whose experience growing up have made the flag a symbol of fear, which was strengthened by the toxic language during the campaign, and people for whom the flag is the symbol of all that\u2019s best throughout the country,\u201d said Lash. He said the trouble started with a gesture meant to help provoke \u201cmeaningful and respectful dialogue\u201d on campus\u2013a stance he outlined in a\u00a0 post on the college\u2019s Facebook page . In that post, he said the Board of Trustees decided to fly the flag at half-staff due to the \u201cenvironment of escalating hate-based violence\u201d in the wake of the election. Lash said the gesture was also meant to be an \u201cexpression of grief\u201d over deaths around the world, including those of U.S. service members. But, the move didn\u2019t work as planned and many\u2013especially veterans and families of veterans in the Hampshire College family\u2013saw it as being disrespectful of the tradition of expressing mourning on a national level. \u201cFrankly, doing that, it didn\u2019t help,\u201d he said. \u201cFlying the flag at half-mast just created more controversy.\u201d On Veterans Day, someone removed the flag and burned it. \u201cIn the middle of the night, we have no idea who did it or even why,\u201d said Lash. So that\u2019s why they decided to take down the U.S. flag\u2013and all flags\u2013on campus. \u201cThe flag had become a heated symbol that was making that more difficult,\u201d Lash said. \u201cWe really feel our community needs a conversation in which both sides listen to each other, and we wish the nation would have that kind of dialogue. We felt that if we could stop arguing about the symbol, we could get to the underlying issues.\u201d Of course, that decision has created even more backlash, and Lash said there \u201ccertainly is\u201d a lot of anger about the decision. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Authorities said police have arrested two people on weapons charges. USA TODAY NETWORK A crime scene technician collects a shell casing as New Orleans police investigate a fatal shooting at Iberville and Bourbon streets early Nov. 27, 2016. (Photo: Michael DeMocker, AP) New Orleans' historic Bourbon Street exploded in violence and chaos early Sunday when a shooting rampage left one person dead and nine others injured and sent panicked partygoers racing through the streets of the French Quarter. Several officers on patrol after the Bayou Classic, a football showdown between Grambling State University and Southern University, heard the gunshots and quickly responded\u00a0just before 1:30 a.m. CT,\u00a0Chief Michael Harrison said during a news conference. \"This was not the place or time to bring firearms,\" Harrison said.\u00a0\"We've\u00a0made that clear. We are going to pursue this to the fullest extent of the law.\" Harrison said none of the victims was an intended target. He identified the lone fatality as Demontris Toliver, 25, of Baton Rouge. Toliver, a tattoo artist, was in town to celebrate his birthday, WWL-TV reported . Mayor Mitch Landrieu said Toliver was a New Orleans native. According to Toliver's Facebook page, he attended New Orleans'\u00a0O. Perry Walker High School. Harrison said five of the victims were released from a hospital by Sunday afternoon. Four remained hospitalized with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. They ranged in age from 20 to 37 years old, police said. Investigators were searching for the suspected shooters, who fled on foot. Mayor Mitch Landrieu said the suspects were believed to be from out of town. He called the gun violence \"completely unacceptable,\" especially following a major city event. \"It's just a tragic end to what was otherwise a beautiful weekend,\" Landrieu said. Harrison said authorities had not immediately determined what prompted the shootings. Police arrested two men, a shooting victim and a bystander, on firearm possession charges. Detectives were interviewing victims and witnesses and reviewing surveillance video footage from the area, Harrison said. ",

Dakota Access protest James MacPherson / Associated Press Protesters encamped in rural North Dakota to oppose the Dakota Access oil pipeline say they will not leave even though federal officials warn that access will be closed Dec. 5. Protesters encamped in rural North Dakota to oppose the Dakota Access oil pipeline say they will not leave even though federal officials warn that access will be closed Dec. 5. (James MacPherson / Associated Press) Sandy Tolan Opposing sides in the increasingly tense standoff over the Dakota Access oil pipeline have found little to agree on.\u00a0But on this fact there is no dispute:\u00a0Sometime between 3 and 4:30 a.m. on Nov. 21, a young woman demonstrating against the pipeine nearly had her arm blown off.\u00a0 But agreement ends there. Depending on the point of view, the explosion that mangled Sophia Wilansky\u2019s left arm happened either because police launched a concussion grenade, or because a propane canister rigged by activists exploded in her hand. The horrific injury to Wilansky, who remains in a Minneapolis hospital facing multiple surgeries to save her arm, exemplifies the war of conflicting narratives over a portion of the 3.8-billion, 1,172-mile Dakota Access pipeline being built in North Dakota.\u00a0 Her\u00a0injury is the latest major incident\u00a0in an eight-month fight to define the pipeline battle as competing values of human and Native American rights versus\u00a0the rule of law, environmental protection versus\u00a0public safety. Pipeline opponents fear a spill would pollute waterways and say construction would desecrate lands tribes hold as sacred.\u00a0 The explosion that injured Wilansky occurred during a 10-hour clash at the Backwater Bridge near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The standoff began around sundown Nov. 20 and continued past 4 a.m. the next day. Each side, police and protesters,\u00a0portrayed the other as dangerous and violent. \u00a0 Videos showed white trails of smoke, showers of orange sparks, and clouds of tear gas hanging overhead as protesters chanted \u201cWater is life\u201d amid urgent shouting for medical assistance.\u00a0 (Sandy Tolan) \u201cIt was a war zone,\u201d Graywolf, 71, Southern California director of the American Indian Movement, said days later. Police, standing behind concrete barriers and looping razor wire, launched tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and\u00a0beanbag and sponge rounds, and drenched protesters with fire hoses\u00a0in the subfreezing temperatures. \u201cThese are the types of things more typical of trench warfare, not protests,\u201d said Noah Morris, who treated the injured as a member of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. Medics treated more than 300 \u201cwater protectors,\u201d he said.\u00a0Twenty-six were sent to hospitals.\u00a0Wilansky was air-evacuated to Minneapolis. Police portray\u00a0themselves as the victims of a \u201ccalculated effort\u201d by protesters to \u201dcause harm,\u201d saying demonstrators hurled Molotov cocktails and other objects at them.\u00a0The self-proclaimed \u201cwater protectors\u201d denied this, though some did throw bottles, and in at least one case a demonstrator\u00a0picked up a smoking tear gas canister and hurled it back at the police line. In recent weeks police have consistently portrayed the protesters as rioters,\u00a0a description repeated on nightly newscasts and by local talk radio hosts, who also have begun to use the label \u201cterrorist.\u201d\u00a0 Over the Thanksgiving weekend, North Dakota authorities issued a \u201ccode red alert\u201d warning the public \u201cto be on alert to any suspicious\u00a0activity.\u2026 Rioters in the area are intent on creating an unsafe environment for the public.\u201d The portrayal seems to be effective in the largely white towns of Bismarck and Mandan, where an estimated 1,000 residents met Saturday morning on a bridge over the Missouri River to pledge their support for law enforcement. Over the last few months, largely peaceful protesters have squared off against hundreds of militarized police wearing riot helmets and\u00a0flanking military equipment designed to absorb roadside explosions in Iraq. In recent weeks, outside observers have underscored a frequent protest chant:\u00a0\u201cThe world is watching.\u201d Earlier this month,\u00a0the United Nations called on the U.S. \u201cto take urgent action on the alarming situation in North Dakota, including the criminalization of indigenous peoples in their peaceful attempts to safeguard their human rights and fundamental rights.\u201d And last week Amnesty International alerted Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of a new \u201cdelegation of observers to North Dakota to monitor the handling of the protests,\u201d reminding him to \u201ctake all measures needed to ensure that the treatment of demonstrators is in accordance with international human rights standards and the U.S. Constitution.\u201d The protesters say\u00a0the use of hoses, and earlier, of dogs from the pipeline company\u2019s security team attacking water protectors, evoke images of the Deep South from decades ago.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s like the freedom marches of the 1960s,\u201d said Strong Young Pony,\u00a043, a member of the Chiricahua band of the Apache Nation in Arizona who worked on the triage team during Sunday\u2019s clashes. The dramatic protests against an oil pipeline in North Dakota began with the local Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which fears the project could contaminate its water supply, but has grown into something much larger, and more contentious .

And that could bode either ill or well for a nation that is so... (Scott Martelle) Last week in the main Oceti Sakowin camp, which has swelled in recent weeks to more than 5,000 Native people and their supporters, traumatized demonstrators showed swollen hands and deep purple bruises suffered from the many rubber bullets fired by police.\u00a0Medics reported seeing injuries to protesters\u2019 faces, thighs and groin areas. Police, however, accuse pipeline opponents of manufacturing stories in an effort to bring more sympathy to their cause \u2014\u00a0like their account of an incident involving a private security company\u2019s guard dog.\u00a0The story of \u201cthe 4-year-old girl being bit by a dog was not true,\u201d Kirchmeier said in a heated October discussion with camp coordinator Mekasi Camp-Horinek. Camp-Horninek, in turn, asked Kirchmeier why he \u201cwent on TV and said we had pipe bombs \u2014 that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\u00a0Kirchmeier acknowledged the pipe bomb allegation was incorrect, blaming it\u00a0on\u00a0bad intelligence.\u00a0 It turned out the \u201cweapons\u201d were actually ceremonial pipes, according to Angela Bibens, lead attorney for the camp\u2019s Red Owl Legal Collective.\u00a0\u201cThis is a profound cultural\u00a0misinterpretation\u00a0of\u00a0what are chanupas,\u00a0or\u00a0peace\u00a0pipes.\u00a0These are sacred ceremonial objects.\u201d On at least two occasions, the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department has alleged that demonstrators were carrying bows and arrows, only to acknowledge later that this also was not true.\u00a0 Now the battle rages over the circumstances surrounding the gruesome injury to Wilansky, 21, a recent graduate of Williams College. In an emotional news conference outside a Minnesota hospital\u00a0on Tuesday, her father, Wayne Wilansky, unequivocally blamed police for his daughter\u2019s injury.\u00a0\u201cIntentionally an officer threw a grenade that exploded right as it hit her forearm,\u201d said Wilansky, who said his daughter told him she saw police throw a device at her. \u201cThis is not Afghanistan;\u00a0it\u2019s not Iraq.\u00a0 We don\u2019t throw grenades at people.\u201d A trauma surgeon and advocate for the protesters who saw photographs of Wilansky\u2019s injury said they contradicted the police account of what happened. The photographs show\u00a0\u201cno evidence of any charring of the flesh or\u00a0burnt clothing that would indicate an explosive device such as a propane canister,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Lopez, a physician of Heartland Surgical Care in Leawood, Kan., and a periodic volunteer with the Medic and Healer Council. Police have vehemently denied their equipment caused her injury. \u201cThe injuries sustained are inconsistent with any resources utilized by law enforcement and are not a direct result of any tools or weapons used by law enforcement,\u201d\u00a0said North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Tom Iverson. Yet in separate interviews, nearly a dozen pipeline protesters\u00a0described the bright flashes, loud reports and concussive airwaves they believe\u00a0indicated concussion grenades. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you come into a vacuum,\u201d said Strong Young Pony.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re standing still and then you have a shock wave \u2014\u00a0a\u00a0movement of a wave, like a ghost\u00a0\u2014 someone walking past you that you can\u2019t see,\u201d he said. Another protester, Efrain Montalvo, 25, a representative of the International Indigenous Youth Council, said bright flashes left him temporarily blind. \u201cIt\u2019s like a white light, but then it makes you shiver,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just don't really know where you are.\u201d\u00a0He described having what he called a seizure,\u00a0lying prone while convulsing for 10\u00a0minutes. A Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department spokesman, Rob Keller, wrote in an email that the department does not use or possess concussion or flash-bang grenades. \u201cOur law enforcement ONLY deployed less than lethal munitions,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0 North Dakota officials suggest instead that it was protesters who rigged \u201cone-pound propane cylinders as explosives.\u201d Officials said they recovered three of the cylinders.\u00a0 Sophia Wilansky, meanwhile, faces a grueling road to recovery, even if she does not lose her arm.\u00a0Her father says she may not ever recover full use of it.\u00a0She faces up to 20 surgeries in the coming months. As she heals, protests will undoubtedly continue and, with them, the possibility of more clashes.\u00a0 On Friday the Army Corps of Engineers ordered that the main camp be evacuated by Dec. 5. The water protectors\u00a0already are saying they will not agree to this.\u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.
