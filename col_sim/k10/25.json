    "text": "House GOP business-tax plan upends U.S. policy, bares corporate fault lines By Richard Rubin Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The rotunda of the U.S. Capitol is seen, Friday evening, Feb. 18, 2011, as Republicans and Democrats square off over a spending bill in the House of Representatives with votes and activity scheduled throughout the night on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Fault lines inside the corporate world are emerging over a\u00a0proposed\u00a0rewrite of the U.S. tax code, pitting\u00a0importers against exporters. At the heart of the fight is\u00a0a Republican plan in Congress that would impose corporate taxes on imports\u00a0while eliminating them from exports,\u00a0a move that would upend decades of tax policy. The proposed shift in effect would curtail existing\u00a0incentives for U.S. companies to move profits and operations abroad, but\u00a0it would also\u00a0pose new challenges for some global businesses. Retailers selling imported products and refiners using imported oil could be hardest hit, while some exporters could see their tax bills vanish. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the big importers fighting the big exporters,\u201d said\u00a0Lisa Zarlenga,\u00a0a former U.S. Treasury official and now a partner at international law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP. The proposal is part of House Republicans\u2019 blueprint for overhauling the entire U.S. tax code and has been around since June. While still not legislation, it has gained fresh momentum\u2014and scrutiny from corporations\u2014since\u00a0the November election sweep gave the GOP the chance to advance its ideas with its newfound one-party control of Congress and the White House. Lawmakers must now weigh competing business interests to\u00a0achieve\u00a0the country\u2019s first major tax revamp since 1986. \u201cTax reform always hits different industries differently,\u201d said Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to rise above those differences that makes tax reform hard.\u201d Other crucial elements of the business-tax plan would also be a major departure for the U.S. and include dropping the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. Companies would also be able to write off capital expenses immediately but couldn\u2019t deduct net interest. ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook George Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management, is blamed for funding anti-Trump protests, a charge his Open Society Foundations disavows. (Photo: Jean-Christophe Bott, AP) Billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros has become the target of Donald\u00a0Trump supporters, who have begun organizing protests against the\u00a0prominent Democratic donor whom they see as contributing to civil unrest in the wake of the 2016 elections. The Hungarian-born investor, a Jew who survived the Nazi occupation during World War II and who has committed about\u00a0$12 billion of his fortune to human rights work around the world, has long been a lightning rod for conservatives for his support of progressive causes. That criticism reached a fever pitch online since the presidential election\u00a0as Trump voters and conspiracy theorists see Soros\u2019 hand \u2014 and wallet \u2014 in the protests that raged across the country in the days following the election.\u00a0It\u2019s a claim of financial support\u00a0Soros' Open Society Foundations\u00a0disavows. \u201cAt the end of the day, it seems like he's sending groups to create chaos and disorder for no reason,\u201d said Rochelle Winther of Los Angeles, who is circulating information about him on social media, concerned that Soros is promoting hate through protests. \u201cI don't see how that helps anybody.\u201d Instagram memes, Reddit organizing Soros has been lampooned on social media platforms such as Twitter and\u00a0 Instagram. \u00a0He\u00a0become the focus of organized campaigns in less visible corners of the Internet, where members of the Internet bulletin board 8chan discussed a campaign to expose \u201call heads of the George Soros Hydra.\u201d Members of one Reddit subgroup devoted to jailing Soros are planning protests against Soros on Nov. 26, with demonstrations in front of the Manhattan offices of Soros Fund Management and the New York City and Baltimore offices of his New York-based philanthropic group, the Open Society Foundations. A photo posted by Gucci Momaa (@guccimomaa) on Nov 19, 2016 at 7:28pm PST The Open Society Foundations says the notion that Soros is paying anti-Trump protesters is fiction, but says \u2014 with so many protests organized by so many groups \u2014 it's possible some groups the philanthropy supports may have been involved in the protests. \"There have been many false reports about George Soros and the Open Society Foundations funding the protests that have erupted since the U.S. presidential elections. There is no truth to these reports,\" \u00a0Foundations President Chris Stone said. \"The only initiative we are planning to fund related to the elections is to respond to hate crimes and speech.\" The Open Society Foundations this week\u00a0pledged $10 million to fight hate crimes.\u00a0The organization says it spends about $500 million annually supporting groups that promote human rights, democracy and justice, including grants to document stop-and-frisk practices of the Newark Police Department and to strengthen global advocacy for HIV treatment. One grant recipient, the non-profit investigative news organization ProPublica, partnered with USA TODAY\u00a0on election night coverage. Gannett board member Stephen Coll, dean of the\u00a0Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, chairs the Open Society U.S. Programs board. Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin describes\u00a0Soros\u00a0as occupying the center of gravity for the progressive funding universe for years. Reports that cast the billionaire in the vanguard of rich liberals who've pledged to fight the Trump administration's agenda from Day One may make him a renewed target, she says. \"Clearly he's going to be back in a position of leading the liberal opposition \u2014 and they've made their intentions known,\" Malkin said.\u00a0\"They want to be the biggest thorn in the side of the Trump administration. Probably that's where this is coming from.\" Koch brothers' counterweight This isn\u2019t the first time Soros has been painted as a villain. The financier became known as the \u201cman who broke the Bank of England\u201d for his high-stakes bet in 1992 that the British pound would be devalued (he netted a profit of around $1 billion through his currency speculation). Investor George Soros attends a Private Sector CEO Roundtable Summit for Refugees at the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 2016. His support of progressive causes has made him a target on social media. \u00a0(Photo: Peter Foley - Pool/Getty Images) Soros landed on the Republican radar during the 2004 presidential election cycle, when he emerged as a counterweight to the GOP\u2019s billionaire benefactors, the Koch brothers. He spent nearly $24\u00a0million in political contributions to\u00a0Democratic groups in an effort to defeat George W. Bush, according to\u00a0 research by the Center for Responsive Politics. Since then, Soros has emerged as the bogey man for the political right. Conservative television host Glenn Beck once described him\u00a0in a series of hour\u2013long commentaries in 2010\u00a0as a shadowy political \u201cpuppet master\u201d \u00a0who manipulates unions, the Democratic Party and the Obama White House. Beck\u00a0suggested he was somehow complicit in the Holocaust. Nationally syndicated radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has called the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre a hoax, this week labeled Soros as \"fundamentally evil\" and screened a clip of a 1998 60 Minutes\u00a0interview that he described as a \"whitewash\" of his role as a Nazi collaborator, a role debunked by Soros biographer Michael Kaufman. \u201cGeorge Soros has spent his life and his fortune promoting justice and human rights around the world,\u201d Soros\u2019 spokesman Michael Vachon said. \u201cThe alt right has manufactured conspiracy theories and delusional narratives to spread their false propaganda.\u201d Anti-Trump protests Protester Phoenix Singer, second from right, leads a chant before he and others march through the streets in Portland, Ore., Nov. 16, 2016. Approximately 100 students at Portland State University joined a nationwide campus walkout to protest President-elect Donald Trump. \u00a0(Photo: Don Ryan, AP) Soros became the focus of renewed attention, and in some quarters, outrage, within days of Trump\u2019s election. The conservative news site Breitbart started the ball rolling when it drew attention to a press release from MoveOn.org \u00a0that urged\u00a0Americans to turn out on Nov. 9 in a rejection of the president-elect\u2019s \u201cbigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia and misogyny.\u201d By the next day, sites like The Free Thought sought to connect Soros to the unrest, noting that MoveOn has been a recipient of the Open Society Foundations' philanthropy. MoveOn, which is best known for its online petitions and organizing, said it was\u00a0involved in organizing a single day of demonstrations. Amateur sleuths among a community of\u00a0 Trump supporters on Reddit claimed to have unearthed a smoking gun. Under the headline \u201cI Got Them!,\u201d one of member of The_Donald group claimed to have found evidence, on Craigslist, of non-profit groups paying for protests. Jones\u2019 website, Infowars, trumpeted the \u201cinvestigative report\u201d on Nov. 14, under the headline \u201cProof \u2014 The Trump Protests Utilizing Paid Professional Protesters financed by George Soros.\u201d The claim is bogus, according to the two non-profit groups whose help-wanted ads were cited by Infowars. Washington CAN! and Clean Water Action say\u00a0they were looking for people to organize around issues of concern, such as clean water or racial justice. \u201cBefore we realized what was going on \u2026 the phone started blowing up. We got all kinds of harassment. Three death threats. I heard the \u201cn\u201d word a couple of times,\u201d said Washington CAN\u2019s communications director Rosalind Brazel. Trump was among the\u00a0first to question the authenticity of the demonstrations that followed his election, describing those who turned out in cities across America as\u00a0 \u201cprofessional protesters .\u201d The allegations of fake protests surfaced again when people took to the streets\u00a0 in Austin, Texas , with suspicions fed in part by a viral photo of buses \u2014 purported to be of paid protesters\u00a0but later found to be connected with a data-sharing conference put on by Tableau Software . Election support Soros' contributions to a super PAC called Immigrant Voters Win, which was devoted to increasing Hispanic voter turnout in key swing states, and to a separate legal effort to protect voting rights in swing states \u2014 may also\u00a0have\u00a0fed perceptions that his wealth is changing election outcomes. He also contributes directly to specific election campaigns, such as supporting the successful bid to defeat Arizona's Sheriff Joe Arpaio , according to campaign finance records. Roberts: Soros spends millions to oust Arpaio It\u2019s not just traditional conservatives who are suspicious of the influence of big-money political donors like Soros, said commentator Malkin. It\u2019s also voters who were\u00a0attracted\u00a0to the anti-establishment candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"Citizens are skeptical of the influence big donors wield in American politics \u2014 whether it\u2019s George Soros on the left or the Koch brothers on the right,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a veteran of Gov. Mitt Romney's and Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns, who now works for a Silicon Valley startup Crowdpac, which tracks political donations. \"It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve seen a sea change in small-dollar donors this election cycle; Americans want their democracy back.\" Dawn Chmielewski\u00a0is a journalist covering technology and media.

    "text": "Colombia Government, Rebels Sign Revised Peace Agreement By joshua goodman and alba tobella, associated press BOGOTA, Colombia \u0097 Nov 24, 2016, 6:23 PM ET 0 Shares Star Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the head of the FARC guerrilla group, Timoleon Jimenez, shake hands during the second signing of the historic peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC at the Colon Theater in Bogota, Colombia, Nov. 24, 2016. 0 Shares Email Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos signed a revised peace agreement with the country's largest rebel movement on Thursday, making a second attempt within months to end a half century of hostilities. Santos and Rodrigo Londono, leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, signed the 310-page accord at Bogota's historic Colon Theater \u2014 nearly two months after the original deal was surprisingly rejected in a referendum. After signing with a pen crafted from the shell of an assault rifle bullet, they clasped hands to shouts of \"Yes we could!\" Thursday's hastily organized ceremony was a far more modest and somber event than the one in September, in the colonial city of Cartagena, where the two men signed an accord in front of an audience of foreign leaders and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon , all of whom were dressed in white to symbolize peace. Juan Jose Horta/AFP/Getty Images People gather at Bolivar's square in Bogota during the signing of a historic peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia known as FARC on Nov. 24, 2016. Santos looked and sounded tired after a two-month political roller coaster that saw him rise from the humiliating defeat to win this year's Nobel Peace Prize. This time the deal will be sent directly to Congress without a public referendum. He tried to inject a dose of optimism about the hobbled accord whose outlook for implementation is shrouded in uncertainty. \"In 150 days \u2014 only 150 days \u2014 all of the FARC's weapons will be in the hands of the United Nations,\" he said during the only part of his speech that drew applause from the audience of a few hundred local politicians and officials. FARC leader Londono used his address to call for a transitional government to ensure the accord is effectively implemented, a suggestion immediately denounced by the opposition as a veiled attempt to extend Santos' tenure past elections in 2018, when he'll be constitutionally banned from competing. The rebel leader also congratulated Donald Trump on his victory and called on the president-elect to continue strong U.S. support for Colombia on its path to peace. Juan Jose Horta/AFP/Getty Images People protest at Bolivar's square in Bogota during the signing of a historic peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia known as FARC on Nov. 24, 2016. \"Our only weapons as Colombians should be our words,\" said Londono, better known by his alias Timochenko, in a 15-minute speech. \"We are putting a definitive end to war to confront in a civilized manner our contradictions.\" The new accord introduces some 50 changes intended to assuage critics led by still-powerful former President Alvaro Uribe. They range from a prohibition on foreign magistrates judging crimes by the FARC or government to a commitment from the insurgents to forfeit assets, some of them amassed through drug trafficking, to help compensate their victims. But the FARC wouldn't go along with the opposition's strongest demands \u2014 jail sentences for rebel leaders who committed atrocities and stricter limits on their future participation in politics. Members of Uribe's political party are threatening protests against what they consider a \"blow to democracy.\" They also are demanding another referendum, which they are confident they'll win. Shortly after Thursday's ceremony, Santos delivered the accord to congress, where a solid pro-peace majority is expected to ratify it in as early as next week. \"I ask public opinion to reflect on what this means for the future of the country,\" Uribe said on the Senate floor Thursday, drawing attention to the fact that FARC leaders will be allowed to fill specially-reserved seats in congress before completing any sentences handed down by special peace tribunals. The lack of broad support for the accord will make the already-steep challenge of implementing it even tougher. Colombians overwhelmingly loathe the FARC for crimes such as kidnappings and drug-trafficking. Ensuring that the 8,000-plus fighters don't wind up joining criminal gangs rampant throughout the country, or the much-smaller National Liberation Army, will also test the state's ability to make its presence felt in traditionally neglected rural areas at a time of financial stress triggered by low oil prices . There's also a risk that peace could trigger more bloodshed, as it did following a previous peace process with the FARC in the 1980s when thousands of former guerrillas, labor activists and communist militants were gunned down by right-wing militias, sometimes in collaboration with state agents. That fear, although less prevalent than in the darker days of Colombia's half-century conflict, has become more urgent with more than a dozen human rights defenders and land activists in areas dominated by the FARC being killed by unknown assailants since the initial signing ceremony in September. Santos this week held an emergency meeting with his Cabinet and U.N. officials to discuss the murders, taking an opportunity to reinforce his message that peace can't wait. So far this year, 70 have been killed, according to Bogota-based We Are Defenders, more than in all of 2015 and 2014. \"We couldn't delay implementation a single minute longer,\" Santos said in his speech, alluding to the risk of a ceasefire falling apart if negotiations were allowed to stretch on. Once signed, Santos will introduce the accord to Congress, where a solid majority in support of peace is expected to ratify it as early as next week. Lawmakers will then embark on the nettlesome task of passing legislation so the guerrillas can begin concentrating in some 20-plus demobilization areas where they will begin turning over their weapons to United Nations-sponsored monitors. \u2014\u2014 Joshua Goodman is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/joshua-goodman 0 Shares ",

And I\u2019m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we\u2019re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. SULZBERGER: Well, since we\u2019re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We\u2019ve seen it personally. Straight up. FRIEDMAN: But you have an open mind on this? TRUMP: I do have an open mind. And we\u2019ve had storms always, Arthur. SULZBERGER: Not like this. TRUMP: You know the hottest day ever was in 1890-something, 98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M.I.T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was \u2026 a long time ago, he had feelings \u2014 this was a long time ago \u2014 he had feelings on this subject. It\u2019s a very complex subject. I\u2019m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what\u2019s this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I\u2019ve received so many environmental awards for the way I\u2019ve done, you know. I\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of work where I\u2019ve received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I\u2019ll say I\u2019m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that\u2019s true. Open mind. JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you\u2019re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn\u2019t connected? Advertisement Continue reading the main story TRUMP: I think right now \u2026 well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it\u2019s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now. They\u2019re really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since W. Bush. 70,000. When I first looked at the number, I said: \u2018That must be a typo. It can\u2019t be 70, you can\u2019t have 70,000, you wouldn\u2019t think you have 70,000 factories here.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t a typo, it\u2019s right. We\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories. We\u2019re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We\u2019re not competitive for a lot of reasons. That\u2019s becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don\u2019t adhere to the deals, you know that. And it\u2019s much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I\u2019m going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don\u2019t believe in it. And we\u2019ll let you know. FRIEDMAN: I\u2019d hate to see Royal Aberdeen underwater. TRUMP: The North Sea, that could be, that\u2019s a good one, right? ELISABETH BUMILLER, Washington bureau chief: I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Hillary Clinton. Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation \u2014 you will not pursue either one of those? TRUMP: Yeah, look, you know we\u2019ll have people that do things but my inclination would be, for whatever power I have on the matter, is to say let\u2019s go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad nauseam. Let\u2019s go forward. And you know, you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made mistakes, etc. etc. I think it\u2019s time, I think it\u2019s time for people to say let\u2019s go and solve some of the problems that we have, which are massive problems and, you know, I do think that they\u2019ve gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a tough, it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. So, for whatever it\u2019s worth, my, my attitude is strongly we have to go forward, we have so many different problems to solve, I don\u2019t think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very divisive, well I think it would be very divisive, you know I\u2019m talking about bringing together, and then they go into all sorts of stuff, I think it would be very, very divisive for the country. SULZBERGER: I agree, I think speaking not as a journalist now, it\u2019s very healthy. There, and then we\u2019re going to go Advertisement MICHAEL D. SHEAR, White House correspondent: Mr. Trump, Mike Shear. I cover the White House, covering your administration \u2026 TRUMP: See ya there. [laughter] SHEAR: Just one quick clarification on the climate change, do you intend to, as you said, pull out of the Paris Climate \u2026 TRUMP: I\u2019m going to take a look at it. SHEAR [interrupts]: And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on American goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to reduce, is that O.K. with you? And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. There\u2019s already, even just in the 10, two weeks you\u2019ve been president-elect, instances where you\u2019ve met with your Indian business partners \u2026 Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest Shortlist. TRUMP: Sure. SHEAR: You\u2019ve talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. People, experts who are lawyers and ethics experts, say that all of that is totally inappropriate, so I guess the question for you is, what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things separate, and are there any lines that you think you won\u2019t want to cross once you\u2019re in the White House? TRUMP: O.K. First of all, on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I don\u2019t think if they\u2019re run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation they\u2019re in no position to do that to us, no matter what I do. They\u2019re in no position to do that to us, and that won\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is costing, you know, what\u2019s the cost to it, and I\u2019ll be talking to you folks in the not-too-distant future about it, having to do with what just took place. As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest. That\u2019s been reported very widely. Despite that, I don\u2019t want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the laws, the president can\u2019t. And I understand why the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest, but I have, I\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world. People are starting to see, when they look at all these different jobs, like in India and other things, number one, a job like that builds great relationships with the people of India, so it\u2019s all good. But I have to say, the partners come in, they\u2019re very, very successful people. They come in, they\u2019d say, they said, \u2018Would it be possible to have a picture?\u2019 Actually, my children are working on that job. So I can say to them, Arthur, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have a picture,\u2019 or, I can take a picture. I mean, I think it\u2019s wonderful to take a picture. I\u2019m fine with a picture. But if it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That wouldn\u2019t be good. That wouldn\u2019t be good. But I\u2019d never, ever see my daughter Ivanka. UNKNOWN: That means you\u2019d have to make Ivanka deputy President, you know. TRUMP: I know, I know, yeah. [room laughs] Well, I couldn\u2019t do that either. I can\u2019t, that can\u2019t work. I can\u2019t do anything, I would never see my, I guess the only son I\u2019d be allowed to see, at least for a little while, would be Barron, because he\u2019s 10. But, but, so there has to be [unintelligible]. It\u2019s a very interesting case. UNKNOWN: You could sell your company though, right? With all due respect, you could sell your company and then \u2026 Advertisement TRUMP: Well \u2026 UNKNOWN: And then you could see them all the time. TRUMP: That\u2019s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world, which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal election, people said, \u2018Wow that\u2019s really a big company, that\u2019s a big company.\u2019 It really is big, it\u2019s diverse, it\u2019s all over the world. It\u2019s a great company with great assets. I think that, you know, selling real estate isn\u2019t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different, it\u2019s in a much different world. I\u2019d say this, and I mean this and I said it on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d the other night: My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I\u2019m doing, \u2019cause I don\u2019t need money, I don\u2019t need anything, and by the way, I\u2019m very under-leveraged, I have a very small percentage of my money in debt, very very small percentage of my money in debt, in fact, banks have said \u2018We\u2019d like to loan you money, we\u2019d like to give you any amount of money.\u2019 I\u2019ve been there before, I\u2019ve had it both ways, I\u2019ve been over-levered, I\u2019ve been under-levered and, especially as you get older, under-levered is much better. UNKNOWN: Mr. President-elect \u2026 TRUMP: Just a minute, because it\u2019s an important question. I don\u2019t care about my company. I mean, if a partner comes in from India or if a partner comes in from Canada, where we did a beautiful big building that just opened, and they want to take a picture and come into my office, and my kids come in and, I originally made the deal with these people, I mean what am I going to say? I\u2019m not going to talk to you, I\u2019m not going to take pictures? You have to, you know, on a human basis, you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we discussed, in terms of health care, in terms of so many different things. I don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it. They\u2019ll say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, so every time somebody stays at that hotel, if they stay because I\u2019m president, I guess you could say it\u2019s a conflict of interest. It\u2019s a conflict of interest, but again, I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the hotel, and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care. I said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d: I don\u2019t care. Because it doesn\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country. MICHAEL BARBARO, political reporter: Mr. President-elect, can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things that, for example, were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of Brexit about wind farms \u2026 TRUMP: About meeting with who? BARBARO: Leaders of Brexit about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to keep, what structures, can you talk about that meeting, by the way? TRUMP: Was I involved with the wind farms recently? Or, not that I know of. I mean, I have a problem with wind \u2026 BARBARO: But you brought it up in the meeting, didn\u2019t you? TRUMP: Which meeting? I don\u2019t know. I might have. BARBARO: With leaders of Brexit. MANY VOICES: With Farage. TRUMP: Oh, I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with me, just I mean, the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of all, we don\u2019t make the windmills in the United States. They\u2019re made in Germany and Japan. They\u2019re made out of massive amounts of steel, which goes into the atmosphere, whether it\u2019s in our country or not, it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other words, we\u2019re subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I mean, for the most part they don\u2019t work. I don\u2019t think they work at all without subsidy, and that bothers me, and they kill all the birds. You go to a windmill, you know in California they have the, what is it? The golden eagle? And they\u2019re like, if you shoot a golden eagle, they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them by, they actually have to get permits that they\u2019re only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird population, O.K. With that being said, there\u2019s a place for them. But they do need subsidy. So, if I talk negatively. I\u2019ve been saying the same thing for years about you know, the wind industry. I wouldn\u2019t want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just said, including the birds, and some don\u2019t. But it\u2019s hard to explain. I don\u2019t care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country. BARBARO: But the structures, just to be clear, that\u2019s the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president \u2026 Advertisement TRUMP: O.K. BARBARO: \u2026 are trying to influence something, like wind farms? TRUMP: O.K., I don\u2019t want to influence anything, because it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s not that important to me. It\u2019s hard to explain. BARBARO: Yes, but the structures? TRUMP: Now, according to the law, see I figured there\u2019s something where you put something in this massive trust and there\u2019s also \u2014 nothing is written. In other words, in theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business, which I am phasing out of very rapidly, you know, I sign checks, I\u2019m the old-fashioned type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer button, boom, and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It keeps, it tells me what\u2019s going on a little bit and it tells contractors that I\u2019m watching. But I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that\u2019s happening right now. But in theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly. And there\u2019s never been a case like this where somebody\u2019s had, like, if you look at other people of wealth, they didn\u2019t have this kind of asset and this kind of wealth, frankly. It\u2019s just a different thing. But there is no \u2014 I assumed that you\u2019d have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I don\u2019t have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don\u2019t care about my business. Doral is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in Miami. We own many incredible places, including Turnberry, I guess you heard. There\u2019s one guy that does \u2014 when I say Turnberry, you know what that is, right. Do a little [inaudible]. But they\u2019re going to run well, we have good managers, they\u2019re going to run really well. Photo Mr. Trump with New York Times editors and reporters. Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times So I don\u2019t have to do anything, but I want to do something if I can. If there is something. BARBARO: Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that is, you\u2019ll come tell The New York Times about it? [laughter] TRUMP: I will. I\u2019ve started it already. SULZBERGER: One of our great salesmen, by the way. TRUMP: I can see that. I\u2019ve started it already by, I mean, I\u2019ve greatly reduced the check-signing and the business. I\u2019ve greatly reduced meetings with contractors, meetings with different people that, you know, I\u2019ve also started by \u2014 \u2019cause I\u2019ve said over the last two years, once I decided I wanted to run, I don\u2019t want to build anything. \u2019Cause building, like for instance, we built the post office, you\u2019ll be happy to hear, ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of schedule, under budget, and it\u2019s a terrific place. That\u2019s the hotel on Pennsylvania. Advertisement Continue reading the main story FRIEDMAN: Just so you know, General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Carolina. Just so you know. TRUMP: Well that\u2019s good. But most of \u2018em are made in Germany, most of \u2018em are made, you know, Siemens and the Chinese are making most of them. [cross talk] TRUMP: They may assemble \u2014 if you check, I think you\u2019ll find that the, it\u2019s delivered there and they do most of the assembly. JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, White House correspondent: Mr. President-elect \u2014 I\u2019m sorry I entered late, but I did want to ask you about \u2026 BAQUET: You should introduce yourself. DAVIS: I\u2019m Julie Davis, one of the White House correspondents. TRUMP: Hi, Julie. DAVIS: I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy. TRUMP: I can\u2019t quite hear. DAVIS: Personnel. TRUMP: Personnel. DAVIS: You hired Steve Bannon to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the alt-right. He\u2019s been described by some as racist and anti-Semitic. I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government you\u2019ll run. TRUMP: Um, I\u2019ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right, or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn\u2019t even think about hiring him. First of all, I\u2019m the one that makes the decision, not Steve Bannon or anybody else. And Kellyanne will tell you that. Advertisement [laughter] KELLYANE CONWAY: 100 percent. TRUMP: And if he said something to me that, in terms of his views, or that I thought were inappropriate or bad, number one I wouldn\u2019t do anything, and number two, he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know him, and in fact, he\u2019s actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know him, and people that are on the left. But Steve went to Harvard, he was a, you know, he was very successful, he was a Naval officer, he\u2019s, I think he\u2019s very, very, you know, sadly, really, I think it\u2019s very hard on him. I think he\u2019s having a hard time with it. Because it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s not him. I\u2019ve known him for a long time. He\u2019s a very, very smart guy. I think he was with Goldman Sachs on top of everything else. UNKNOWN: What do you make of the website he ran, Breitbart? TRUMP: The which? UNKNOWN: Breitbart. TRUMP: Well, Breitbart\u2019s different. Breitbart cover things, I mean like The New York Times covers things. I mean, I could say that Arthur is alt-right because they covered an alt-right story. SULZBERGER: [laughing] I am, I am. I\u2019ll take whatever you say. I am always right, but I\u2019m not alt-right. [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: The New York Times covers a lot of stories that are, you know, rough stories. And you know, they have covered some of these things, but The New York Times covers a lot of these things also. It\u2019s just a newspaper, essentially. It\u2019s a newspaper. I know the guy, he\u2019s a decent guy, he\u2019s a very smart guy. He\u2019s done a good job. He hasn\u2019t been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that category, I would immediately let him go. And I\u2019ll tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think. DAVIS: But you are aware, sir, with all due respect, that African-Americans and Jews and many folks who disagree with the coverage of Breitbart and the slant that Breitbart brings to the news view him that way, aren\u2019t you? TRUMP: Yeah, well Breitbart, first of all, is just a publication. And, you know, they cover stories like you cover stories. Now, they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that\u2019s become quite successful, and it\u2019s got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean it\u2019s a pretty big, it\u2019s a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization. Graphic: 20 Things Donald Trump Said He Wanted to Get Rid of as President Now, I\u2019ll tell you what, I know him very well. I will say this, and I will say this, if I thought that strongly, if I thought that he was doing anything, or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would think, I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the meantime, I think he\u2019s been treated very unfairly. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It\u2019s very interesting \u2019cause a lot of people are coming to his defense right now. PRIEBUS: We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. It\u2019s been the total opposite. It\u2019s been a great team, and it\u2019s just not there. And what the president-elect is saying is 100 percent true. [cross talk] TRUMP: And by the way, if you see something or get something where you feel that I\u2019m wrong, and you have some info \u2014 I would love to hear it. You can call me, Arthur can call me, I would love to hear. The only one who can\u2019t call me is Maureen [Dowd, opinion columnist]. She treats me too rough. I don\u2019t know what happened to Maureen! She was so good, Gail [Collins, opinion columnist]. For years she was so good. [cross talk] SULZBERGER: As we all say about Maureen, it\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s just your turn. [laughter] ROSS DOUTHAT, opinion columnist: I have a slightly different, but somewhat Steve Bannon-related question, I guess. It\u2019s about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in decades, especially Midwestern Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on trade, entitlements, foreign policy, even your daughter Ivanka\u2019s child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose leaders, and Reince, may differ with me a little on this, but don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye on those views. TRUMP: Although right now they\u2019re loving me. [laughter] UNKNOWN: Well, right now they are. [cross talk] TRUMP: Paul Ryan right now loves me, Mitch McConnell loves me, it\u2019s amazing how winning can change things. I\u2019ve liked Chuck Schumer for a long time. I\u2019ve actually, I\u2019ve raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck Schumer. I had a Brooklyn office, a little office, in a little apartment building in Brooklyn in Sheepshead Bay where I worked with my father. And Chuck Schumer came in and I gave him, I believe, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s willing to admit this, but I believe it was his first campaign contribution, $500. But Chuck Schumer\u2019s a good guy. I think we\u2019ll get along very well. Advertisement Continue reading the main story DOUTHAT: I guess that\u2019s my question is, how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a Republican-led Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that you\u2019ll wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will say, well, he governed more like Paul Ryan than like Donald Trump. TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t worry about that. \u2019Cause I didn\u2019t need to do this. I was telling Arthur before: \u2018Arthur I didn\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m doing this to do a good job.\u2019 That\u2019s what I want to do, and I think that what happened in the Rust Belt, they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through it, you look back 20 years, they didn\u2019t used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory that\u2019s empty and rusting. Rust is the good part, \u2019cause they\u2019re worse than rusting, they\u2019re falling down. No, I wouldn\u2019t sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people don\u2019t take care of these people, they\u2019re not going to win and you\u2019re going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what you\u2019re looking at right now. These people are really angry. They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re workers, and they\u2019re angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in speeches, I say they\u2019re the forgotten people \u2014 they were totally forgotten. And we\u2019re going to bring jobs back. We\u2019re going to bring jobs back, big league. I\u2019ve spoken to so many companies already, I say, don\u2019t plan on moving your company, \u2019cause you\u2019re not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think you\u2019re going to just sell it across what will be a strong border, you know at least we\u2019re going to have a border. But just don\u2019t plan on it. And I\u2019ll tell you, I believe, and you\u2019ll hear announcements over the next couple of months, but I believe I\u2019ve talked numerous comp \u2014 in four-minute conversations with top people \u2014 numerous companies that have, leaving, or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs. FRIEDMAN: Are you worried, though, that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots? TRUMP: They will, and we\u2019ll make the robots too. [laughter] TRUMP: It\u2019s a big thing, we\u2019ll make the robots too. Right now we don\u2019t make the robots. We don\u2019t make anything. But we\u2019re going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re going to have more factories. We can\u2019t lose 70,000 factories. Just can\u2019t do it. We\u2019re going to start making things. I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, \u2018Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you\u2019re making your product right here.\u2019 He said, \u2018I understand that.\u2019 I said: \u2018I think we\u2019ll create the incentives for you, and I think you\u2019re going to do it. We\u2019re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you\u2019ll be happy about.\u2019 But we\u2019re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It\u2019s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can\u2019t, they can\u2019t even start up, they can\u2019t expand, they\u2019re choking. I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I\u2019m giving a big tax cut and I\u2019m giving big regulation cuts, and I\u2019ve seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I\u2019ve met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would\u2019ve never said that\u2019s possible, because the tax cut\u2019s going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they\u2019re leaving also because of the regulations. And I would say, of the two, and I would not have thought this, regulation cuts, substantial regulation cuts, are more important than, and more enthusiastically supported, than even the big tax cuts. UNKNOWN: Mr. President-elect, I wanted to ask you, there was a conference this past weekend in Washington of people who pledged their allegiance to Nazism. TRUMP: Boy, you are really into this stuff, huh? PRIEBUS: I think we answered that one right off the bat. ",

Jill Stein's website suggested that she had reached her $2.5 million goal about 3 a.m. ET Thursday. https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount However, she quickly raised the sum being sought by another $2 million. \"Raising money to pay for the first round so quickly is a miraculous feat and a tribute to the power of grassroots organizing,\" a message on her website read. The Green Party didn't single out any specific evidence of fraud, nor does it need proof of irregularities to call for a recount. Stein's party won only 1 percent of the vote. \"After a divisive and painful presidential race, reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable,\" Stein said Wednesday. \"These concerns need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified. We deserve elections we can trust.\" Related: Clinton's Popular Vote Lead Now More Than 2 Million A small but vocal group of scientists and activists has emerged in recent days advocating for a recount on the basis of Trump's unexpected win and concerns about Russian involvement in the election. They note that only a small minority of public polls predicted Trump's success, and although public polls have been wrong before, the magnitude of their error this cycle was unprecedented. Play Meet Pennsylvania Voters Who Swung the Election in Trump's Favor 1:55 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161125055222if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/817215555722\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> They also point to evidence that Russian hackers infiltrated the Democratic National Committee and potentially a top adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign as evidence of both ability and willingness. Hackers compromised voter records in Illinois and attempted to breach voting systems in a handful of other states before the election. Clinton campaign officials haven't commented on Stein's efforts, which hinge on the Green Party's ability to pay for a recount. Stein told supporters Wednesday that she needed to raise \"over $2 million by this Friday, 4 p.m. central,\" to put her plan to action. The deadline to file for a recount in Wisconsin is Friday, while the deadlines for Pennsylvania and Michigan are next week. Recounts are costly to conduct, and each state requires various fees depending on the size of the vote lead and how expansive the recount is. She surpassed her website's original $2.5 million goal by 3 a.m. ET Thursday. Within around 20 minutes, the sum had been increased to $4.5 million. And by 7:30 p.m. ET Thursday, that goal was only $200,000 away. A screenshot taken from Jill Stein's #Recount2016 website early Thursday showing the new fundraising goal https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount \"Now that we have nearly completed funding Wisconsin's recount (which is due on Friday), we can begin to tackle the funding for Michigan's recount (due Monday) and Pennsylvania's recount (due Wednesday),\" a message on her site read. \"In true grassroots fashion, we're turning to you, the people, and not big-money corporate donors to make this happen.\" A recount wouldn't change the outcome for Stein. She came in fourth, behind Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Clinton and Trump, taking a little less than 1.4 million votes overall. But there's a very small chance that a recount in those states could boost Clinton. Trump won Michigan by about 9,500 votes, Wisconsin by 22,500 votes and Pennsylvania by 69,700. Given the relatively wide margin for Trump and Clinton's narrow advantage in more traditionally blue states like Minnesota, it's unlikely that compromised voting machines were to blame. Trump aide Kellyanne Conway took a jab at the effort Thursday, tweeting, \"Look who 'can't accept the election results.'\" Look who \"can't accept the election results\" Hillary Clinton Supporters Call for Vote Recount in Battleground States https://t.co/D4t6HbPUXG \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 Most political observers agree that the more likely reason for Clinton's loss was an unforeseen breakdown in the Democratic turnout machine in key states, which meant Democrats simply stayed home. There was no evidence of any vote tampering on Election Day, and even flipping one state in Clinton's favor wouldn't give her the Electoral College votes needed to win. Related: N.C. Governor Files for Recount as Challenger's Lead Grows Last week, two experts advocating for a recount, voting-rights lawyer John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, made a phone call to Clinton campaign officials. The voting experts urged the campaign to file for a recount in key states, but their efforts, a person on the call said, were rebuffed. \"While many of us were hoping Clinton's campaign would pursue this, it seems clear they won't, because they said there's no clear proof of fraud\" at the ballot box, which candidates typically cite in calling for a recount, that person said.

The price of a basic Thanksgiving meal in 2016 fell to $49.87 as food prices mark the first annual drop in nearly 50 years. (Los Angeles Times) Geoffrey Mohan and Daniel Wheaton Contact Reporter The cost of a basic Thanksgiving meal for 10 people dropped 24 cents, to $49.87,\u00a0thanks to the first annual deflation in food prices in nearly half a century, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture . The consumer price index for supermarket food was down by 1.1% from last year\u2019s annual rate, with little more than a month left to the year. The annual decline is likely to be between 0.25%\u00a0and\u00a01.25%, marking the first time U.S. retail food prices posted an annual deflation since 1967, the agency\u2019s Economic Research Service\u00a0 said. A strong U.S. dollar made U.S. goods less competitive abroad, leaving more in the domestic market, while low oil prices kept the cost of transportation and other factors lower, according to USDA. Turkey prices dropped substantially from last year \u2014\u00a030 cents less for a 16-pound turkey \u2014\u00a0as the industry fully recovered from last year\u2019s avian flu outbreak, according to the Farm Bureau.\u00a0 U.S. dairies\u00a0over-produced so much, the federal government spent $20 million to buy 11 million pounds of cheese, according to USDA. A Wall Street Journal analysis of USDA data suggests the dairy industry dumped as much as 43 million gallons of milk in the first eight months of this year. The price slide is not expected to last through next year. USDA predicts retail food prices will rise by 0.5% to 1.5% in 2017. The Farm Bureau survey, now in its 31st year, includes turkey, bread stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk, all in quantities sufficient to serve a family of 10 with plenty for leftovers.\u00a0 In current dollars, the meal cost a high of $63.16\u00a0in 1986, and was below $50 from 1991 to 2010.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a look at some of what may be on your plate this year: A beginner's guide to cooking a Thanksgiving turkey \u00bb Turkeys There are nearly enough turkeys raised in the U.S. for each person to have his or her\u00a0own bird for Thanksgiving.\u00a0 The latest turkey census showed more than 286 million\u00a0birds in the country, according to the U.S.\u00a0Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service. North Carolina has the most turkeys, with more than 54 million birds.\u00a0California ranks seventh, with a little more than 15 million birds.\u00a0 According to the National Turkey Foundation \u00a0industry group, Americans eat about 16 pounds of turkey a year, a number that has been flat since the 2000s. The consumption has doubled from the 1970s, when the average was 8.1 pounds per year.\u00a0 It is the fourth-most consumed protein in the nation. Cranberries First mass sold in 1914, cranberry sauce is now a mainstay.\u00a0 Wisconsin leads the nation in the number of acres used to produce cranberries, according to the USDA. The state was followed by Massachusetts and New Jersey.\u00a0 Cranberries are one of the few fruits native to the Americas. They grow in shrubs that can reach up to 7 feet tall. Although\u00a0the berries are not grown in bogs, the fields are often flooded at\u00a0harvest time because the berries float in water.\u00a0 The methods for commercial production of cranberries were developed by a group of farmers who later formed the brand Ocean Spray.\u00a0 Green beans The production of green beans, or snap beans as called by the USDA,\u00a0is spread nationwide. All but Connecticut, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts and Mississippi have some amount of acreage devoted to the production of these beans.\u00a0 Wisconsin is the bean king, with more than 70,000 acres of beans, followed by Florida and New York. The origins of the ubiquitous green been casserole comes from 1955, when recipe pamphlets were the \u201ctasty\u201d videos of that era.\u00a0 Dorcas Reilly created the recipe that was inspired by\u00a0various Minnesotan hot dish recipes. Mashed potatoes In nearly every Thanksgiving meal, the starch is the spiritual center to the dish.\u00a0 Idaho makes the most potatoes, with 30%\u00a0of all potatoes grown in that state. Other northern states follow Idaho\u2019s lead. Only three states in the nation do not produce any potatoes: Connecticut, Louisiana and New Mexico. Mashed potatoes have been a part of the western diet since Spanish conquistadors brought the spud back to Europe from South America. One of the earlier mentions of \u201cmashed\u201d potatoes was in the 1747 English cookbook \u201cThe Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy,\u201d by Hannah Glasse. The recipe was more of a custard, as it called\u00a0for the addition of sugar, eggs and some brandy.\u00a0 Caption 4 Thanksgiving Stories You Can't Miss How to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers, expert tips on how to survive, and hopefully enjoy your dinner this Thanksgiving when politics comes up, why some stores are staying closed this Thanksgiving, and traveling tips.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 24, 2016 11:38 PM EST BEIJING --\u00a0The death toll from the collapse of scaffolding at a construction site in eastern China rose to 74, state media said Friday, in the country\u2019s worst work-safety accident in over two years.\u00a0 Two others were injured after the work platform at a power plant cooling tower that was under construction collapsed Thursday, sending iron pipes, steel bars and wooden planks tumbling down on the workers, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The cooling tower was being built in the city of Fengcheng in Jiangxi province when the scaffolding tumbled down, an official with the local Work Safety Administration who would only give his surname, Yuan, said by telephone. Workers search for survivors in the debris of a collapsed platform in a cooling tower at a power station at Fengcheng, in China\u2019s Jiangxi province, Nov. 24, 2016. Getty About 500 rescue workers, including paramilitary police officers, dug through the debris with their hands, according to state broadcaster CCTV. It showed debris strewn across the floor of the cavernous, 165-meter (545-foot) -high concrete cooling tower, in the middle of which stood an unfinished structure. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged local governments to learn from the accident and hold those responsible accountable. He said that in the wake of recent work accidents, the State Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, should carry out thorough inspections of work sites to reduce risks. China has suffered several major work-safety accidents in recent years blamed on weak regulatory oversight, systemic corruption and pressure to boost production amid a slowing economy. The scaffolding accident happened the same day that Yang Dongliang, a former head of the State Administration of Work Safety, stood trial in a Beijing court for allegedly accepting $4.3 million in bribes between 2002 and last year, as he rose through the ranks as an official in Tianjin before joining the regulatory agency. Yang was sacked in August 2015 in connection with a massive explosion at an illegal chemical warehouse in the northern port of Tianjin that killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers. The head of a logistics company was given a suspended death sentence over the case. Earlier this month, 33 miners were killed in a gas explosion at a coal mine in Chongqing in China\u2019s southwest. In 2014, a dust explosion at a metal production workshop killed 146 people. Other accidents blamed on lax safety standards in recent years have also caused significant fatalities. In June 2015, 442 people were killed in the capsize on the Yangtze River of a modified cruise ship blamed on poor decisions made by the captain and crew, while 81 people were killed in December when an enormous, man-made mountain of soil and waste collapsed on nearly three dozen buildings in the southern manufacturing center of Shenzhen. Construction of the 1,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant at the center of Thursday\u2019s accident began in Fengcheng in late 2015 and was expected to be finished in November 2017. Provincial officials held a televised news conference late Thursday at which they bowed to express condolences to the workers\u2019 families. The cause of the collapse is under investigation. Hundreds of coal-fired power plants are under construction in China. Beijing has vowed to solve a looming problem of power oversupply and cap greenhouse gas emissions in the medium term, but economic planners said earlier in November they intend to boost coal power generation capacity by a fifth over the next five years, or the equivalent output of hundreds of new coal-fired plants.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

The shooting occurred at about 1:30 p.m. while the park was crowded with people attending the annual Juice Bowl football game, Louisville Metro Police Department spokesman Dwight Mitchell said. When officers arrived on the scene, they found two deceased black males, police said in a statement. Four other individuals were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment with non-life-threatening injuries, according to police. \"This is very tragic what's happened here,\" Mitchell said, according to local ABC affiliate WHAS . \"I'm saddened. We've had over 100 homicides in our city, something that hasn't happened in a long time. And we consider ourselves one of the safest cities in America but when you have a tragedy like this it certainly puts a damper on that.\" The shooting is under investigation. 0 Shares ",

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivers remarks while being honored during the Children's Defense Fund's Beat the Odds Celebration at the Newseum on Nov. 16, 2016, in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter A group of election lawyers and data experts have asked Hillary Clinton 's campaign to call for a recount of the vote totals in three battleground states \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 to ensure that a cyberattack was not committed to manipulate the totals. There is no evidence that the results were hacked or that electronic voting machines were compromised. The Clinton campaign on Wednesday did not respond to a request for comment as to whether it would petition for a recount before the three states' fast-approaching deadlines to ask for one. President-elect Donald Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by razor-thin margins and has a small lead in Michigan. All three states had been reliably Democratic in recent presidential elections. The group, led by voting-rights attorney John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, contacted the Clinton campaign this week. That call, which was first reported by New York Magazine, raised the possibility that Clinton may have received fewer votes than expected in some counties that rely on electronic voting machines. But Halderman, in an article posted on Medium on Wednesday, stressed that the group has no evidence of a cyberattack or voting irregularities. He urged that a recount be ordered just to eliminate the possibility. \"The only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is to closely examine the available physical evidence -- paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,\" Halderman wrote. Recounts, which are often costly and time-intensive efforts, would likely only be initiated if the Clinton camp pushed for one, though Wisconsin independently announced that it would conduct an audit of its vote. A call for a recount, particularly coming on the heels of a fiercely contested and sharply partisan election, would likely be cheered by Democrats but denounced by Republicans eager to focus on governing. Hillary Clinton , in her first formal appearance since conceding the presidential election, acknowledged Wednesday that the experience has been terribly painful but urged a gathering of child advocates to persevere with their work and press \"the values we share.\" \"I know over the past week a lot... Hillary Clinton , in her first formal appearance since conceding the presidential election, acknowledged Wednesday that the experience has been terribly painful but urged a gathering of child advocates to persevere with their work and press \"the values we share.\" \"I know over the past week a lot... (John Wagner) A request to the Trump transition team for comment was not immediately returned. Trump's campaign had long believed that his message of economic populism would resonate in the Rust Belt. He frequently campaigned in Pennsylvania and made a late push in both Wisconsin and Michigan, successfully turning out white working-class voters whom pollsters may have missed. Many pre-election polls showed Clinton with slight leads. While advocating for the recounts, Halderman writes that \"the most likely explanation\" for Trump's surprise win \"is that the polls were systematically wrong,\" The deadlines for petitioning for a recount in all three states are in the coming days, with Wisconsin's on Friday. Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced a fundraising effort Wednesday to pay for such recounts. The focal point of any possible electoral cyberattack presumably would have been electronic voting machines that, whether or not they are connected to the internet, could be infected with malware that could change vote totals. But many of those machines produce a paper record of the vote that could be checked to see if the vote tabulations are accurate. Milwaukee's elections chief said Wisconsin's voter ID law caused problems at the polls in the city and likely contributed to lower voter turnout. Milwaukee saw a decline of about 41,000 voters in Tuesday's election compared with 2012, when President Barack Obama won broad support in the city and... Milwaukee's elections chief said Wisconsin's voter ID law caused problems at the polls in the city and likely contributed to lower voter turnout. Milwaukee saw a decline of about 41,000 voters in Tuesday's election compared with 2012, when President Barack Obama won broad support in the city and... (Tribune news services) Pennsylvania is considered one of the states most susceptible to hacking because 96 percent of its voting machines have no paper trail. Wisconsin is far less vulnerable because it uses electronic machines with voter-verifiable paper trails in most counties. Michigan is considered the safest of the three because it uses paper ballots. Officials in the three states confirmed that no recounts have been ordered. A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department says it is not tallying the number of voting complaints to determine whether federal action is warranted. Many election experts have called for routine post-election audits designed to boost public confidence in vote outcomes, by guarding against both tampering and natural vote-counting mistakes. These could involve spot-checks of the voting records and ballots, typically in randomly selected precincts, to make sure that votes were accurately recorded. In many states, audits involve hand-counting the votes on paper ballots and comparing the results to the totals stored in the state's electronic voting system. Such audits do sometimes turn up mistakes that reverse an election. That happened in Florida's Palm Beach County in 2012, when a post-election audit determined that the \"winners\" in two city council races were actually losers. Routine audits also make it possible to confirm the accuracy of elections without putting the onus on losing candidates to call for a recount. In states without regular audits, a candidate who question the results gets \"painted as a sore loser,\" Pamela Smith, president of the nonprofit Verified Voting, said in an interview earlier this year. \"If you do a regular audit, you often don't need a recount. It either shows the count was right or you find something.\" Any attempted hack to swing the results in three states would have been a massive and unprecedented undertaking. But electoral security was an issue that loomed large in many Americans' minds this year as the Democratic National Committee and several Clinton staffers had their emails breached and later released. U.S. security officials believe that hack of email was orchestrated by Russian hackers. Associated Press ",

A hickory-smoked bird. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) Jonathan GoldRestaurant Critic If\u00a0you\u2019ve been following the media recently, you may have noticed a certain lack of consensus on many things, including what an ideal Thanksgiving dinner might be. There have been instructions on how to spatchcock a turkey; how to slow-roast it; and how to bone it out, form it into a jelly roll around fennel sausage, and serve it in neat slices as kind of a turkey porchetta. My favorite butcher decided not to stock turkey at all this season. There is nothing like a Turkey of the Year. Even some usually happy cooks seem to be limping toward this holiday, wondering if anyone will notice if we substitute bottled chestnuts for fresh in the stuffing or canned squash for pumpkin in the pie.\u00a0 Thanksgiving is the happiest day of the year for passionate home cooks. This year, we are seeing a little less joy. Instead, more people may be gathering at Friendsgiving parties, at which the guest list is determined by compatibility rather than by accident of birth. A lot of publications, including this one, have been suggesting neat bourbon instead of wine as the proper Thanksgiving drink. Your best Thanksgiving yet Open link But even in this year, when events have pushed us apart,\u00a0where slights suffered in April still smart in the fall, when half of your crowd isn\u2019t talking to the other half and the weekly poker game hasn\u2019t convened since August, nothing has quite as much power to bring us together as an hour or two at the table \u2014 an hour or two devoted to family and friends, grace and gratitude for the blessings of America. We eat together and talk together as people with a single purpose. We are happy together at least until the bowl of cranberry sauce runs low. It was this idea of reconciliation, the idea of a single America, that led Abraham Lincoln to establish the first national Thanksgiving in 1863, at the height of the Civil War. \u201cIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u201c \u2026 order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict.\u2019\u2019 At the moment of the nation\u2019s deepest despair, Lincoln set aside the last Thursday of November as a \u201cday of Thanksgiving and Praise.\u2019\u2019 So in this difficult year we may need Thanksgiving more than ever \u2014 even if you\u00a0rarely tackle anything more taxing than a stir-fry or a grain bowl the rest of the year, even if you have yet to decide whether to truss the legs, make giblet gravy, or roast the bird on a bed of carrots instead of on a rack. Guests who wonder how they are going to react if Uncle Morris gets into one of his moods need Thanksgiving. So do people whom Cousin Rose hasn\u2019t acknowledged\u00a0since November 1980. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re dining on turkey biryani, turkey adobo, Persian turkey with barberries or clay-roasted Chinese beggars\u2019 turkey stuffed with black mushrooms and mustard greens. Or turkey made with the classical technique and stupendous amounts of butter; or the turkey that your mother learned how to make from Betty Crocker. Is crisp, brittle skin worth slightly dry meat? Is Deb going to show up with that big bowl of ambrosia again? Is a heritage bird worth the extra four dollars a pound? If\u00a0your oldest friend and your sister-in-law decide to bring pecan pies, which of the pies are you going to serve first? If all else fails, Salt and Straw is offering ice cream spiked with turkey-skin brittle; the Dog Haus, turducken sausages with gravy; and Trader Joe\u2019s, turkey-flavored potato chips.\u00a0But you are going to be at the table this afternoon, and so am I.

An online statement claimed claimed responsibility for the attack in the city of Hilla in the name of ISIS, which is fighting off a U.S.-backed offensive in Mosul, in northern Iraq. The pilgrims were en route back to Iran from the Iraqi Shiite holy city of Kerbala, where they had commemorated Arbaeen. The rite marks the 40th day of mourning for the killing of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammad, in the 7th century A.D., the medical sources said. Civilians search for survivors at the scene of a suicide bomb attack Thursday near the Iraqi city of Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. Hadi Mizban / AP A restaurant on the premises of the gas station is popular with travelers. Five pilgrim buses were set afire by the blast from the explosives-laden truck, a police official said. In recent months, ISIS has intensified attacks in areas out of its control in efforts to weaken the offensive that was launched Oct. 17 to retake Mosul, the last major Iraqi city under its control. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack without giving a casualty toll. Tehran will continue to support Iraq's \"relentless fight against terrorism,\" Bahram Qasemi, a spokesman for the ministry, was quoted as saying by the Tasnim news agency. U.S. officials condemned the attack. \"The United States remains steadfast in its partnership with the Iraqi people and government and this attack only serves to strengthen our resolve in defeating ISIL,\" Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement that referred to the terrorist group by the U.S. government's preferred name. The State Department is in close contact with Iraqi authorities, John Kirby, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement. Reuters ",

William Pulliam confessed to shooting James Means, 15, with a .380 caliber revolver in the capital city of Charleston on Monday, saying he felt threatened by the boy, according to a criminal complaint filed in Kanawha County Magistrate Court. \"Mr. Pulliam expressed no remorse,\" the complaint, written by a Charleston police detective, said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Ruby said federal authorities have been asked to determine if the shooting can be prosecuted as a hate crime. Pulliam is white, and Means was black. \"The way I look at it, that's another piece of trash off the street,\" the police detective quoted Pulliam as saying. \"That review is in its early stages, and the fact that a review is being conducted should not be taken as any indication of what the review's outcome will be,\" Ruby said. Pulliam told investigators he ate dinner then went to a friend's house after the shooting, according to the complaint. The attack unfolded around 8:46 p.m. ET Monday, according to the complaint. Two friends who were with Means said they got into an argument with Pulliam after the older man allegedly bumped into Means in front of a Dollar General store. Pulliam went into the store, they said, and after he re-emerged, walked past them on the street. The boys, standing in front of a house, argued with Pulliam again, the friends told investigators. One of the friends said Means then crossed the street to confront Pulliam. Pulliam then shot Means twice, the friend said. Means was pronounced dead at CMAC General Hospital, the complaint said. Pulliam remains jailed without bond because he has yet to appear before a judge, a jail officer said. A local ABC station interviewed Pulliam behind bars, and quoted him as saying Means and his friends had threatened him with a gun before he entered the Dollar General store. On the way back, Pulliam told the station, he walked on the other side of the street. He said he did not know why the boys confronted him. Pulliam denied calling Means \"trash\" to police, the station reported. And Pulliam told the station that that race had nothing to do with his decision to shoot. \"It doesn't make any difference if he's black,\" Pulliam said. \"My God, everybody I live around over there is black. I get along with all of them, ask them.\" Means' relatives, friends and Capital High School classmates gathered at the shooting scene Wednesday to remember him, local NBC affiliate WSAZ reported . \"This was unexpected because he was a really good person,\" a friend, Haley Braxton, told the station. \"He wasn't a fighter. He didn't mess with anybody. He always made everybody so happy.\" Means participated in a program called Dream Chasers, which helps \"at-risk\" children develop career goals, founder Obi Henderson told WSAZ. \"James wanted to be a businessman and open up a mechanic shop,\" he said. Means' mother, Nafia Adkins, told the station: \"My son is in a safer place now, and we all love him.\" Jon Schuppe ",

(Photo: Evan Vucci/AP) INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump spent at least part of his Thanksgiving trying to convince Carrier Corp. to keep its Indianapolis plant open . Trump on Thursday hinted that he's \"making progress\" toward a campaign pledge of reversing Carrier Corp.'s plan to shutter its Indianapolis operations and relocate jobs to Mexico\u00a0by 2019. \"I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana),\" Trump\u00a0said in a Twitter post.\u00a0\"MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\" The Connecticut-based air conditioning maker issued its own statement on Twitter, acknowledging that it has been in discussions with Trump's administration. Carrier did not describe the nature of those talks. Carrier union backs Sanders, spurning Trump \"Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together,\" Carrier said on Twitter.\u00a0\"Nothing to announce at this time.\" Carrier earlier this year announced that it would close its Westside plant by 2019, laying off 1,400 workers. They layoffs are scheduled to begin next year. Carrier has said it will move those jobs to\u00a0Monterrey, Mexico. Trump campaigned, in part, on keeping manufacturing jobs in America and punishing companies that move work outside the U.S. Trump made a particular example of Carrier, saying he would \"tax the hell\" out of the company if it followed through on its plan. Trump in the spring said he could persuade Carrier to stay in Indianapolis. \"You\u2019re going to bring it across the border, and we\u2019re going to charge you a 35%\u00a0tax,\" Trump\u00a0said in April.\u00a0\"Now within 24 hours, they\u2019re going to call back:\u00a0'Mr. President, we\u2019ve decided to stay. We\u2019re coming back to Indianapolis.'\" I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2016 Carrier already has taken several steps toward moving its Indianapolis operations to Mexico. The company has\u00a0reached a severance agreement\u00a0with workers,\u00a0agreed to repay the city $1.2 million\u00a0for past tax breaks and refunded\u00a0$380,000 to the state for grants. Carrier is owned by\u00a0United Technologies Corp., which is a government contractor. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who is Trump's vice president-elect, already took a shot at changing Carrier's plans. Pence\u00a0met with Carrier in March. Although he was unsuccessful at convincing Carrier to remain in Indianapolis, Pence urged the company to repay state and city incentives it had received.

Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS \u2014 Will know soon!\u201d Trump tweeted . Carrier, a division of United Technologies of Farmington, Conn., responded with a tweet about an hour later: \u201cCarrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time.\u201d During the campaign, Trump called the planned closure of the Indianapolis plant \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d and made it a campaign rallying cry . At an Indianapolis event in April, he went further, offering the crowd a \u201c100 percent\u201d guarantee the plant would not leave if he were elected. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump said, according to Bloomberg News . \u201cThey\u2019re going to call me, and they are going to say, \u2018Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 1 of 7 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

Chief of Staff\u00a0Reince Priebus President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump\u2019s campaign.

One hundred\u00a0percent.\u201d The Carrier back-and-forth was reminiscent of a similar exchange over manufacturing facilities that Trump began a week earlier, when he said on Twitter that he had received a call from Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Co., saying that \u201che will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky \u2014 no Mexico.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim was exaggerated , as Ford\u2019s union contract prevented it from shutting down its Louisville assembly plant. Ford clarified that it had merely decided not to relocate production of a single vehicle model, the Lincoln MKC, from Kentucky. Carrier announced its plans to shut down the Indiana plant in February, with the closure slated for 2019. Chris Nelson, a Carrier president overseeing the unit, issued a statement at the time saying the move to Mexico would allow the company \u201cto operate more cost effectively\u201d because of the industry\u2019s ongoing migration to that area as well as \u201ccost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements.\u201d The closure could lead to the loss of more than $100\u00a0million to the Indiana economy and more than 1,000 other jobs that indirectly relied on the plant, according to some estimates . Trump\u2019s promise to save the plant was met with skepticism in some corners of Indiana, the home state of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, but Trump carried the state easily over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. business ",

    "text": "By James McAuley and Griff Witte November 24 at 6:11 PM Follow jameskmcauley Follow @griffwitte PARIS \u2014 When Donald Trump shocked the world with an upset victory in the U.S. presidential election this month, much of Europe was aghast. But in at least one critical sense, the result couldn\u2019t have been more European: Across the continent, parties of the center-left that have dominated politics for decades \u2014 and that have given Europe its reputation for generous social welfare systems \u2014 now find themselves beaten, divided and directionless. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are just the latest members of a beleaguered club. In Germany and Britain, once-mighty center-left parties have been badly diminished, locked out of their nations\u2019 top jobs for the foreseeable future. In Spain and Greece, they have been usurped by newer, more radical alternatives. And in France and Italy, they\u2019re still governing \u2014 but their days in power may be numbered. The rout of the center-left has even extended deep into Scandinavia, perhaps the world\u2019s premier bastion of social democracy. Overall, the total vote share for the continent\u2019s traditional center-left parties is now at its lowest level since at least World War II. Like the Democrats, these parties have been marginalized, with little influence over policy as the right prepares to place its stamp on the Western world in a way that could endure for decades. \u201cIf the left and the center-left don\u2019t get their act together, then we\u2019re looking at a period of very unstable right-wing hegemony,\u201d said Alex Callinicos, a European studies professor at King\u2019s College London. German Chancellor Angela Merkel waits for President Obama before a meeting in Berlin with government heads of France, Italy, Spain and Britain on Nov. 18. (Markus Schreiber/AP) [ Trump\u2019s win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave ] The decline of the European center-left is part of a broader unraveling of the continent\u2019s mainstream consensus as electorates fracture and a political kaleidoscope of alternatives emerges. But unlike the center-left, traditional parties of the center-right have managed to hold their own amid the populist fury, clinging to power in London, Berlin and Madrid \u2014 with a strong chance next year to take Paris, as well. As recently as a decade ago, the picture was very different. Britain\u2019s Tony Blair was at the vanguard of a generation of European center-left leaders who had emulated Bill Clinton\u2019s pragmatic Third Way politics and seemed poised to ride their marriage of social democracy with market liberalization to an unlimited future of electoral success. But the Great Recession \u2014 and the bumpy, deeply unequal recovery that followed \u2014 fundamentally changed that. \u201cWith the economic crisis, and the negative effects of globalization, the socialists couldn\u2019t convince the populations in their respective countries that the future lies in a liberal Europe,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a historian of socialism at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cThis is the end of the European utopia.\u201d That \u201cutopia\u201d emerged in the aftermath of 1945, when politicians across war-torn Europe banded together to build a new continent that would never repeat the grave mistakes of the recent past. This was the genesis of the European Union: an economic union that was meant to become, at least in theory,committed to the common cause of social justice, largely a leftist ideal. Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers a speech at a Center for Labour and Social Studies event in London on Nov. 5. (Neil Hall/Reuters) If the three decades that followed World War II coincided with the longest period of growth in Europe\u2019s history, voters today see neither leftist economic policies nor the E.U. itself as necessarily worth preserving. Britain voted to leave the bloc in June, and separatist movements have spread across the continent to France, the Netherlands and elsewhere. [ Europe\u2019s traditional left is in a death spiral. Even if you don\u2019t like the left, this is a problem. ] To historians, the unlikely abandonment of this former European bedrock is partly a function of its own achievements. \u201cIt was a failure by success,\u201d said Timothy Snyder, a historian of 20th-century Europe at Yale University. \u201cOnce the left becomes not revolutionary but transformative, and once that transformation succeeds, people start taking it for granted. \u201cEuropeans take for granted that they will have public education, free health care and social services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the left doesn\u2019t get votes on this anymore.\u201d The marginalization of Europe\u2019s center-left parties has been consistent across the continent, although their paths to the political wilderness have varied. In France, prospects for a leftist victory in presidential elections in 2017 remain bleak. The perceived failure of the Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to respond adequately to a recent string of terrorist attacks has brought him the lowest approval ratings in modern French history and ignited a rebellion in his own party. In particular, Hollande\u2019s proposal to strip French citizenship from convicted terrorists who hold dual nationality outraged fellow leftists, distracting the party from presenting a united front against its opponents. [ Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, France\u2019s conservative front-runner, promises the return of the traditional right ] Hollande will face a conservative party whose candidates have promised to bolster national security and bring the country out of economic stagnation. For nearly the duration of the current Socialist government\u2019s tenure, the unemployment rate has hovered at or above 10 percent. In prosperous Germany, the Social Democratic Party\u2019s years of playing second-fiddle to the center-right-led government of Chancellor Angela Merkel have diluted its voice. Analysts give it little prospect for victory in next year\u2019s national elections. In Italy, the center-left Democratic Party occupies a precarious position. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has proposed a host of constitutional revisions, which have been put to a referendum slated for early December. Renzi has reiterated his promise to resign from office if he loses the vote, which the latest polls suggest he will. In economically devastated Greece, the traditional center-left party, Pasok, finished no better than fourth in a pair of votes last year that saw its support drop to the mid-single digits. In both elections, it embarrassingly placed behind the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. But rather than swinging to the right, Greek voters went far left, electing and then reelecting a government led by the Syriza party, a coalition of Trotskyites, Maoists and other figures once limited to the revolutionary fringe who were thrust into power on a pledge to fight austerity and the unforgiving terms of the country\u2019s international bailout. In Spain, voters have divided almost evenly between the long-standing center-left party, the Socialists, and an upstart far-left alternative that didn\u2019t exist three years ago, Podemos. As a result of the split, the center-right People\u2019s Party was able to squeak back into power after elections in June. Britain\u2019s Labour Party \u2014 which built the country\u2019s vaunted National Health Service and was riding a streak of 13 years in power as recently as 2010 \u2014 has faced no similar challenge by an upstart party to its left. Instead, the far left has taken over Labour from within, through the bomb-throwing backbencher Jeremy Corbyn and his astonishing victory in leadership elections last year. Corbyn\u2019s win came after two straight national election defeats for Labour and a bout of soul-searching that mirrors the sort of anxious introspection now sweeping the Democratic Party in the United States. Faced with the choice of three center-left contenders or the long-shot bid of Corbyn, Labour members went with a man who had made a career of bucking the Labour hierarchy and who starkly repudiated the centrism embodied by Tony Blair. [ After Trump win, Obama warns against taking democracy \ufffd?for granted\u2019 ] But there\u2019s little sign that Labour\u2019s lurch to the left has put it any closer to power. With a possible early election coming next year, polls indicate the party would lose decisively to the ruling Conservative Party. Corbyn, meanwhile, has struggled to hold his party together as Labour members of Parliament have overwhelmingly said they have no confidence in his leadership. Blair and his allies have argued that Corbyn will simply guide the party to continued irrelevance. \u201cYou win from the center; you win when you appeal to a broad cross section of the public; you win when you support business as well as unions,\u201d Blair, who guided the party to three straight national election victories, said in a speech last year. \u201cYou don\u2019t win from a traditional leftist position.\u201d But center-left parties have an obligation to try something more radical, said Callinicos, the European political analyst, because the moderate approach they\u2019ve been offering hasn\u2019t worked. \u201cThe merger of traditional social democracy with neoliberalism and globalized free-market policies has fallen apart in fairly disastrous fashion,\u201d he said, suggesting that the turning point was the global financial crash of 2008, when working-class voters saw their jobs disappear or their wages stagnate even as the net worth of the wealthy continued to race ahead. Across Europe, the center-left has had little to offer those voters, who have looked elsewhere \u2014 including the far right. In Britain\u2019s June referendum on the European Union, for instance, working-class voters in traditional Labour strongholds ignored their party\u2019s advice to opt to stay in, and instead heeded the call of the anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party to vote out. Trump\u2019s victory in the United States rested at least in part on a similar phenomenon \u2014 a billionaire tycoon using appeals to xenophobia and racism to scoop up support from voters who no longer believe the party of the working man has their interests at heart. As in the Brexit vote, Trump won certain key states with the help of working-class voters who had supported Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012. One implication of the growing void on Europe\u2019s left could be profound political instability, both within specific countries and geopolitically. Another could be the emergence of a right-wing stranglehold, based on widespread nostalgia for a world that, in Snyder\u2019s view, never actually existed. \u201cAll these continental parties are nostalgic for the interwar nation-state, which was a total disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never any moment when they were happy, independent nation-states. There was never such a time, and their nostalgia is a kind of disguise. \u201cIf you plunge into that abyss,\u201d he added, \u201cvery bad things lie ahead.\u201d Witte reported from London. ",

(Photo: AP) At least 67 people were killed Thursday when a platform that was under construction at the\u00a0cooling tower of a power plant\u00a0in eastern China collapsed,\u00a0state media reported. The incident happened at\u00a0the Fengcheng plant in Jiangxi province at around 7 a.m. local time, the official news agency Xinhua said. State TV reported that rescuers\u00a0were trying to free one person who was trapped. Five injured workers were taken to a local hospital, Xinhua reported. State broadcaster CCTV reported that\u00a0more than 100 paramilitary police joined in the rescue effort. Premier Li Keqiang said\u00a0supervision and preventive measures should be improved to stop such a major accident from happening again. Work on the $1.1 billion coal-powered\u00a0plant is due to be completed in 2018, according to media reports. Accidents are common at industrial sites in China. Anger is growing over lax standards, according to Reuters. In August last year,\u00a0huge\u00a0explosions and a fire at a chemical warehouse in the northeastern\u00a0city of Tianjin killed more than 170 people and injured about 800.

Louisville Metro Police Department spokesman Dwight Mitchell said officers responded to a call of multiple shootings about 1:30 p.m. at Shawnee Park. The injuries among those taken to University Hospital were not considered life-threatening, he said. \"Most people were here having a good time,\" Mitchell said. \"But unfortunately this tragic situation has happened.\" Mitchell had no information about any suspects or motives. The shootings occurred near the site of the annual Juice Bowl series of football games, which was attended by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. \"To have people with guns so disrespect life, Shawnee Park, and neighborhood tradition is sad and has no place in our city,\" Fischer said in a Twitter post. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those impacted by today's violence,\" he said. Youth games had just ended and two women's teams were in the middle of a flag football game when the shots were fired. Men's games scheduled to take place afterward were canceled. Charlotte Waddell, a cousin of the late Muhammad Ali who has attended the football event for decades, told The Courier-Journal that she had just finished talking to the mayor when she heard several gunshots. \"This is the worst Thanksgiving ever; I'll never be back,\" she said. \"I'm pretty shaken up.\" Associated Press ",

USA TODAY Sports Dez Bryant of the Dallas Cowboys argues with Josh Norman #24 of the Washington Redskins after catching a pass in their game at AT&T; Stadium on November 24, 2016 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo: Ronald Martinez, Getty Images) ARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant and Washington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman had to be warned by officials during the game because their words and actions were getting a little too heated in the second half. The end of the game didn\u2019t calm anything down. Norman and Bryant went mask-to-mask and had a heated exchange on the field after the Cowboys' 31-26 win and had to be separated by teammates. Once both players retreated to their respective locker rooms, the fireworks continued. \u201cFirst off,\u201d Bryant told reporters, \u201cWashington needs to get their money back from Josh Norman.\u201d Dez Bryant and Josh Norman pic.twitter.com/imieKlig4d \u2014 Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) November 25, 2016 That was, frankly, the kindest thing said. (And a reference to the shot Norman took last season when he said the Cowboys needed \u201cto get their $70 mil back from Dez.\u201d) \u201cI didn\u2019t make it personal,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI was just going to come out and do my job and that\u2019s exactly what I did. He wanted to bump and me and him got to bumping a little bit and it just made me attack him even more. I honestly feel like the guy is extremely soft. He\u2019s a bunch of talk. If he was out and about, I wouldn\u2019t dare on my life let him talk to me like that. \u201cThose words would never come out of his mouth. I promise. I promise it wouldn\u2019t. We got after that ass and it was a hell of a win. It feels good.\u201d Bryant and Norman battled all game, at times needing to be separated. \u00a0After a 13-yard completion on a skinny post in fourth quarter, Norman tackled Bryant by the legs, and held on after the whistle. Bryant got up and got in Norman\u2019s face, and the two continued to jaw back and forth. After that series, a member of the officiating staff directly addressed both players. \"I think he's extremely soft. All talk,\" Bryant said. Norman told reporters\u00a0that Bryant \u201cbumped into me\u201d after the game and \u201cwas\u00a0like, 'what\u2019s up.' \u201d Norman then said: \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we unload the clip,\u201d but it was unclear if he was attributing that saying to Bryant or himself. \"Don't step to someone when the game is over like that when they're not even looking for you, or even having a conversation with you,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThey won the game, so you have to tip your hats off to them. But I don't do trash, and that was trashy on his behalf.\u201d All through the week I will post film how Norman got exposed... https://t.co/WKWE9IdQYr \u2014 Dez Bryant (@DezBryant) November 25, 2016 Boy stop... go watch the film.... the man can't cover one on one... I broke him down on so many routes tonight https://t.co/EoOtHWHoid \u2014 Dez Bryant (@DezBryant) November 25, 2016 @J_No24 don't lie on me..  but I will whoop yo ass boy straight up \u2014 Dez Bryant (@DezBryant) November 25, 2016 Bryant finished the game with five catches for 72 yards on seven targets. He appeared to have Norman beaten deep for what would have been a sure touchdown, but Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott did not see Bryant streaking down the field wide open. \"You supposed to be a lockdown corner, and you can't even play man-to-man,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing bail technique. That\u2019s not man-to-man. He was scared. He was scared, man.\" Norman signed a five-year, $75 million contract this offseason after his former team, the Carolina Panthers, rescinded the franchise tag the offered him in March. \"He was holding the whole night, man,\" Bryant said. \u201cHow much he got paid? Seventy-something? Damn.\u201d Norman has also sparred with Odell Beckham Jr. of the New York Giants, a highly-publicized matchup from Week 15 last season in which both players were penalized for five personal foul penalties. Now, it appears Norman may have another bitter rival inside the NFC East. \"If that boosts his ego, or if he needs it to fuel whatever kind of things he got in his head, then so be it,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI played him three or four times now,\u201d Norman said. \u201cAnd those times, I don\u2019t think he broke 30 yards, or had any significance of any kind in the game. Definitely didn\u2019t have a touchdown. So, out of those three games, you would think that a guy of that magnitude, of that kind of big standards, would do more than that. But at the end of the day, I will let him speak for himself. If he feels like he wants to have that, then go play with the kids on the playground.\u201d Follow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes . PHOTOS: Best of NFL Thanksgiving games Posted!

Have you met my little friend? Gavin Williamson leaves the residence of British Prime Minister Theresa May at 10 Downing Street in London after being appointed in July. Dominic Lipinski / PA Wire/Press Association Images The government's chief whip has reared the one-year-old arachnid since it was a spiderling and says he has \"paternal\" feelings toward it, similar to the \"love and care\" he extends to all of his fellow members of Parliament. Williamson, 40, spoke to Britain's Times Newspaper about Cronus, saying: \"You have to look at different ways to persuade people to vote with the government and it's great to have Cronus as part of the team. He added: \"Cronus is a perfect example of an incredibly clean, ruthless killer \u2014 absolutely fascinating to rear.\" A tarantula. Alastair Grant / AP Strict rules at the Palace of Westminster state that the only animals allowed on the estate are guide or security dogs and Williamson has reportedly been reminded of the rules. But a source close to Williamson told the Sun tabloid : \"Authorities were told in no uncertain terms that Cronus was staying ... The point was also made when they remove all the mice here, we may then think about removing Cronus.\" Several other British government departments keep cats to control a mice infestation in the government buildings.

Lakshmi Singh/NPR hide caption toggle caption Perry the turkey presides over Thanksgiving dinner. Lakshmi Singh/NPR Thanksgiving came early in Poolesville. Only, instead of dining on turkey, the hundreds who gathered in this Maryland town actually dined with a turkey. His name is Perry. The strutting turkey, who's something of a star at Poplar Animal Sanctuary, stared down the hungry crowd with nothing to worry about \u2014 because the big dinner in Poolesville was no ordinary Thanksgiving feast: The diners there were only interested in vegan fare. Every year, they gather to forego the traditional dinner of turkey or pork roast, and instead eat vegan or vegetarian dishes right alongside the chickens, pigs and sheep. Terry Cummings and her husband, Dave, came up with the idea of this Thanksgiving shindig some 18 years ago with one goal in mind: to save farm animals from slaughter. And that idea, she says, has really caught on. Terry Cummings accepts tickets and welcomes guests to the Thanksgiving feast. Lakshmi Singh/NPR hide caption toggle caption Lakshmi Singh/NPR \"More people are more aware of the issues now,\" she says. \"They're more concerned about farm animals. They realize that there's a need to have sanctuaries like this one.\" So, with help from charitable donations, Cummings works full-time to take care of roughly 200 animals. And she's got her favorites. \"Evie, the three-legged goat \u2014 she lost her leg because her owners did not take her to the vet when an emu stepped on her and she got a broken leg,\" Cummings says. \"They were going to shoot her, and the veterinarians called us and asked us to take her \u2014 and we've had her ever since.\" Now, here's your moment of Zen: Evie, the three-legged goat, dines politely with her turkey compatriot. Lakshmi Singh/NPR hide caption toggle caption Lakshmi Singh/NPR Now, here's your moment of Zen: Evie, the three-legged goat, dines politely with her turkey compatriot. Lakshmi Singh/NPR As a family, Cumming and several hundred of her friends from all over the region have pulled out all the stops to put on a Thanksgiving dinner where the animals eat before the humans. Chunks of watermelon, vegetables and worms are plucked and scattered across white serving panels on the grass. Article continues after sponsorship Ricardo Travino drove 2 1/2 hours with his wife, Nicole, to get to the feast. And he certainly showed up in style \u2014 with a Butterball hat on his head that read \"Tofurkey.\" (That's tofu instead of meat.) He stuffed his face with vegan treats. This dinner wasn't just for the birds. These pigs got in on the action, too. Lakshmi Singh/NPR hide caption toggle caption This dinner wasn't just for the birds. These pigs got in on the action, too. Lakshmi Singh/NPR \"This is not your typical potluck. People really haul out everything they have to come up with great meals here,\" says Ruth Davis, who sat just a couple of tables down from Travino. She plucked a few desserts that she \"wouldn't normally go for,\" she says \u2014 \"but we're going to give it a shot.\" Guess that's where the \"luck\" from potluck comes from. When you're dining with the animals, you never know what you're going to get. ",

It is the final large segment of the $3.8 billion, 1,200-mile pipeline to carry North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois that\u2019s been held up while the Corps consults with the Standing Rock Sioux, who believe the project could harm the tribe\u2019s drinking water and Native American cultural sites. Months of protests have taken place near Lake Oahe. Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline earlier this month, which Kelcy Warren, CEO of pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press is not an option from the company\u2019s standpoint. Obama said his administration is monitoring the \u201cchallenging situation\u201d but would \u201clet it play out for several more weeks.\u201d \u201cYour inaction on the pending easement has created undue hardship and uncertainty for area residents, private landowners, tribal members, construction workers and law enforcement personnel,\u201d Dalrymple, Hoeven and Cramer told Obama. In this image provided by Morton County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department, law enforcement and protesters clash near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Cannon Ball, N.D.\u00a0 AP Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said Wednesday she also pressed the White House to make a decision, saying inaction \u201chas put lives at risk.\u201d Protests have intensified in recent weeks , with total arrests since August rising to 528, and a clash earlier in the week near the main protest camp left a police officer and several protesters injured. One of them, Sophia Wilansky, 21, of New York, suffered an arm injury in an explosion during the skirmish and is hospitalized in Minneapolis. Protesters say she was injured by a grenade thrown by police, while police say she was hurt by a small propane tank that protesters rigged to explode. The protests have garnered the attention of several celebrities, two of which - Jane Fonda and Shailene Woodley - will be at the Standing Rock reservation Thursday to help serve Thanksgiving dinner to about 2,000 protesters. The North Dakota lawmakers also asked for federal law enforcement help to police the protests. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said Monday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be providing some Border Patrol agents to help his department, the state Highway Patrol and officers from other states, though he didn\u2019t say how many. Another issue for the state is the cost of policing the protests, which is up to more than $11.8 million, state Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong said Wednesday. The department will seek another $7 million in emergency borrowing on Nov. 30 on top of the $10 million borrowed earlier this year, Fong said. Morton County also has spent more than $8 million policing protests, and county officials have said they may apply for state reimbursement. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Fernando Vergara/AP hide caption toggle caption Fernando Vergara/AP Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos (left) shakes hands with with FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, after signing a revised peace pact in Bogota, Colombia, on Thursday. Fernando Vergara/AP Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Rodrigo Londono, the leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC, signed a new peace agreement Thursday, despite lingering opposition to the deal. The accord, which was struck earlier this month , follows an October referendum in which the country narrowly voted to reject a peace agreement reached in September. Voters opposed the September peace deal for its \"perceived leniency toward FARC fighters,\" as my colleague Colin Dwyer wrote, but Santos was still awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. This time, the peace deal will not be put to a country-wide vote. Instead it will go to Colombia's Congress for ratification, the Associated Press reports : The new accord introduces some 50 changes intended to assuage critics led by still-powerful former President Alvaro Uribe. They range from a prohibition on foreign magistrates judging crimes by the FARC or government to a commitment from the insurgents to forfeit assets, some of them amassed through drug trafficking, to help compensate their victims. The AP said the deal could be ratified \"as early as next week.\" Members of Uribe's party, however, who wanted harsher punishment for FARC rebels, are calling for \"protests to denounce what they say is a 'blow against democracy,' \" the AP said. Article continues after sponsorship The BBC reported the Thursday signing ceremony was \"deliberately\" smaller than the ceremony held for to sign the previous deal on Sept. 26. Today, about 800 people were in attendance, about a third as many as who attended the September ceremony. Though the peace accord aims to end more than 50 years of conflict between the government and FARC rebels, the lack of unified support could complicate the already difficult task of disarming fighters and implementing the terms of the peace. The AP says Colombia's government will have to \"[ensure] that the 8,000-plus fighters don't wind up joining criminal gangs rampant throughout the country, or the much-smaller National Liberation Army.\" ",

Thanksgiving shopping has begun Edward C. Baig , USA TODAY 9:17 p.m. EST November 24, 2016 x Share Confused about where to shop for those Thanksgiving deals? Have no fear. We've put together a list for you. USA TODAY NETWORK JC Penny's Mechella Wheeler hands out gift cards to shoppers a  sChristmas shopping began with a flurry of activity on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24, 2016, in Grand Chute, Wis. Thousands of shoppers put down their forks after Thanksgiving dinner and headed out to take advantage of doorbusters and in-store deals. Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) NEW YORK \u2014 Thanksgiving has traditionally boiled down to three \u201cFs\u201d: food, football and family. Many Americans can now add a fourth F to the mix, the \u201cfrenzy\u201d that comes with holiday shopping. We\u2019re not just talking Black Friday. More and more folks are shopping in person on Thanksgiving Day, with major retailers such as Best Buy, Macy\u2019s, Sears, Target and Toys R\u00a0Us, all opening their doors even before the last of the turkey has gotten cold. And online shopping is off to a brisk start. Shoppers spent $1.15 billion online between midnight and\u00a05 p.m. ET, a 13.6% increase over last year, reported Adobe Digital Insights. Adobe is forecasting Thanksgiving Day online sales to hit $2 billion for the first time, a 15.6% year-over-year growth increase. A record $820 million is expected to come from mobile devices, with $449 million spent by 5 p.m. ET. Adobe added that half the people it surveyed expect to shop after 5 p.m.\u00a0on Thanksgiving, after families pushed back from the dinner table. Black Friday tech deals: Making sense of it all \"Thanksgiving Day is still on track to either hit or come close to $2 billion, although heavy discounting seen in the early hours of the day has slowed revenue growth,\" Adobe reported. In all, an estimated 137.4 million consumers plan to or are considering shopping during the holiday weekend, according to the annual survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. Twenty-one percent of the weekend shoppers plan to shop on Thanksgiving Day itself, nearly the same as the 22% who did so last year. Still, not every retailer is comfortable with the idea. There\u2019s been a recent tug of war over whether retailers should be open on Thanksgiving Day,\u00a0with some deciding to close their doors this year to boost employee morale, score points with consumers who dislike the practice, and preserve the dwindling sales power of Black Friday. Tennessean Tom Alberty told The (Clarksville, Tenn.) Leaf-Chronicle last week, that he doesn't like shopping on the holiday because it takes away from family time. \"You have 300 days to shop throughout the year. Why do you pick Thanksgiving?\" Holiday Spending Headquarters The Mall of America stayed shuttered this holiday. CBL & Associates Properties Inc. planned to close 72 of its 89 malls this Thanksgiving after keeping them open the last three years, and electronics chain hhgregg\u00a0closed all of its 220 stores. But most major retailers decided to continue this newest tradition of kicking off the holiday shopping marathon right after \u2014\u00a0or even before \u2014\u00a0the Thanksgiving feast. Toys R Us, for instance, opened its doors at 5 p.m. on the holiday and will keep its stores open for 30 hours straight. \u201cOne of the reasons we opened our stores on Thanksgiving ...\u00a0is there\u2019s just a lot of people that enjoy that as part of their Thanksgiving tradition,\u2019\u2019 says Toys R Us\u2019 CEO Dave Brandon. \u201cAnd if they want to shop ... we want to be open and available to them.\u2019\u2019 In Wisconsin, Mike Franke knows something about tradition. He likes being first in line for Black Friday deals, so he planted himself in\u00a0the small slice of real estate right outside the Best Buy store in Delafield. Mike Franke holds a pair of commemorative chips he got from Best Buy after arriving at the Delafield store a week in advance to be first in line on Thursday. \u00a0(Photo: Mark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) Franke didn't arrive a few hours before Best Buy opened at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving.\u00a0Or even a few\u00a0days\u00a0before. No, Franke is a hearty shopper with time to burn, or at least vacation to use from his job at the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles. So he\u00a0took roost at Best Buy a full week\u00a0before the big sale. Arriving at 3 p.m. on Nov. 17, Franke set up two tents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one for sleeping, one for a living room outfitted with a heater and television hooked into Direct TV powered by his own portable generator. He's done this at the same Best Buy for the last 10 years. And\u00a0the object of his desire? A TV. \"It's tradition, believe it or not. Everyone thinks it's the deals, but it's the tradition. I actually met the other people in line 10 years ago, and we see them every year and we've become friends,\" Franke said Thursday afternoon, about two hours before he was the first person\u00a0through the sliding glass doors to snap up a Toshiba 50-inch 4K TV for $199 for his man cave. A line forms outside of JC Penny as Christmas shopping began with a flurry of activity on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24, 2016, in Grand Chute, Wis. Thousands of shoppers put down their forks after Thanksgiving dinner and headed out to take advantage of doorbusters and in-store deals. Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin \u00a0(Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) Charlie Nardi, a longtime manager for JCPenney, said there was a line of customers when he arrived at the Vero Beach, Fla., store at 1:15 p.m. Thursday, almost two hours before the 3 p.m. opening. \u201cCustomers who came so early are going to be happy to shop,\u201d said Nardi during an employee pep talk before the opening. \u201cAll of our hard work for the last couple weeks will come to fruition today. It\u2019s going to be crazy all day.\u201d At a nearby Best Buy, Vero Beach resident Bobby Lusquinos said he lined up at 2 a.m., 15 hours before the 5 p.m. opening. He came for the 50-inch Toshiba 4K television for $199 and a $349 Dell laptop. \u201cI rather have it in my hand than order online,\u201d Lusquinos said, adding that he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about order cancellation this way. Like Lusquinos in Florida, Jess Coulson of Milwaukee had a plan. Coulson visited in advance every store where she planned to shop on Thanksgiving, noting where in-store exclusive items were located. Some retailers handed out store maps to people in line, which Coulson said was a help. ",

A man walks past a shop in as retailers discount prices for the Black Friday shopping event on Nov. 23, 2016. (Andrew Matthews / AP) Lindsey Rupp, Sarah VeryBloomberg Now that Election Tuesday is over, retailers are counting on Americans turning their attention to Black Friday . The National Retail Federation projects that about 137.4 million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four-day weekend that starts on Thanksgiving, marking the kickoff to the holiday shopping season. The amount Americans have spent has declined in the last three years, slipping 26 percent from 2013 to an average of $299.60 per person last year, according to the trade group. By most accounts, this holiday season is expected be a boon for retailers. Unemployment, gasoline prices and inflation are low, while wages, home values and the stock market continue to rise. Shoppers have the wherewithal to spend, and now retailers are hoping the holiday season will give them a reason to. Companies such as Kohl's Corp., Gap Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc. have said the U.S. presidential election was a major cause of consumers' recent reluctance to open their wallets. With the outcome settled, they're expecting the dollars to finally flow. \"We've had some, we believe, pent-up demand -- just based on the economics of our consumer,\" J.C. Penney Co. Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said in an interview this month. \"We're anticipating we'll see pent-up demand released, and it being post-election will only help that.\" U.S. retail spending is expected to rise 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion in November and December, the Washington-based NRF estimates. Retailers are poised to take full advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday period, now known by some as Black Week, which accounts for about 15 percent of holiday spending, according to the trade group. J.C. Penney will open its doors at 3 p.m. on Thursday to reach shoppers before they tuck into their Thanksgiving feasts. EBay Inc. is trying to push the selling even earlier: It rebranded the day before Thanksgiving as Mobile Wednesday, using discounts to target traveling Americans. The sales will stretch through the weekend, with online and brick-and-mortar companies offering deals for Cyber Monday . Investors are confident that the retail industry will see strong sales. The Standard & Poor's 500 Retail Index has risen 4.9 percent so far in November and is on pace for its best monthly return since July. Retail stocks have outpaced the broader market since the U.S. presidential election, with the index up 4.7 percent since Nov. 8, compared with the broader S&P 500's 3 percent rally. Historical studies indicate that elections affect the timing of retail sales rather than the overall volume, said Jerry Storch, CEO of Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co. \"Hopefully, when we get to Black Friday, which really tolls the bell of holiday shopping, then the consumer will start looking forward to Christmas,\" Storch said. That would be a welcome development for merchants that have yet to see a sales bump materialize. Dollar sales in the second week of November were 8 percent lower than in the same period a year earlier, according to research firm NPD Group. The decline was broad-based, too, with drops in apparel, toys, technology, athletic footwear and perfumes, the firm said. For shoppers who are ready to spend, they have more ways than ever to do so, with retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. offering exclusive deals to customers who download their mobile applications. Non-store sales may increase 7 percent to 10 percent this year, reaching as much as $117 billion, according to the NRF. Online sales account for the bulk of this measure, the group said. \"If Amazon had everything, like everything you need in the world, I would buy everything from there,\" said Oscar Viral, a 58-year-old chef in New York. \"I wanted something from Macy's, and I got on the internet because they didn't have it available in the store.\" With shoppers able to go online any time for deals, some malls are bucking the trend of opening earlier on the Thanksgiving holiday and staying closed that day. The country's largest shopping mall, the Mall of America in Minneapolis, will remain closed, reopening at 5 a.m. on Friday. But the 520 stores inside have the option to open on Thursday. CBL & Associates, a developer, said it would keep 72 of its malls closed that day, as well. Still, the largest mall operators, Simon Property Group Inc. and General Growth Properties Inc. haven't made plans to close on Thanksgiving, nor have major department-store anchors that typically drive early traffic. No matter when they shop, customers will be hunting for bargains. While a survey of about 1,000 U.S. consumers by AlixPartners indicated that 83 percent of shoppers expect to spend about the same or more this holiday season, mobile phones are making price comparisons simpler than ever. \"We like to scope it out in person, then we go online,\" said Natalie Kelly, a hospitality worker in Florida who was shopping at a mall in Manhattan earlier this week. \"To get me to go into the department store, things would have to be discounted more than they are online.\" ",

    "text": "Your Black Friday cheat sheet: how to find the deals and duds Courtney Jespersen You\u2019ve made your list, you\u2019ve got your comfiest shoes on and you\u2019ve honed your bargain-hunting skills. You\u2019re readier than ever to conquer the stores on\u00a0 Black Friday . But not everything will be business as usual the day after Thanksgiving, as retailer policies will greet consumers with a mixture of shiny gifts and lumps of coal. Here\u2019s what you should know about the shopping rules that have changed ahead of Nov. 25. Coal: Restricted price matching Price matching is a valuable money-saving technique for shoppers. In price matching, store customers can show proof of a lower price from a competitor and ask the store to meet or beat that deal. But price matching probably won\u2019t be there to bail you out of bad deals this Black Friday. Many major retailers make their policies exempt during the annual shopping extravaganza. Toys R Us says it doesn\u2019t match \u201cany competitor\u2019s advertised store or online pricing for Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday .\u201d Target strikes out price matches and adjustments for prices from Thanksgiving Day through the end of the following week. You\u2019ll find similar blackout dates at Best Buy and Staples. That\u2019s because price matches can be time consuming for retailers, said Sucharita Mulpuru, chief retail strategist for annual commerce industry convention Shoptalk. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to be discounting products even further than they already are, especially if you only have limited units of the product,\u201d Mulpuru added. So if you won\u2019t be able to price match while you\u2019re standing in the store, compare prices before you shop and head straight to the retailer with the best offer. Apps such as BuyVia and ShopSavvy can make comparing a breeze. Gift: More free shipping Here\u2019s a present for you: Free shipping won\u2019t just exist on Black Friday; there will be more of it than usual. That\u2019s welcome news, since 93% of online shoppers surveyed in the\u00a0 National Retail Federation\u2019s annual holiday consumer spending survey \u00a0said they\u2019ll take advantage of free shipping this holiday season. A handful of big-box retailers have eliminated their free shipping minimums for Black Friday and throughout the holidays, granting their Internet customers free shipping on everything, regardless of price. At Best Buy, items ship free through Christmas Eve, and at Target, free standard shipping extends through Jan. 1, 2017. Use free shipping for even your smallest orders, but remember that some exclusions may apply to these promotions; read the fine print. Coal: Limited coupons If coupons are your go-to discount method, think again on Black Friday. With deals and discounts so prevalent in the days after Thanksgiving, it\u2019ll be more difficult to stack coupons on top of what you\u2019re already saving. Last Black Friday, for instance, Macy\u2019s stuffed savings passes within its Black Friday ad with coupons for $10 off purchases of $25 or more or $20 off $50 or more, but the discounts were only good for a limited period and couldn\u2019t be used on door busters or deals of the day. In 2015, Kohl\u2019s shoppers earned $15 Kohl\u2019s Cash for every $50 spent, but the coupons could be redeemed only during the first week of December. Keep a close eye on coupon restrictions and limitations again this year. Gift: Longer return periods Some retailers will have one more treat to offer \u2014 extended return policy windows. In case you\u2019re filled with regret after your Black Friday shopping splurge, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to return or exchange your not-so-hot purchases. Items shipped by Amazon.com from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 may be returned until Jan. 31 for a full refund, subject to return guidelines. This is much more generous than Amazon\u2019s typical 30-day return period. At Newegg, almost every product bought Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 can be returned for a refund or replacement until Jan. 31. Sears, too, has made returns easier. Select items purchased Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 \u2014 which typically have 30-day return periods \u2014 can be returned through the end of January. Check your favorite store\u2019s return policy for similar extended holiday offerings. These can be found on a retailer\u2019s website.

    "text": "By Emily Schultheis CBS News November 24, 2016, 10:12 AM No more Electoral College? Here's how campaigning might change Email Imagine this scenario: a presidential campaign in which the campaigns focused their attention on big cities like Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. More national TV advertising. And a race that depended far more on turning out one\u2019s base than on expanding appeal to new voters. That might be the reality if the United States decided to get rid of the Electoral College in presidential campaigns. 2016 is on track to be the fifth election in U.S. political history in which the candidate who wins the most votes is not the one elected president -- giving rise to another round of calls to abolish the Electoral College system. All told, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is currently leading President-elect Donald Trump by about 1.7 million votes nationally, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s win in the Electoral College. Mr. Trump, for his part, has responded to the criticism of the system by saying he would have won under a national popular vote system as well. In a meeting with the New York Times Tuesday, the president-elect said, \u201cI\u2019d rather do the popular vote from the standpoint \u2014 I\u2019d think we\u2019d do actually as well or better \u2014 it\u2019s a whole different campaign. It\u2019s like, if you\u2019re a golfer, it\u2019s like match play versus stroke play. It\u2019s a whole different game.\u201d Still, he has tweeted about the \u201cgenius\u201d of the Electoral College. A petition is circulating with the hopes of making Hillary Clinton the president because she won the popular vote, despite losing the Electoral C... \u201cThe Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play,\u201d he wrote in one tweet. \u201cCampaigning is much different!\u201d Given the complexity of actually changing the U.S. electoral system, it seems fairly unlikely that the country will get rid of the Electoral College anytime soon. But for the sake of argument, what would an Electoral College-less presidential election really look like? There would be upsides and downsides to such a system -- for proponents and opponents alike, it\u2019s hard to deny that the way a campaign conceives of its strategy and tactics would be drastically different. Instead of a small number of national battleground states in which the candidates focus the majority of their attention , they would instead go to where their votes are -- even if those votes are in a deeply Democratic- or Republican-leaning state. For Democrats, that would mean mining the urban centers they already depend on, but expanding those efforts even more to solidly Democratic states like California and New York. Out of Clinton\u2019s approximately 64 million votes nationally, more than 7.5 million came from California alone. And Republicans would focus where their largest numbers of votes are: in some deeply GOP counties around the country, and likely on suburban areas where they\u2019ve done well in the past. \u201cYou would probably have legitimate field offices in Los Angeles, New York, Miami, San Francisco,\u201d said Michael Trujillo, a Los Angeles-based Democratic strategist. \u201cYou would basically be doing base turnout, and Republicans would be doing base turnout in Texas and the Deep South.\u201d In order to reach more voters across the country, candidates would likely turn to more national television advertising -- instead of what campaigns do now, which is essentially flood the airwaves in a small number of states and media markets. President-elect Donald Trump gave a preview of what he plans to focus on during his first 100 days in office in a short video. CBS News digital j... \u201cYou\u2019re going to see more of what I called national TV ads, as opposed to buying the Dayton, Ohio, market out,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cSo you would have seen more of the campaigns\u2019 ads during the baseball playoffs ... it would have been less newsworthy and more sort of the way campaigns would have been run.\u201d On the flip side, smaller states that currently get a lot of attention might see candidates start to make themselves scarce. Mr. Trump spent part or all of 43 days in Iowa during the course of the 2016 campaign, for example, and Clinton spent 49 days there. If the campaigns were focused on solely the popular vote, Iowa\u2019s approximately 3 million residents would see far less of the candidates after the primaries were over. Mr. Trump alluded to this aspect of the Electoral College in his talk with the New York Times. \u201cWhat it does do is it gets you out to see states that you\u2019ll never see otherwise. It\u2019s very interesting. Like Maine. I went to Maine four times. I went to Maine...because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270,\u201d adding that the calculation was ultimately \u201cfalse,\u201d given that his electoral tally at this point exceeds 300 (Michigan has not yet been called). \u201cSmaller states are going to see much less of the candidate,\u201d said Norm Sterzenbach, a veteran Democratic strategist based in Iowa. \u201cYou get rid of that system and you go to a national popular vote and they\u2019re going to campaign where the votes are.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say how campaigning in 2016 would have been different had the end goal been to win the popular vote, not the Electoral College. Trump and his allies have suggested that the GOP businessman could have made inroads in Democratic states had they put more time and resources there. \u201cIf we had total vote mattering, we would have competed in California,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier this month. \u201cAnd then -- we would probably have picked up at least 2 million votes just by competing.\u201d Trujillo pointed to Republicans\u2019 recent attempts to win statewide in California, like Meg Whitman\u2019s unsuccessful $140 million gubernatorial effort in 2010 , to dispute the idea that a more concerted Republican campaign in California could significantly chip away at Democrats\u2019 massive vote lead there.

(It\u2019s not easy to get to No. 1 when your career overlaps with three of the greatest tennis players to ever live.) Now some folks back in\u00a0Great Britain are calling for him to be knighted by the Queen. Not so fast, though, says Murray. From the BBC : Speaking about the possibility, Andy Murray said: \u201cObviously it is the highest honour you can get in this country. I don\u2019t know, I feel too young for something like that. \u201cI don\u2019t think about that stuff much, really. When I win any award or am presented with anything it is nice because it is recognition for what you have given your life to, up to now anyway. \u201cI am still young and there are still a lot of things that can go wrong, I could still mess up and make mistakes. Do stuff wrong. I am just trying to keep doing what I am doing, working hard, and achieving stuff.\u201d I\u2019ve seen some internet folks\u00a0trying to frame this as Murray \u201cturning down\u201d the honor, which it clearly isn\u2019t. He\u2019s probably just surprised by the whole thing, and he\u2019s totally right \u2014 knighthood is for the old people. It\u2019s a lifetime achievement award. He\u2019s doing stuff\u00a0right now.\u00a0He frames it as he can still \u201cmess up and make mistakes\u201d which is adorably Andy Murray, but I agree with his take. Knighthood is for the olds.

    "text": "Pitcher Ralph Branca at Dodgers spring training camp in Vero Beach, Fla. Bettmann Archive hide caption toggle caption Pitcher Ralph Branca at Dodgers spring training camp in Vero Beach, Fla. Bettmann Archive Ralph Branca, the Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher who gave up the \"shot heard 'round the world\" back in 1951, died at midnight Tuesday. Branca was 90 years old and died in his sleep at an assisted living home, his publicist, Diana Baron, said. Branca had a remarkable 12-year career in the major leagues, where he put up a career 3.79 ERA and made the All-Star roster three times. But Branca will always be remembered for one pitch he made during the National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and their crosstown rival New York Giants in 1951. He entered the game as a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth inning and gave up a walk-off home run to Bobby Thomson. Here's the New York Times on the significance of that moment : \"In baseball lore the Thomson homer has been preserved in amber. It sits alongside Lou Gehrig's farewell at Yankee Stadium, Don Larsen's perfect game in a World Series and 'the Catch,' Willie Mays's spectacular over-the-shoulder, warning-track snare of a Series blast at the same Polo Grounds, three years after Thomson's 'shot.' \"It was also immortalized in American literature by Don DeLillo, who opened his 1997 novel, 'Underworld,' with an extended, lyrical re-creation of that Wednesday at Coogan's Bluff, complete with echoes of the radio announcer Russ Hodges's disbelieving call as the ball headed for the fence and sailed over the Dodgers' left fielder Andy Pafko, culminating, as pandemonium erupted, with the joyous, repeated declaration, 'The Giants win the pennant!' \" YouTube In 2001, The Wall Street Journal found evidence that the Giants may have been cheating by placing a telescope in center field to steal pitch signs from opposing teams. Thomson denied he knew what pitch was coming . Article continues after sponsorship Either way, friends said despite that news and the outsize role that pitch played in Branca's life, he was always the consummate professional. \"Ralph always held his head high,\" sportscaster Vin Scully said in a statement. \"He never let that incident define him. He was bigger than that. When he retired five years later in 1956, he did so with his self-respect intact. Some men display heroism in victory. But far more impressive is the display of heroism in loss. Ralph's acceptance of that loss, without rancor or bitterness, is one of the most inspiring examples of sportsmanship I've been privileged to witness.\" Branca is survived by his wife and his two daughters. Correction Nov. 23, 2016 A previous version of this story misspelled Bobby Thomson's last name as Thompson and gave Vin Scully's first name as Vince. ",

It's unclear how this year's scheduled protest will affect retailers' business on the busy shopping day. A Black Friday shopper passes by protesters blocking the entrance to a Victoria's Secret store on North Michigan Avenue on Nov. 27, 2015. It's unclear how this year's scheduled protest will affect retailers' business on the busy shopping day. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Activists plan to again disrupt shopping along Chicago's Magnificent Mile on Black Friday. The demonstration, spearheaded by the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, is seeking more police accountability and protesting how police shootings that sparked last year's protests have been handled. \"We want justice for all those who've been victimized by police crimes in this city,\" Frank Chapman, a field organizer with the group, said Wednesday. Last year on Black Friday, hundreds of activists marched along Chicago's highest-profile retail street, urging a shopping boycott to protest the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager, by a white Chicago police officer. Protesters temporarily blocked customers from entering some stores, and some retailers decided to close early. A handful of merchants said sales were 25 to 50 percent below expectations on what is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year. This year, activists plan to gather on the north end of North Michigan Avenue at 10 a.m. Friday before walking north and south on the west side of the street, Chapman said. \"We want to discourage people from shopping on the Mag Mile,\" Chapman said. \"We're sending a message to the mayor and his supporters and the Mag Mile that we want CPAC enacted,\" he added, referring to a proposal to create an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council to oversee the department. Protesters, joined by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the leaders of the Chicago Teachers Union, marched down the Magnificent Mile on Black Friday and on Saturday in support of police shooting victim Laquan McDonald. They\u00a0called for the resignation of police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. While not organized in opposition to President-elect Donald Trump, \"We'd proudly take on (the anti-Trump) banner,\" he said. It's unclear whether this year's protest will have a similar effect on retailers' Black Friday business, said Magnificent Mile Association President John Chikow. \"People have a right to say what they want to say,\" Chikow said. \"We just hope everybody respects others' rights to be able to do what they need to do.\" Managers at some Michigan Avenue stores declined to comment on the record on Tuesday, saying they were not authorized to speak to the media. Water Tower Place \"incorporates a 24/7 safety and security team and is in close partnership with (Chicago Police Department) as well as the Magnificent Mile Association. At any given time, there are a number of professionally trained security officers on site at the shopping center,\" mall owner General Growth Properties said in an emailed statement. ",

A senior intelligence official cautioned that it was too early to gauge the significance of Trump's sparse briefing schedule, given that he is in the middle of his transition process. But the news, first reported by The Washington Post , will likely fuel critics who've questioned Trump's knowledge of foreign affairs and national security issues. Related: Clinton's Popular Vote Lead Now More Than 2 Million While a team of intelligence analysts remains ready and waiting to deliver briefings to the president-elect, sources told NBC News that he has accepted them only twice. Instead, Trump has turned the briefings down to focus on meetings with potential Cabinet members , media executives and business associates. Pence, on the other hand, has received the briefings nearly every day, the sources said. The President's Daily Brief is a document that includes top-secret information and is meant to provide presidents-elect with an overview of security developments and the workings of the U.S. intelligence community and defense apparatus.

If you have video game lovers on your shopping list, video games (software only) will offer the most value relative to their current prices. The worst deal on Black Friday: jewelry. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Black Friday madness shouldn't spill back into Thanksgiving Thursday. Shopping on Thanksgiving Day in 2015 in Panama City, Fla. (Photo: Patti Blake, AP) If you\u2019re reading this any place other than in a store or at a shopping mall, congratulations, you\u2019re part of a healthy trend: Not shopping on Black Friday. And if you ignored the siren call of shopping on Thanksgiving Day itself,\u00a0then you\u2019re already ahead:\u00a0 You spent the day doing something more interesting and worthwhile than exercising your credit cards. Black Friday came of age in the 1980s, kicking off the holiday shopping season. By the mid-2000s, store\u00a0openings were pushed into the pre-dawn hours. The race to be first ended in tragedy when 2,000 shoppers burst through the doors at a Wal-Mart on\u00a0Long Island, N.Y., in 2008 and trampled an employee to death moments before the 5 a.m. opening. \u00a0All in the name of finding a bargain. By 2011, several retailers \u2014\u00a0including Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Macy\u2019s, Wal-Mart and Target \u2014 introduced shopping on Thanksgiving night , turning what was once a day of feasting, family and\u00a0football\u00a0into one more day of crass commercialism, one more day for retail workers to be on the job. Thanksgiving deserves to be celebrated as a holiday all its own. It has been a uniquely American tradition since Abraham Lincoln declared a national day of thanksgiving, a holiday that all families, no matter their race, religion or culture, can share. Humorist Art Buchwald once called it the \u201conly time during the year\u201d when Americans \u201ceat better than the French do.\u201d That in itself is worth celebrating. The good news this year is that the public is\u00a0pushing back against shopping on Thanksgiving Day. Meanwhile, Black Friday is no longer what it once was. In a survey by Deloitte this fall, 67% of shoppers said they disagreed with stores being open on Thanksgiving, and\u00a023% said they\u2019d be more loyal to retailers that closed. They\u2019ve also voted with their feet:\u00a0In 2014, there were 4% fewer shoppers on Thanksgiving Day than in 2013, according to surveys by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights and Analytics \u2014\u00a0a small decline, but relevant in an improving economy. (Comparable figures for 2015 are not available.) This year, more malls and chains are taking the hint: Thanksgiving closures included the giant Mall of America in Minnesota, hhgregg electronics stores, T.J. Maxx and Costco . Some are using the decision to public relations\u00a0advantage.\u00a0Outdoor retailing chain REI\u00a0announced for the second year that\u00a0it would be closed on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, creating social media buzz with its #OptOutside campaign. For other reasons, Black Friday has lost some of its appeal.\u00a0Foot traffic has been down in recent years. And net sales in stores have declined. Special discounts are offered earlier in November, so there's no point in waiting\u00a0until Friday. Customers are getting used to shopping online at their leisure: Over the past year, online shopping grew far faster than overall sales, boosted in part by online's continuing\u00a0unfair sales tax advantage over brick-and-mortar stores. Lest anyone fear the end of shopping orgies, there are plenty of new contenders. In 2014, Super Saturday,\u00a0the last Saturday before Christmas, eclipsed Black Friday for the most foot traffic.\u00a0This year, there are predictions of new sales records on Dec. 23 , which doesn\u2019t yet have a name. How about Frantic Friday? As an antidote to commercialism, a group of non-profits in 2012 organized Giving Tuesday \u00a0\u2014\u00a0otherwise known as the day after Cyber Monday \u2014\u00a0to encourage activities more in keeping with the spirit of the season.\u00a0The day generated $117 million in charitable donations\u00a0last year, but sadly it is still far less known than Black Friday. None of this is to suggest that there's anything wrong with\u00a0shopping.\u00a0Retailing is a huge driver of the U.S. economy, generating jobs in manufacturing and employing more than 10 million retail sales workers . But for the final Thursday each November, it would be better to give it a rest. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its\u00a0 Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.

Jason Arres said. The incident occurred at about 2 a.m. in the 1400 block of Fairway Drive, when the victim and five of his friends were returning from an evening out and got into a \"verbal dispute\" with a man who was driving through the complex, Arres said. The suspect, described as Hispanic and in his 20s, pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots before fleeing in a white SUV, he said. The shooting victim, a West Chicago resident, was hit in the shoulder. He has been admitted to Edward Hospital in Naperville, Arres said. It's not yet known how many shots were fired or what type of gun was used, he said. Police do not believe the incident was gang related. At least one of the five people involved in the lives in the apartment complex, Arres said. None of them knew the suspect prior to the incident, he said. Anyone who may have witnessed the shooting or has information about it is asked to call the investigations division at 630-420-6666. ",

Mark Humphrey/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Humphrey/AP A school bus is carried away on Tuesday in Chattanooga, Tenn., from the site where it crashed on Monday. The bus driver, Johnthony Walker, 24, has been arrested on charges including vehicular homicide, reckless driving and reckless endangerment. The crash killed six elementary school students. Mark Humphrey/AP Police in Chattanooga, Tenn., say toxicology test results released on Wednesday show school bus driver, Johnthony Walker, 24, had no alcohol or drugs in his system. Police say Walker was not driving his designated route when the bus left the road and crashed into a tree on Monday. Five children died on Monday and a sixth child, who had been hospitalized, died on Wednesday. Five children remain hospitalized. Walker had been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, and authorities say he now will be charged with a sixth. At the time of the crash, 37 children were on the bus on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School. Reporter Michael Edward Miller of member station WUTC tells our Newscast unit: \"The bus crashed on Talley Road, a narrow winding road in a Chattanooga residential area. The driver may have been speeding. The bus had cameras, but they're so damaged, the NTSB can't download footage yet. Chattanooga police are conducting a separate, criminal investigation.\" National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart told a news conference that Walker had no criminal record in the state. Article continues after sponsorship Chattanooga Police Sgt. Austin Garrett says investigators have not yet spoken to any of the surviving children. The Associated Press reports: \"Police disputed one woman's claim that the driver asked the children if they were 'prepared to die' just before the wreck. Jasmine Mateen, whose 6-year-old daughter was among the dead, said one of her two surviving children who were on the bus told her about the driver's remarks. \"Garrett, however, said at a Wednesday press conference: 'I want to be very clear on this. No witness we have spoken with has that information or provided it directly to our investigators.' \" The bus company has not responded to questions about Walker's safety or employment record, but the head of the company did release a condolence video on YouTube. The New York Times reports: \"The chief executive of Durham School Services, the busing contractor for the school district in Hamilton County, Tenn., offered an emotional apology for the crash, which has prompted rigorous scrutiny of a company that transports more than a million schoolchildren in the United States each day. \" 'I can't fathom the anguish of the parents whose children were involved in this horrific accident and that involved one of my company's buses,' the executive, David A. Duke, said in a video that Durham published on YouTube. 'Nothing that I can say can take away the pain and the grief for these families. What I can say is I'm deeply sorry for the children that were taken from their families with so much life before them.' \" A makeshift memorial to the victims has grown with people adding more stuffed animals, flowers and balloons to the collection. School officials repeatedly declined to answer questions Wednesday about whether they received complaints about the driver. The Associated Press reports: \"School Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran said their focus is on 'giving our families and students the support that they need in this tragedy.' \" \"Walker was involved in another bus accident only two months ago, police said. In September, he was driving the bus into a blind curve when he crossed over the center line and hit an SUV, according to a police report. No one was injured, and the damage to both vehicles was minor. He was not cited for any violations.\" ",

The press service for the national military police couldn't immediately say whether the incident is linked to a terror act or not. A press official said early Friday that more than 100 members of the security forces have been dispatched on the scene in the village of Montferrier-sur-Lez, near the southern town of Montpellier. The body of the deceased woman was found gagged and tied up outside the building, the official said. The security forces searched the four floors of the residence but did not find the assailant. Research was continuing in other parts. The official said 59 monks are out of danger. 0 Shares ",

(Shasta County Sheriff's Office) (Newser) \u2013 Sherri Papini, the mother of two who vanished after going for a jog Nov. 2, has been found alive. USA TODAY Sherri Papini (Photo: Provided) REDDING, Calif. \u2014 Sherri Papini, the Mountain Gate mom who went missing Nov. 2 after going on a jog, was located safe, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office announced Thursday . According to the sheriff's office, Papini was reunited with husband, Keith Papini. She is \"safe, in stable condition and receiving medical clearance at an undisclosed hospital.\" Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said at a news conference Thurday afternoon that a reward that was offered for Sherri Papini played no role in her safe discovery. Anonymous donor offers $50K 'ransom' for missing Calif. woman Bosenko says his office was notified at 4:30 a.m. Thursday that Papini had been released by her captor on a rural road near Interstate 5 in Yolo County. She was bound with restraints, but got help from a passing motorist on Interstate 5 near a county road, he said. The California Highway Patrol, Yolo County Sheriff's Office and medical personnel immediately responded to her location, he said. A family spokesman thanked law enforcement officers for their work and residents for support and prayers that were answered Thursday. \"This is a Thanksgiving beyond belief for all of us,\" Rod Rodriguez posted on the Facebook group Redding Crime 2.0. \"Although I have no details yet we are joyous that Sherri is alive and Keith is reunited with her at the hospital.\" Developments in the case came about two hours after friends, family and supporters gathered at Diestelhorst Landing in Redding for a somber balloon release to bring awareness that she was missing and to keep hope alive in finding her. Turkey Trot participants watched as hundreds of yellow balloons floated in the sky. Papini family friend Scott Bruland kept his hopes up as he addressed a crowd and recited a poem Keith Papini had written to his wife. Later during the event, Bruland said he was hopeful there would be a break in the case. \"We hope Sherri is found and is returned safely very soon.\" His wife, Jessica Bruland, passed out yellow ribbons during the event. She asked people to keep her friend in the eye of the public. Separately, a ransom-turned-reward website created by a mystery donor has been shut down. A check of the site around the time of the sheriff's office's announcement showed it was blank. A call to negotiator Cameron Gamble was not immediately returned.

Four inmates escaped from a California jail, on Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office said Thursday. Two of the men were recaptured just outside the jail after the nighttime escape, but the other two, Rogelio Chavez and Campbell, remained on the lam early Thursday, authorities said. (Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office via AP) 0 Shares Email Four inmates cut their way through the bars of a second-story window and rappelled down the side of a California jail using a makeshift rope of bedding and clothing before making their way clear of the facility, the Santa Clara County sheriff's office said Thursday. Two of the men were recaptured just outside the jail after the Wednesday night escape, but the other two, Rogelio Chavez and Laron Campbell, remain on the lam, Sgt. Rich Glennon said. Crime scene detectives were working to figure out how the men were able to cut through the window's bars. A deputy patrolling the jail's perimeter spotted the men as they made their escape. \"He kind of thought he saw some movement in the shadows looked up and saw some bedding in the window,\" Glennon told The Associated Press. Both Chavez and Campbell were facing false imprisonment and weapons charges, among other counts, when they made their escape. Several agencies are searching for the men, with help from dogs and a helicopter using thermal imaging. The men were last seen in their jail clothing, consisting of an orange top over gray bottoms. Chavez has a distinctive face tattoo that resembles an inky gash going through his left eye. The recaptured men, whose names are not being released, are expected to face charges for the escape. Glennon warned the public off approaching the men if they see them, but is asking people in the area to remain vigilant. \"We definitely don't want the community to approach these individuals, but be aware of anything suspicious,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Sherri Papini, 34, disappeared Nov. 2 after leaving home to jog, her family said. Her cellphone and headphones were found near the site where she was last seen. Her husband reported her missing when she didn\u2019t arrive to pick up their two young children from day care.\u00a0 Police and dozens of volunteers previously searched an area around Mountain Gate, an unincorporated community near Redding. Shasta County sheriff Tom Bosenko said investigators now believe Papini was abducted. Bosenko said she was released by her captor or captors early on Thanksgiving Day along I-5 in northern Yolo County. Allegedly bound with restraints, she flagged down a passing driver for help.\u00a0 Papini was freed from her restraints and taken to a local hospital where she was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and released, Bosenko said Bosenko said investigators have not located a suspect or suspects. He said they\u2019re searching for a dark colored SUV with two Hispanic females armed with a handgun. He said he didn\u2019t know a possible motive or whether the abduction was targeted or random. Papini and her husband Keith have been reunited. Papini\u2019s husband is \u201coverjoyed\u201d that his wife is safe, Bosenko said.

Chicago Public Schools will host two public hearings Monday at its headquarters on a revised annual operating budget. (Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune) Juan Perez Jr. Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago Public Schools will host two public hearings Monday on a revised annual operating budget that includes tens of millions of dollars in new expenses. The school board approved a budget in August, but an additional round of hearings is needed because of the financial provisions in a new contract for teachers reached in October, moments before a strike deadline set by the Chicago Teachers Union . The school board will also take another budget vote. According to CPS officials, the teachers contract will cost the district an additional $55 million this year \u2014 still barely a blip in a budget that now surpasses $5.5 billion. CPS officials have said about 85 percent of the $55 million in extra spending comes from new \"step-and-lane\" pay increases for teachers based on their experience and education. The district is relying on Mayor Rahm Emanuel's promise of a new infusion of money from special city taxing districts to pay for the increase. CPS now is expecting to get $87.5 million in tax increment financing dollars, a vast increase from the roughly $32 million of surplus TIF district money the district initially budgeted. CPS has said the teachers contract would cost slightly more than $2.3 billion in the district's current budget year. The annual cost increases next year, to $2.4 billion, and by 2019, the district's annual expenses on the deal would stretch slightly past $2.4 billion, the district said. Both the union and CPS have praised the deal. The CTU says the contract contains hundreds of millions of dollars worth of upgrades compared with a deal the union rejected in January. CPS CEO Forrest Claypool described the deal as \"the most cost-effective contract in history,\" while citing lower across-the-board pay increases and changes to union health care plans and contributions.

The accident happened around 7:30 a.m. local time when \"the platform of a power plant's cooling tower under construction collapsed in Fengcheng, east China's Jiangxi Province,\" Xinhua News said. UPDATE: #XiJinping urges rescue, follow-up efforts after deadly accident in east China kills 67 https://t.co/FkBENmkqeX pic.twitter.com/zpcpb0JyIL \u2014 China Xinhua News (@XHNews) November 24, 2016 The Associated Press reported: \"About 500 rescue workers, including paramilitary police officers, were digging through the debris with their hands, according to state broadcaster CCTV. It showed debris strewn across the floor of the cavernous, 165-meter (545-foot) -high concrete cooling tower, in the middle of which stood an unfinished structure. \"Rescue dogs were seeking to locate survivors or the bodies of victims, while backhoes shifted wreckage to the margins of the massive round tower.\" State media said that President Xi Jinping \"urged local authorities to step up efforts of rescue, treatment and follow-up work.\" The scaffolding collapse is the latest in a series of deadly accidents in China that have been blamed on hasty construction and lax safety standards. Article continues after sponsorship Earlier this month, 33 miners in southwest China were killed after a gas explosion . In August 2015, two explosions at a warehouse in the port city of Tianjin killed dozens. In December 2015, a massive man-made pile of dirt and debris swept away three buildings and killed more than 80 people in southern China. ",

In Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said a tsunami threat from the earthquake had passed. The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter of the 12:43 p.m. quake was about 92 miles south-southwest of the port of El Triunfo, El Salvador. El Triunfo is located about 50 miles southeast of San Salvador, the capital, where the quake was felt strongly. Nicaragua, meanwhile, was already under alert after Hurricane Otto made landfall on the country\u2019s Caribbean coast. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Price: $59.99 Description: \"Overwatch\" has only been out for several months, but it\u2019s already creating its own culture \u2014 and for good reason. The online multiplayer game lets players pick from a variety of unique characters, which then work together as a team toward their goals. Lifespans are short in this game, and players can switch between characters often (read: between deaths) to provide different sorts of support for their team throughout the matches.  The game is arguably only as good, however, as the people you play it with. If you don\u2019t have a thick skin or are unfamiliar with the culture of online gaming, you may want to make sure to play with a buddy or two, at least at the beginning. The community has been fairly well-behaved, but coordination and communication are important, and it\u2019s generally far more fun to play with the devils you know. Adult Games Pro: Action-packed, good-looking and fun. Con: The story may leave some people wanting more. Price: $59.99 Description: \"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided\" is set in a time after a global incident caused all humans with cybernetic implants to lash out with unspeakable violence. As the game\u2019s own enhanced protagonist, Adam Jensen, players must fight their way through a world that calls for combat of all kinds, from high-tech hacking to good old-fashioned brawling.  The weak point of this game is likely its story, which takes some interesting, even convoluted twists and has drawn complaints about an abrupt ending. It\u2019s true that the game could grapple more deeply with questions about humanity and machinery that are inherent in the plot. But the story at least doesn\u2019t distract too much from some seriously solid gameplay that is fun and rewarding. Adult Games Pro: A rich alternative history to a fascinating period Con: Multiplayer mode may take some time to develop Price: $59.99 Description: War is cruel, and \"Battlefield 1\" takes players back to one of the most brutal and unforgiving wars ever \u2014 World War I. In an age where the industry seems obsessed with space marines and future tech, it\u2019s a bold step. And it\u2019s one that pays off for \"Battlefield,\" which takes pains to recreate (as much as is possible) the muddy, bloody experience of trench warfare. The game actually flits between several perspectives, giving players a small taste of the settings and people caught up in this pivotal conflict.  The game is still fairly young, and so it\u2019s hard to say how the atmosphere of the multiplayer will evolve. Multiplayer is a huge part of any \"Battlefield\" game, and so this a major component of the game that\u2019s still, essentially, under development. That said, the modes are fun, and familiar to anyone who\u2019s played any iteration of this franchise before. Adult Games Pro: Gives players flexibility and plenty of room to run Con: Starts off stronger than it ends Price: $59.99 Description: \"Mafia III\" puts players in the shoes of Lincoln Clay, a biracial gangster recently returned from Vietnam and looking for revenge against the Sicilian mob that took out his crime family in a stylized version of New Orleans. New Bordeaux, as the game\u2019s city is called, is divided into districts and players have to conquer each part of the city as they build their own empire from the ashes of the old one. \"Mafia III\" gives Clay his own lieutenants, which also sets up an internal power struggle to offset the larger battle. \"Mafia III\" starts off strong but can get bogged down as players work their way through the story and the city and can eventually lose some of its momentum. The game has missed some opportunities, particularly to shine a light on the era that the developers very consciously chose. But on balance, \"Mafia III\" is still worth a look for players who like the franchise and those with an appreciation for a good setting. Adult Games Pro: The game keeps up a tense, exciting mood from start to finish Con: Some cosmetic hiccups can cause problems during the game Price: $59.99 Description: \"XCOM 2,\" a turn-based strategy game, carries over all the tension and high-stakes play of its predecessor, \"XCOM.\" The world, conquered by aliens, is in need of your armed resistance and careful planning for the sake of humanity. But be warned: this game is not designed to be easy. It is hard and purposefully random, sometimes to the point of cruelty \u2014 but not necessarily in a bad way. Just expect to feel your fair share of frustration, and don\u2019t get too attached to any of the characters you direct. \"XCOM 2\" is a solid game, though at times there can be some cosmetic hiccups that keep players from getting a full view of the map around them \u2014 critical information to have when creating a battle strategy. But these problems are likely to be fixed in future patches and shouldn\u2019t prevent anyone from picking the game up. The random nature of the game also gives it great replay value, since you\u2019re unlikely to get exactly the same experience twice. Adult Games Pro: This innovative game provides some interesting challenges Con: It may be a little too quirky for some. Price: $19.99 Description: \"Unravel\" is perhaps best-described as a game of pure whimsy. This title puts players in the place of a small creature made of Yarn \u2014 Yarny, actually \u2014 who must make his way through the world using only the yarn contained in his own body. Players can use the free end of Yarny to swing from branch to branch and attach themselves to points in the environment to get around a host of obstacles. As long as you can find another supply of yarn, you\u2019re fine to keep unraveling yourself to move forward.   This tender game actually does have a plot that touches on longing, love, loss and nostalgia, but it\u2019s mostly a meditative puzzle game that requires just a dab of critical thinking. Puzzles can get a bit repetitive, and the controls are not always as responsive as players might like. But overall, it is a sweet tale and one worth checking out if you like a slower pace to your play. Adult Games Pro: You get to drive a hovertank! Con: Requires the PS VR, which means an extra expense. Price: $59.99 Description: \"Battlezone VR\" puts players in the cockpit of a hovertank, thanks to the PlayStation VR virtual reality headset. The game, which one can play seated, places players on a stylized version of a battle field but still manages to convince your senses that you\u2019re actually driving and moving around in your very own enormous vehicle. A reboot of an old Atari franchise, the game certainly retains an arcade feel that should appeal to plenty of players.  Players can shoot enemies and take territory in battles, all while working toward a broader victory. It can feel at times like you\u2019re constantly under siege, particularly with the VR, so it\u2019s probably a game best left to short bursts of play. Players can participate in online matches, or stay offline if they prefer. Adult Games Pro: Inside is a unique and dark game that is utterly engaging. Con: As an indie game, it lacks that blockbuster smash. Price: $19.99 Description: \"Inside\" is going to make a lot of top independent game lists this year, and with good cause. This puzzle-platformer has a unique feel to it, and deftly sketches out a terrifying world. Players inhabit a small boy who\u2019s running from guards in a very eerie world inhabited by zombie-like people. Using the boy\u2019s powers of mind control, players can solve puzzles as he makes his way through the environment.   The game has a dark humor augmented by its indie aesthetic, which while certainly not in the style of a photorealistic blockbuster, does help set the mood for what is, ultimately, a pretty horrifying world. Plot twists add to the excitement of the game, which admittedly isn\u2019t very long \u2014 a dedicated player could probably knock it out in an evening. That said, even though it\u2019s short, it\u2019s well worth the time and money to play it. Kid Games Yo-Kai Watch 2 (Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls) Pro: Quirky characterizations and charming writing. Con: Can get a bit repetitive, particularly for those who\u2019ve played the first game. Price: $39.99 Description: A Pokemon-style game, \"Yo-kai Watch 2\" asks kids, or players of all ages, to search the world for spirits, called Yo-kai, to fight and gain the right to summon on command. This second installment of the series comes in two versions \u2014 \"Bony Spirits\" and \"Fleshy Souls\" \u2014 which represent two factions of a civil war within the universe. (Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s quite civil as civil wars go.)  These versions of the game also add online multiplayer battles, which is a welcome addition but worth noting for parents who want to keep an eye on their kids\u2019 online interactions. Combat in general is fun and engaging, though it can feel like a bit of a slog if you don\u2019t take a break every now and then. Overall, though, this is a worthy sequel to a fun franchise and worth checking out. Kid Games Pro: A classic franchise meets a \u201cMinecraft\u201d-style building world with good results. Con: Not necessarily action-packed. Price: $59.99 Description: \"Minecraft\" has become the gold standard of \u201cbuilder\u201d games, which let players create their own worlds from materials they mine and hone into the tools of their choosing. \"Dragon Quest Builders\" could have easily been a \"Minecraft\" clone that just happened to be set in the world of the classic series, but the developers have deftly avoided that trap and made it into a full-fledged concept on its own.  Building is a big part of this game, and players are asked to construct buildings in four different main areas throughout the story, to serve different purposes. Each of the areas has its own rules about what should be built and how, and each advances the game in its own way. But story \u2014 an area that \"Minecraft\" has always largely ignored \u2014 also plays a big part in \"Dragon Quest Builders.\" The role-playing elements of the central series shine through in this spinoff as well, making it distinctly different from most builder games. Kid Games Disney Art Academy for Nintendo 3DS Pro: Good, clean fun that\u2019s sneakily educational Con: The stylus can feel clunky at times. Price: $29.99 Description: Kids can tap their inner Walt Disney in this game, which offers basic instruction on how to sketch characters from the Disneyverse while secretly teaching kids (gasp!) some of the basics of drawing. Younger players may particularly like learning how to draw characters they recognize, even if the game does stick mostly to the fundamentals.  It is true that this game will not make you a stunning artist overnight \u2014 or, indeed, replace a good drawing class in any meaningful way. The stylus on the 3DS doesn\u2019t always feel like the most precise tool. And the game itself can lose its luster over time. But it is fun, and could help get players thinking about how to apply their creative skills to their own characters down the line. For parents, it\u2019s a purchase they can make without worrying about what content may show up in the game. Kid Games Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens Pro: A witty send-up and love letter to the Star Wars franchise. Con: The humor is probably a little mature for very young players Price: $50 Description: The Lego video game adaptations of popular movies are always fun for the whole family, and \"Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is no exception. As always, Lego has adapted this game to be part love letter and part parody, staying true to the original material while also putting a snarky spin on it. The game itself is a combination of action, adventure and puzzler \u2014 a well-rounded game that should have appeal for most types of players.   The game carries a rating of 10 and up, which is appropriate for its humor. While things never get blue or bawdy, there is some humor that will appeal more to older children (and adults) than your little ones. There is also some cartoon violence, though certainly nothing that could be called disturbing \u2014 just objects dissolving into piles of Legos. Kid Games Pro: Spurs greater creativity with the best Con: The game has stuck to a successful formula, but a formula nonetheless Price: $74.99 Description: \"Skylanders\" is a perennial favorite for young players, who can play with the characters both in-game and in the real world -- the game comes with real figurines that you can collect and play with offline as well. With \"Skylanders Imaginators,\" the game has taken another creative leap forward, giving players the option to design their own Skylanders in the game, choosing from several attributes in a number of combinations.  Core gameplay in \"Imaginators\" is very similar to past games, which means it will feel familiar (maybe even perhaps a little boring) to those who have played the series in the past. But there are some updates, including very powerful figures that can really tip a battle in your favor when used judiciously. Parents should know that there are some micro-transactions in this game, as well as the option to have custom characters 3D printed and sent to your doorstep. You can play together to avoid surprise charges \u2014 but also play together because it\u2019s fun. Kid Games Pro: Beautiful, interesting exploratory game. Con: Gets a little less challenging -- but no less fun -- toward the end. Price: $14.99 Description: \"Song of the Deep\" puts players in the place of a woman named Merryn, who\u2019s on an underwater quest to save her father. The sense of movement in this underwater game is excellent and gives players a distinct experience and environment for players of all ages. Cerebral and oddly soothing, this game offers a lot of bang for its buck with a lot of playtime and surprises to uncover.  It\u2019s true that the puzzles in \"Song of the Deep\" can get a little samey-samey after a while and that some of the challenges are not as difficult in the later game. But the overall game provides a strong challenge and a great ambience for younger players \u2014 and it\u2019s not bad for older players either. Kid Games Pro: A beautiful game that should appeal to speed demons of all ages. Con: Not a gearhead? This may not be for you. Price: $59.99 Description: Of all the games released this year, \"Forza Horizon 3\" may be one of the easiest on the eyes, with its large fleet of cars rendered in loving detail for virtual races across the varied terrains of Australia. Car enthusiasts (or even those who appreciate a pretty game) should be happy with the variety of wheels available, as well as the many, many options to customize your ride so that it fits exactly what you want.   In this iteration of the game, players are encouraged to travel from festival to festival in their gorgeous cars, and to do some hard driving along the way to earn money, unlock achievements and rock out to the game\u2019s impressive soundtrack. It\u2019s fantasy indulgence at its finest \u2014 you can crash with no consequences \u2014 and straightforward, fast and furious fun for players of all ages. Kid Games Pro: Visually stunning and immersive. Con: Suffers from the same weaknesses as previous installments. Price: 59.99 Description: From a visual standpoint, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed with \"Paper Mario: Color Splash,\" which, as one may intuit from the title, delivers a big and richly hued world while retaining its own unique paper cutout style. The art style and music add so much to this game\u2019s charm that it\u2019s easy to get swept up in its aesthetics.   The gameplay, however, can get a little boring \u2014 players have to collect in-game Battle Cards that let them attack enemies, and engaging in fight after fight can get tedious at times. This is a problem that has shown up in previous \"Paper Mario\" games as well; if action is what you\u2019re looking for, this may not be the game for you. That said, Wii U owners looking for a nice game to pick up this holiday may find it worth a play, particularly if they\u2019re fans of the series already. Kid Games Pro: A rhythmic and beautiful game that works in VR or out of it. Con: Its simplicity may be a little too simple for some players. Price: $19.99 Description: Mesmerizing may be the best word for \"Thumper,\" which is one of the games supported by the PlayStation VR headset this holiday season. (Support for other headsets, the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, are on the roadmap as well.) It\u2019s a little hard to explain \"Thumper,\" which is all about finding your rhythm, as you take on the perspective of a metal beetle racing down a long track toward menacing figures in the distance. As odd as that may sound, \"Thumper\" is addictive, particularly in VR, when you can be completely immersed by the music and entirely bent on the next twist or obstacle in your way. \"Thumper\" advertises itself as a \u201crhythm violence\u201d game, but there isn\u2019t exactly a lot of overt violence \u2014 though the trippy backgrounds may get a little scary for very young players who spook easily. On the flip side, older players who are looking for a complex challenge may find its gameplay too simple. \"Thumper\" is best for players in the middle, who want something engaging. Gifts under $100 BlueAnt Pump 2 HD Multi-Sport Bluetooth Headphones Pro: Durable, waterproof construction. Price: $99.95 Description: BlueAnt\u2019s Pump 2 HD headphones are made for working out. They are wireless with a decent range that won\u2019t fritz out on you in the rain. (In theory, you could take them swimming \u2014 though you\u2019d have to be pretty near your phone at all times.) These headphones should work with any device that also has Bluetooth, making them versatile in more ways than one.   The sound quality is clear, but probably better suited for accompanying a run than a deep appreciation of the music. Audiophiles should look elsewhere. But if you\u2019re looking for something waterproof, wireless, relatively cheap and sturdy, this is a good pair to consider. Gifts under $100 Pro: Stylish, practical and convenient. Con: Just for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Price: $99.95 Description: Few things panic an always-connected person more than a yellow or \u2014 horrors! \u2014 red battery indicator on their smartphones. But one easy way to keep yourself from feeling that pressure is to get a phone case that comes with an extra battery built in. Moshi\u2019s iGlaze Ion is an excellent, stylish and fairly lightweight case that can offer you extra juice and some peace of mind.   This battery pack should get you through the day and then some and is particularly comforting to have on the road, when you\u2019re not sure when you\u2019ll next be able to get to an outlet. The iGlaze Ion is currently only available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, however, so owners of other phones will have to look elsewhere. Gifts under $100 Pro: A good-looking, simple stylus. Con: A little pricey. Price: $49.95-$59.95 Description: It\u2019s becoming more of a digital world every year. But don\u2019t you sometimes just miss the feeling of a good pencil in your hand? Pencil by Fifty Three is a tried-and-true stylus for sketchers and writers who want to split the difference between the digital and analog worlds \u2014 and who like a little heft to their implement. The Pencil comes in a variety of shades and materials, giving you some personalization options without breaking the bank. Think of it as the modern equivalent of a pen and pencil set.   The quality can help you feel as though you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth, though honestly these can still feel a little pricey for what you get. That said, they\u2019re nice to give as gifts \u2014 a splurge for someone else that they may not treat themselves to. Just be sure to get a case with a loop, since Pencil by Fifty Three does not come with a clip. Gifts under $100 ",

(The Washington Post) Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor considered the \u201cking of bankruptcy\u201d for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliver profits, is expected to be President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, two officials with knowledge of the decision said. Ross helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s economic agenda, particularly its hard-line stance on the need to renegotiate \u2014 or even withdraw from \u2014 free trade agreements. That position resonated with the working class voters who were instrumental in delivering Trump\u2019s upset victory. Elevating Ross to a position in his Cabinet could suggest that Trump intends to nurture the nationalist streak that was one of the hallmarks of his campaign. In a video released this week, Trump said he is focused on\u00a0creating jobs and reiterated his pledge to withdraw from the sprawling Asian trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership that became a flash point during the election. 1 of 7 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

Chief of Staff\u00a0Reince Priebus President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump\u2019s campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party.

In Ross, Trump has tapped a like-minded businessman who understands the prospects for both profit and peril in restoring American manufacturing. Ross built his fortune buying the distressed companies that were once at the heart of American industry \u2014 steel mills, coal mines and textile factories, to name a few \u2014 and then selling them in short order, making billions of dollars along the way. [ Ross: How Trump would stimulate the U.S. economy ] Perhaps his signature investment was the purchase of some of the nation\u2019s largest steel mills in the early 2000s, including Cleveland-based LTV Corp. and Pennsylvania\u2019s Bethlehem Steel. The move was credited with saving manufacturing jobs, with the United Steelworkers calling Ross \u201ca new ally\u201d in news reports at the time. Since then, however, many steel mills have shut down amid a glut of foreign production, much of it in China. Ross sold his steel conglomerate to what is now ArcelorMittal in 2004 for about $4.5 billion. 1 of 47 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

His metallurgical coal company was headquartered in West Virginia, cobbled together from the remnants of bankrupt mining company Horizon Natural Resources and smaller coal companies. Shortly after the company went public in 2005, an explosion at its Sago Mine in West Virginia killed a dozen people. Ross sold the business to Arch Coal in 2011 for $3.4 billion. [ 2006: Sago mine explosion: After 44 Hours, Hope Showed Its Cruel Side ] And in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Ross purchased several failed banks, including BankUnited in Florida, as well as some European banks. More recently, Ross has invested in troubled oil and gas companies, taking advantage of the oversupply and weak demand that have tanked big-name businesses. He remains chairman and chief strategy officer of WL Ross & Co., which is now part of investment firm Invesco. Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on trade includes a promise to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, as well as threatening to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In addition, Trump has called for double-digit tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. Many economists have warned that adopting those policies could spark a trade war that could undermine the U.S. recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that we could engage in some interventionist trade policy through tariffs and other measures that might help some Americans, somewhere, for some period of time,\u201d said Michael Strain, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut certainly the country as a whole would suffer. \u2026 As your time horizon extends beyond a few years, it\u2019s just going to be harder and harder to find anyone better off by those kinds of policies.\u201d As head of Commerce, Ross would oversee many of the government\u2019s disputes with its trading partners, though it remains unclear how much authority over trade policy Trump might provide him. Ross could ramp up the number of cases brought against China, for example, or increase the penalties for dumping, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI think they are in broad alignment,\u201d Hufbauer said of Ross and Trump\u2019s views. But, he added, \u201cRoss is probably more single-mindedly protectionist than Trump.\u201d In an interview with Yahoo Finance just days after the election, Ross appeared to walk back at least some of Trump\u2019s remarks. He stressed that withdrawing from trade deals would only occur if other countries refused to negotiate. He also described some more mundane changes, such as relaxation of Chinese quotas on some American imports. \u201cEverybody says, oh he\u2019s going to slap 45 percent tariff on everything out of China,\u201d Ross told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat\u2019s not what he said, and it\u2019s not what he intends.\u201d Previously, Ross warned that the economy could enter another recession within the next 18 months, especially if Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were elected. He told Bloomberg TV last month that stock markets appeared near a top. \u201cWhat we\u2019re noticing is there is relatively little demand for any kind of physical product and almost nobody has any kind of pricing power,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you just can\u2019t cut costs anymore and therefore you ultimately need pricing power and physical volume growth, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really lacking in today\u2019s world.\u201d Ross is a trustee of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think bank, and a noted art enthusiast with a taste for Chinese and Vietnamese works who boasts a $100 million collection of works by surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. The Commerce Department is also responsible for compiling crucial data about the health of the economy, including the quarterly estimate of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, or GDP. It also houses\u00a0the U.S. patent office and the Minority Business Development Agency, among others, and the department\u00a0has often been led by corporate executives. Current Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker was a wealthy real estate investor whose family helped found the Hyatt hotel chain. Carlos Gutierrez, who served under President George W. Bush, was chairman and chief executive of Kellogg. No formal announcement about Ross\u2019s position has been made, and the team was still discussing how to make one Thursday morning. Trump met with Ross on Sunday at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J. Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Trump said he was considering Ross to lead the Commerce Department. Ross demurred when asked if he wanted the job. \u201cWell, time will tell,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, internal divisions within Trump\u2019s inner circle over whether he should tap Mitt Romney to be secretary of State are becoming more pronounced due to tensions over whether Romney\u2019s sharp critique of Trump\u2019s career and temperament during the GOP primary ought to disqualify the former Massachusetts governor from a cabinet position. Conservative Romney supporters Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich this week spoke out against the possibility of choosing Romney. \u201cI\u2019m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump,\u201d Huckabee said on Fox News Wednesday morning. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just go after him from the standpoint of \u2018I disagree with his policy on immigration, I disagree with his policy on taxes.\u2019 He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor.\u201d Gingrich said Romney didn\u2019t represent \u201cthe kind of tough-minded America-first policies that Trump has campaigned on\u201d later Wednesday on Fox. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, advanced those critiques Thanksgiving morning on Twitter, saying she had received a \u201cdeluge\u201d of social media and private communications from Trump loyalists warning against the Romney choice, possibly opening the door for former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani or another candidate to be named. She added that former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George P. Shultz \u201cflew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist.\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell contributed to this report. powerpost ",

And when Donald Trump gets sworn in as president on Jan. 20, that contingent will balloon to more than 920 Secret Service agents and support personnel in Washington and his hometown, New York. The price tag for all that security is already very big, or as the Manhattan mogul might put it, \"Yuge,\" internal Homeland Security and Secret Service documents reviewed by NBC News show. \"Secret Service protection is the most intrusive thing that anyone could ever experience\" Right now, the cost to taxpayers is more than $2 million a day, the documents show, a number that is sure to increase whenever the president or the first lady travels \u2014 or when the threat level rises. Meanwhile, the New York Police Department is already handling external security at Trump Tower, the president-elect's Manhattan home base, at an estimated cost of $1 million per day. \"You put a price tag on anything around the president, then you're putting a price tag on his life, and that is priceless,\" Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent who has protected every living president, including Barack Obama, told NBC News in an exclusive interview. Protecting Trump's family presents unprecedented challenges. First off, it's a big family \u2014 18 members in all, including Melania Trump and her 10-year-old son, Barron, as well as four adult children, three of them married, with a combined eight grandchildren. The Secret Service has not had to protect the adult children of a president-elect in a long time, Wackrow said. Play ",

In the most recent incident, officers were called to the intersection of Lamon and Wrightwood avenues on the Northwest Side where a 20-year-old man was shot in the shoulder and a 17-year-old boy was shot in the head about 8:40 p.m., police said. The man and the teen\u00a0were inside a car when two unidentified males approached and opened fire, police said. The victims then drove to the 3000 block of North Knox Avenue in the Kelvin Park neighborhood, where they sought medical help.\u00a0 They were taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where they were listed in serious to critical condition, said Chicago Fire Cmdr.

    "text": "Navy Says Personal Data of Over 134,000 Sailors Was Hacked By Paul Blake Nov 24, 2016, 12:07 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Russian Suspected in LinkedIn Breach Arrested 0 Shares Email Personal data belonging to 134,386 current and former sailors in the U.S. Navy has been compromised, the Navy said on Wednesday. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear when the hack took place, but the Navy is pointing the finger at a compromised laptop belonging to a contractor as the source of the data breach . In a statement, the Navy said it was notified by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services that a laptop belonging to one of its employees was compromised. That employee, the Navy said, was working in support of a Navy contract. \"The Navy takes this incident extremely seriously -- this is a matter of trust for our Sailors,\" said Chief of Naval Personnel Vice Adm. Robert Burke. \"We are in the early stages of investigating and are working quickly to identify and take care of those affected by this breach.\" A Navy official told ABC News that the breach was believed to only include social security numbers and names. The official said that the contract with HPES was for a program known as Career Waypoints that the Navy uses for sailors to reenlist or apply for new Navy jobs. According to the Navy Times , an initial investigation has not uncovered evidence that the data has been used in a malicious manner. Affected sailors will be notified of the breach by email, letter and phone, the Navy said. In an emailed statement, Thomas Wat Brandt, a spokesman for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, told ABC News: \"The security and privacy of our clients is a top priority for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). This event has been reported to the Navy and because this is an ongoing investigation, HPE will not be commenting further out of respect for the privacy of our Navy personnel.\" The scope of the data breach pales in comparison to the massive cyberattack on the federal government's Office of Personal Management that took place in 2015. That attack -- which Chinese hackers are believed to have been behind -- saw personal data associated with more than 22 million people inside and outside of government stolen. ABC News' Lucien Bruggeman contributed to this report from Washington. 0 Shares ",

It's that bedrock belief in decency that can only come from an inherent optimism about the road ahead.\u201d The president also posted a Thanksgiving message on Facebook , writing that while the White House has \u201cserved as the backdrop to the tough decisions and trying times that often characterize the Presidency,\u201d it\u2019s also been home, \u201cwhere Michelle and I have watched our daughters grow into the funny, smart, humble, and extraordinary young women they are today.\u201d What Happens to the Turkeys Pardoned by President Obama Earlier today, the president called Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard service members who are deployed overseas.

    "text": "Otto Weakens to Tropical Storm as It Moves Across Nicaragua By luis manuel galeano, associated press MANAGUA, Nicaragua \u0097 Nov 24, 2016, 10:35 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Civil Defense workers look the area where a couple was killed after their home was destroyed by a mudslide in Arraijan on the outskirts of Panama City, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. Civil defense officials in Panama say the country has already seen three deaths blamed on late-season Tropical Storm Otto. (AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco) 0 Shares Email Hurricane Otto weakened rapidly as it moved across southern Nicaragua on Thursday after making landfall on that country's Caribbean coast as a dangerous Category 2 storm. It was the southernmost hurricane on record to hit Central America. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Otto had faded to a tropical storm by Thursday night and was expected to emerge off of Central America's Pacific coast early Friday. Authorities in Nicaragua said Otto had damaged houses and toppled trees, but so far there were no reports of casualties. Earlier, heavy rains from the storm were blamed for three deaths in Panama. Otto battered Nicaragua's Corn Islands with 3.5-meter waves and damaged houses but residents were all safe in refuges, said the archipelago's mayor, Cleveland Rolando Webster. \"There is a lot of rain, the sea is rough and the wind is strong. We have been in danger all night, getting cold and wet,\" said Alicia Lampson, 21, as she arrived at a shelter with a group of people from the village of Monkey Point, south of Bluefields, Nicaragua. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the unusually strong late-season hurricane hit land just north of the Costa Rican border with winds of 110 mph (175 kph). Otto's winds later weakened to 70 mph (110 kph) as it moved inland near the border with Costa Rica . By Thursday night, it was located about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Liberia , Costa Rica. The Nicaraguan government declared a state of emergency, and said evacuations would continue because of the continued risk of flooding. In Bluefields \u2014 the nearest major town on the Nicaraguan coast \u2014 residents rode out the hurricane. \"In our house, we have packed up some things in plastic bags and we went out to buy some provisions, just in case,\" said resident Jean Hodgson. Further south \u2014 and closer to where Otto hit \u2014 residents in the smaller town of Punta Gorda said they were planning to ride out the hurricane. \"There is fear, because these kinds of things are scary, but we are praying and doing what the authorities have told us to do,\" said Punta Gorda resident Sara Pantin. Nicaragua closed schools and was evacuating more than 10,000 people from communities in the storm's path. Heavy rains were expected to affect the entire country, raising the possibility of flooding and landslides. Officials in Costa Rica ordered the evacuation of 4,000 people from its Caribbean coast and called off school nationwide for the rest of the week. Heavy rain was already causing flooding in some areas and the president announced that public employees would not have to work Thursday or Friday. By Thursday afternoon, Costa Rica's Emergencies Commission said that 231 communities in the country's center-north had been affected, of which 23 were isolated because of damages to roads and highways. Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis said Otto could damage the country's important coffee and agriculture sectors. Nicaragua also feared damage for impoverished farmers and to coffee crops that are almost ready for harvest. 0 Shares ",

Louisville Metro Police spokesman Dwight Mitchell told WDRB-TV that officers arriving at the park found two black males with gunshot wounds. Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene, according to Mitchell. Mitchell said four other victims were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police have not yet made any arrests and are searching for possible suspects. The shooting took place during the annual \"Juice Bowl\" youth football game at Shawnee Park, which had to be canceled. Coaches told WDRB-TV they scrambled to get players to a safe place as police evacuated the park. \"There are people who won't make it home to the Thanksgiving table,\" one coach told the television station. Children had finished playing football and two women's teams were in the middle of a flag football game when several shots were fired, The Courier-Journal reported. Charlotte Waddell, a cousin of Muhammad Ali, told the newspaper she had just finished talking to the Mayor Greg Fischer when she heard several gunshots. \"This is the worst Thanksgiving ever, I'll never be back,\" Waddell, who has attended the event for years, told The Courier-Journal. \"I'm pretty shaken up.\" ",

Reuters/Mike Segar Email Last Updated Nov 24, 2016 1:43 PM EST PALM BEACH, Fla.\u00a0-- The scramble to shape his administration underway , President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s team has simultaneously begun turning its attention to raising tens of millions of dollars for festivities related to his Washington inauguration. Mr. Trump, who vowed during the campaign to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests corrupting Washington, has set $1 million donation limits for corporations and no limits for individual donors, according to an official on the Presidential Inaugural Committee with direct knowledge of tentative fundraising plans. At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee will not accept money from registered lobbyists, in line with his ban on hiring lobbyists for his nascent administration. Barack Obama set stricter limits on donations for his first inauguration, in 2009, holding individual donors to $50,000 each and taking no money from corporations or labor unions, as well as none from lobbyists and some other groups. Plenty of corporate executives, though, gave individually and often at the maximum amount. And he opened the spigots for his 2013 inauguration, setting no limits on corporate or individual donations. President-elect Donald Trump is spending Thanksgiving with family at his Palm Beach, Florida resort. He announced Wednesday that charter school a... The new details, confirmed Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to disclose private deliberations, came as Mr. Trump gathered with family at his Palm Beach estate on Thanksgiving. It was a working holiday of sorts for Mr. Trump, who suggested on Twitter that he was engaged in trying to prevent an Indiana air conditioning company from moving jobs to Mexico. \u201cI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cMAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\u201d The company, which has announced plans to move 1,400 jobs to Mexico from Indiana in the coming years, said  Thursday it \u201chas had discussions with the incoming administration\u201d but that there was \u201cnothing to announce at this time.\u201d Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time. \u2014 Carrier (@Carrier) November 24, 2016 On the eve of the national holiday, the president-elect offered a prayer for unity after \u201ca long and bruising\u201d campaign season. \u201cEmotions are raw and tensions just don\u2019t heal overnight,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a video message on social media. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country strengthened by shared purpose and very, very common resolve.\u201d Unity has emerged as a common theme during Mr. Trump\u2019s limited public appearances in the days since his stunning general election victory, which followed a campaign season in which he rained extraordinary personal attacks on his opponents in both parties, the media and his many Republican critics. Mr. Obama also emphasized this in his own Thanksgiving message .\u00a0 Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we are still one people, part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d the president said in a video published Thursday. \u201cWe are communities that move forward together. We are neighbors who look out for one another, especially those among us with the least. We are always, simply, Americans.\u201d Unity would also be a theme for the incoming president\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration, the official said. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the U.N. ambassador for his administration. Who else will be part of T... While Mr. Trump\u2019s fundraising plans have not been completed, he is expected to raise significantly more than the $43 million Obama raised for his 2013 inauguration. Taxpayers cover the cost of official activities such as the swearing-in, but outside donations pay for the many related balls and parties. Mr. Trump has focused most of his attention in the two weeks since his victory on building a White House team from scratch. He injected the first signs of diversity into his Cabinet-to-be on Wednesday, tapping South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. They are the first women selected for top-level administration posts. And Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, would be his first minority selection after a string of announcements of white men. The South Carolina governor has little foreign policy experience, yet Trump praised her as \u201ca proven dealmaker.\u201d DeVos, like Mr. Trump, is new to government but has spent decades working to change America\u2019s system of public education. The president-elect called DeVos a \u201cbrilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d saying in a statement that \u201cunder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families.\u201d Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on Wednesday said \u201can announcement is forthcoming\u201d on his position, which would make him the first black choice - possibly as secretary of housing and urban development. But he also suggested he\u2019d be thinking about it over the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cI feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\u201d Carson wrote on his Facebook page. Mr. Trump praised his former primary opponent as a \u201cgreatly talented person,\u201d after months of launching vitriolic campaigns against the neurosurgeon. \u00a0 I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 Mr. Trump is also expected to select billionaire investor Wilbur Ross Jr. to lead the Commerce Department, a senior Trump adviser said on condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorized to disclose internal deliberations. The 78-year-old Ross, who is white, is chairman and chief strategy officer of private-equity firm W.L. Ross & Co., which has specialized in buying failing companies. The picks come as Mr. Trump works to dissociate himself from the alt-right, a movement of white supremacists who continue to cheer his election. His first appointments included chief counselor Steve Bannon , who previously led Breitbart News, a website popular among the alt-right. Mr. Trump on Thursday was with his family behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. He\u2019s spending the Thanksgiving holiday there after a week of interviewing potential appointees in New York, punctuated by announcements of members of his national security team. The president-elect is not expected to meet with anyone over the Thanksgiving holiday, but according to pool reports, Mr. Trump is still making phone calls throughout the day.\u00a0 He will be sworn into office in fewer than 60 days. Beyond his Cabinet, he must fill hundreds of high-level administration posts. Mr. Trump is expected to stay in Florida through the weekend. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Fenwick\u00a0football players leave the field after practice on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016 in Melrose Park. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Bob Narang Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Brian Badke had a lunchtime conversation that was duplicated across Chicagoland and beyond. The subject was last Saturday's controversial Class 7A semifinal between Fenwick and Plainfield North, won by North in overtime after it was incorrectly given an untimed down at the end of the fourth quarter. Badke, the head football coach at Brother Rice, heard plenty of interesting opinions during his discussion. \"I had a long talk with an NFL ref and a college ref who also does high school games and is a major Division I ref,\" Badke said. \"I think the refereeing is a huge concern to all of us. It seems to be getting worse and worse, and for Fenwick to end their careers that way, knowing that was a wrong call and they can't play again, it's tough.\" The Tigers defeated the Friars 18-17 in overtime \u2014 a result that was upheld in court Wednesday morning \u2014 to advance to Saturday's state title game against East St. Louis. The game's unusual and controversial ending received interested from across the country, including stories on Deadspin and ESPN's website. New Trier coach Brian Doll acknowledged he has never witnessed a similar scenario, but he does have a backup plan that soon could be emulated by coaches across the country. \"I carry the last two to three years of rule books in a bag on the sidelines, so if there was anything that would happen during a game then I could reference it,\" Doll said. \"I have never used it, but maybe in a situation like this one, that could've been pulled up where somebody said, 'Do you guys want to reference a rule book?'\" (Steve Schmadeke) Barrington senior defensive end Jackson Perkins, a Navy recruit, cited another controversial play during the playoffs that impacted a game. Barrington wide receiver Alec Andrea caught an apparent touchdown at the end of the first half during Maine South's 42-27 win in a Class 8A second-round playoff game. Andrea had the ball pulled out when he came to the ground. Officials ruled the play an interception. \"That was a big play in our game and very similar to (Fenwick's game),\" Perkins said. \"I don't like to blame anything on the refs because you have to plan for calls not going your way. You can't control that. That's just the game, and it's high school officiating. You are not going to get instant replay. It's human error. I respect that.\" Prairie Ridge's Chris Schremp was another coach who had a lunchtime conversation about the game. He called the situation \"a tragedy\" for both Fenwick and Plainfield North, and said his impromptu committee offered an interesting solution. \"The best thing we could come up with is for Fenwick and Plainfield North to play a rematch in Champaign this weekend,\" Schremp said. \"And then the winner plays a road game at East St. Louis the following week. That might be fairest for everybody.\" Schremp, whose Wolves play Springfield Sacred Heart-Griffin in Saturday's Class 6A final, suggested the IHSA should have a rules representative at each game starting at a certain point in the postseason. Badke echoed Schremp's thoughts on putting an IHSA official in the press box or on the field, and cited the increased pressure on players and coaches due to many games being televised. Badke, a former basketball referee, said six Brother Rice games were televised this season. The Crusaders' game against Mount Carmel drew 23,000 viewers on Brother Rice TV, according to Badke. \"Refs had better make the right decision because everybody will see it,\" he said. \"For them to take that game away from Fenwick is a travesty. Hopefully, this will lead to awareness to the refs and the impact they have on kids. This is a profession that we understand that you will always get criticized, as we are as coaches, but let the kids on the field decide the game.\" Bob Narang is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.

    "text": "Email Federal officials are investigating the shooting death of a black 15-year-old in West Virginia as a hate crime. Sixty-two-year-old William Pulliam has reportedly confessed, saying he felt threatened when confronted by the teen outside a Charleston convenience store Monday night. The complaint signed by Charleston police reportedly said Pulliam wasn\u2019t just unremorseful; he also referred to the victim as \u201ctrash.\u201d And now the teen\u2019s family said they\u2019re putting their faith in the law to see justice done, reports CBS News correspondent Don Dahler. The police complaint reportedly stated 15-year-old James Means was part of a group that engaged in a verbal confrontation with Pullium outside a Charleston convenience store. It escalated into violence, with Pulliam allegedly opening fire. The teen was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead with two gunshot wounds. Pulliam gave a jailhouse interview after his arrest, repeating what he says he heard from the group. \u201c\u2018What the f*** you say?\u2019\u201d I said, \u2018Man, I didn\u2019t say anything.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, but, I mean, I\u2019m 62 years old. I\u2019m not going to take a bunch of punks beating me up,\u201d Pulliam said. The police complaint reportedly said Pulliam confessed, stating, \u201cThe way I look at it, that\u2019s another piece of trash off the street.\u201d Authorities are now looking into whether the shooting falls under the federal hate crime statute -- killing someone because of their race. \u201cI just shot him. I mean, I felt my life was in danger,\u201d Pulliam said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re white or black. Nobody\u2019s going to treat me like that. It doesn\u2019t make any difference he\u2019s black.\u201d Means\u2019 family said this is not a time for revenge, but for justice. \u201cWe don\u2019t hold a grudge, so nobody else should hold a grudge,\u201d said his aunt, Teresa Means. \u201cWe all have to forgive and let everything take its place.\u201d The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports that Pulliam was not allowed to have a gun because of a previous domestic violence conviction. A Thanksgiving peace walk for the teenager is set to take place in Charleston later Thursday morning. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Israeli police have arrested four Palestinians in connection with one of several large fires that damaged homes and prompted the evacuation of thousands of people in the past few days. Police are investigating the causes, including possible arson. Windy and hot weather have helped fan the flames. The blazes started three days ago near Jerusalem and in the north. Hundreds of homes were damaged. Russia, Italy and other countries are assisting the Israeli firefighters. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit) 0 Shares Email A wildfire roared through parts of Israel's third-largest city on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes as the country's leaders raised the possibility that Arab assailants had intentionally set the blaze. Spreading quickly due to dry, windy weather, the fire raced through Haifa's northern neighborhoods, sending panicked residents fleeing from the area. The Associated Press People run as wildfires rages in Haifa, Israel, Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016. The Associated Press A home damaged from fire is seen in Zikhron Ya'akov, Israel, Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016. While there were no serious injuries, several dozen people were hospitalized for smoke inhalation. In a rare move, Israel called up hundreds of military reservists to join overstretched police and firefighters and was making use of an international fleet of firefighting aircraft sent by a slew of countries. The Haifa blaze was the most serious in a series of fires that have erupted across the country in recent days. On a visit to the area, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said anyone implicated in setting the fires would be punished severely. \"It's a crime for all intents and purposes and in our opinion it is terror for all intents and purposes,\" he said. He said incitement to arson was also playing a role in spreading the fires. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the identity or motives of the suspected arsonists, but Israeli officials typically use the term \"terror\" to refer to Arab or Palestinian militant activity. Israel has been on edge during more than a year of Palestinian attacks, mostly stabbings, that have tapered off, but not halted, in recent months. Netanyahu has blamed Palestinian incitement for fueling those attacks. Netanyahu's accusations could test already brittle relations between Israel's Jewish majority and its Arab minority, which has long suffered discrimination in Israel and says it has been slighted by rhetoric from Netanyahu and other Israeli officials in the past. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told Channel 10 TV news that eight people had been arrested and that authorities had found \"flammable materials and liquids poured in certain areas,\" a find that pointed to arson. He said arson was suspected in about half of the fires. Israeli media said the Shin Bet internal security agency was helping search for perpetrators, while Erdan said \"we need to be prepared for a new type of terror.\" \"It's safe to assume that whoever is setting the fires isn't doing it only out of pyromania,\" Israel's police chief Roni Alsheich told reporters. \"It's safe to assume that if it is arson it is politically motivated.\" The Associated Press A boy stands next to a burnt car following a wildfire in Zikhron Ya'akov, Israel, Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016. The Associated Press A fire burns in Haifa, Israel, Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016. Ayman Odeh, the head of a joint Arab bloc of parties in Israel's parliament and a Haifa native, appealed to Israelis to come together and abandon \"politics\" during the trying time. \"This is something that harms all of us. This is not a story of Arab or Jew. Whoever did this is an enemy of all of us,\" he told Israeli Channel 2 TV news. The Palestinians meanwhile offered to send firefighting teams to help combat the flames, according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. Yousef Nassar, the director general of the Palestinian Civil Defense, said the offer of assistance was \"a humanitarian message.\" The Palestinians assisted Israel during a deadly wildfire in 2010. Israel's response to the offer was not immediately known. The rash of fires is the worst since 2010, when Israel suffered the single deadliest wildfire in its history. That blaze burned out of control for four days, killed 42 people and was extinguished only after firefighting aircraft arrived from as far away as the United States. Israel has strengthened its firefighting capabilities since then, buying special planes that can drop large quantities of water on affected areas. Several countries, including Russia, France, Cyprus , Turkey, Croatia , Greece and Italy were also sending assistance to battle this week's blazes. The Associated Press A man watches wildfires in Haifa, Israel, Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016. The Associated Press People walk a away from wildfires in Haifa, Israel, Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016. Residents of eight neighborhoods in the northern city of Haifa were told to evacuate their homes on Thursday afternoon, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Or Doron, a spokeswoman for the city of Haifa, said some 50,000 people had been evacuated. Police and firefighters were deployed throughout the city, as people loaded up supermarket carts with belongings and fled their homes. Some people connected hoses together from apartment buildings to help battle the fires, while residents held cloth over their faces. Guy Catlan, who runs a gas station in Haifa, told Channel 10 TV that workers turned the power off and were helping firefighters to prevent the flames from reaching it. \"There is a very large quantity of fuel here,\" he said. \"It is very dangerous to the entire area, it could be a big catastrophe.\" Michal Schanin, a professor at the University of Haifa, was in the middle of a lecture when she received word that she and her 70 students would need to evacuate. She said that while the evacuation was orderly, the flood of cars fleeing the area caused a traffic jam. \"We couldn't move. If, God forbid, there would have been fire there it would have been one huge trap,\" she said. The military said it deployed two search and rescue battalions in order to assist civilian efforts. It also called up about 500 reserve soldiers to back up the police and fire departments. Police said the blazes started early Tuesday morning at Neve Shalom, a community outside Jerusalem where Jews and Arabs live together. Fires later erupted elsewhere near Jerusalem and in the northern Israeli area of Zichron Yaakov. 0 Shares ",

Dozens of Shiite pilgrims were targeted for attack Thursday after the holiday, which marks the end of the 40-day mourning period after the anniversary of the 7th century martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson. Karim Kadim/AP A truck bomb detonated Thursday in the Iraqi city of Hilla and killed at least 57 civilians, including many Iranians, according to NPR's Alison Meuse. She said the attack targeted Shiite Muslims returning from an annual religious pilgrimage. Alison told NPR's Newscast unit: The truck bomb exploded next to a rest stop frequented by Iranian travelers. An official with Iraq's interior ministry says the explosives were concealed by the truck's cargo of vegetables. It was detonated as a group of Shiite pilgrims left a nearby restaurant. In addition to the dead, dozens of civilians were wounded and cars parked nearby were incinerated. The attack, which happened about 70 miles south of Baghdad, targeted Shiite Muslims returning from Karbala for the religious pilgrimage of Arbaeen. Alison said the Sunni extremist group ISIS, sometimes also known as ISIL, considers Shiites heretics and typically claims such attacks. In a statement Thursday, National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the violence \"was clearly intended to stoke sectarian tensions. The United States remains steadfast in its partnership with the Iraqi people and government, and this attack only serves to strengthen our resolve in defeating ISIL.\" NPR thanks our sponsors ",

(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and activist Ja'Mal Green speak to the media\u00a0Nov. 24, 2016, about the fatal shooting by police of a\u00a019-year-old man. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Elvia Malagon and Rosemary Regina Sobol Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A 19-year-old man was fatally wounded late Wednesday after a police sergeant said the man pointed a gun in his direction, but a grid search Thursday morning failed to uncover a weapon,\u00a0officials said.\u00a0 \"We were not able to locate a weapon as of yet,'' said Chicago police Superintendent\u00a0Eddie Johnson, who briefly made remarks about the shooting at a 1 p.m. news conference at headquarters. \u201cWe have some missing information in our timeline,\u2019\u2019 Johnson said. \"There are still many unanswered questions.\u2019\u2019 Police, including an Englewood District police sergeant responded at 11:07 p.m. to a battery in progress in the 1400 block of West 65th Street, said Johnson. The sergeant spotted a man that \"matched the description of the offender,\" in the battery, Johnson said. The sergeant identified himself as an officer and approached the man but he began running away. The sergeant gave chase. At some point during the pursuit the man \"turned and pointed\" a weapon at the sergeant two separate times, causing the sergeant to shoot him, Johnson said. The man, identified by his family as Kajuan Raye, was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where he was later pronounced\u00a0dead. \u201cUnfortunately, we still don\u2019t have a complete synopsis of exactly how and what transpired,\u2019\u2019 Johnson told reporters. \"There is still a lot of investigating going on.\" Fatal Police Involved Shooting Ahkeya White describes the events after her cousin was fatally shot Nov. 23, 2016, by a member of the Chicago Police Department in the 6500 block of Marshfield Avenue in Chicago's West Englewood neighborhood. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune) Ahkeya White describes the events after her cousin was fatally shot Nov. 23, 2016, by a member of the Chicago Police Department in the 6500 block of Marshfield Avenue in Chicago's West Englewood neighborhood. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune) A grid search for ballistics evidence of the area was completed overnight but no gun was found, Johnson said. There weren't any officers injured during the incident.\u00a0 Early Thursday, police blocked off the intersection of 65th Street and Marshfield Avenue along with surrounding alleys. Officers searched vacant lots using rakes and flashlights. An officer with a K-9 could be seen searching a parking lot near the intersection. The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting. IPRA spokeswoman Mia Sissac said the Englewood District does not have body cameras, so investigators are looking for witnesses that may have seen the incident or may have captured it on video. \u201cWe would hope that people would allow for some time. As we continue to go through the process we will learn more about the case,\u201d Sissac said. The sergeant will be placed on administrative duties for 30 days pending the outcome of the investigation.\u00a0 Community activists also spoke to reporters outside police headquarters, and decried what they said was a lack of transparency in the Police Department.\u00a0 \"I'm sickened,\" said Ja\u2019Mal Green. \"It does not take a day to find a gun. They (cops) messed up. \"Right now the city has to pay for what it has done,\" Green said. Ald. Raymond Lopez, who represents the 15th Ward, where the shooting occurred, was also at police headquarters.\u00a0 \"It's just sad,\" Lopez said. According to Cook County court records, Raye had pleaded guilty to a theft charge in September 2015, and he was given one year of court supervision. In 2016, records show Raye violated supervision and an arrest warrant was issued in his name July 25. Standing outside of a family home in the Brainerd neighborhood Thursday morning, Ahkeya White said the family was told that her cousin, Raye, had been standing with a friend at a bus stop near the intersection of 64th Street and Ashland Avenue just before the shooting happened.\u00a0 The bus stop is less than half a mile away from where police said the sergeant had responded for the battery call.\u00a0 After spending time at a home of a friend's mother, White said her cousin was waiting for a bus to return to Dolton when the officer approached him.\u00a0 \"They are saying that it was, you know, a battery, but if that's the case, the police officer showed up, it was only one person in the car,\" she said. \"If they are responding to a call, why is it only one person in the car? Then you pull up to the bus stop. So something is off and we need answers.\" She said the officer got out of his car and told his cousin and friend to go to the police car. That's when her cousin and friend ran from the officer, prompting the sergeant to run after her cousin.\u00a0 Raye was shot once in the abdomen, White said.\u00a0 She disputes that her cousin was armed during the incident, saying she is sure Raye didn't have a gun. \u00a0 \"There was no gun,\" she said. \u00a0 Man fatally wounded by police in West Englewood Provided by Kajuan Raye's family Family members identified Kajuan Raye, 19, of Dolton, as the man who was fatally shot by police.\u00a0 Family members identified Kajuan Raye, 19, of Dolton, as the man who was fatally shot by police.\u00a0 (Provided by Kajuan Raye's family) As news began spreading about the shooting and relatives gathered at the hospital, White said she wondered why the shooting happened. \"Why, because I know he didn't do anything to deserve it,\" she said. \"We want answers, but there's really no explanation for what happened other than this is what's been going on, and it seems, you know, that this is the norm. But it's unacceptable, it's unacceptable.\" \u00a0 She described her cousin as a typical 19-year-old who was figuring out what he wanted to do. The family had been urging him to return to school to get his GED.\u00a0 \"Tears are flowing and we are praying,\" she said. \"We'll miss him greatly.\" Wednesday's shooting happened about a mile from where officers last Friday fatally shot a man after seeing him shoot and wound another man, according to officials.\u00a0 Chicago Tribune reporter Grace Wong contributed.

By Robin Givhan November 23 at 8:00 AM Follow @RobinGivhan (Illustration by David Downton) At the Hay-Adams this fall, members of Washington\u2019s diplomatic community gathered inside the historic hotel\u2019s glass-walled loft, with its postcard views of the White House, for a conversation about fashion. About clothes and their place on the world stage. The program, hosted by the State Department and Elle magazine, included a panel discussion, in which I was invited to participate, that featured designer Derek Lam. When the conversation came around to first lady Michelle Obama \u2014 because how could it not? \u2014 Lam dropped his head in a mournful manner and lamented: Her departure from the East Wing signaled the end of a singular era for American fashion. During her tenure, Obama brought widespread attention to Seventh Avenue. She energized designers, editors and stylists with her fashion-forward wardrobe choices. She made industry insiders stand taller both at home and abroad. She\u2019s been an exemplar of modern, fit and confident middle age. She instilled pride and kinship among countless black women. And she has been the most high-profile cheerleader for the sleeveless sheath as the 21st-century power uniform. \u201cIt\u2019s been accepted everywhere,\u201d says designer Maria Pinto, who created many of Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign dresses, including the purple sheath she wore when she fist-bumped the presumptive Democratic nominee. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in a suit. There\u2019s other ways to get that power look.\u201d Lam is among the many Seventh Avenue designers whose clothes have been part of the first lady\u2019s public wardrobe and whose life story has been fundamental to her version of fashion diplomacy. Obama wore Lam\u2019s block-printed dress for her arrival in Beijing in March 2014. The black dress, with a geometric pattern in ivory and taupe, was contemporary in its design, sophisticated and sleek. But there was more: Lam, who grew up in San Francisco, is of Chinese descent. In wearing his design, Obama quietly noted that in addition to trade agreements and intellectual property concerns, there is a very real, human connection between the United States and China. For the Obamas\u2019 first state dinner, in honor of India, she wore a white strapless gown by the Indian American designer Naeem Khan. In 2011, she donned an array of British brands \u2014 Preen, Roksanda \u2014 for a visit to London. But for the grand occasion of a state dinner at Buckingham Palace, Obama wore a regal white gown and long white gloves by an American designer, Tom Ford \u2014 but one with deep business roots in London, where he also maintains a home. She wore a flowing violet gown by Japan-born designer Tadashi Shoji, whose business is based in Los Angeles, to a state dinner in honor of Japan, a dress by Korean American designer Doo-Ri Chung for the South Korea state dinner and a student-designed frock to a White House education workshop on careers in the fashion industry. Her fashion choices served as a grace note to the moment. Her clothes were unexpected: a cardigan to meet Queen Elizabeth II. They spoke of Hollywood glamour: a Vera Wang mermaid gown at the China state dinner. They evoked Everywoman: hiking shorts at the Grand Canyon. The pictures are captivating. But are they the totality of her fashion legacy? When Obama leaves the White House in January, what precisely will she leave behind besides multiple covers of Vogue and an impressive array of evening gowns destined for a presidential library? 1 of 21 Michelle Obama\u2019s state dinner style View Photos When it comes to foreign diplomacy, the first lady dresses for the spotlight. Caption When it comes to foreign diplomacy, the first lady dresses for the spotlight. \u00a0Oct. 18, 2016 Michelle and Barack Obama pose for pictures with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and his wife, Agnese Landini, during a state dinner at the White House. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Obama was good for fashion. Mostly because she got people talking about it. But look closely and see that the bright light she shone on fashion also revealed the challenges of a business that traffics in glamour and fantasy. Her midmarket wardrobe choices sparked sales. But her attentions could not save those same brands from the financial pressures of a recession or overexpansion. She underscored how most fashion companies are entrepreneurial endeavors, not big publicly traded corporations; they are the very definition of small businesses. She thrust once little-known brands \u2014 Jason Wu, Brandon Maxwell, Azede Jean-Pierre, Narciso Rodriguez, Maria Cornejo, Pinto \u2014 into the spotlight, giving them priceless publicity and a leg up in expanding their business. But press notices cannot form the foundation of a company. She helped young people see that fashion is more than catwalk extravaganzas and \u201cProject Runway.\u201d In October 2014, she brought fashion designers to the White House as part of her education initiative Reach Higher . And she connected fashion to the broader popular culture. \u201cFashion is really about passion and creativity, just like music or dance or poetry,\u201d Obama said during her welcome to students. \u201cFor so many people across the country, it is a calling; it is a career. It\u2019s the way they feed their families.\u201d A good portion of the population has always been stubbornly committed to the idea that clothes don\u2019t matter and to give them more than a moment\u2019s consideration is evidence of superficiality, snobbishness or weak character. But dressing with consideration and care is part of the social contract. It is part of what makes a civil society. Clothes are part of the ritual of weddings, funerals, coming-of-age celebrations, faith-based rites of passage. Our choice of attire is a measure of our respect for those around us and our own personal dignity. And in the largely symbolic role of first lady, Obama turned fashion into an especially eloquent form of communication. She made people anticipate fashion, notice it, parse it and wonder about the folks who made it. The conversation mainly focused on aesthetics and authorship. Fashion in the Obama administration was not a source of scandal or ethics investigations, as it was during the Reagan era when the first lady was taken to task for borrowing and not returning designer fare. Obama was buying her clothes, not the taxpayers. Her first inaugural gown, the white one with its single strap and romantic embroidery, is displayed at the National Museum of American History. Other gowns were stored at the National Archives until they were recently shipped to Chicago along with boxes of other Obama administration artifacts. In countless state appearances, Michelle Obama highlighted the absolute best that Seventh Avenue had to offer, in the same way that one might expect the White House to offer the non plus ultra of American culinary skill at a state dinner, or present the most accomplished musicians at a concert. Every now and then \u2014 mostly when asked \u2014 she spoke about her personal appreciation and affection for the American fashion industry. She joked about her devotion to Spanx, for example, or noted her love of glamour. Just recently, in Harper\u2019s Bazaar, she expressed thanks to her longtime stylist, Meredith Koop. Still, as first lady she has not been especially forthcoming in discussing fashion. Her office declined a request for an interview on the subject. Fashion is, perhaps, no longer a \u201cthird rail\u201d topic for any woman who wants to be taken seriously, but it still isn\u2019t broached with the same enthusiastic patriotism as, say, baseball or a March Madness bracket. Even for a style-conscious first lady, her relationship to fashion is complicated. Michelle Obama backstage following her speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. (Ken Cedeno/Corbis via Getty Images) Obama did not rely on a single designer as a de facto personal dressmaker, as had been the case with her most recent predecessors. Nancy Reagan favored the late James Galanos ; Barbara Bush was a fan of Arnold Scaasi, and both Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton came to rely on Oscar de la Renta . Obama had no such loyalties. [ The quiet defiance behind Nancy Reagan\u2019s high-glamour fashion ] When she first stepped onto the national stage, Obama, a Chicago native, relied heavily on the simple, sleeveless sheaths of hometown designer Maria Pinto. And once in the White House, certain designers became staples in her wardrobe \u2014 Khan, Rodriguez, Wu, Michael Kors, Tracy Reese. But she pulled from a wide range of collections \u2014 some of them quite esoteric, such as Thom Browne. Her fashion vocabulary was deep and rich. The result was a wardrobe that spoke eloquently about an entire industry. No one brand defined her style. In that way, it was both uniquely her own and broadly American. The country\u2019s interest in Obama\u2019s clothes began during the 2008 presidential campaign. The fascination increased once she became first lady, in part because she didn\u2019t dress like the stereotypical Washington matron in boxy suits, nude pantyhose and sensible pumps. Her favorite accessory was a wide, embellished Azzedine Alaia belt that emphasized her hourglass figure. She did not wear pantyhose. She wore over-the-knee suede boots. She stood out, not because she was setting trends or even leading the charge in embracing those offered up by the fashion industry. She simply looked engaged with fashion. Her clothes were part of the fashion conversation. She looked modern. The mainstream media, bloggers and Twitter celebrated her clothes, and as with any celebrity christened a style icon, Obama had the ability to spark a shopping frenzy. Women copied Mamie Eisenhower\u2019s bangs and Jackie Kennedy\u2019s bouffant, but companies such as J. Crew, the Gap and White House Black Market benefited from the culture\u2019s Obama obsession. One researcher tracked Obama\u2019s ability to create consumer demand and estimated the \u201cObama Effect\u201d was worth $38\u00a0million to a company. Still, while Obama could ignite a run on J. Crew cardigans and pencil skirts, one can\u2019t ignore this reality: J. Crew has also been suffering financially. In the afterglow of the 2013 inauguration, sales have been spiraling downward. Company executives have attributed the decline to the quality of the merchandise and a fashion point-of-view that has been off the mark. Customers don\u2019t want what J. Crew is selling despite its having one of the world\u2019s biggest celebrities as a customer. The Gap has also been suffering financially. There is also the case of Pinto, who garnered extraordinary attention thanks to Obama\u2019s patronage. Yet in 2010, Pinto closed her company and filed for bankruptcy. In 2013, she relaunched as M2057 under a new business model. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in reinvention,\u201d Pinto says, \u201cbut evolution.\u201d President-elect Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama on election night in Chicago in 2008. Michelle Obama\u2019s black-and-red Narciso Rodriguez dress was pictured on countless front pages. (MCT/MCT via Getty Images) And consider Rodriguez, who designed the black-and-red dress Obama wore on election night in 2008 that appeared on front pages around the world. Even as Obama continued to wear his clothes, his business teetered on the edge of closing before it began to right itself in 2012 thanks to a reorganization. Obama can turn a spotlight on a designer. But she has not been an antidote to a recession, overextended finances, bad luck or poor choices. No one could be. That was not her intent. As much as Obama\u2019s clothes have been rich with symbolism, the East Wing has been loath to discuss the thought that goes into her fashion choices. Her office rarely announced, confirmed or mentioned the designer of her attire except for occasions of historical significance, such as inaugurations or state dinners. But even then, the statement was hardly more than a single sentence, with the sparest details about the dress and the designer. For the Italy state dinner, the White House noted: \u201cTonight, Mrs. Obama is wearing a floor length, rose gold chainmail gown designed by Atelier Versace.\u201d A confidential transition memo from July 2008, released by WikiLeaks, offered advice on handling public interest in the new first lady\u2019s wardrobe: \u201cFormer First Ladies\u2019 Chiefs of Staff recommend throwing a bone to the press and public \u2014 show the inaugural gown or at least disclose the designer; answer questions about hair styles. ... In other words, fulfill the public\u2019s fascination with celebrity and the mystique of the White House \u2014 most of it will die down as the Administration progresses.\u201d Her staff did not follow that advice, not even for inaugural gowns. In contrast, Laura Bush previewed sketches of her dress and Hillary Clinton announced that Oscar de la Renta would be her designer of choice. Details of Obama\u2019s fashion selections were typically shared by flattered designers who took to social media, an observant reporter who managed to identify the garment from a runway collection or a savvy publicist who trumpeted the news. Obama didn\u2019t dress and tell. But she offered the public something more than silk and satin to consider.

(Pool/Getty Images) What was it about Obama\u2019s clothes that kept people talking? What made critics roar over her bare arms when she wore a sleeveless, eggplant-colored Narciso Rodriguez dress to her husband\u2019s first address to Congress? Obama was not the first presidential spouse to go sleeveless in the Capitol. Jackie Kennedy had done so decades earlier. But Kennedy was not a statuesque black woman with muscular arms. The fascination with Obama\u2019s style has not simply been about the clothes, but the body in them. A lot of people had never seen a black woman so confidently glamorous \u2014 one who had not won an Oscar or a Grammy or spent her professional life raising Cain on reality television. Obama was not model-thin; she wasn\u2019t an ingenue. She was a grown-up with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 staking her claim on fashion. She was a unicorn on the political circuit. And she was strong. Folks could literally see her strength in her arms. A small industry developed around them, with more than a few personal trainers declaring they knew the secret to sculpted triceps. Obama began a rewrite of what a strong black woman looked like that had nothing to do with the Hollywood tropes of long-suffering maternal types, sassy broads or joyless uniformed functionaries. There remain those who cling to stereotypes, who use racist imagery to describe her and who assess her body as if it were on an auction block. The rewrite is a work in progress. It wasn\u2019t that women like Obama didn\u2019t already exist. They did. Her Chicago social circle was filled with women who shopped at the upper echelons of fashion, who saw vanity as a form of empowerment. She was their representative on the world stage. And her wardrobe choices underscored a simple but often overlooked aspect of fashion: It should be a confidence-building pleasure, not a burden. Obama waves after concluding her address to delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, September 4, 2012. (JASON REED/REUTERS) Obama arrives during the presidential inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol January 21, 2013. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Other first ladies have expressed their gratitude to Seventh Avenue for keeping them looking tastefully appropriate or have been supportive of industry initiatives aimed at breast cancer research or the prevention of heart disease. Hillary Clinton recognized fashion\u2019s philanthropy as first lady. And back in the 1960s, Lady Bird Johnson hosted a White House fashion show to highlight American style and to juice the economy. Obama engaged in a different, broader kind of conversation that was about the challenges and aesthetics of fashion and its role in the economy, in diplomacy and in our daily lives. Her clothes reflected fashion\u2019s global reach and the reality that American designers come from all over the world. She spoke as much to fashion\u2019s insiders as she did to everyone else. Obama has done a lot toward normalizing our relationship with fashion. Still, the industry does not stand equally alongside other branches of popular culture. I don\u2019t know anything about fashion remains an acceptable answer from our leaders to a question about Seventh Avenue. But should it be? Shouldn\u2019t the occupant of the West Wing at least express curiosity and excitement about an industry that churns out some $350\u00a0billion in sales in this country? It falls to the next residents of the White House \u2014 one of whom is a former model \u2014 to bring fashion fully into the fold. And doing so requires not just selecting a wardrobe that reflects occasion, personality and modernity, it means being willing to discuss it \u2014 maybe not in depth and certainly not ad nauseam, but with ease and thoughtfulness. If an all-star baseball game can get a visit from the commander in chief, why not the opening of Fashion Week in New York? If we believe that personality traits can be gleaned from the way a politician plays basketball or golf, surely clothes can be just as evocative. And if it\u2019s worth it to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s on your summer reading list?\u201d why not also inquire, \u201cWhat\u2019s new in your closet?\u201d The answer surely matters.

But thanks to the Army\u2019s cooks, they\u2019re not missing the taste of a Thanksgiving meal. Holly Williams visited the 101st Airborne Division at Camp Swift near Mosul, as the soldiers prepared to celebrate the holiday. \u00a0 These soldiers, in the fight against ISIS , are fresh-faced, many of them not long out of high school. \u00a0 \u00a0 It\u2019s a long way from home for Private First Class Onae Beam, a 19-year from Fontana, Southern California, on his first tour of duty. \u201cThis is my first time out of the U.S. You know, I didn\u2019t leave California until I went to Basic to Georgia... This is my first one,\u201d Beam said, smiling. \u201cYou know, I came out of basic, couple of months -- air assault school and stuff like that -- then straight here.\u201d \u00a0 Private Beam and many others at Camp Swift were children when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and they told us they don\u2019t know very much about America\u2019s recent history here. But five years after the U.S. said it had left Iraq for good, American service members are back in the country again. Private First Class Patrick Meehan from Pepperell, Massachusetts, is part of the security detail for the senior officers who work in the camp\u2019s command center, launching airstrikes on ISIS. \u00a0 \u201cSo the idea is that you could give your life to protect senior officers?\u201d Williams asked. \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Meehan said. \u201cIs that scary?\u201d Williams asked. \u201cNo ma\u2019am, not really,\u201d he said. \u00a0 These are big jobs resting on very young soldiers. Specialist Monique Frink, 22, from Goldsboro, North Carolina, is one of three cooks at the base who\u2019ll cater Thanksgiving lunch for 150 from a tiny kitchen. \u00a0 \u201cWe have steamship, ham, turkey, greens, corn on the cob, green beans,\u201d Frink said. \u00a0 Frink told us she\u2019s thankful to her grandfather, who also served as a military cook, inspiring her to enlist. But her recruiter first tried to convince her away from the job. \u201cI told my recruiter I want to be a cook, and he looks at me, he says, \u2018No you don\u2019t,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes I do.\u2019 He said, \u2018no you don\u2019t!\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes I do!\u2019\u201d Frink recalled. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you really don\u2019t.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No I really do.\u2019 And they gave it to me. I\u2019ve loved it ever since.\u201d \u00a0 A passion to serve their country -- in many different ways -- has led them half way across the world, and into the battle to defeat ISIS extremists. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Trump at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., this week. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump is expected to select as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross , a billionaire investor who became known as the \u201cking of bankruptcy\u201d for buying, restructuring and selling off steel makers and other fading industrial companies, officials on the transition team said on Thursday. After choosing national security hard-liners for some of his earliest appointments, Mr. Trump is now turning to a group of ultrawealthy conservatives to help steer administration policy. In addition to Mr. Ross, a generous contributor to his campaign, Mr. Trump is likely to choose Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor who is an owner of the Chicago Cubs and whose father founded TD Ameritrade, to be the deputy commerce secretary, the officials said. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would name Betsy DeVos , a school choice activist and Republican fund-raiser, as his education secretary. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest Shortlist. Mr. Ross, 78, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be $2.9 billion, is aligned with Mr. Trump on trade. He says the United States must free itself from the \u201cbondage\u201d of \u201cbad trade agreements,\u201d and he has advocated threats of steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Mr. Ross, the chairman of the private equity firm WL Ross & Company, has also pressed for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and reducing taxes and regulations on energy companies. During the general election, he hosted at least one fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his home in the Hamptons. There, Mr. Trump, who at the time was pondering his choice for a running mate, turned his deliberations into a party game, soliciting opinions from the donors in attendance. ",

Riley and Beth Warren, The (Louisville) Courier-Journal 3:40 p.m. EST November 24, 2016 The scene of a shooting on West Broadway on Thanksgiving Day. (Photo: Beth Warren) LOUISVILLE \u2014 Two people were killed, and four others injured in\u00a0a shooting at Shawnee Park sometime around 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Louisville Metro\u00a0Police confirmed. Police confirmed that a separate \u2014\u00a0but possibly related \u2014\u00a0scene\u00a0in front of the Gene Snyder U.S. Courthouse, was a crime scene and was blocked off from traffic. Police said they believed one victim was in a black vehicle that was stopped in the middle of the road. Traffic was stopped in front of the courthouse. Hundreds had gathered for the annual Juice Bowl football game at the park, including Mayor Greg Fischer, who was approximately 200 yards from the incident with his\u00a0security detail and staff members. Wayne State campus police officer dies after being shot Fischer spokesman Chris Poynter said the mayor attends the annual event every year and was never in danger. It was an \"alarming\" situation, however, he said. Children had finished playing football and two women's teams were in the middle of a flag football game when several shots were fired. One player, who asked not to be named, said she didn't hear\u00a0shots but saw a patrol cars rush in with blue lights flashing. The men's football games were then canceled. Charlotte Waddell, a cousin of Muhammad Ali, said she had just finished talking to the mayor when she heard several gunshots. \"This is the worst Thanksgiving ever, I'll never be back,\" said Waddell, who has attended the event for years.\u00a0\"I'm pretty shaken up.\" Follow\u00a0Beth Warren on Twitter: and @BethWarrenCJ 333 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gkUi8H ",

Costco, REI, Home Depot, IKEA and even the Mall of America are just some of the more than 50 national retailers that pushed back and stayed shuttered on Thanksgiving Day. According to ShopperTrak, Thanksgiving Day sales dropped 12.5 percent in 2015, giving some retailers a good reason to give their employees the day off. \"They're listening to customers, how they shop, and making business decisions on that,\" said Ellen Davis, senior vice president of research and strategic initiatives for the National Retail Federation. For the first time in eight years, Legends Outlets in Kansas City, Kansas, was closed for the holiday, said Jennifer Wojcik, the mall's general manager. People shop for deals Thursday morning at a Big Lots store in Alhambra, California. Frederic J. Brown / AFP - Getty Images \"I think the first couple of years you saw a big boost in sales by opening on Thanksgiving, and then it was pushed earlier and earlier everywhere,\" Wojcik told NBC station KSHB of Kansas City, Missouri. \"But we've seen a lot of shifting the sales around throughout the weekend, and not necessarily increasing them.\" In Moorestown, New Jersey, Maria Butkovic got to stay home on Thanksgiving for the first in three years. She manages two malls in the area. Related: So Which Stores Are Closed on Thanksgiving? \"Well, I'm pretty excited,\" she told NBC News. \"I can relax a little and spend time with my family. I don't have to leave my own party early.\" Stores that stayed open saw a huge opportunity to steal foot traffic from their competitors as they face the end of a weak year in the retail industry.

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times It is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump \u2019s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nation\u2019s education system. For nearly 30 years, as a philanthropist, activist and Republican fund-raiser, she has pushed to give families taxpayer money in the form of vouchers to attend private and parochial schools, pressed to expand publicly funded but privately run charter schools , and tried to strip teacher unions of their influence. A daughter of privilege, she also married into it; her husband, Dick, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan a decade ago, is heir to the Amway fortune. Like many education philanthropists, she argues that children\u2019s ZIP codes should not confine them to failing schools. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls \u201cfailing government schools.\u201d Conservative school choice activists hailed her on Wednesday as a fellow disrupter, and as someone who would block what they see as federal intrusion on local schools. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where Ms. DeVos helped push legislation establishing tax credits for scholarships to private schools, called her an \u201coutstanding pick,\u201d a \u201cpassionate change agent to press for a new education vision.\u201d \u201cHer allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next,\u201d he wrote on Facebook . Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a \u201csmart, principled small-government conservative who\u2019s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy.\u201d But to teachers\u2019 unions, she is anathema. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos \u201cthe most ideological, anti-public education nominee\u201d since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago. Even some groups that share her support for charter schools worried that picking someone so closely identified as a champion of vouchers signaled that the Trump administration would try to starve public schools. As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed steering $20 billion in existing federal money toward vouchers that families could use to help pay for private or parochial schools, perhaps tapping into $15 billion in so-called Title I money that goes to schools that serve the country\u2019s poorest children. He called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issues of our time.\u201d Photo Betsy DeVos, the pick for secretary of education, has advocated charter schools and vouchers. Credit Drew Angerer/Getty Images Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education Trust-Midwest, an advocacy group in Michigan that supports charters but has been critical of a Michigan charter school law that Ms. DeVos has spent millions to defend, said the pick had \u201cthe potential to undermine the nation\u2019s hard-won progress by diverting resources from the young people who most need them, or by failing to uphold the federal government\u2019s responsibility to protecting the needs and interests of all students \u2014 especially the most vulnerable.\u201d Michigan is one of the nation\u2019s biggest school choice laboratories, especially with charter schools. The Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids school districts have among the nation\u2019s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by for-profit organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation. ",

    "text": "WICHITA, Kan. -- Authorities say Yesenia Sesmas, the woman accused of killing Wichita mother Laura Abarca-Nogueda and kidnapping her six-day-old baby is in the U.S. Illegally. Laura Abarca-Nogueda and her newborn infant, Sophia KWCH Wichita police said Sesmas faked being pregnant for months and had been a longtime acquaintance of the 27-year-old mother, who was found dead Thursday at her home. Authorities launched a massive search for the new mother\u2019s six-day-old infant Sophia, who was found safe in Dallas days later. In an interview with KUVN-TV of Dallas-Fort Worth, Sesmas, 34, said that Abarca-Nogueda had agreed to turn over her newborn daughter to her but reneged on the agreement. She admitted killing the woman, but said it was an accident. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials confirm to CBS affiliate KWCH that Sesmas is an undocumented immigrant. They say her name was first flagged to them in July, when she was arrested in another kidnapping case. Sesmas had been arrested \u2014 but was never charged \u2014 on suspicion of threatening a pregnant woman with a knife and trying to hold that woman\u2019s two daughters for ransom. She posted bond and was released less than 24 hours after her arrest, said Col. Brenda Dietzman, undersheriff for the Sedgwick County sheriff\u2019s office in Wichita, Kansas. The family in that case was able to escape unharmed. The victim told KWCH that Sesmas seemed \u201cfascinated\u201d with her pregnancy. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not receive the July 25 list of arrests from the Sedgwick County sheriff\u2019s office that included Yesenia Sesmas\u2019 name until the following day, and by that time she had been released, ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok said Wednesday. The agency would have asked that Sesmas, a Mexican national, be detained if she had still been in jail, Rusnok said. Sesmas reportedly then missed a court date and a warrant was issued for her arrest, but authorities weren\u2019t able to locate her until her arrest in the latest case in Dallas. Sesmas was jailed in Dallas on a Kansas warrant, with first-degree murder and kidnapping charges pending, and Kansas authorities are seeking her extradition. The station reports ICE now has a detainer on her, and should she be convicted she\u2019ll serve out her sentence in Kansas before beginning immigration proceedings. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

What is happening in North Dakota is just a mere continuation of 500 years of colonization,\" Goldtooth said.

Stephanie Keith/Reuters Protesters block highway 1806 in Mandan during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, Nov. 23, 2016. \"An important thing to remember is that this movement and that this resistance is not born out of hate for others, but out of love and celebration for our continuous existence,\" Goldtooth said. Goldtooth said that many of the activists, who call themselves \"water protectors,\" celebrated this at the dinner Thursday night. \"There is a meal being served to the community of Cannon Ball to show our appreciation. That is the one that Jane Fonda is a part of, that meal is being served to the Cannon Ball community as a way of saying thanks for putting up with us,\" Goldtooth said. Goldtooth added that in the coming weeks, activists are expecting scores of veterans to \"deploy\" to Standing Rock, in order to show support for the \"water protectors.\" \"They\u2019re supposed to be coming over the next week or so. There has been a lot of support from veterans. It\u2019s a pretty beautiful thing to see,\" Goldtooth said. Energy Transfer Partners announced last week that it filed for a court order seeking the right-of-way to finish construction of the pipeline without further intervention from the federal government. The latest legal move followed a statement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that said it would delay issuing the final approval that the pipeline needs in order to complete construction in North Dakota, and invited the tribe to engage in further discussions. 0 Shares ",

Revelers cheered and yelled, \"Thank you!\" as police walked the parade route, and the crowd gave special attention to the New York Police Department marching band. Spectators \u2014 sometimes standing 10 deep \u2014 held signs and balloons as they watched Santa Claus and his reindeer, Ronald McDonald and SpongeBob SquarePants pass by. Charlie Brown led the signature balloons as the parade kicked off with a ceremonial ribbon-cutting before the parade made its way to Macy's flagship store on 34th Street. Photos: 90th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Floats Through NYC Clowns carrying bundles of balloons rode down the parade route as marching bands from across the country entertained revelers. Costumed characters and dozens of celebrities, including singers Tony Bennett and Sarah McLachlan and Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez, were among the attendees. Annie Quinn traveled more than three hours from Albany to attend the parade with her cousin and two sisters \u2014 all three dressed in turkey costumes \u2014 scoring prime front-row seats along the route. \"We sat here for hours, but it was worth it,\" she said. \"This was the best parade I've seen in a while.\" But amid the fun, high-fives and cheers, there was an air of uncertainty about the possibility of an extremist attack after a recent posting in an English-language Islamic State group magazine that called the parade \"an excellent target.\" Nevertheless, the parade went off without a hitch Thursday. More than 80 sanitation trucks filled with sand were parked at intersections and other places, acting as barriers against any kind of attack. The NYPD said the sanitation trucks, which they have used before, would play a bigger role at this year's parade in the wake of the cargo truck attack in Nice, France, that killed more than 80 people. In addition to more than 3,000 uniformed and plainclothes officers, bomb-sniffing dogs and officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors walked among the crowds. At least one spectator said the intensive security made her feel secure. \"There are so many police officers out here you can't help but feel safe,\" said Sarah Bender, who brought her two young sons to watch the parade. \"It's a day to have fun, watch the balloons and celebrate with your family. You can't spend your life worrying about what could happen.\" Close ",
