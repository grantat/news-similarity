    "text": "Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Says He Might Write In Evan McMullin By ALI ROGIN Nov 2, 2016, 5:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Independent Candidate Evan McMullin Could Make History This Election 0 Shares Email Having ruled out Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , Republican Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said he might vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president. \"That\u2019s a possibility,\" he told ABC's Jon Karl and Rick Klein during an interview on their podcast \"Powerhouse Politics.\" Arizona voters can write McMullin in on their ballot. Flake, among a handful of Senate Republicans who have never supported Trump, says his popularity has dropped at home because of it, and that he\u2019s relieved he\u2019s not up for re-election until 2018, by which time he hopes tempers will have subsided. \u201cI won\u2019t lie, it\u2019s not been easy,\u201d he said, going on to paraphrase a John McCain joke that Congress\u2019 popularity is down to paid staffers and blood relatives. \u201cI always thought I was fine having 10 siblings and 69 first cousins on my father\u2019s side. I\u2019m not sure that blood relatives, they hold anymore,\u201d he joked. Despite polls showing tightening margin's between Clinton and Trump in many battleground states, Flake said he was skeptical that the outcome of the race, which he said Trump will be \"very unlikely\" to win, will be close. Flake, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also reiterated his belief that Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland should get a confirmation hearing in the post-election, pre-inauguration lame duck session . \"Hillary Clinton will not likely nominate somebody as conservative as Garland. I\u2019m not suggesting he\u2019s that conservative, he\u2019s just more conservative than somebody she would name, particularly if she has a Democrat Senate,\" he said. Given his post on that influential committee, Flake has also interacted routinely with FBI Director James Comey. He said he was surprised when Comey made such a public show in July of criticizing Hillary Clinton's email practices while also declining to indict her, so he wasn't as surprised when Comey, upon acquiring potentially relevant, new information in the case, again went public with it. Clinton has said there is \"no case\" regarding the review of the newly discovered emails on longtime aide Huma Abedin 's computer. The junior Arizona senator refused to game out the fate of Senate control post-Election Day, but he did say he believes it's \"very, very close and I wouldn't want to call it today.\" He also avoided speculating about whether current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has drawn the ire of some conservatives who accuse him of being a member of the \u201cWashington establishment,\u201d would be able to retain his post as Republican Leader if Democrats regain the majority. \"I wouldn't want to speculate losing the Senate. I'm still hopeful we'll hold it,\u201d he said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "x Share Voters go to the polls everywhere Tuesday, but political watchers will have their eyes on these eight counties and the trends they represent. Republican turmoil Waukesha County in Wisconsin This iconic GOP stronghold in the Milwaukee suburbs has never quite warmed to Donald Trump, highlighting one of his biggest obstacles against Hillary Clinton. For much of this race, the Democratic nominee has been getting more support from her party\u2019s voters (just under 90% nationally) than he has from his (just over 80%). Phil Rosen, standing on West Main Street in downtown Waukesha, is an ardent conservative. He says Donald Trump is a \"horrible human being,\" but he doesn't trust or like Hillary Clinton. (Photo: Mike De Sisti, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) That \u201cloyalty gap\u201d has accounted for most of Clinton\u2019s lead this fall. When we talked to habitual Republicans in Waukesha, Wisconsin\u2019s third-largest county, we found widespread qualms about Trump\u2019s temperament, political depth and conservatism. In a place where Clinton is intensely unpopular, that has left many voters pained and conflicted. It also has left Trump with a much smaller edge in this landslide county than his party typically enjoys. That\u2019s a stark reversal of form, since Waukesha has been growing more Republican (compared to the rest of the country) with every presidential race for 40 years. Trump\u2019s weakness in the GOP\u2019s high-turnout suburban base has offset his strength in more rural and blue-collar parts of Wisconsin, and it\u2019s complicated his dogged push to \u201cflip\u201d a state that has voted Democratic for president seven times in a row. National polls are now showing some signs of Republican voters \u201ccoming home\u201d to their nominee, a trend that could be boosted by a revival of the Clinton email controversy. That is essential for Trump. One election night key to watch: whether Trump gets the huge margins and turnouts his party needs from reliably red suburbs in metropolitan battlegrounds like Milwaukee, Charlotte and Cincinnati. The education gap Chester County in Pennsylvania Republicans have won over white college graduates in every presidential race since 1956. That streak may end next week, thanks to an education gap that has become the demographic hallmark of the Clinton-Trump election. Margot McKee of Chester County, Pa., voted for Donald Trump in the state's primary but is undecided now. \"I'm so disgusted I'm thinking that maybe I'm not going to vote,\" she says. \"But then, that's a cop-out.\" (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) No group has swung more sharply toward Democrats since the last presidential race than white college-educated women. They voted Republican four years ago but now favor Clinton by large margins, a trend exacerbated by the recording of Trump\u2019s sexual boasting and allegations about his behavior toward women. The fallout is being felt in such suburban battlegrounds as Northern Virginia, North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle and the Philadelphia suburbs, where we spoke with many voters \u2014 even those mistrustful of Clinton \u2014 who were dismayed by Trump\u2019s tone and rhetoric. Chester County has the highest share of college-educated adults in Pennsylvania. Unlike Waukesha, it has been growing\u00a0less\u00a0Republican over time, not more \u2014 a trend in many white-collar suburbs that ring large cities. Chester was decided by less than a point in 2012. But a recent Pennsylvania poll by Bloomberg Politics showed Clinton with a 28-point lead in Philadelphia\u2019s suburban counties, home to almost 3 million people. That represents another high hurdle in Trump\u2019s effort to turn a blue state red. One election night key to watch: whether Clinton does better than Obama did in purple, high-education counties like Jefferson, Colo. (outside Denver), Loudoun, Va. (outside Washington, D.C.)\u00a0and Wake, N.C. (home to Raleigh). African-American vote Four years ago, 38 precincts in Detroit cast zero votes for the Republican presidential ticket. Trump has pointed to big-city returns like those to argue the elections are \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is only qualified to run his mouth. I\u2019m definitely voting against him,\" says Debra Gatson, 61, of Detroit. (Photo: Salwan Georges, Detroit Free Press) But the pattern is easily explained by a familiar feature of presidential politics: African-American support for Democrats is one-sided in the extreme. President Obama won 93% of the black vote, according to 2012 exit polls. He won 100% in some precincts in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Chicago and other cities. He won 98% of the vote in Wayne County\u2019s biggest\u00a0city, Detroit . In a recent Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll, no black voters in the survey backed Trump. The Republican has tried to woo African-American voters, even taking his pitch to a Detroit church this fall.\u00a0 But it\u2019s clear here and elsewhere that his message has been undercut by his own rhetoric, including his claims of urban voting fraud and his bleak portrayal of black communities as violent and despairing. Clinton faces a very different challenge when it comes to her party\u2019s most lopsided supporters: maximizing their vote in battlegrounds like Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Florida. There is no group where the rise and fall in turnout has a more direct impact on elections because its vote goes almost entirely to one side. But Clinton\u00a0doesn't generate\u00a0the enthusiasm Obama did. In the president\u2019s re-election, black turnout surpassed white turnout, according to census surveys. That\u2019s a campaign feat Clinton may have trouble replicating. One election night key to watch: whether Clinton gets fewer votes than Obama in counties with sizable black populations such as Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Cuyahoga, Ohio (Cleveland). Latino turnout Maricopa County in Arizona Arizona was not expected to be a tossup state in 2016, having voted Republican for president in every election but one since the 1960s. Esther Rivera, 18, asks people to register to vote at a Fry's parking lot in Phoenix. She hopes her vote will help bring immigration changes that will benefit her mother and brother, who are both undocumented. (Photo: Nick Oza, The Arizona Republic) But right now it\u2019s more competitive than some perennial swing states, inviting a late Clinton ad blitz. One big reason: a Latino backlash against Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration and his comments about Mexican-Americans. Something similar has happened in Texas, where the Republican margin is far slimmer than in previous races. Polls give Clinton a more than 2-to-1 lead among Latinos in Arizona. Once again, turnout is the x-factor. Four years ago, Latinos made up 30% of the population in massive Maricopa County (home to Phoenix) , but only an estimated 15% of the votes cast. Latinos have lower rates of citizenship and lower rates of voting, diluting their political clout. Maricopa County hasn\u2019t voted Democratic in more than 60 years. But if that streak ends this year, it could alter the presidential map. One election night key to watch: whether Latinos match the share of the total vote they represented in the 2012 national exit poll (10%) and in critical states like Florida (17%), Nevada (19%) and Arizona (18%). The urban-rural gap Union County in Iowa Iowa has been one of Trump\u2019s best and Clinton\u2019s shakiest battlegrounds, despite having twice voted for Obama. \u201cI think we are ready for change, and I think we need it,\u201d said Sharon Hower, a retiree of Creston, Iowa's Bunn-O-Matic plant. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything Mr. Trump says, but I think he deserves a chance.\u201d (Photo: Rodney White, The Des Moines Register) A key factor is Clinton\u2019s weakness and Trump\u2019s strength with rural voters, who made up more than half the vote in Iowa in 2012, far higher than in any other swing state. Democrats need to be competitive with rural whites to win battlegrounds like Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. In Iowa\u2019s Union County , home to fewer than 13,000 people, many voters we talked to pointed to the economic struggles of rural communities to explain the appeal of Trump\u2019s populist message. Those communities also match the demographic profile of Trump\u2019s core support: older white voters without college degrees. The divide between urban and rural voters has been a growing feature of American politics, and the Trump-Clinton contest has widened it. Obama won urban voters by 26 points and lost rural voters by 20, according to the 2012 exit poll \u2014 a gap of 46 points. That gap could grow even larger this year. One election night key to watch: whether Trump exceeds Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 share of the rural vote in Wisconsin (53%), Iowa (52%) and Ohio (60%). The millennial generation Larimer County in Colorado Young voters have no perceived champion in this race: Obama is off the ballot and Democrat Bernie Sanders lost his party\u2019s nomination. Clinton has struggled to mobilize and inspire them. Disillusioned by the choice of presidential candidates, Colorado State University student Matthew Nagashima and friends created the \"Nobody 2016\" website and merchandise. \"We're just saying that these two candidates aren't viable,\" he said. (Photo: Valerie Mosley, The Coloradoan) Colorado is the youngest state (demographically) of the battlegrounds. And very purple Larimer County , home to Colorado State, is among its younger counties. Young voters here and elsewhere have been slow to embrace either nominee, raising questions about how many will stay home or vote third party. No part of the \u201cObama Coalition\u201d has been softer for Clinton, whose relationship with millennials has been a \u201ccomplicated\u201d one, according to John Della Volpe, a pollster for Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics. He found some signs of progress for her in a national poll Harvard released last week. Clinton easily led Trump 49% to 21% among voters 18 to 29. But that left almost a third of young voters preferring a third-party candidate (14% for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 5% for the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein) or undecided (11%). While views of Clinton had improved after the July conventions, they were still more negative than positive among young voters. One election night key to watch: whether the under-30 vote matches its share of the national vote in 2012 (19%) and whether Clinton wins those voters by a margin similar to Obama\u2019s (23 points). Battle for blue-collar whites Clark County in Ohio Of the five battleground states where blue-collar whites are a majority of the electorate, Ohio is easily the most important in deciding the next president (the others are Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa and New Hampshire). When we visited Clark County, home of Springfield , we found a community striving to bounce back from years of harsh industrial decline. Stephen Jarrell, left, and Richard Jarrell are both veterans. The brothers took to the streets with signs trying to get Donald Trump's attention because they are running out of funds. They don't necessarily support Trump, but they believe he has a lot of influence. (Photo: Carrie Cochran, The Cincinnati Enquirer) To the east, Youngstown, Ohio, has become a national symbol of Trump\u2019s Rust Belt, working-class appeal to struggling whites who may have once voted Democratic. But the story in Clark County is more mixed, as voters struggle with their qualms about both candidates. Trump\u2019s stands on trade and immigration appeal to some, while his volatility turns off others. Clark County was decided by 523 votes in 2012 and is expected to be closely divided in this election. In an Ohio poll by NBC/Marist last month, Trump trailed Clinton by 12 points among college grads but led Clinton by 10 points among non-college educated voters. Blue-collar whites (Trump\u2019s base) historically vote at lower rates than college-educated whites, who lean toward Clinton this year. Closing that turnout gap is an obvious challenge for Trump. But it is also an opportunity, since turnout among blue-collar voters has more room to grow. One election night key to watch: just how big the divide is between college and non-college voters (in 2012, there was virtually no difference in the way the two groups voted). The Metropolitan vote Hillsborough County in Florida This county, home to Tampa, is the quintessential battleground within a battleground \u2014 a big, diverse and purple region in a diverse and massive swing state. Because Republicans have lost ground elsewhere on the map, there is no path to victory for Trump without Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes. \u201cI don\u2019t love Donald Trump. He disgusts me. The things that I find most disgusting about him are the things that play over and over and over and over again,\u201d says attorney David Galloway of Plant City, Fla. \u2014 who does plan to vote for the GOP nominee. (Photo: Luke Franke, Naples Daily News) Hillsborough County is a microcosm of the nation in many ways:\u00a0urban, suburban, rural; 51% white, 27% Hispanic\u00a0and 18% black. It features all the dividing lines that have marked this contest: race, gender, education and age. And it has picked the winner in 19 of the past 20 presidential elections. But while the region is a cross-section of America, the Tampa-St. Petersburg area has a distinctive place politically among the nation\u2019s major metropolitan areas, which have been trending Democratic over time, boosting the party\u2019s vote totals. Obama won 35 of the 50 most populous metros in 2012 \u2014 by a staggering margin of almost 12 million votes. Only 15 of the top 50 metros voted Republican, most of them in solid red states. But metropolitan Tampa Bay mirrored the national vote more closely than almost any other large metro four years ago.\u00a0It is arguably America\u2019s top battleground-state battleground. We found signs that both Clinton and Trump were struggling to solidify their political bases of support here, reflecting a contest that has largely pitted one candidate\u2019s \u201cnegatives\u201d against the other\u2019s. Hillsborough County will be critical next Tuesday in the battle for America\u2019s top electoral prize. And in that sense, it will help determine whether Trump\u2019s path to the White House is merely difficult, or impossibly narrow. One election night key to watch: if Trump loses Florida, his hopes are dead and all suspense about the outcome will be over; if he wins Florida, he'll still need to win Ohio and probably Pennsylvania to have a chance.

    "text": "By Manuel Bojorquez CBS News November 2, 2016, 7:26 PM Okla. schools make tough cuts amid oil slump, budget cuts INOLA, Okla. -- Inola High School is like any other in America, bustling with students running from class to class. Except on Mondays. Inola High School on a Monday CBS News The school district, outside of Tulsa, has lost $400,000 in state funding over the past year. \u201cNot in my worst dream did I ever figure I would be taking my district to a four-day school week,\u201d said Dr. Kent Holbrook, the superintendent. Dr. Kent Holbrook CBS News The choice was cut teachers or switch to four days with longer hours. \u201cWhen I started weighing out, what\u2019s going to do more damage to these students? Is it going to be put 30, 35 first-graders in a class, or change the hours in a week? The decision was actually pretty easy,\u201d Holbrook said. Lawmakers blame a 70 percent drop in oil and gas prices since 2014. This year the state faced a $1.3 billion deficit and cut $34 million in education funding. But critics say that\u2019s in part due to years of giving tax breaks to oil companies; Rates as low as one percent during the boom, while the going rate in North Dakota was 11.5 percent. Nearly one-third of Oklahoma\u2019s school districts, in mostly poor, rural areas, have had to shorten the school week. \u201cKnowing we don\u2019t have enough money to keep the lights on and the buses running \u2026 it\u2019s just an outrage,\u201d said Audra Cornett, who has two children in Inola schools and is also a teacher. Audra Cornett CBS News \u201cTheir whole future depends on the quality of education that they received at these young ages,\u201d Cornett said. \u201cI don\u2019t see them being ready in the way we had been able to prepare them before.\u201d To help out other parents, she opened a learning center, where for $20, they can send their children on Mondays -- until the time when that will be a school day again. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Puskar/AP Updated at 1 a.m. ET The Chicago Cubs, ending a championship drought that has lasted 108 years, beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. They did it the hard way, too, coming back from a 3-1 game deficit, winning three straight games, including the last two on the road in Cleveland. And it took ten innings to win it all in Game 7. The Cubs are the first team since the 1985 Kansas City Royals to claw back from a 3-1 deficit in the World Series. They won 103 games during the regular season.

They were leading 6-3 when their hard-throwing closer Aroldis Chapman blew a save opportunity by giving up three runs in the eighth inning, two coming from a dramatic home run by the Indians' Rajai Davis that tied the score at 6-6. In the top of the rain-delayed tenth inning, the Cubs' Kyle Schwarber opened the frame with a single and was replaced by pinch runner Albert Almora Jr., who took second base on a sacrifice fly by Kris Bryant that almost left the park. Anthony Rizzo was intentionally walked. Ben Zobrist doubled to score Almora and then pinch-hitter Miguel Montero singled to score Rizzo. The game stood at 8-6.

That brought up Davis, the hero of the Indians' eighth inning. He promptly singled, scoring Guyer. With the score at 8-7, Cubs reliever Mike Montgomery induced Michael Martinez to ground out. Article continues after sponsorship The last time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series was 1908 back when Theodore Roosevelt was president. By losing in extra innings in Game 7, the Indians fell short of their goal: to win Cleveland's first championship since 1948. The game had no shortage of stomach-tightening moments for both teams and their fans. The Cubs struck quickly with a solo home run to center field by lead-off hitter Dexter Fowler, off Indians starter Corey Kluber in the first inning. Schwarber followed with a single, but Kluber then retired eight straight Cubs hitters over the first three innings. Schwarber collected his second single of the game but he was thrown out trying to stretch out a double to end the top half of the third inning. The Indians tied the score at 1-1 when Coco Crisp led off the bottom of the third inning with a double to left, took third on a sacrifice bunt by Roberto Perez and scored on a single to right field by Carlos Santana. An error by Cubs second baseman Javier Baez put another runner on base. But the Indians failed to capitalize on what might have been a big inning. The Cubs regained the lead in the top of the fourth inning, scoring two runs. Kris Bryant led off with a single and Rizzo was hit by a pitch. A sacrifice fly by Addison Russell scored Bryant, then a double by Willson Contreras brought in the Cubs' second run of the frame. The Indians went down quietly in the bottom of the fourth inning. Chicago got two more runs in the fifth inning on a solo homer by Baez on the first pitch he saw from the Indians' Kluber. The Indians brought in their ace reliever Andrew Miller. Two outs later, Bryant walked and scored on a base hit by Rizzo. Chicago led the game 5-1. The Indians came back with two runs in the fifth. Cubs manager Joe Maddon pulled his starter Kyle Hendricks in the bottom of the fifth with two outs after he walked the Indians' Santana. Hendricks left the game surrendering only one run and scattering four hits. The Cubs' Jon Lester, typically a starter, came in to relieve. A throwing error by catcher David Ross put runners at second and third. They both scored on a wild pitch by Lester, cutting the Indians' deficit to two runs, 5-3. Ross reclaimed one of those runs with a solo home run to center off the Indians' Miller in the top of the sixth inning, extending Chicago's lead 6-3. Chicago stayed in command until the improbable bottom of the eighth. They were never behind in this game. Correction Nov. 2, 2016 ",

Families Facing Sticker Shock Over 400 Percent Price Hike by Ben Popken The Carras, whose son Dorian has type-1 diabetes, read a book on the couch at their Texas home. NBC News Share advertisement Is insulin is the new EpiPen? In the last eight years, the average price per milliliter of insulin has skyrocketed by over 200 percent. But there's one major difference. If you can't get an EpiPen, there's a chance you might die. If your body doesn't have insulin, you certainly will die. \"It feels like they're holding my kid ransom,\" said Tiffany Cara, whose son has diabetes. Only three companies make insulin in the U.S. and each has steadily ratcheted up prices, sometimes in lockstep. Since 2004, the manufacturer list price for insulin, known as wholesale acquisition cost, is up by triple digits. Novo Nordisk's insulin Novolog is up 381 percent, Eli Lilly's Humalog is up 380 percent and Sanofi's Lantus is up 400 percent, according to data from Truven Health Analytics. That's sending some diabetic families into sticker shock. Play Diabetes Patients Struggle as Insulin Costs Soar 1:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161103061419if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/799519811736\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Six-year-old Dorian Carra loves to play outside his Texas home and dress up as a super hero. Specifically, Captain America, the World War II version. His mom says her outgoing boy has \"never met a stranger.\" But four years ago he couldn't stay awake. He was breathing oddly. His parents brought his rag doll body to the E.R. Doctors said his blood sugar levels had spiked to 965 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood. A normal range is 80 to 140. The diagnosis was type-1 diabetes. The prescription was insulin, every day, for the rest of his life. Recently those treatment costs doubled after the Carra's health insurance company switched to cover another brand. Even though the brands are clinically the same, the new medicine isn't available in the dosages he needs, so they have to stick with the more expensive kind. Tiffany Carra, a thirty-two-year-old stay-at-home mom, says it now costs them $1,880 a year for insulin and supplies. 6 million Americans rely on insulin Mostly Dorian keeps a brave face. He's able to set up his insulin supplies by himself. Sometimes his parents help him with the last step. Sometimes he cries. Sometimes he says he hates diabetes. But without insulin his cells can't absorb the sugar they need to make energy and he can go into a life-threatening diabetic coma. There an estimated 30 million Americans with diabetes. Most are what's known as type-2. Their body doesn't use insulin the right way and may end up with a prescription for it if lifestyle and diet changes aren't enough. But 10 percent of diabetics are type-1, like Dorian. Their immune system actually destroys the cells that release insulin, requiring a lifetime of daily treatment. The pricing buzzsaw faced by the Carras and the six million others who use insulin reflects a simple economic reality. \"Prices are set by the pharmaceutical companies at whatever the market will bear,\" Dr. Kesselheim, associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told NBC News. Just like with EpiPen , insulin list prices have been going up behind the scenes for years. Most patients had a relatively small copay so they didn't really see the price hikes except as part of gradually rising premiums. But since Obamacare went into effect in 2014, the number of employees enrolled in high-deductible plans has shot up 9 percentage points, according to a survey by the Kaiser family foundation , as employers have successfully steered their workers towards the plans. Even though those premiums are increasing at historic lows, the higher deductibles mean more Americans are getting directly exposed to the soaring prices \u2014 and paying for them out of pocket. Sometimes insulin drugmakers have played \"follow the leader\" with price hikes. Price increases for competing brands of insulin tend to occur at the same time and by the same amounts. NBC News When Eli Lilly raised the average wholesale price of the Humalog Dorian was taking by 10 percent in the 4th quarter of 2013, so did Novo Nordisk with its competing insulin Novolog. And when Novolog's prices went up by 8 percent in the third quarter of 2016, so did Humalog's. Between the 3rd quarters of 2008 and 2016, the drugs saw 16 separate price moves. Of them, 10 were by the same amount and at the same time. The others differed by a few percentage points, or were delayed by a quarter. Generic is no panacea Another major factor: there is currently no generic for insulin. And while Wal-Mart sells three different kinds of insulin for $25 a vial, these are older kinds that require the patient to follow strict snack and meal schedules. That's not as viable for families with diabetic children who prefer the flexibility of the newer - and more expensive -- generations of insulin. Dorian's insulin kit. Courtesy Tiffany Cara Another factor tamping down competition is that it's hard and hugely costly to make a \"generic\" (technically a \"biosimilar\") version of insulin. The drug is not just synthesized chemicals, it's actually made by cells. Insulin used to be drawn from the pancreases of slaughtered animals. Nowadays it's coaxed from tweaked yeast or bacteria. This December will be the first time that biosimilar insulin is set to hit the shelves, and others are in the works. The increased competition will offer much-needed, but modest, price relief. A typical generic offers 85 percent savings off the name brand. But biosimilar insulins are only projected to save 11-15 percent, according to an analysis by the nonprofit RAND research corporation . It can take $100 to $250 million for a drug company to develop and market a biosimilar drug, versus the $1 million to $4 million needed for a regular generic. The blame game There's plenty of blame for rising prices to go around with a complex health care machine responsible for getting a drug from the manufacturer to the patient. Drugmakers say pricing is multifaceted and driven up by middlemen. Novo Nordisk says it negotiates to increase access for its drugs and that most patients have co-pays that average between $1 to $1.40 per day. \"Price increases are necessary to support our mission to research and develop new medicines,\" the company said in a statement to NBC News. Eli Lilly, makers of Humolog, said in a statement that \"today's health care system works well for most people, but those enrolled in high-deductible insurance plans and managing chronic conditions face challenges in gaining reasonable access to treatments they need.\" In a statement, Sanofi said it hasn't raised prices for Lantus since 2014 \"because of efforts to remain included on formularies at a favorable tier which helps to reduce out of pocket costs to patients.\" All drug makers say they also offer co-pay assistance programs as well as assistance programs for those without insurance to help needy patients. They also point the finger at pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for negotiating larger rebates for insurers, which they say forces them to raise prices. Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, one of the two largest PBMs in the country, said drug companies are responsible for setting the prices, and creating and managing the rebate program. He says they they pass along most of the rebate to insurers. Meanwhile, insurance carriers just say drug prices are out of control. \"Millions depend on insulin every day,\" said David Merritt, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plan. \"Every cost increase by a drug company makes it that much harder for patients to access the treatments they need. We need to solve this pricing crisis now.\" Price hike relief is on the way -- for payers. Shares of insulin maker Novo Nordisk and drug wholesaler McKesson fell by double digits last week on news that aggressive rebate negotiations are helping cut or flatten the prices insurers pay for insulin. But don't expect to see that get passed down to a lower premium or cheaper insulin, especially for those without insurance or facing a high deductible. \"Most people with insurance are paying a co-pay, and even when a price changes, we don't see much movement on the co-pay side,\" said Novo Nordisk's Inchausti. \"A patient exposed to list price is still going to be exposed to list price.\" Another shot at savings Ultimately, you should tell your doctor if you're having trouble paying for what you're prescribed. There may be a more affordable alternative, so check with your insurance company to see if you qualify for patient assistance programs, and comparison shop on sites like GoodRX. Big box stores like Costco and Wal-Mart may also offer additional savings. Even if you tell your doctor they may not know all the tricks. The Carras worked with drug comparison site Rx Savings Solutions and found two manufacturer coupons that cut the price back to the $150 they used to pay. Using them required that they start going to a different drugstore. A small price to pay but one that reflects the complex network of hidden agreements that governs who gets the best access to insulin and at what cost. \"The only way for consumers to save money is to advocate for themselves,\" said Michael Rea, founder and CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. \"You can manage cholesterol six different ways, and the difference can be $4 to $400. Consumers don't know that \u2014 and neither do their doctors.\" Ben Popken ",

    "text": "Rare Neurological Disease Investigated in Mysterious Washington State Illness Cluster By Gillian Mohney Nov 2, 2016, 2:04 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Rare Neurological Disease Investigated in Mysterious Washington State Illness Cluster 0 Shares Email A cluster of children who developed neurological symptoms in Washington state has put the spotlight on a rare and frightening syndrome called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM.) The syndrome affects the nervous system, especially the spine, and can lead to temporary or permanent paralysis of the limbs. Two of the hospitalized children were confirmed to have AFM and seven other cases are under investigation. One child who died, though the cause of death has not yet been confirmed, experienced the same severe neurological symptoms. Yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new numbers about the disease, which show an uptick in cases this year. At least 89 people have been diagnosed with AFM in the U.S. as of September. In 2015, there were a total of 50 cases. \"CDC is concerned about AFM, a serious illness that we do not know the cause of or how to prevent,\" the agency wrote on its website. The frightening syndrome also made headlines in 2014 when 120 cases were reported, most of them in children. While experts from the CDC investigated the outbreak to look for a cause, they have yet to identify a single pathogen that led to the outbreak. What is acute flaccid myelitis? AFM is a condition that affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause temporary or permanent paralysis in one or more limbs. The word myelitis refers to an inflammation in the spinal cord. Symptoms of AFM include weakness or paralysis of the limbs, facial droop, difficulty breathing and drooping eyelids, according to the CDC . If the muscles involved in breathing become too weak to function, the syndrome can turn deadly and a patient may need to be put on a ventilator to survive. What causes the syndrome? AFM can be caused by a variety of infections, including viral illness such as enteroviruses, which includes the polio virus, West Nile virus and adenoviruses. However, identifying a cause for a cluster of cases can be difficult. In 2014, CDC officials looked for signs that an outbreak of enterovirus D68 had caused the subsequent AFM outbreak, but they never found a clear link between that specific viral infection and the syndrome. \"To date, we have not consistently detected a pathogen (germ) in the patients' spinal fluid; a pathogen detected in the spinal fluid would be good evidence to indicate the cause of AFM since this illness affects the spinal cord,\" the CDC said on their website. State health officials investigating the Washington state cluster of cases said no link between them has been identified. The nine children hospitalized lived in four different counties. \"We\u2019re looking at all possible causes of the AFM cases in 2016,\" a CDC spokesman told ABC News today. \"We know that certain viruses can cause AFM, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and West Nile virus, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing these cases of AFM in 2016 specifically.\" How is it treated? No specific treatment has been proven to stop AFM, but doctors can take steps to diminish dangerous inflammation in the nervous system. How often does AFM appear in the U.S.? Tracking the number of AFM cases in the U.S. has not been consistent. The outbreak in 2014 led the CDC to ask doctors to look for and report the disease. From August to December 2014 the agency received at least 120 reports of AFM cases, in 2015 50 cases were reported and, as of September this year, 89 cases have been reported. AFM is one type of the condition called transverse myelitis. In the neurological disorder, inflammation occurs on both sides of one segment of the spinal cord, according to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). The NIH states, \"1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed each year in the United States, and approximately 33,000 Americans have some type of disability resulting from the disorder.\" 0 Shares ",

In July, after a lengthy investigation, the FBI and Department of Justice declined to pursue charges in the case. While criticizing Clinton's actions, Comey said \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring a case based on the evidence agents found. But agents recently discovered emails that may be relevant to the case when examining the computer of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of Clinton's top aides, Huma Abedin. Article continues after sponsorship After FBI Shakes Up Presidential Race, Candidates Try To Adjust And Capitalize Attempting to carefully walk a line between his support for Clinton and his unwillingness as president to, as he put it, \"meddle\" in an ongoing investigation, Obama said that \"when this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that she had made some mistakes, but there wasn't anything there that was, you know, prosecutable.\" FBI agents are currently sifting through the Abedin emails found on Weiner's computer. It's unclear when the agency will provide any official updates \u2014 or when developments may next leak to media outlets. More Surprises: FBI Releases Files On Bill Clinton's Pardon Of Marc Rich Clinton and many Democrats are blasting Comey for revealing the latest developments so close to an election, and before the facts were clear. (Agents had not obtained a warrant to examine the new emails at the time that Comey sent his letter to Congress.) Obama declined to join that pile-on, saying about the timing of Comey's letter: \"I've made a very deliberate effort to make sure that I don't look like I'm meddling in what are supposed to be independent processes for making these assessments,\" Obama said. \"I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations \u2014 we don't operate on innuendo, we don't operate on incomplete information, we don't operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.\" White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Wednesday that Obama wasn't trying to criticize Comey in the interivew. Earlier this week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the White House would neither criticize nor defend Comey and that Obama \"believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle, and he's a man of good character.\" ",

(Photo: ESO/A. McLeod) Breathtaking new images dubbed \"pillars of destruction\" from\u00a0the Carina Nebula were released Wednesday by the European Southern Observatory. The spires and pillars are actually vast clouds of dust and gas within a hub of star formation\u00a0some 7,500 light years from Earth, ESO said.\u00a0The massive stars within the star formation region slowly destroy the pillars\u00a0from which they are born. The pictures rank right up with the Hubble Space Telescope's famous Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula, the Associated Press reported. The phenomena\u00a0were observed by a team led by astronomer\u00a0 Anna McLeod \u00a0via the Very Large Telescope in Chile. These composite image shows several pillars within the Carina Nebula which were observed and studied with the MUSE instrument, mounted on ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope. \u00a0(Photo: ESO/A. McLeod) This craggy fantasy mountaintop enshrouded by wispy clouds looks like a bizarre landscape. But it is indeed a pillar of gas and dust, three light-years tall, which is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars. \u00a0(Photo: ESO/A.

The Cubs last won the World Series in 1908. SLIDESHOW: Chicago Cubs Celebrate World Series Championship Game 7 got off to a good start for the Cubs: Dexter Fowler started off the Cubs strong with a lead-off home run at the top of the first inning, which many long-suffering Cubs fans took as a sign of more good things to come in Game 7 of the World Series. The game included a 17-minute rain delay before the 10th inning. The Cubs halted the longest title drought in baseball, becoming the first club to overcome a 3-1 Series deficit since the 1985 Kansas City Royals. The team led the majors with 103 wins this season. Among those who were happy about the Cubs' win was Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was raised in a Chicago suburb.

Though the jet\u2019s transponder and automated data systems were switched off early in the flight, rudimentary Satcom continued to ping. Investigators have assessed that data and believe it is \u201cconsistent with the aircraft being in a high and increasing rate of descent,\u201d according to the ATSB. Malaysia Airlines Mystery May Never Be Solved, Officials Say Additionally, analysis of debris that washed ashore indicates the Boeing 777\u2019s flaps were likely \u201cin the retracted position\u201d when the plane hit the water -- consistent with the ATSB\u2019s theory that the plane plunged in the sea seconds after running out of fuel. (A competing theory suggests someone in the cockpit may have deliberately attempted to ditch the jet by landing it on the surface of the ocean, a maneuver that normally would have included deploying the flaps.) All this data seems to suggest that authorities are searching in the right place -- as do the drift patterns of the debris. But despite scouring more than 110,000 square kilometers (about 42,471 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, investigators have yet to unearth the wreckage of the plane or the remains of its 239 occupants. The conundrum has Australian authorities wondering if there could possibly be something they\u2019ve missed, prompting them to release their data in the hopes that other analysts can identify an alternative scenario. ABC News' David Kerley contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

(Molly Hennessy-Fiske / Los Angeles Times) See more videos Iraqi government forces took a brief pause Wednesday in their 2-week-old offensive to retake Mosul from Islamic State , working to clear jihadi fighters from these outlying suburbs and to handle the flood of civilians who are fleeing Iraq\u2019s second-largest city. Meanwhile, Shiite Muslim forces who entered the fight last week reported they had gained control of a main highway linking Mosul to Islamic State\u2019s other main stronghold in Raqqah, Syria \u2014 a move they said will enable them to cut a main supply line to Islamic State forces in the city. More than 18,000 people have been displaced from their homes since the Mosul offensive started on Oct. 17, according to the United Nations, and humanitarian agencies are preparing for an even greater flood as the fighting in the city escalates. Aid workers \u201care now bracing ... for the worst. The lives of 1.2 million civilians are in grave danger, and the future of all of Iraq is now in the balance,\" said Wolfgang Gressmann, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq. Hussein\u2019s battalion has taken over a half dozen villages, but Gogjali was the first area that was inhabited, and soldiers were preparing for the possibility that some of those leaving  could be Islamic State fighters disguised as civilians. (Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Laura King) The Iraqi commander advised his soldiers to deal fairly with residents as they cleared and secured the area, but also to be suspicious. The risk would only increase the closer they crept to \u00a0Mosul\u2019s urban core. Fleeing Islamic State fighters shot at departing civilians as they left and took with them as hostages a half dozen of those who had relatives in the security forces, residents\u00a0and soldiers said. Iraqi forces killed eight of the militants, who attacked with suicide car bombs and mortars. A 14-year-old girl was killed when her house was hit by a mortar strike. Two other children were injured: a 9-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. As a day of clouds gave way to clearer skies, U.S. coalition planes resumed flying  and airstrikes boomed on the horizon. Elsewhere in town, smaller booms sounded as Iraqi soldiers defused mines. Hussein passed houses displaying white flags signaling their surrender. Residents emerged carrying tea for the soldiers. Children waved. Others just looked on, wide-eyed. A soldier asked one resident why he hadn\u2019t shaved. He said they still didn\u2019t have electricity. Hussein was looking for Islamic State fighters. He had found one of their cellphones, and had a list of names. \u201cIf I give you a name, can you help?\u201d the commander asked a small group of men standing in the dirt road. Awat Suleiman, 55, nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready to help,\u201d he said. But when Hussein said he was looking for a local Islamic State fighter named Omar Abdel Salem, the man clammed up. \u201cI don\u2019t know him,\u201d he said, stone-faced. The rest of the crowd stood silent. Hussein smiled ruefully as he walked away, shaking his head. \u201cAlways they are saying they don\u2019t know them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still afraid that the army will withdraw and ISIS will come again.\u201d Pentagon fears killing civilians from the air as battle for Mosul intensifies \u00bb He walked to a local cement plant where his troops had fought Islamic State militants the day before, and pointed in the rubble to a body of a militant they had killed. The bearded man was unarmed and shirtless, wearing blue shorts and Nike sandals. He had fled after confronting the Iraqi special forces and was shot in the face. \u201cHe removed his ISIS uniform and was trying to dress as a civilian,\u201d Hussein said. The fighter was not alone in attempting to blend in with fleeing civilians. At a red house that had served as an Islamic State base, Hussein pointed to several brown uniforms discarded on the patio. Some civilians here have been helpful, showing soldiers where militants were hiding and where they had placed mines so they could be defused, said Sgt. Maj. Hattab Bashir Rashid. Hussein found one of the explosives in the doorway of the home of a known Islamic State fighter. Rashid, 37, said he has five children at home in nearby Dohuk and cannot help but think of his own family when he sees those fleeing the escalating fight in Mosul. \u201cTo liberate families is our duty. We can\u2019t do more than this,\u201d he said as his Humvee passed the fleeing crowds of civilians. \u201cAfter us, intelligence groups will come and do screenings. Those who committed crimes will be judged and go to prison. Others we will welcome.\u201d ",

Sofya Tsygankova has been ordered committed by a Texas judge to a state mental health facility for 120 days of treatment with the hope that she will be able to face justice when she regains \"a reasonable degree of rational understanding,\" court records revealed Wednesday. In this 2014 file photo, award-winning concert pianist Vadym Kholodenko, poses with his wife Sofya Tsygankova and daughters Nika, 4, and Michela, at their home in Fort Worth, Texas. Joyce Marshall / AP Tsygankova, who is 32 and charged with two counts of capital murder of a person under age 10, will remain in the Tarrant County jail until a bed becomes available at the mental health facility. Prosecutors raised no objections to state Judge Ruben Gonzalez's order, which was signed on Monday. Tsygankova has pleaded not guilty to charges of killing daughters Nika, 5, and Michaela, 1, at their Benbrook, Texas home. Kholodenko, 30, is a Ukrainian musician whose critically-acclaimed career took off after he won the gold medal at the 14th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2013. Police said that when the pianist arrived at his wife's home March 17 to pick up the girls and take them to preschool, he found Tsyganova covered in blood with cuts on her wrists and the two children dead in their beds. Tsygankova had visited a state mental health facility in Fort Worth a day before her daughters were found dead, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Inside the home, police found an empty prescription bottle of quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug used to treat such mental illnesses as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, the paper reported. Kholodenko resumed playing concerts a month after his girls were killed. \"In this time of extreme loss and sorrow, I must look to music which has been so important in my life, and through which I can express myself,\" he said in a statement. \"I ask those who will attend my concerts to also focus on the music. I continue to be grateful for those who are sending support from all over the world.\" Corky Siemaszko ",

    "text": "Prosecutor says Bill Cosby's lawyers are trying to intimidate 13 women who want to testify against him Bill Cosby Bill Cosby in court in Pennsylvania in September. Bill Cosby in court in Pennsylvania in September. (Matt Rourke / Associated Press) Steven Zeitchik Contact Reporter From the moment sexual assault charges were filed against Bill Cosby in December, the case became a touchstone for the dozens of other instances in which women say they were attacked by the entertainer. On Wednesday, with Cosby present, the issue of how to view those alleged victims exploded in court, as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued about how, when and whether many of those women should testify. \u201cThis is another attempt to intimidate\u201d victims, said the prosecutor, Montgomery County Dist. Atty. Kevin Steele. He was referring to the defense\u2019s decision to identify 13 purported Cosby victims whom Steele hopes to call as witnesses in the case involving the comedian and former Temple University employee Andrea Constand \u2014 and suggested the defense aimed to demonize the women or even scare them into not testifying. \u201cThis is all [about] trying to get at people,\u201d Steele said. A moment later, the lead defense lawyer, Brian McMonagle, responded with an equally pointed set of comments in defense of Cosby. Bill Cosby admitted he regularly bought Quaaludes for women he wanted to have sex with. Will a jury get to hear about it too? Lawyers in the Bill Cosby sexual assault case spent Tuesday morning arguing whether a deposition the comedian gave in a 2005 civil proceeding... Last year the public learned that Bill Cosby admitted he regularly bought Quaaludes for women he wanted to have sex with. Will a jury get to hear about it too? Lawyers in the Bill Cosby sexual assault case spent Tuesday morning arguing whether a deposition the comedian gave in a 2005 civil proceeding... (Steven Zeitchik) \u201cThis is a crucial time in this courthouse and criminal justice as a whole,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cPeople [once] had the presumption of innocence. But the pendulum has swung. I\u2019ve never seen the pendulum swing so far. We started with the rape shield law to introduce evidence of accusers \u2026 and now we\u2019re actually debating whether we can bring in 13 people who have nothing to do with Andrea Constand?\u201d At legal issue is whether the women can testify about their interactions with Cosby because, together, their stories form a pattern of behavior that reinforces the charges against the entertainer. Emotionally, however, there is more at stake. Many of the women who\u2019ve come forward have pinned their hopes on the Constand case, in which Cosby is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault over a 2004 incident in which he had sexual contact with Constand at his Pennsylvania home. Because nearly all their cases have exceeded the statue of limitations, they say, they hope this case can bring them vindication. McMonagle on Wednesday said he was suspicious of the other alleged victims because 10 of the 13 called to testify were represented by one lawyer, Gloria Allred. He suggested the women were on a witch hunt for his client, egged on by the outspoken attorney. \u201cI\u2019d like you to find out what\u2019s going on here,\u201d McMonagle said, addressing the judge. \u201cWhat might be wrong in Denmark.\u201d Sitting in the back of the courtroom, Allred stirred, then held an impromptu news\u00a0conference outside. \"It's not the first time I've been attacked by the defense,\" Allred said. \"I guess Mr. McMonagle is very concerned that these witnesses have representation. [He's] going to have put on their big-boy pants and deal with it.\u201d The judge in the case, Steven T. O\u2019Neill, will not rule until next month whether the 13 women can testify. But on Wednesday he set up a road map in which McMonagle will present a plan for O\u2019Neill to interview the women in chambers and, if O\u2019Neill agrees, talk to them before making a ruling. The decision is also being closely watched by victims\u2019 rights advocates, some of whom were in the courtroom Wednesday. O\u2019Neill will base his ruling on whether these women\u2019s stories indeed attest to a specific pattern and also whether their testimony would prejudice the jury. The prosecution\u2019s decision to pursue them is a bold stroke, and legal experts believe several outcomes are possible. One option is that the judge will whittle down the number that can testify. Another is that all of them will be excluded. The session Wednesday in this suburb north of Philadelphia concluded a two-day set of hearings in which lawyers for Cosby have attempted to get the charges dismissed \u2014 or, barring that, the evidence severely restricted. Defense attorneys this week also pleaded for the suppression of evidence gathered from a civil lawsuit in which Cosby admitted to buying drugs to have sex with women. They argued that their client testified in that case only because he thought he wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted criminally. Cosby\u2019s lawyers are also seeking to dismiss the case entirely on the premise that, by waiting 11 years to file charges, a key witness has died and Cosby has lost much of his eyesight, impeding a fair trial. \u201cHe is physically impaired,\u201d attorney\u00a0Angela Agrusa\u00a0said, as Cosby sat nearby with a walking stick at his side. \u201cWe can\u2019t test his memory\u00a0because he can\u2019t see,\u201d she said, noting that it would hamper Cosby\u2019s ability to counter evidence against him. O\u2019Neill, sounding skeptical, said equating fading vision with memory loss was \u201ca big leap.\u201d Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Falin countered Agrusa, saying the diagnosis was unconvincing. It\u2019s \"something you get when you walk out of LensCrafters\u2026. Is he really saying that he can\u2019t see a photo if it\u2019s held 6 inches from his face?\u201d Dressed in a green tweed suit and often led by the arm of an assistant, Cosby stood outside the courthouse with his attorneys for a news\u00a0conference. He didn\u2019t say much, but did give a small smile when a reporter asked how he was and then a \u201cthank you\u201d when someone told him he looked good.

Photo of Cubs fans during\u00a0the World Series games.\u00a0 Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune If you're expecting an epic Game 7 hangover, the Cubs have your back. The team tweeted out \"Super official excuse notes for EVERYONE!\" Wednesday in the form of a fill-in-the-blank letter asking that fans be excused from class, work or other responsibilities in order to watch the final World Series game. At the request of a fan, the Cubs tweeted out an updated note with the date crossed out and Thursday written in a nod to the citywide hangover that may make early mornings near-impossible for some people Thursday morning. \"The Chicago Cubs are playing Game 7 of the World Series, and if you're not familiar with sports narratives ... well, it's kind of a big deal,\" the letter reads. \"We need all the support we can muster up, and ______ has been an integral part of our fan base for ___ days/weeks/months/years, and we cannot #FlytheW without them.\" The letter goes on to promise \"a cute GIF tweeted at you.\" Followers who requested one were treated to clips of joyous Cubs team moments and more than a few shots of Anthony Rizzo's smile. Employees at Henson Consulting don't need the note to come in late Thursday. Kathleen Henson, founder and CEO, is pushing her office's start time to noon if the Cubs win and 10 a.m. if they lose. Henson said she made the decision after a brutally heavy commute to her downtown office from Wheaton this morning. She was later than usual, and figured her comrades stuck on the Eisenhower Expressway alongside her probably had been up late celebrating the Cubs Game 6 win as well. \"This is a big day in history,\" said Henson, who normally expects her employees at work at 8:30 a.m. She posted her plans on Facebook as a call to action for other employers to give their employees a late start as well. Her next petition, Henson said: If the Cubs win, she hopes the city can turn the river blue. ",

Throughout the city and suburbs, fans gathered in bars, community centers and neighbor's homes to see if a 108-year-dream would finally come true \u2014 or if they would find themselves, once again, waiting for next year. And with the region's attention fully focused on the North Side, malls emptied, streets cleared and restaurants closed early. Less than an hour before the first pitch, Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg \u2014 arguably the highest high temple of consumerism in the northwest suburbs \u2014 was virtually a ghost town. A few bands of teens stalked the promenades, and small knots of people meandered from store to store, but it was not a usual Wednesday night. \"This is so slow,\" guest service representative Luis Maldonado said. \"I'm sure it's the Cubs game.\" Cubs fans Game 7 Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune Four Dominican Sisters, who teach at St. Ignatius, borrow a \"W\" flag from two boys Wednesday and ask them to take their picture by Wrigley Field. Four Dominican Sisters, who teach at St. Ignatius, borrow a \"W\" flag from two boys Wednesday and ask them to take their picture by Wrigley Field. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) To be sure, the city has been enthralled with the Cubs for the past month as the team fought through 17 playoff games and gave its fan base countless thrills along with the occasional scare. Watch parties popped up in the most unlikely places: people's backyards, liquor stores and even on the South Side, where an enmity toward the North Side is a birthright. The West Pullman neighborhood on Chicago's South Side is White Sox territory, but the Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center mounted a massive screen in a meeting room where Cubs fans could gather. Only a few were there at the start of the game, but Dexter Fowler's leadoff home run quickly drew a crowd. \"All right, we got a home run already? Yes! Yes! Tee off! Tee off!\" said Darryl Wren, an IT specialist. Wren, wearing a personalized pinstriped jersey, said a Cubs victory would provide a big lift to both sides of town. \"It would be fantastic,\" he said. \"I think most of America is rooting for the Cubs and rightfully so. This would be pretty big. I'd put this up with the 1985 Bears.\" Game 7. World Series . \"I said I wanted to see the Cubs win the World Series before the good Lord takes me, so here I am with my grandson and my son,\" Tom Brown, 84, said as he rested beneath the Progressive Field marquee near the home plate gate. \"If we win, I can go...

(Patrick M. O'Connell) Back on the North Side, Cubs fans flocked to Wrigleyville to watch the game despite pouring rain, flashes of lightning and the team playing in Cleveland. Among the jubilant masses was Jim Griffin, who drove 81/2 hours from Memphis, Tenn., to watch the game with family members at Smoke Show, a neighborhood restaurant. A World Series title, Griffin said, would validate a lifetime of long suffering fandom. All those times when they were not in it, those games in July or August when they absolutely had no chance. \"I just had to be here with my friends and family, to be as close to the game as possible,\" he said. \"You can feel the energy and not even the rain is going to stop it.\" Over at Wrigley Field , Cecile Blot stood with a piece of blue chalk in her hand and tears in her eyes. She had joined hundreds of other fans in writing messages on the brick wall on the east side of the park. Her contribution: her father's name next to a heart. A lifelong Cubs fan, her father had died earlier this year and she flew in Wednesday morning from Washington, D.C., to make sure he was part of the celebration he didn't live long enough to see. \"It's kind of bittersweet,\" Blot said. \"He would have been really happy. The Cubs are playing so well, he would have been so excited.\" In Logan Square, clusters of people in Cubs gear smoked outside Whirlaway Lounge in a light rain while others posted up on stools at the bar to guarantee themselves prime real estate after 7 p.m. The bar is a popular spot to watch sports and an oasis of old-time tavern style in a neighborhood increasingly populated by $12 cocktails and farm-to-table restaurants.

(Mark Gonzales/Chicago Tribune) See more videos After throwing 20 pitches in Game 6 following his yeoman 2 2/3 inning outing in Game 5, the question is how much his arm can take without falling off. But Maddon has more trust in Chapman than anyone else in the bullpen, and Chapman wants the ball for that final out. Seems like a certainty at some point if Cubs have a late lead. Jon Lester Photos of Cubs starting pitcher Jon Lester. Possible Cy Young winner and their most consistent starter in the postseason. Helped save the season in his Game 5 start. \u00a0Has difficulties throwing to bases, so insertion of Lester may also have to involve insertion of Ross behind the plate to replace Willson Contreras.

Above, an AT&T store in New York City. Opponents of AT&T\u2019s deal to buy Time Warner said the collusion suit was another reason for regulators to reject\u00a0the deal. Above, an AT&T store in New York City. (Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images) Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporter AT&T Inc.\u2019s hopes of completing its $85.4-billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. depends on convincing federal regulators that they should\u00a0allow one of the nation\u2019s telecommunications giants to become even bigger. Getting hit with a collusion lawsuit doesn\u2019t help make that case, particularly for a deal that already has drawn bipartisan criticism,\u00a0antitrust experts and consumer advocates said.\u00a0 The Department of Justice on Wednesday sued AT&T\u2019s DirecTV unit, alleging it was \u201cthe\u00a0ringleader\u201d in unlawful efforts to prevent widespread carriage of the SportsNet LA television channel owned by the Los Angeles Dodgers.\u00a0 Making matter worse for AT&T, the Justice Department is the same agency that must review the Time Warner deal to make sure it passes antitrust muster. \u201cAll things being equal, you don\u2019t want to be sued by the DOJ when you\u2019re trying to get a merger approved by the DOJ,\u201d said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at digital rights group Public Knowledge. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u00a0helps them.\u201d But how much it might hurt\u00a0AT&T\u2019s attempt to acquire Time Warner Inc. was unclear. Although the suit names DirecTV and AT&T, the unlawful activity took place before AT&T completed its purchase of the satellite provider in July 2015. Los Angeles Dodgers fans have missed Clayton Kershaw \u2019s brilliant pitches. They also never got to watch\u00a0Vin Scully\u2019s emotional final season and a dominant march\u00a0to the playoffs. \u00a0 Now,\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice says that baseball fans were shut out\u00a0because... For three seasons, thousands of frustrated Los Angeles Dodgers fans have missed Clayton Kershaw \u2019s brilliant pitches. They also never got to watch\u00a0Vin Scully\u2019s emotional final season and a dominant march\u00a0to the playoffs. \u00a0 Now,\u00a0the U.S. Department of Justice says that baseball fans were shut out\u00a0because... (Meg James) AT&T was one of the pay-TV providers that the Justice Department said was part of the collusion. But the Time Warner deal is a\u00a0vertical integration\u00a0of companies that don\u2019t directly compete against one another instead of a horizontal merger with another pay-TV provider, which would raise additional collusion concerns. Time Warner spun off its Time Warner Cable unit in 2009. Charter Communications Inc.\u00a0bought Time Warner Cable last year and is renaming the service Spectrum. AT&T said the allegations regarding SportsNet LA shouldn\u2019t have any effect on regulatory approval of Time Warner. \u201cThis civil suit has nothing to do with our proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc.,\u201d said AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a Georgetown University law professor, said the Justice Department would review the deal on its own merits. But the collusion suit could have an impact \u201con the margins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt affects your judgment and your assessment if they have a track record of behaving anticompetitively,\u201d he said of Justice Department antitrust regulators. If the deal also must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission, which appears likely, the DirecTV suit could have a larger impact, Schwartzman said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at the broader effects on the marketplace,\u201d he said of the FCC. \u201cSomething like this underscores for the FCC some of the problems that are exacerbated if you increase AT&T\u2019s and Time Warner\u2019s collective clout in the marketplace.\u201d Concerns about increased media consolidation led the AT&T/Time Warner deal to get a frosty reception when it was announced last week. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said his administration would block the deal if he wins next week\u2019s election. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, said the merger raised \u201cquestions and concerns.\u201d\u00a0 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) called for a \u201crobust review.\u201d The panel\u2019s antitrust subcommittee has scheduled a hearing for Dec. 7. Opponents of AT&T\u2019s deal to buy Time Warner said the collusion suit was another reason for regulators to reject\u00a0the deal. \u201cAT&T and DirecTV had too much power over the pay-TV, Internet\u00a0and content markets even before their multibillion merger closed last year,\u201d said Matt Wood, policy director of Free Press, another digital rights group. Read the complaint against AT&T-DirecTV; Open link \u201cNow that they\u2019ve joined forces, the absolute last thing we need is approval of a deal to put these bad actors in control of Time Warner\u2019s video content empire,\u201d he said. Bergmayer said the collusion case \u201craises obvious concerns about whether AT&T would have the incentive and ability to harm consumers if it were permitted to acquire Time Warner.\u201d \u201cThe past behavior\u00a0of a company is relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying this by itself is the reason to block the merger. It\u2019s one more data point.\u201d Hours before the suit was announced, Public Knowledge, Free Press and 16 other digital rights, consumer advocacy and social justice organizations sent a letter to Clinton and Trump urging them to reject the deal because it would make AT&T too powerful. \u201cThere is little evidence that anyone \u2014 other than the executives and shareholders of the merging companies \u2014 benefits from these massive deals,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe recent history of media concentration is littered with broken promises and higher prices for customers.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the FBI would have to find to press charges against Hillary Clinton , Frank Gehry\u2019s controversial development is approved , two Des Moines officers were shot to death , and the Cubs push a game 7 of the World Series .

    "text": "Hulk Hogan Settles With Gawker for $31 Million By Linzie Janis Nov 2, 2016, 2:14 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Gawker Media Files for Bankruptcy to Block Hulk Hogan From Seizing Its Assets 0 Shares Email Hulk Hogan will settle all of his litigation with Gawker Media for $31 million with the possibility of more, ABC News has confirmed. Settlement documents filed at a New York federal bankruptcy court stipulate that Hogan, whose given name is Terry Bollea, will get $31 million plus share with other creditors 45 percent of any additional funds that come into the bankruptcy court by virtue of third-party claims brought by Gawker. Hogan's camp said in a statement: \"After almost five years of litigation all parties agreed it was time to resolve this matter. This will allow people to go about their lives and concentrate on things more important than continued court proceedings. As in any case involving negotiation all parties give-and-take. We would like to thank everyone involved in the process.\" In a blog post on the settlement, Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, wrote: \"After four years of litigation funded by a billionaire with a grudge going back even further, a settlement has been reached. The saga is over.\" PayPal Co-Founder Peter Thiel Admits to Bankrolling Hulk Hogan's Gawker Lawsuit This past March, a Florida jury awarded the former wrestler $140 million in damages after he sued the media company and its founder for invasion of privacy for publishing a portion of a sex tape that featured him. Immediately afterward, Gawker Media President and General Counsel Heather Dietrick said the jury was not privy to key facts and that she planned to file an appeal. In May, Hogan sued Gawker again, this time for intentional infliction of emotional distress, accusing the company of \"leaking a sealed transcript of surreptitiously recorded private oral communications in a bedroom to the media,\" court documents state. Hogan claimed in the lawsuit that in 2015, the National Enquirer published a transcript from a 2007 video in which he used a racial slur, and that the information was at least in part furnished by Gawker. As a result of the publication, Hogan was fired by his employer, the World Wrestling Entertainment, he claimed. Gawker released a statement at that time in response, calling the lawsuit \"ridiculous\" and denied it had leaked the transcript. Later that month, however, new light was shed on Hogan's litigious attitude toward Gawker, when PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel confirmed that he'd bankrolled the invasion of privacy lawsuit. Thiel, the subject of a 2007 article on the Gawker-owned website Valleywag entitled, \"Peter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People,\" told The New York Times that he wanted to protect those whom he felt had been unfairly targeted by Gawker. \u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.\u201d In an open letter to Thiel posted on Gawker.com in May, Denton called him \"twisted.\" \"Among the million posts published by Gawker and other properties since the company was founded, there have undoubtedly been occasions we overstepped the line. In offsetting the fawning coverage of tech luminaries and others, sometimes our stories swing too far for my taste toward snark,\" he wrote. \"But this vindictive decade-long campaign is quite out of proportion to the hurt you claim.\" In June, Gawker Media declared bankruptcy, and in August, a number of its websites, including Jezebel and Gizmodo, were acquired by Univision for a reported $135 million, though the deal did not include the group\u2019s flagship site, Gawker.com, which was shuttered. That same month, Denton filed for personal bankruptcy protection. In the blog posted today, Denton explained the reason for the settlement. \"Yes, we were confident the appeals court would reduce or eliminate the runaway Florida judgment against Gawker, the writer of the Hogan story and myself personally. And we expected to prevail in those other two lawsuits by clients of Charles Harder, the lawyer backed by Peter Thiel. \"But all-out legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight. The Valley billionaire, famously relentless, had committed publicly to support Hulk Hogan beyond the appeal and 'until his final victory.' Gawker\u2019s nemesis was not going away,\" Denton continued. \"For Thiel, an investor in Facebook and Palantir, the cost of this exercise is less than 1% of his net worth and a little additional notoriety. The other protagonists?\u2014?including Hulk Hogan and A.J. Daulerio, the author of the Gawker story about him?\u2014?had much more at stake. That motivated a settlement that allows us all to move on, and focus on activities more productive than endless litigation. Life is short, for most of us.\" 0 Shares ",

He defended Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee and his former secretary of state, as someone who is \"going to be a great president.\" \"I trust her. I know her. I wouldn't be supporting her if I didn't have absolute confidence in her integrity and her interest in making sure young people have a better future,\" Obama said. The FBI on Friday announced it is reviewing a new cache of emails potentially \"pertinent\" to the agency's suspended investigation into Clinton's use of a private server. Multiple federal sources told NBC News they were found as part of an ongoing probe into disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner's alleged sexting with an underage girl. President Barack Obama speaks at Capital University Field House in Columbus, Ohio, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Since then, officials have been poring through the missives found on Weiner's laptop to find only the relevant communiques using a program that will target only the emails to and from Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, Weiner's estranged wife, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state. Obama said that he's steered cleared of discussing the timing of the new FBI review. \"I've made a very deliberate effort to make sure that I don't look like I'm meddling in what are supposed to be independent processes for making these assessments,\" he said.

(Photo: Jonathan Daniel, Getty Images) The Justice Department is suing AT&T and its satellite TV service DirecTV for unlawfully colluding with competitors Cox and Charter Communications about carrying\u00a0SportsNet LA, a Los Angeles Dodgers-owned TV channel. In its lawsuit filed in\u00a0the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the department alleges that DirecTV \u2014 in 2014 before it was purchased by AT&T in 2014 and approved last year \u2014unlawfully shared competitively-sensitive information with AT&T, Cox and Charter during those companies' negotiations with SportsNet LA, which has the exclusive rights to nearly all live Dodger telecasts in the L.A area. The companies shared information about their plans of whether to carry the channel, the DOJ says in the complaint, to obtain bargaining leverage. DirecTV was the \"ringleader\" in the sharing of information that became \"a material factor\" in the companies' decisions not to carry the channel, the complaint says.\u00a0Since then Charter\u00a0has added the Dodgers Channel, but the other providers have not. AT&T-Time Warner deal could spur more mergers, scrutiny \"Dodgers fans were denied a fair competitive process when DirecTV orchestrated a series of information exchanges with direct competitors that ultimately made consumers less likely to be able to watch their hometown team,\" said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Sallet of the DOJ's antitrust division in a statement. \u00a0\u201cCompetition, not collusion, best serves consumers and that is especially true when, as with pay-television providers, consumers have only a handful of choices in the marketplace.\u201d Stan Kasten, president and CEO of the Dodgers, called the allegations \"shocking but not surprising,\" in a statement posted to Twitter . Time Warner Cable, acquired in 2015 by Charter, paid the Dodgers $8.35 billion in 2013 for the rights to games for 25 years. When SportsNet LA launched in 2014, many satellite and cable providers balked at what they considered high fees to carry the channel. The sharing of information\u00a0\"made it less likely that any of these companies would reach a deal\" because each knew the competition was unlikely to begin carrying the channel, the complaint says. Should DirecTV, especially, decide to carry SportsNet LA, the other companies would feel forced to, to prevent subscriber defections, the suit says. But AT&T General Counsel David McAtee said the company sees \"the fact differently,\" he said in a statement released after the DOJ complaint was announced. \"The reason why no other major TV provider chose to carry this content was that no one wanted to force all of their customers to pay the inflated prices that Time Warner Cable was demanding for a channel devoted solely to LA Dodgers baseball. \u00a0We make our carriage decisions independently, legally and only after thorough negotiations with the content owner. We look forward to presenting these facts in court.\u201d Also, DirecTV has said, Time Warner Cable\u00a0wanted the channel carried on the pay TV services standard tier \u2014 not as an option. Estimates by research firm SNL Kagan indicate that SportsNet LA costs were higher than some, but lower than others. Pay-TV providers would have to pay an average monthly subscriber fee of $4.06 for SportsNet LA versus $2.83 for YES Network, which broadcasts the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Nets, and $4.55 for MSG Network (New York Knicks, Rangers and Islanders, New Jersey Devils). It compares to\u00a0top basic cable channels such as ESPN ($7.21) and TNT ($1.82), Kagan estimates. 'Good news' for baseball fans The case complicates issues for AT&T, which two weeks ago announced its $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner . (Time Warner includes CNN, Warner Bros. Studio and HBO; it spun off Time Warner Cable in 2009.) Since that deal will require DOJ approval, AT&T will likely settle this suit, says\u00a0Phil Swann, president of TVPredictions.com . \"There is no way that AT&T will allow the Justice Department attorneys to begin merger consideration with this lawsuit pending,\" he said. That's good news for baseball fans, he says. The settlement will likely include SportsNet LA on DirecTV and AT&T's U-Verse next season. Follow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider ",

    "text": "By Katie Zezima November 2 at 2:30 PM Follow @katiezez MATTAWAMKEAG, Maine \u2014 The regulars at Bob & Tom\u2019s Gun Shop spend hours here fiddling with firearms, sipping coffee and making small talk \u2014 chatter that now focuses on fighting an initiative that would require universal background checks for nearly all gun purchases in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s honest gun country here,\u201d said Bud McLaughlin of Medway, Maine, who brought his 12-gauge shotgun into the shop, which is filled to the brim with rifles, shotguns, handguns, semiautomatic weapons and boxes of ammunition. Two rolls of toilet paper \u2014 one bearing the face of President Obama, the other of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 hang from a shotgun that dangles from the ceiling. \u201cOnce they start getting their fingers into the gun laws, it\u2019s the first of the bullcrap that\u2019s going to start,\u201d he said. But McLaughlin and his friends are likely to be disappointed on Tuesday. Voters here and in Nevada are poised to approve background checks for almost all private sales and transfers of guns. The ballot initiatives seek to close a loophole in federal law that exempts private sales \u2014 such as those online or at gun shows \u2014 from comprehensive checks. In California and Washington state, which have already closed the loophole, voters are being asked to take gun control a step further. Washington will vote on whether to allow family members to seek a temporary order barring a person from having a gun if the person is determined to pose a risk to themselves or others. In California, residents will be asked whether they want to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines and require background checks for ammunition purchases. The sign outside Bob & Tom's gun shop in Mattawamkeag and a show of support for defeating a ballot initiative to require background checks for firearm sales in Maine. (Katie Zezima/The Washington Post) The four measures are part of a state-focused approach that gun-control advocates have adopted in the wake of repeated losses in Congress \u2014 a strategy reminiscent of the one pursued by same-sex marriage advocates beginning a decade ago. In Maine and Nevada, the legislatures passed background check bills that were vetoed by Republican governors, while California and Washington have already shown strong popular support for gun-safety rules. \u201cIn the wake of Congress\u2019s failure . . . we decided to take a state-by-state approach,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group backed by billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cIn many ways we were borrowing a page from the marriage equality movement.\u201d Everytown has poured $13.3\u00a0million into Nevada, $4.6\u00a0million into Maine and $550,000 into Washington; it has not put any money toward the California initiative. The National Rifle Association has spent millions to oppose the initiatives, while also spending money in battleground states to help GOP Senate candidates and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Proponents of the measures \u00adargue that universal background checks are needed to keep guns out of the hands of people who might fail a check but could still obtain a gun through the loophole. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia require background checks for some types of firearm purchases. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to protect the Second Amendment, by keeping guns away from knuckleheads who are going to make the rest of us gun owners look bad,\u201d said Nick Wilson, executive director of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition. In Nevada, gun-control advocates have butted up against a potent force: the state\u2019s law enforcement community. Sixteen of Nevada\u2019s 17 sheriffs have come out against the ballot measure, as have Gov. Brian Sandoval and Attorney General Adam Laxalt, both Republicans. Many in Nevada law enforcement said they don\u2019t agree with language in the measure that requires a background check for the transfer of any gun at any time, requiring both people to go to a licensed firearms dealer before it can be exchanged. The measure exempts some temporary gun transfers, such as while hunting and during organized contests, from this requirement. Chuck Allen, the sheriff of Washoe County, said he and others believe the requirement will create more work for stretched law enforcement agencies that would have to spend time making sure transfers were done legally. The Maine provision has exemptions for shooting ranges, competitions and transfers while hunting or trapping. Robert Uithoven, who is spearheading the NRA\u2019s effort in Nevada, said the Nevada measure \u201cwould make illegal the common activities of people throughout the West and particularly in Nevada who are ordinary, law-abiding citizens. Transferring firearms, perhaps between cousins and good friends while going out recreating, shooting . . . those everyday common practices in Nevada would be illegal.\u201d A Las Vegas Review-Journal poll conducted in late October shows that 54\u00a0percent of Nevadans surveyed support the background check question, with 38\u00a0percent opposing. Mark Prentice, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun-control group founded by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in 2011, and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, said that there is an appetite for change in states including Nevada. Prentice and other gun-control advocates said they see education as a large part of their push. Many people, he said, don\u2019t know that the loophole exists. Giffords and Kelly have embarked on a 42-day, 16-state bus tour to push for gun control. The couple has been to Maine and Washington and plans to visit Nevada before Tuesday. In Maine, a Portland Press-Herald poll conducted in late September showed that 61 percent of respondents support the background check measure, with 33\u00a0percent opposing. \u201cThe public is fed up with the inability for politicians to take \u00adaction,\u201d said David Farmer, who works for Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership. The group said it has 1,500 volunteers canvassing in the more-liberal population centers of South Portland, Brunswick and Orono and has spent thousands on ads. But at the gun shop here in rural Mattawamkeag \u2014 about 60 miles north of Bangor and west of the Canadian border \u2014 owner Bob Berg sat behind the counter of his shop, boxes of ammunition stacked behind him and a sign reading \u201cGuns left at own risk\u201d tacked to a plywood wall next to an array of handguns. He said he doesn\u2019t want outside interests controlling his state. \u201cIt\u2019s not what Maine needs,\u201d he said of the expanded background checks. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Outside the Santa Clara County registrar of voters office last month. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) David Lauter Contact Reporter Charles Franklin is hardly a household name, but for a few minutes Wednesday, the full spotlight of the 2016 presidential campaign focused on the veteran pollster and political scientist as he unveiled the latest results from his closely followed poll of Wisconsin voters. When he announced the verdict: Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump 46%-40% \u2014\u00a0almost identical to the margin the poll had found in early October \u2014 sighs of relief from Democratic activists could be heard from Brooklyn to Santa Monica.\u00a0 For Democrats , who, as a tribe, seem more inclined to election-season\u00a0night terrors than their Republican foes, these are anxious days. After the final presidential debate last month, they had begun to pinch themselves and talk of landslides. No more. In recent days, once high-flying polls for Clinton have come back to earth. Indeed, in an ironic\u00a0\u2014\u00a0yet, in hindsight, predictable \u2014 fashion, the 2016 campaign, after all the controversy and twists, is ending in a familiar way, almost identical to the last days of the race four years ago. The Democratic nominee is moving down the final stretch with a small lead while the Republican scrambles to find a way to flip blue states. That scenario is testimony to the tremendous pull that partisanship exerts over presidential elections, almost regardless of the specifics of the candidates. In a closely divided country, it means yet another contest that will leave many voters feeling whiplash. Even though far fewer polls have been conducted this year than in the last election, social media has made them more available and ubiquitous than ever. News headlines highlight the variations from one survey to the next \u2014 the inevitable product of the laws of probability \u2014\u00a0driving many voters to distraction as they check Twitter for the latest bulletin. But interviews with leading pollsters in both parties Wednesday found widespread agreement on several points: Although Trump seems all but certain to perform better with blue-collar\u00a0white voters than Mitt Romney did four years ago, those gains are being offset by losses among suburban, college-educated voters, especially women. The lineup of states may shift slightly from 2012 \u2014\u00a0Clinton may win North Carolina, which President Obama lost, but lose Ohio, which Obama carried \u2014\u00a0but Trump, so far, has not been able to break the Democrats\u2019 hold on the states they need for an\u00a0electoral majority.\u00a0 Last Friday\u2019s news from FBI Director James B. Comey that agents would\u00a0be examining additional emails that may be related to Clinton has had a small, but mostly transient, influence on the race. And Clinton holds\u00a0a lead roughly similar to Obama\u2019s 4-point margin of victory from four years ago. How to get to 270 electoral votes \u00bb Some polls, of course, continue to show a path to victory for Trump. A tracking poll by ABC and the Washington Post , which last week showed Clinton holding a double-digit lead, now finds her and Trump tied at\u00a046%. And the USC/Los Angeles Times \u201cDaybreak\u201d tracking poll , which has consistently shown a better result for Trump than most other surveys, gave him a 5-point lead, 47.8% to 42.4%. In both parties, however, experienced pollsters don\u2019t see the race that way. Neil Newhouse, who served as Romney\u2019s\u00a0chief pollster four years ago, said Comey\u2019s news \u201cput the brakes\u201d on what was starting to look like a runaway victory for Clinton, but that she was still ahead by 2 to 4 percentage points. \u201cHillary is still likely to win,\u201d Newhouse said, even if that means \u201climping across the finish line.\u201d\u00a0 On the Democratic side, Anna Greenberg, whose firm polls for many of the party\u2019s Senate and congressional candidates, called the race \u201cpretty stable.\u201d \u201cThere has been narrowing, which was to be expected. Trump was always going to consolidate more Republicans, and I don't think Clinton was ever going to win by 10 to 12 points\u201d \u2014\u00a0as some surveys had shown in the days after the final presidential debate Oct. 19 \u2014\u00a0she said. The big impact of a tighter race, she and Republican pollsters said, could be to improve the chances of Republicans in down-ballot races by encouraging GOP turnout. Indeed,\u00a0 the Wisconsin poll, released by Marquette University Law School , found that the Senate race between Republican incumbent Ron Johnson and former Sen. Russ Feingold had narrowed to a near tie. Other Senate races, such as those in North Carolina, Indiana and Missouri, also appear headed to extremely close finishes, with control of the chamber up for grabs .\u00a0 ",

The latest numbers from the CNN/ORC poll shows Trump taking a slight lead in Nevada, with 49 percent support from likely voters compared to Clinton's 43 percent. That marks an increase in his support since early October, when Clinton had 46 percent support and Trump had 44 percent in the state. In Arizona, Trump has 49 percent support and Clinton has 44 percent, though that is within the margin of error of polling. Clinton's support in Arizona has grown since the last poll, in which Trump was still leading by 7 points. Trump Rated More Honest; Contest Stays a Dead Heat (POLL) The results in Florida and Pennsylvania also came within the polling margin of error, with Clinton receiving 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent in Florida and Clinton receiving 48 percent to Trump's 44 percent in Pennsylvania. These four states are crucial to the electoral map and the candidates have been spending serious time and money to win over undecided voters there in recent days. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is down from his previous results in all four states, with his highest results coming in Arizona and Nevada, where he received five percentage points apiece. In a mid-August CNN/ORC poll, Johnson received 12 percent of the vote in Arizona. ABC News' Ryan Struyk contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top Photo Chicago\u2019s Kris Bryant smiled after scoring on a sacrifice fly ball in the fourth inning. Credit Ezra Shaw/Getty Images A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor\u2019s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor\u2019s foot may not have been on the bag. That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez. Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis\u2019s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop. David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders. Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs\u2019 worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs\u2019 fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I. Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive Photo Cleveland\u2019s Coco Crisp hit a double in the third inning. He later would score a run. Credit Ken Blaze/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners. Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game. With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat. Victor Mather: It\u2019s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it. David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up. It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky. Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning Photo Chicago\u2019s Kyle Schwarber was tagged out by Cleveland\u2019s Francisco Lindor while trying to stretch a single into a double in the third inning. Credit Ken Blaze/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning. Victor Mather: Maybe you aren\u2019t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron. David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench. Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself Photo Cleveland\u2019s Jose Ramirez was picked off at first base by Chicago\u2019s Anthony Rizzo off a throw from pitcher Kyle Hendricks in the second inning. Credit Charles Leclaire/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it. Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks\u2019 ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis\u2019s speed. David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall\u2019s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out. The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs\u2019 batters getting warmed up in this weather. Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In Photo Cleveland\u2019s Lonnie Chisenhall made a catch on a fly ball hit by Chicago\u2019s Willson Contreras in the second inning. Credit Matt Slocum/Associated Press Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop. David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it\u2019s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even. Bottom of 1st: Indians Can\u2019t Match Cubs\u2019 Start Photo Cleveland\u2019s Mike Napoli broke his bat connecting on a pitch in the first inning. Credit David Richard/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Indians were not able to match the Cubs\u2019 strong start to the game. Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks\u2019s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning. Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs. David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \u201cMy bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\u201d he said. Too much info? Advertisement Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One Photo Chicago\u2019s Dexter Fowler celebrated his solo home run in the first inning. Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland\u2019s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series. After Fowler\u2019s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single. Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning. Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for. David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans. Here\u2019s What to Expect in Game 7 Photo A fan dressed as a goat wandered around outside Progressive Field in Cleveland before Game 7. Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press.. \u25a0 The Cubs\u2019 Kyle Hendricks will face off against Indians ace Corey Kluber. While Hendricks, who led the majors in earned run average, is no pushover, Kluber won Games 1 and 4 and will be attempting to become just the 13th pitcher to earn three victories in a single World Series . The last to do it was Randy Johnson with the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, but one of Johnson\u2019s wins came as a reliever. The last player to win three World Series starts was Mickey Lolich, who did it for the 1968 Detroit Tigers. \u25a0 The Cubs have struggled to hit through must of the series, but Kris Bryant, the team\u2019s best hitter, has found a groove. He homered in Game 5 and then went 4 for 5 with another home run in Game 6. The surge has helped all the hitters around him, as Cleveland finally has someone to fear. Should the Cubs win Game 7, Bryant would be a potential M.V.P. candidate. \u25a0 Outfield miscommunication was a huge issue for Cleveland in Game 6 , with a brutal misplay costing the Indians two runs in the first inning. It continued after the game with center fielder Tyler Naquin claiming both players called for the ball and right-fielder Lonnie Chisenhall saying neither did. Tonight, the Indians will start the veteran Rajai Davis, bringing some much-needed experience to the outfield. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u25a0 Both managers have extreme faith in their closers, but Francona appears to have a bullpen advantage in Game 7 as a result of not using Andrew Miller or Cody Allen in the Game 6 blowout. Desperate to stay alive at all costs in that game, Joe Maddon endured some criticism for letting closer Aroldis Chapman throw 20 pitches to get four outs in a game that was never close. He insisted after the game that it would not affect Chapman\u2019s availability tonight. \u25a0 Weather could be an issue. According to The Weather Channel, the chance of precipitation increases steadily throughout the game, going from 5 percent at 8 p.m. to 15 percent at 9 a.m., 25 percent at 10 p.m. and 55 percent at 11 p.m. As rain-shortened games are not permitted in the postseason, the game has to go all nine innings. Considering the slow the pace of play for much of the postseason, a rain delay is certainly possible. \u25a0 This is the first Game 7 since 2014, when the Giants beat the Royals in a taut encounter that featured a rare five-inning save by Madison Bumgarner. In 2011, the Cardinals rallied from a 2-0 first inning deficit to beat the Rangers, 6-2. Before that, you have to go back to 2002, when the Angels won their only World Series with a 4-1 win over the Giants. Cubs Fans Invade Cleveland Photo Kristin Cisek, left, and Mike Crittendon wrote messages on the wall outside Wrigley Field before Game 7. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times Once again, the weather in Cleveland is a summery 69 degrees and thousands of nervous baseball fans have been roaming the streets of downtown in anticipation of a historic Game 7. Progressive Field is overrun with Cubs fans. I spoke to a few who drove in today from Chicago and said that I-90 was saturated with vehicles full of Cubs fans making the five-and-a-half hour drive across Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. They said the rest stops were swarming with Cubs fans high-fiving one another. The scene is set, batting practice is over, and in only a few minutes the game of the century will begin. Someone\u2019s long, agonizing history will change within the next three or four hours, and someone else\u2019s will trudge on as it has for decades. ",

Donald Trump speaks in Charlotte on Oct. 26, 2016. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) My fellow Americans, early in my campaign for the Republican nomination for president, I was asked by a reporter whether I had ever felt the need to ask for God\u2019s forgiveness . I responded by saying I didn\u2019t think I ever had. That was a stupid thing for anyone to say \u2014 but especially me! I\u2019ve now concluded I not only need to seek God\u2019s forgiveness for many things, I also need to ask for forgiveness from so many others. But let me start with God. I\u2019ve said that his book \u2014 the Bible \u2014 is the greatest book I\u2019ve ever read; yet I\u2019ve largely ignored what it teaches us about pride. God hates pride. The New Testament says, \u201cGod opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble \u201d (James 4:6). Without a doubt, my life has been marked more by pride than by humility. I have come to the realization that everything I have or have accomplished is because of God \u2014 for it is he who blesses us with intelligence, health and the ability to make wealth. Today, I publicly confess my pride and ask for God\u2019s forgiveness. I also confess that I have, far too often, used language better associated with a construction site than with the White House \u2014 or any house. I am not proud of much of the language I have used, and I apologize to Americans everywhere \u2014 especially to young people who should be able to look up to anyone running for president. I commit to no longer speak in a way that would diminish the dignity that the office of president rightly merits. America deserves better. Next, I want to apologize to reporter Serge Kovaleski for publicly mocking your physical disability. I showed tremendous disrespect to you and the millions of Americans living with a disability of one kind or another. I wish I could take it back and hope you will forgive me. I\u2019m sorry. Sen. John\u00a0McCain, I\u2019m sorry for disparaging your service to our country by mocking your capture. I was wrong and offer no excuse for it. I know I\u2019m late, but I\u2019m asking you to forgive me. What you sacrificed for our nation and my freedom is beyond heroic,\u00a0and I salute you, sir! The GOP may not survive the Trump takeover: Max Boot Megyn Kelly, I apologize for calling you names and mistreating you; please forgive me. I realize that you, along with thousands of men and women who choose to be reporters, are just trying to do your job. In putting myself forward to run for president, I should have been more respectful of you and all those trying to provide the public with information and insight on this important campaign. I\u2019m sorry I mistreated you; I\u2019m sorry I have repeatedly called the press such ugly names. I have been to parts of the world that don\u2019t have a free press, and I am thankful for our system. I also recognize I was blessed with hundreds of millions of dollars of media attention I didn\u2019t have to pay for, so I certainly should not protest every story I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m sorry I treated Jeb Bush so poorly during the primaries. Jeb, you and your family have an admirable record of public service to our nation, and I apologize for calling you names and not showing you the respect you deserve. Please forgive me \u2014 you would have been a fine president. I\u2019m sorry for things I said about most of my Republican primary opponents \u2014 Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and others. Just because politics is a contact sport is no excuse for behaving the way I have far too often. These men and women might\u00a0have been political adversaries \u2014 but they are also people, people who sacrificed much to seek the same office I now seek, and all people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. I don\u2019t deserve their forgiveness, but I\u2019m humbly asking for it. Mitt Romney, I now know just how hard it is to run for president \u2014 and you did it twice! Please forgive me for calling you a loser and a choke artist \u2014 two labels many will no doubt place on me, should I be unsuccessful on Election Day. You, sir, exemplify class, dignity, character, integrity and faith. You are a national model of a good husband, father and grandfather. Frankly, I\u2019m sorry we aren\u2019t all working for your re-election this year! Then, I want to apologize to the people of Mexico for painting an entire nation with the kind of broad-brush stereotype that has no place in political discourse \u2014 or modern life, for that matter. I\u2019m sorry, and win or lose, I hope to earn your respect and trust. That anyone from Mexico \u2014 or any other country \u2014 would risk everything to seek the kind of opportunity and freedom this land has to offer is a tribute to America, and those who pursue it should not be disparaged. From now on, I will discuss and debate policy without ascribing negative labels or cheap stereotypes to those most affected by it. I must also apologize to the loving parents of a slain Muslim-American soldier. Just because Khizr and Ghazala Khan \u00a0appeared at the Democratic convention in support of my opponent does not mean they are not deserving of my utmost respect and appreciation for their son\u2019s sacrifice to protect the freedoms I enjoy every day. Mr. and Mrs. Khan, I take my hat off to you, and all of our Gold Star families \u2014 regardless of political affiliation \u2014 and respectfully ask for your forgiveness. It\u2019s past time to apologize for demeaning women as I clearly have by talking about them as objects to be exploited for personal pleasure. This behavior should not be dismissed as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d It is vulgar and reprehensible, and has no place in public or private life. I\u2019m ashamed and I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t expect forgiveness for this one, but I\u2019ll ask anyway. I owe Alicia Machado a public apology as well; please forgive me for judging any woman by her physical appearance or weight, rather than by her inner spirit and heart. I\u2019m sorry, Alicia. Right message, horribly wrong messenger: Linda Killian Throughout this campaign many of my surrogates, staff members and supporters have tried to explain my hurtful words and often mean-spirited behavior by saying things like, \u201cHe\u2019s not a trained politician; he\u2019s not politically correct; he just says what\u2019s on his mind.\u201d Or, \u201cHe\u2019s a counter puncher; he just hits back when someone hits him first.\u201d None of us would accept these excuses from our children or co-workers, and you should not accept them from or on behalf of me. So, I also want to apologize to all of these folks who have sacrificed personal reputation and credibility in their efforts to make excuses for behavior of mine that was simply inexcusable. While much of my own behavior and speech have\u00a0had many defenders, I must be honest \u2014 it simply has no defense. I especially apologize to the many evangelical leaders who defended and promoted me against their own moral and biblical convictions and beliefs about character, for I have no doubt cost you much moral authority in future elections. Secretary Hillary Clinton, I want to apologize for calling you names and inciting hatred toward you and your husband. Our political differences are many, but you have given your life to public service, and that is still a noble calling. If I win, I will want your help. If you win, you can count on my support. America deserves our cooperation. My candidacy for this nomination was launched, and succeeded, in response to deep-seated anger from people across this land \u2014 people who believe their government has been taken from them and no longer serves and protects them. I was upset when many of these people supporting me were referred to as deplorables\u00a0\u2014 yet I recognize now, I am the one who has been deplorable. I\u2019m sorry! POLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0 look at race, justice, media I realize that the best way to make America great again is to appeal to our collective better angels, not to our shrillest tones and most divisive words. For nearly 70 years I\u2019ve been blessed far beyond anything I could have imagined, and certainly beyond anything I deserve. I want to now give back and serve the country that has provided so much opportunity and blessing for me. I want to serve in a way befitting of the office I seek in the land that is still the greatest on earth. Finally, I fully expect many people to be skeptical of these apologies and appeals for forgiveness \u2014 after all, I\u2019m trailing nationally in the final weeks of a presidential campaign. I understand such skepticism and have no doubt my sincerity will be questioned across this country. Believe me, I am well aware that my own actions in the days and weeks ahead will have to prove my sincerity, and I intend to work hard to earn the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019ll let you be the judge. This much I know \u2014 win or lose, apologizing and asking forgiveness is the right thing to do and I\u2019ll be better for it. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless America. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Photo: Charlie Riedel, AP) The Lovable Losers Regardless of the outcome of\u00a0Wednesday night's Game 7 of the World Series, the Chicago Cubs are going to lose \u2014 either the championship or their mystique. \u00a0They will suffer a painful defeat against the Cleveland Indians, or surrender the Lovable Loser label that has defined and united their fan base. It\u2019s something Boston Red Sox fans experienced in 2004, when the Red Sox won their first World Series title in 86 years. It\u2019s something the Chicago White Sox experienced in 2005, when the White Sox won their first World Series championship in 88 years. Although Red Sox fans and White Sox fans might deny it, the victory stripped them of a yearning that had enriched their lives and gave them a special identity. After 108 years, Cubs fans will gladly give up the moniker without knowing what they\u2019re in danger of learning \u2014 the sweetest of victories comes at a cost. Posted!

According to the New York Daily News , the machine on which Bookman was playing flashed $42,949,642.76 and read \u201cPrinting cash ticket.\u201d The excited mother-of-four thought she had won nearly $43 million and took a selfie video next to the machine. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Bookman told the Daily News. \u201cMy body went numb.\u201d But instead of being able to collect her reported winnings immediately, Bookman says she was escorted off the floor by Resorts World employees and told to come back the next day. Woman denied $43 million jackpot at casino, gets steak dinner instead https://t.co/MApyucFjH4 \u2014 FOX31 Denver KDVR (@KDVR) November 2, 2016 When she returned to the casino Bookman recalled \"I said what did I win? (casino rep said) You didn't win nothing,\" reports ABC. The only prize the casino offered her was a steak dinner. Representatives from the New York State Gaming Commission (which run the Queens gaming facility) were called in to tell Bookman that the machine had malfunctioned, and she was not entitled to a payout. According to the commission and the casino, any malfunction makes the game-- and any jackpot-- null and void. The slot machine was pulled from the casino floor and fixed after the incident. TRUMP'S TAJ MAHAL CASINO CLOSING AFTER 26 YEARS \u201cThere was nothing wrong with it when I was playing the machine,\u201d Bookman said. \u201cHow do we know when there\u2019s a problem with it? Once I hit something, now you\u2019re going to say it\u2019s a problem. I totally don\u2019t think that was fair.\u201d But a spokesman for Resorts World told FoxNews.com that the near $43 million figure flashed on the screen doesn\u2019t tell the full story. The machine on which Bookman was playing has a maximum payout of $6,500, which the casino says is clearly advertised. The casino also claims that before any notifications of a larger prize appeared, Bookman first printed a ticket from the machine for $2.25. The much larger figure only appeared later, after she had finished putting money into the slot. \"Upon being notified of the situation, casino personnel were able to determine that the figure displayed on the penny slot was the result of an obvious malfunction - a fact later confirmed by the New York State Gaming Commission,\u201d said a Resorts World spokesman in a statement to FoxNews.com. \u201cAfter explaining the circumstances to Ms. Bookman, we offered to pay her the correct amount that was shown on the printed ticket. Machine malfunctions are rare, and we would like to extend our apologies to Ms. Bookman for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d According to Resort World, the highest slot jackpot ever recorded in any casino is $39.7 million-- and that was in a multi-property, progressive jackpot game. Still, the Queens casino, which has over 3,000 slot games, says it pays out over $50 million daily to individual winners. FREE BOOZE HURTING LAS VEGAS CASINOS? But Bookman believes she was wronged and plans to sue the casino. \u201cShe\u2019s upset obviously,\u201d Alan Ripka, Bookman's attorney, told the Daily News. \u201cShe thought her life and family\u2019s life would have been changed forever.\u201d Ripka said he believes the casino should honor the advertised payout but Resort Worlds says that would be against New York state law gaming regulations\u2014thus the steak dinner was offered. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Ripka said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying that the machine was broken. Doesn\u2019t that mean a place can claim a machine is broken every time somebody wins?\u201d\u00a0 On Wednesday, a spokesman for Resorts World would not confirm whether a lawsuit had been served. Alan Ripka was not immediately available for comment.\u00a0 ",

    "text": "By Laura Strickler CBS News November 2, 2016, 1:26 PM What women who worked for Donald Trump have to say about him Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump walks into a phone bank before a campaign rally in Greeley, Colorado, U.S. October 30, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Carlo Allegri - RTX2R3ZU Email \u201cI have huge respect for the Trump family,\u201d said Jaclyn Groenen, a mom who used to work for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, \u201cbut I hate to tell you that because I don\u2019t think he should be president,\u201d she said. From 2006 to 2008, Groenen ran a merchandise store in Trump Tower. She said she dealt with Trump and his children, and she found them to be both respectful and hard workers, regularly starting their day with 7:30am meetings. Although she said she\u2019s going to support Hillary Clinton for the presidency, she says working for Trump, in part, got her to her most recent job as a buyer for a major department store. A new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Donald Trump edging ahead of Hillary Clinton with a one point lead nationally. CBS News senior politica... Groenen is one of 84 women CBS News tracked down around the country who worked for the Trump Organization at some point in the last 35 years, ranging from interns to executives. \u00a0 Most women we reached out to didn\u2019t want to talk.\u00a0 Forty-three did not respond, and another 19 said they would not comment on their experiences -- positive or negative -- on or off the record.\u00a0 Four said the experience was too short to form an opinion.\u00a0 But 19 women did speak to CBS News about their experiences, and they paint a mixed picture of what it was like to be a female employee in the Trump Organization. \u00a0Most of the women spoke positively about their time there, and almost all said that having the name Trump on their resume had been a boost to their careers. At the same time, several described a culture where women were judged and promoted, at least in part, based on their looks. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. However, the Republican nominee has said more than once during the campaign, \u201cNobody has more respect for women than I do.\u201d In a 2008 interview with CBS News about women in the workplace, Trump praised the women he\u2019s hired over the years. \u201cWomen are doing very, very well in my company and in virtually all companies. They\u2019re tough, they\u2019re smart, they\u2019re competitive \u2013 they really are a force,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they talk about the glass ceiling -- I believe they\u2019ve broken that glass ceiling many, many times over.\u201d Joanne Blank, former employee of the Trump Organization Photo provided by Joanne Blank Throughout the 1990\u2019s Joanne Blank was one of the first woman-owned certified businesses in the state of New York. Blank says that Trump contracted with her\u00a0company to manage vendors and contracts on Trump\u2019s construction and renovation projects.\u00a0 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only hotshot I worked for, but he was a damn good one,\u201d Blank told CBS News.\u00a0 She said she interacted with him regularly and recalled a night when she needed to be at a function for one of her children and asked Trump for permission to arrive the following morning for a key meeting, instead of traveling the night before.\u00a0 She said she appreciated that he had no problem with that.\u00a0 Blank says the Billy Bush tape wasn\u2019t appropriate but said, \u201cI heard him yell and scream, but I never heard him call anyone a bimbo.\u00a0 I never heard him demean anyone,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Alexis Poe Feder, former Trump employee, undated photo LinkedIn profile Alexis Poe Feder, 44, says she was hired at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City right out of college in 1997 and \u201cfelt very empowered when I worked there.\u201d Feder says the story she always tells about working there is the day she got a call that Trump was coming to the property and that she needed to come immediately to the front desk because, \u201cTrump likes to have blondes at the front desk, attractive people.\u201d She says now as someone in the hospitality industry she understands that because, \u201cYou don\u2019t want ugly people.\u201d A human resources manager who worked in Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos shared this view. \u201cEveryone wants beautiful people,\u201d Christine Schrader said. She worked for Trump from 1992 through 2000 and says this practice is no different than any other hospitality company for which she has worked.\u00a0 Jodi Wladyka briefly worked in 2008 for a Trump project in Long Island to build a new catering hall on Jones Beach. The town objected to the project and it later went under. Wladyka said in her multiple construction jobs throughout her career she has encountered male-dominated atmospheres.\u00a0 Was this environment any different?\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve worked for worse,\u201d she said, \u201cOh God, yeah, it wasn\u2019t bad at all.\u201d Like most of the women we spoke to, Samantha Elias, a young entrepreneur in New York, praised Trump\u2019s children.\u00a0 Elias interned at Trump Tower in 2010 and said she worked primarily for\u00a0 Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka .\u00a0 She said Trump\u2019s oldest daughter was \u201cextremely kind, gracious and poised.\u201d She said when she started her first pop-up store on 34th St. she invited Ivanka to the opening and was shocked and appreciative when she showed up. Joanne Silver-Sparta worked for Trump as a concierge for one of his Manhattan properties from 2000 to 2003, even appearing in this video. \u00a0 ",

Take Austin Midili and Sean Sandro-Olsen, two 8-year-olds who have opposing political views. Austin is a staunch Donald Trump supporter. Sean is a big-time fan of Hillary Clinton. The two friends recently participated in the biggest mock election in the country, alongside approximately 390,000\u2014 but they try and avoid talking politics, a subject they say has become touchy in their classroom at Thomas Richards School in Atco, New Jersey. \"It kind of gets uncomfortable,\" said Sean, adding that he doesn't like Trump's idea to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico or how the Republican interrupts Clinton in the debates. Austin added, \"We don't like to talk about it too much. We don't want to get separated as friends.\" They'd rather talk about soccer and baseball \u2014 anything other than politics or girls. Indeed, students across the nation are divided over Clinton and Trump, although nowhere near the level of America's adults. Of the nearly 390,000 students \u2014 2nd grade through 12th grade \u2014 who participated in the mock election using the computer learning tool Newsela, 57 percent voted for Clinton while 32 percent cast their ballots for Trump. The results were released on Wednesday morning. Interestingly, Clinton took some GOP strongholds, like Texas, Georgia and South Carolina in the mock election. Trump won the swing state of Ohio. Related: Life of a Ballot Of course, these kids can't vote for real (well, maybe a few of the 12th graders can). But one day, they will. And they can't help but pay attention to politics, even at their age. The three most important issues to the young people who participated in the mock election mirror the existing national dialogue: Trump's plan to build a border wall, his controversial language about women and Clinton's email scandal. The anti-Clinton kids were fierce. \"Hillary Clinton should be in jail,\" said Jacob Mueller, a Trump-supporting 2nd grader in New Jersey. \"Because she put secret stuff on her computer and then erased it,\" he added. Ryan Ramos, a 16-year-old in San Antonio, Texas who attends S.T.E.M. Early College High School, reiterated that sentiment. \"Because of the emails, I don't even think she should even be able to run for president. I don't feel like she's her own person. She's more of a puppet of the Democratic Party.\" Related: Democrats Fear Senate Majority Quest May Be Killed by Comey's Email Bomb Meanwhile, Clinton's juvenile supporters were quick to bring up Trump's controversial stance on immigration. Salma Muniz, a 5th grader at Austin's University of Texas Elementary School whose parents were born in Mexico, said, \"I wouldn't want to vote for him because he wants to make a wall in Mexico and my parents are in Mexico. \u2026 It makes me feel sad.\" Third grader Isabella Bonfiglio, from Thomas Richards School in New Jersey, said Trump \"doesn't really like women.\" And Jasleen Hira, an 8th grader at KIPP Summit Academy in San Lorenzo, Calif. supporting Green Party candidate Jill Stein, said she was disturbed by how Trump spoke about women like they were \"puppets.\" \"As a young woman who is going to live in the country with the possibility of Trump being the president, it's scary,\" she said. All of this also puts teachers in a tough spot. From Trump bragging in lewd terms about his relationships with women, to Bill Clinton's sexual transgressions of yesteryear, to Trump calling Hillary Clinton a \"nasty woman\" and likening her to the devil, this year's election is awfully hard to talk about in the classroom, despite teachers' desire to discuss with students civics and the world around them. The contentious nature of this election cycle has even resulted in some districts, from New Jersey to Nebraska, canceling classes on Election Day because of safety concerns. Related: Election Day Safety Fears See Schools Cancel Classes or Move Polling Places Newsela, used by 9 million students in 75 percent of classrooms in some capacity across the country, has helped with that in many classrooms. Students read different versions of news stories depending on their age and reading level and take corresponding lessons and quizzes. Still, Erin Green, a 5th grade social studies teacher in Austin, Texas, has found teaching this election year particularly difficult, especially when one student brought up the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" video featuring vulgar comments Trump made about women in 2005. \"I said that I wanted to talk about it, but I didn't know how because I couldn't quote what Trump said without losing my job. But a lot of kids already knew what I was talking about. They either saw the video or heard from their parents,\" said Green, who teaches at The University of Texas Elementary School. She then steered the conversation to whether or not moral character or attitudes toward women should affect someone's ability to become president. Related: Trump on Hot Mic: 'When You're a Star ... You Can Do Anything' to Women Jackie Broderick, an 8th grade social studies teacher in San Lorenzo, Calif., said she took controversial subjects like sexual harassment head on. For example, when the \"Access Hollywood\" video came out, \"We talked about it, how it's not OK to comment on other people's bodies and if you said that at school there would be consequences. We talked about the inconsistencies in terms of expectations.\" \"I'II try not to have a huge conversation of what they hear outside of the school because it can get very touchy. There's no filter. A lot of times, they don't know what they're saying. They're just repeating what they hear on TV, what their family has said, what a friend told them on the bus,\" said Jessica Niedoba, a 2nd grade teacher at Thomas Richards in New Jersey who has focused her discussion on the economy, education and health care, issues which she says are the easiest for younger kids to understand. But the students, especially the younger kids, have definitely picked up on the negative politicking. Alexandra Handzus, who also teaches 2nd grade at the New Jersey school, recounted one of her students saying she knew why kids aren't allowed to run for president. \"She said they'd have to say bad things about each other. That's the takeaway they have from the election \u2014 that that's a requirement, that in order to get the votes, you have to say something negative about somebody else.\" Hira, the 8th grader who is supporting Stein, echoed that sentiment. \"It feels like it's not even an election anymore. It's a fight between the two. It's a game for them.\" Aliyah Frumin ",

Cubs fan and UFC fighter Clay Guida shows off his tickets Wednesday for Game 7 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Game 7. World Series . \"I said I wanted to see the Cubs win the World Series before the good Lord takes me, so here I am with my grandson and my son,\" Tom Brown, 84, said as he rested beneath the Progressive Field marquee near the home plate gate. \"If we win, I can go to the Maker in peace.\" The Brown clan was among the thousands of Cubs fans who made the trip to northeast Ohio for Wednesday night's game against the Indians , ramping up for a day many have been dreaming about for a lifetime. \"I'm incredibly excited. I'm extremely happy to be here,\" Brown said, wearing a blue Cubs floppy hat and pinstriped jersey, as the corner of Ontario Street and Carnegie Avenue hummed with the chatter of baseball fans. Fans in Cleveland before Game 7 Fans gather on East 4th Street in Cleveland before World Series Game 7 Fans gather on East 4th Street in Cleveland before World Series Game 7 See more videos Brown, who grew up in the Chicago suburbs and now lives in Lincoln, Neb., shelled out $8,000 for the three tickets. He and his son, Jeffrey, and grandson Patrick left the Kansas City, Mo., area at 3 a.m. Tuesday, boarded a flight to Detroit, rented a car and stayed the night in Toledo, Ohio, before heading to Cleveland. It was worth it, they said. \"I decided I don't really have the money, but we're going,\" Tom Brown said. \"I sold a little stock.\" With the excitement level rising with each tick of the clock at the iconic Tower City Center, aglow in red and blue spotlights, fans made their way to the ballpark. In one of the plazas between a busy East 4th Street and the stadium, Indians fans mobbed actor Charlie Sheen as he exited a black SUV, on his way to a rally to pump up the local fans. Sheen played fictional Indians pitcher Ricky Vaughn, nicknamed \"Wild Thing,\" in the baseball movie \"Major League.\" Sheen had been angling to throw out a ceremonial first pitch before one of the Series games in Cleveland, but the Indians selected former stars, including Jim Thome for Game 7. That didn't stop Sheen from high-fiving surprised Tribe fans, then giving an expletive-filled speech to the crowd. \"It's the wrong night to be from Chi-Town!\" Sheen said. He criticized the Indians for bypassing him, then said it was going to be Cleveland's night on the field. Tom Brown Cubs fan Tom Brown on Game 7 of the World Series. (Patrick O'Connell / Chicago Tribune) Cubs fan Tom Brown on Game 7 of the World Series. (Patrick O'Connell / Chicago Tribune) See more videos The plaza beyond the left-field gate was a popular gathering spot for fans, many who didn't have tickets to the game but wanted to soak in the moment. Ryan Koehneke, 41, of St. Charles, drove to Cleveland on Tuesday and was searching for a ticket on the street after attending Game 6. A few moments before, someone nearby beat him to a pair of standing-room tickets. \"We're hoping for a miracle, man,\" Koehneke said. \"We're hoping for magic.\" As Corey Kluber delivered the first pitch, Indians and Cubs fans stood and cheered. Cubs fans made their presence known early, erupting from the box seats to the nosebleeds when Dexter Fowler led off the game with a home run. Cubs fans appeared to make up close to half of the fans in the stands. This was an unprecedented moment not to be missed for loyal Cubs fans. \"I lived at Wrigley Field as a kid,\" Tom Brown said. In the 1940s, he'd buy a bleacher ticket for 25 cents. He said he once got in trouble for skipping school to attend a Cubs home opener. As a baseball-crazed teenager, he scurried for the latest editions of the newspapers, scouring the box scores and memorizing player statistics. His favorite Cubs are Ernie Banks and Phil Cavarretta \u2014 \"He was a hell of a first baseman.\" He said he's been a die-hard fan for 72 years. Photo of Cubs fans during\u00a0the World Series games.\u00a0 Most Cubs fans were not alive the last time the team won the National League pennant, in 1945, let alone when the team won its last championship in 1908, facts not lost on the waves of fans who headed to the ballpark, giddy anticipation apparent on their faces. Indians fans have been long-suffering as well, the team's last title coming in 1948. \"As far as the game tonight, let the best team win,\" Brown said. \"If the Cubs lose, what's the phrase, 'Wait 'til next year?' I've waited for them for 72 years. I'll wait a few more.\" poconnell@chicagotribune.com ",

It happened in the '60s. It shouldn't happen in 2016.\" After a fire consumed Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, the words 'Vote Trump' were written along the side of the building in Greenville, Mississippi. Angie Quezada Greenville Police Chief Delando Wilson said investigators were \"possibly talking to a person of interest\" but had no suspects in custody or surveillance video of the fire, which appeared to have been deliberately set. \"It is a local person who lives in the area,\" Wilson told NBC News. He declined to identify the man or his race. Donald Trump's presidential campaign said Wednesday night that it was \"deeply saddened for the members of the Hopewell M.B. Church community and condemn[s] in the strongest terms this terrible act that has no place in our society.\" \"We are grateful that no one was hurt and we urge witnesses with any information to come forward and help bring justice to those who are responsible,\" the campaign said. Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, said in what appeared to be a personally signed tweet that \"this kind of hate has no place in America.\" The perpetrators who set the Hopewell M.B. Church in MS on fire must be brought to justice. This kind of hate has no place in America. -H \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 3, 2016 Pastor Carolyn Hudson said the 200-member church hadn't received any recent threats. \"Our church was a historic church that has been there for over 111 years,\" Hudson said. \"This has left our hearts broken, but we are strong together. ... Y'all continue to pray for us.\" A spokeswoman for Simmons, the mayor, told NBC News that the church hadn't been targeted before \u2014 \"not in recent years that I know of,\" she said. The FBI, meanwhile, confirmed that it was \"aware of the situation in Greenville.\" \"We are working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed,\" Brett Carr, an FBI spokesman, said in a statement. The fire was reported at 9:16 p.m. (10:16 p.m. ET) Tuesday, and when firefighters arrived they found the main sanctuary of the brick building engulfed in flames, Greenville Fire Chief Ruben Brown said. The Trump graffiti was found in big letters on an outside wall, he said. Investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the state fire marshal's were on the scene. Greenville is a mostly black city of 34,000 in the Mississippi Delta where Simmons said \"the racial climate is fairly good.\" He said the most recent racist incident happened on Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, when somebody spray-painted the N-word on the city's boat ramp. But Mississippi also has a sad history of African-American churches being targeted by vandals. \"The black church has always been a symbol of the black community,\" Simmons said. A GoFundMe page has been set up to collect money to repair the church. Corky Siemaszko ",

LiPo Ching / Bay Area News Group Elyse Jones waters the marijuana clones at the Harborside Health Center medical marijuana dispensary in San Jose, Calif. Elyse Jones waters the marijuana clones at the Harborside Health Center medical marijuana dispensary in San Jose, Calif. (LiPo Ching / Bay Area News Group) Patrick McGreevy Contact Reporter California appears poised to legalize\u00a0the recreational use of marijuana, with a strong majority favoring Proposition 64 ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote. A new statewide poll shows 58% of likely voters support\u00a0 Proposition 64 \u00a0and 37% oppose it. The number who said they don\u2019t know how they will vote dropped from 8% last month to 4% in the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released this week. Next week\u2019s decision comes six years after a similar initiative was rejected by 53.5%\u00a0of California\u2019s voters. \u201cThe electorate has gotten younger and more demographically diverse,\u201d said Dan Schnur, director of the poll and of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. \u201cThe change over the last six years has been more cultural than political. Society feels differently about marijuana legalization now than it did then.\u201d The initiative enjoys its strongest support, at 74%, among likely voters ages 18 to 29, while only 46% of voters over age 64 back the idea, according to the poll, which was conducted Oct. 22-30. Pot users were much more likely to say they favor Proposition 64 \u2014 72% did so. The survey found\u00a043% have used marijuana for recreational purposes and 54% said they had not. Of the group who hasn\u2019t used marijuana, support was split, 46% in favor and 48% against the measure. Of those who have used it, 30% said they have done so in the last year.\u00a0Among those who have not, just\u00a02%\u00a0said they are much more likely to use it if Proposition 64 passes, 5%\u00a0said they are somewhat more likely to use it, and 89% said they are no more likely to smoke pot if it is legalized. California is one of five states considering legalization measures on Nov. 8 and is seen as a battleground state for the national movement to relax drug laws. Proposition 64 would allow the growing, transporting and retail selling of marijuana to individuals, who will be allowed to possess up to one ounce of pot. The measure, supported by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Facebook President Sean Parker , also allows Californians to grow up to six marijuana plants. Buying marijuana at state-licensed shops would come with a 15% excise tax. The measure is supported \u201cstrongly\u201d by 47% of likely voters and is supported, but \u201cnot so strongly,\u201d by 11%. The poll found support a little softer among Latino voters, 43% of whom \u201cstrongly\u201d support the initiative and 13% \u201cnot so strongly.\u201d Why? For many voters it is a question of finances. Among respondents who support the initiative, 23% of all voters and 30% of Latinos said they do so because legalizing marijuana \u201cwould generate a billion dollars in tax revenue for California, which would go towards after school programs and job training initiatives.\u201d That opportunity was the first reason offered by Barkev Tatevosian, a 28-year-old administrative analyst from Los Angeles who plans to vote for Proposition 64 but does not use marijuana. \u201cThe revenues are already being seen, but they are going into the wrong hands,\u201d Tatevosian said. \u201cPeople who want to get marijuana are already getting it, they are just getting it from the wrong hands.\u201d The poll found 22% support the measure because they believe the criminal justice system is broken and legalizing pot would allow more of a\u00a0focus on violent criminals. Eighteen percent said they support Proposition 64 to take the marijuana market out of the hands of the drug cartels and allow government regulation. For 13%, pot should be legal because \u201cusing it is a personal choice, not something the government should regulate.\u201d And 10% of supporters say marijuana should be legal because it is less dangerous than alcohol. That argument is partly why Heather Leikin, a realtor from Culver City, supports Proposition 64. The ballot box guide to California's propositions \u00bb \u201cI think that marijuana is better than alcohol as far as safety goes, as far as health goes,\u201d said Leikin, 43. \u201cI don\u2019t see people killing each other on marijuana or overdosing on marijuana.\u201d Among all of those who oppose the measure, the biggest concern, cited by 23% of opponents, is that it is a drug whose use often leads to abusing other narcotics. That issue is why Raul Duarte, a bus driver from Anaheim, plans to vote \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a gateway drug for other, harder drugs, and we shouldn\u2019t make it accessible to all the youngsters,\u201d said Duarte, 29. Other concerns were that the measure would suggest to children it\u2019s OK to do drugs or that it could lead to stoned driving and deaths on the road .\u00a0 \u201cColorado is dealing with some pretty extreme issues that I don\u2019t think we need to deal with, like impaired driving,\u201d said Barbara Mayers, a retired office manager from Poway, 79. The survey of 1,500 registered voters was conducted for USC Dornsife and the Los Angeles Times by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research and American Viewpoint.

The Russian Defense Ministry, which is helping forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad try to retake full control of Aleppo, said rebels would be allowed to exit the city unharmed and with their weapons between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time on Nov. 4 via two special corridors. Syrians carry their belongings as they leave Aleppo on Sunday. OMAR HAJ KADOUR / AFP - Getty Images Civilians and the sick and wounded would be allowed to leave via six other corridors, it said. President Vladimir Putin had ordered the pause in fighting \"to avoid senseless victims,\" the Defense Ministry said. It added that Syrian authorities would ensure that Assad's troops pulled back from the two corridors designated for rebels. One exit leads to the Turkish border, the other to the city of Idlib, according to the ministry. Rebel groups in Aleppo dismissed Russia's latest offer, with The Associated Press quoting one of the groups as saying it was a media stunt for \"public consumption.\" Russia and its Syrian allies say they halted air attacks on Aleppo on Oct 18. Western governments had alleged that the strikes had been killing civilians in large numbers, an allegation Moscow denied.

ABDALRHMAN ISMAIL / Reuters, file But Molhem Ekaidi, deputy commander of Fastaqim group, one of the major rebel factions fighting inside Aleppo, accused the Russians of lying. \"The (Russian) shelling and crimes continue and their planes have not left the skies of Aleppo,\" he said. Humanitarian pauses designed to allow both rebels and civilians to exit the city have been organized by Moscow and Damascus before, but have largely failed amid continued violence with both sides accusing the other of stopping people from leaving.

Mone/AP A member of the Stutsman County SWAT team who declined to give his name nor to be identifiable by badge stands guard by an armored personnel carrier equipped with an LRAD, or long range acoustic device, while deployed to watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline. John L. Mone/AP President Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is examining possible alternative routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Protesters have been occupying land along the current pipeline route near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. A federal judge has ruled that work on the pipeline can go forward, but the Corps and two other agencies said work would not go forward in an area particularly sensitive to the tribe until a review was completed. \"We're monitoring this closely and I think, as a general rule, my view is that there's a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans,\" Obama said in an interview with the news organization Now This . The president continued: \"I think right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline in a way. So we're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans.\" Article continues after sponsorship \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) November 2, 2016 In a response to the president's statement, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, Dave Archambault II, said, \"We believe President Obama and his administration will do the right thing.\" Morton County Chairman Cody Schulz said that he did not agree with the president's decision to let the situation play out, saying in a statement: \"Rather than creating further uncertainty, the President should be sending us the support and resources necessary to enforce the law and protect people's right to peacefully protest.\" Police Evict Dakota Pipeline Protesters According to the Morton County Sheriff's Office Facebook page , protesters and law enforcement officers were in a standoff on Wednesday along a creek north of the main protest camp. Following the president's remarks, Vicki Granado, spokeswoman for the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, said in a statement, \"We are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\" The easement refers to permission from the Corps to begin construction on the portion of the pipeline that would cross under the Missouri River. It was not immediately clear what a rerouting plan might look like, or what might be involved in the Corps' considering such a plan. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters are specifically trying to block that section of pipeline because, they say, the route interrupts sacred sites and burial places . Tribe members are also concerned that if the pipeline ruptures, an oil spill could pollute drinking water, as The Two-Way has reported . In his statement, Archambault called on the Obama administration to stop all work on the pipeline until the Corps was finished \"examining this issue.\" As demonstrations continue, so have clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Last week, police arrested more than 100 people as officers evicted demonstrators from land owned by the pipeline company. As we reported, some of the officers were in riot gear, some were armed, and they arrived with soldiers driving trucks and military Humvees. They also deployed helicopters and an airplane to monitor from above. The Federal Aviation Administration is restricting flights over the area until at least Nov. 5. Last week, Archambault called on the Department of Justice to investigate what he called the \"overall militarization of law enforcement response\" in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Asked what he thought about the law enforcement response, Obama said Tuesday that it's a \"challenging situation.\" The president continued: \"I think that my general rule when I talk to governors and state and local officials, whenever they're dealing with protests \u2014 including, for example, during the 'Black Lives Matter' protests \u2014 is there's an obligation for protesters to be peaceful, and there's an obligation for authorities to show restraint. \"I want to make sure that, as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt.\" In an apparent effort to confuse police, more than 1 million people have tried to make it appear that they are protesting in North Dakota by \"checking in\" at the protest camp on Facebook . The Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a Facebook post Monday afternoon that it \"does not follow Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location.\" NPR's Jeff Brady also reported Wednesday that authorities have charged a protester, Red Fawn Fallis, with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer after she allegedly fired a pistol three times as she was being arrested last week. According to an officer who witnessed the event, police did not return fire against the woman. North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind said he was nearby and was surprised no one was injured. \"The only angle that gun could have been fired where there was no law enforcement is the angle it was fired. It wasn't because she was trying to aim away from law enforcement,\" he said. If Fallis is found guilty, Jeff says, she faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. ",

Lu Parker, an anchor at KTLA and an animal activist, was arrested at LAX on Wednesday morning. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) Veronica Rocha and Richard Winton Contact Reporter KTLA news anchor Lu Parker was arrested Wednesday\u00a0after a passenger accused her of taking headphones\u00a0during security screening at Los Angeles International Airport , officials said. The anchor, whose legal name is Frances Louise Parker, was booked on suspicion of petty theft and\u00a0is being held at the Los Angeles Police Department \u2019s Pacific Division. The incident\u00a0occurred about 7\u00a0a.m., when a passenger walking through the Transportation Security Administration screening area\u00a0in Terminal 6 noticed a personal belonging was missing, said Officer Robert Pedregon, a spokesman for Los Angeles Airport Police. (KTLA said in a statement that the situation was the result of a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d) When officers\u00a0arrived at the screening area, the passenger told them what had happened and\u00a0asked to perform\u00a0a private person\u2019s\u00a0arrest, Pedregon\u00a0said.\u00a0Such an arrest is usually made when no on-duty officer witnessed the offense. Security video also showed the incident and a potential suspect,\u00a0Pedregon said. Parker, 48, of West Hollywood, was then removed from a flight and arrested, authorities said. According to KTLA, Parker was going through the security line and noticed that a pair of earbud headphones had been left behind. \u201cShe picked them up intending to return them to the owner whom she had been speaking with while in line to clear TSA,\u201d KTLA said in a statement. But Parker couldn\u2019t find the headphones' owner,\u00a0so she boarded her flight, according to KTLA. \u201cWe believe this is a misunderstanding, Lu is cooperating fully with the authorities and we are confident she will be able to clear this all up,\u201d KTLA said. Parker was traveling to visit her father who is ill, the news station said. Parker is\u00a0a former Miss USA,\u00a0a onetime girlfriend of former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and a well-known animal rights advocate.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the FBI would have to find to press charges against Hillary Clinton , Frank Gehry\u2019s controversial development is approved , two Des Moines officers were shot to death , and the Cubs push a game 7 of the World Series .

    "text": "Independent Presidential Candidate Evan McMullin Could Make History This Election \u201cThis race is one of a few that we\u2019re watching that could turn over power,\u201d according to Shushannah Walshe, ABC News\u2019 deputy political director. Kander volunteered to serve in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, and one of the things he says he wants to change is creating better policy for our men and women in uniform. \u201cThere's nothing that's going to be asked of me in the United States Senate that it is more difficult than like a Tuesday in the United States Army,\u201d Kander said. His message seems to be resonating in Missouri, but across the country, down-ballot candidates have been pulling out all the stops to get voters to the polls. \u201cIn these tight Senate races across the country we may see more split ticket voters \u2013 that means people casting their ballots for one party at the top of the ticket and a different party down ballot,\u201d Walshe said. New Hampshire is another state with a very tight Senate race between Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. \u201cThe big question here is whether folks like Ayotte and Hassan can withstand the unpopularity of the presidential candidates at the top of the ticket. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d said ABC News digital journalist Ali Rogin, who has been following the Senate race in New Hampshire for the last year. \u201cWe spoke to a couple people who are going to vote for Clinton for president, but then they\u2019re going to vote for Kelly Ayotte for Senate even though she\u2019s a Republican because they say she\u2019s done a good job for the state of New Hampshire,\u201d Rogin added. \u201cThe big question is going to be how many of those ticket splitters end up being on Election Night.\u201d Hassan has been going from town to town, going into diners and restaurants to shake hands and make an impact on a personal level. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m just a little person. I\u2019m just one out of the hundreds of thousands there are in New Hampshire and for [Hassan] to come over and to say something, it makes me want to vote for her even more,\u201d said New Hampshire voter Kim Devaux. Ayotte has also been making one-on-one time voters a priority, a strategy that\u2019s perhaps even more important because her relationship with the top of the Republican ticket has been complicated. She first said she believed Trump could be president, but after the 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced, Ayotte disavowed Trump. \u201cI cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\u201d Ayotte wrote on Twitter. \u201cI will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and instead will be writing in Governor Pence for president on Election Day.\u201d Jason Kander\u2019s campaign is also doing a delicate dance with the top of the ticket for both parties. Clinton has not been stumping for him because, even though he\u2019s a Democrat, to win the Missouri seat, he can\u2019t alienate all of the state\u2019s Trump supporters. Instead top Democrats like Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have stumped for him in Missouri. With less than a week until Election Day, from Missouri to New Hampshire, Democrats and Republicans want voters to know that regardless of who wins the top of the ticket, who controls the Senate also matters. As Kander said to a cheering crowd, \u201cWe\u2019ll just do what we do best -- just get to work.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Independent Candidate Gaining in Utah Slams Trump as Sexist By brady mccombs, associated press SALT LAKE CITY \u0097 Nov 2, 2016, 9:49 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Independent Candidate Evan McMullin Could Make History This Election 0 Shares Email Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin said Wednesday he won't wither under attacks by white supremacists backing Donald Trump as his late campaign surge pushes him closer to winning Utah. McMullin said at the University of Utah that the rise of Republican Donald Trump this campaign has illustrated a lingering problem in the United States with bigotry, racism and misogyny. \"When we have a presidential candidate who brags about grabbing women by their private parts and brags about how he can get away with it because he's famous, we still have a problem with sexism,\" McMullin told university students. \"When one of our major parties is offering up a leader who thinks that way and speaks that way and who attacks people based on the color of their skin or their faith... that tells us something about where we are.\" McMullin has a chance to win enough conservative votes in Utah to defeat Trump and become the first non-Republican to win the state in nearly a half century, polls show. At the event, he pointed to a Ku Klux Klan-affiliated newspaper this week running an editorial praising Trump, and a robo call placed in Utah against him by a white nationalist Trump supporter this week. The Trump campaign denounced both. White nationalist William Johnson on Wednesday canceled his robo call, apologizing for a \"mean-spirited message\" that included calling McMullin a \"closet homosexual.\" McMullin called them \"baseless\" lies earlier this week. His spokeswoman Rina Shah said in a statement Wednesday in response to the apology that the damage has already been done since the robo calls ran since Monday. Shah reasserted the campaign's belief that Trump's campaign was behind the \"desperate whisper campaign\" and called on Trump to apologize. Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks has said Trump had no knowledge of the robo call and condemned the message. \"Not every Trump supporter is racist, but from the alt-right to the Ku Klux Klan , every racist in America has seemingly flocked to Trump's cause,\" Shah said in the statement. His event at the university, in which he took questions from students, came a day after some of Utah's top Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch , urged their fellow conservatives to unite around Trump rather than leave the party to vote for McMullin. Hatch said Trump \"doesn't take any crap from anybody,\" and \"he's exactly what we need.\" Other top Utah Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Mia Love, Sen. Mike Lee and Gov. Gary Herbert have said they will not vote for Trump. Utah's mostly-Mormon voters have widely rejected Trump's brash demeanor and taken exception to the billionaire's comments about women, minorities and Muslims. Trump finished a distant third in the March presidential caucus and polls show he's in a tight race with McMullin despite Utah being a Republican stronghold that hasn't elected a non-GOP presidential candidate since 1964. McMullin, a Mormon and former CIA agent, tells voters around the state that a win for him in Utah would help launch a new conservative movement that is more inclusive and open to people of all faiths and races than Trump's Republican Party . \"The best thing we can do is stand up and fight for people being attacked based on their race, their religion, their gender,\" McMullin said. \"Let's stand up and fight for equality.\" 0 Shares ",

Got it At a rally in Miami, Nov. 2, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he believes his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton is \"very unstable.\" The crowd followed with cheers of, \"Lock her up.\" (The Washington Post) By Jenna Johnson , Abby Phillip and Sean Sullivan November 2 at 3:33 PM Follow @wpjenna Follow @abbydphillip Follow @WaPoSean MIAMI \u2014 Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton \u201cvery unstable\u201d at a rally in Miami on Wednesday afternoon, a campaign event in which he went hard on the attack against the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cShe\u2019s got bad judgment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPersonally, I think she\u2019s a very unstable person.\u201d He did not substantiate his claim. The Republican nominee, without presenting specific evidence, also said Clinton \u201cprobably\u201d received a heads-up about questions in her debates against him. He pointed to the revelation by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks that Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chair, provided Democratic primary debate questions to Clinton\u2019s campaign. Trump also noted other unflattering releases by WikiLeaks and predicted that more damaging ones might be on the way. He also mentioned the FBI\u2019s revived investigation into Clinton\u2019s email practices at the State Department. \u201cDid you hear about this little event?\u201d Trump said. At a Miami rally, Nov. 2, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed reporters including \"Katy\" aren't properly covering support for his campaign. The target of his finger pointing was NBC News reporter Katy Tur. (The Washington Post) Trump told the crowd to vote with urgency and \u201cpretend we\u2019re slightly behind,\u201d though some recent Florida polls do show him trailing Clinton. He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to blow this.\u201d At one point, Trump appeared to single out NBC News reporter Katy Tur for criticism, as he has done before. \u201cWe have massive crowds. There\u2019s something happening. They\u2019re not reporting it. Katy, you\u2019re not reporting it, Katy. There\u2019s something happening, Katy. There\u2019s something happening, Katy,\u201d Trump said. As animosity against the media has grown at recent Trump rallies, his has added a larger buffer zone and more security between reporters and the crowds. But at the Miami rally, there was no buffer, and screaming supporters were just inches away from reporters. One man near the press pen continued screaming menacing things at \u201cKaty\u201d as the rally continued. Meanwhile, President Obama expressed concern in a radio interview broadcast Wednesday morning that too few African Americans are voting this time around, and he pressed black voters to turn out for Clinton to protect the policies he has implemented. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you right now, because we track \u2014 we\u2019ve got early voting, we\u2019ve got all kinds of metrics to see what\u2019s going on. And right now the Latino vote is up, overall vote is up, but the African American vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be,\u201d Obama said on \u201cThe Tom Joyner Morning Show,\u201d a syndicated program with many African American listeners. Obama framed the election as not only a race between Clinton and Trump but one in which his record is on the line. At a rally in Dade City, Fla., Nov. 1, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton deplored how Republican rival Donald Trump has treated women like Alicia Machado. \"We cannot hide from this,\" Clinton said. (Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post; Video: The Washington Post) \u201cI need everybody to understand that everything we\u2019ve done is dependent on being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in,\u201d the president said. [ Obama worries black vote \u2018is not as solid as it needs to be\u2019 ] To shore up support among black voters, Clinton released a new radio ad Wednesday, titled \u201cDisrespect,\u201d that says Trump \u201copenly mocks the African American community.\u201d The ad will air in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, the Clinton campaign said. Obama also briefly addressed for the first time the FBI\u2019s reopened investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails, saying in an interview with NowThis News posted Wednesday that the agency does not \u201coperate on innuendo\u201d and emphasizing that there is no evidence that the Democratic presidential nominee had violated the law. Trump\u2019s midday rally in Miami was the first of three he planned to hold in Florida on Wednesday. Clinton, who focused on Florida on Tuesday, was to campaign in Nevada and Arizona. The Clinton campaign announced Wednesday that it is doubling its Arizona advertising investment to $1\u00a0million for the final week of the campaign. A Democratic nominee for president has not won Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996, but polls show a competitive contest there. The deadly shootings of two police officers in central Iowa prompted two of Hillary Clinton\u2019s top surrogates to cancel a Wednesday campaign event in the region. Bill Clinton and vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine would no longer hold a get-out-the-vote event in Des Moines, Clinton\u2019s campaign announced in the morning. The officers were shot in their squad cars in Des Moines and Urbandale. Authorities took a suspect into custody Wednesday morning. In Miami, Trump called the shootings a \u201cterrible tragedy.\u201d He said that \u201can attack on our police is an attack on all of us.\u201d [ Iowa police capture suspect after \u2018ambush-style\u2019 killings of two officers ] Trump\u2019s children were fanning out across key battlegrounds to campaign on his behalf on Wednesday. Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump and Eric Trump were covering Colorado, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. At his rally, Trump criticized both Bill and Hillary Clinton, saying, \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. Haven\u2019t we just been through a lot with the Clintons? Right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can\u2019t practice law, he doesn\u2019t have the right to practice law. Didn\u2019t we just go through this?\u201d As Trump spoke, a man in the crowd kept screaming, \u201cHe\u2019s a rapist!\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal R. Labrador (R-Idaho) was an introductory speaker at Trump\u2019s rally. Trump seldom has Republican lawmakers appear in states other than their own. Speaking for 3\u00bd minutes, Labrador did not mention Trump\u2019s name once. \u201cI\u2019m here because what we need to do in this election is we need to elect somebody that can believe and does believe in the American Dream,\u201d Labrador said, then telling the crowd about how he grew up in Puerto Rico and ended up being a Republican. Later he added, \u201cI need you to do everything you can for the next seven days to make America great again.\u201d As the crowd waited in the hot sun for Trump to arrive, a local GOP official also spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans up and down the ticket \u2014 but the crowd was distracted by a woman wearing a jail jumpsuit and a Clinton mask who posed for photo after photo. For the second rally in a row, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus addressed Trump\u2019s crowd, saying in Miami that while Trump is \u201cnot politically correct,\u201d he doesn\u2019t lie like Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle for freedom,\u201d Priebus said, \u201cand Donald Trump will fight for our freedom.\u201d Sullivan reported from Washington.

Denis Farrell/AP In South Africa, protesters are once again calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down over allegations of corruption and political mismanagement. People took to the streets Wednesday in Pretoria over an official report on alleged corruption inside the Zuma administration. After the president asked the country's highest court to block its release, thousands of people turned out to protest, The Associated Press reports. Public support for Zuma and his party, the African National Congress, has fallen. This summer, as The Two-Way has reported , the party \"lost key races in South Africa's municipal elections following a series of corruption scandals. It's the worst defeat in the history of the African National Congress, which has governed South Africa since the country's first post-apartheid vote in 1994.\" The result was widely seen as a referendum on Zuma. At Wednesday's rallies, some people carried signs declaring, \"Zuma Must Go.\" Police officers outside Zuma's offices fired stun grenades and turned on water cannons, according to the AP. Reporting from Pretoria, Peter Granitz told NPR's Newscast unit that: \"Protesters are blocking the streets into downtown with burning tires and they're pelting cars with stones, trying to intimidate people into staying home. \"Some large, poor residential areas have also been cordoned off by protesters, hoping the shutdown catches President Jacob Zuma's eye. \"Today's protest, dubbed 'Save South Africa' is organized by opposition political parties. It comes just one day after the Nelson Mandela Foundation accused Zuma of looting the state.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "Why Republicans Don\u2019t Even Try to Win Cities Anymore By EMILY BADGER and QUOCTRUNG BUI NOV. 2, 2016 Continue reading the main story Photo As a Republican presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan toured the South Bronx in the summer of 1980 to try to win urban voters. Credit Vic DeLucia/The New York Times Ronald Reagan visited the South Bronx in the summer of 1980, when Charlotte Street was still lined with vacant lots and the rubble of toppling tenements. The place looked like London after the blitz , he said, and he wanted to do something about it. The Republican candidate for president that year, Mr. Reagan wasn\u2019t merely mugging for the kind of photo op that unnerves white suburban voters. Earlier that day, he spoke to the National Urban League in New York. Then he flew to Chicago to meet with the editors of Ebony and Jet magazines, pillars of the black press, and Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader. He wasn\u2019t always greeted warmly, but it was the kind of campaign itinerary that\u2019s hard to imagine a Republican presidential candidate even contemplating in 2016. Mr. Reagan believed he could make a genuine play for urban voters in 1980. Today, his party has all but conceded them. Only three of the 25 largest cities in America now have Republican mayors. In the House of Representatives, Republicans from dense urban congressional districts have become extinct. In the 2012 presidential election, the counties containing Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Washington, San Francisco and Philadelphia each gave less than 20 percent of their vote to Mitt Romney. In this coming election, Donald J. Trump is unlikely to do better \u2014 and may fare worse. Continue reading the main story The Relationship Between Density and Voting Over the last 60 years, the population density of a county has become a strong predictor of how residents vote in presidential elections. Note: Circles sized by the number of voters in that county. Source: Jonathan Rodden analysis of county-level presidential election results. The Realignment The pattern highlights a paradox about Mr. Trump: \u201cHe\u2019s the most urban candidate in American history \u2014 he was born in Queens and lives in a skyscraper on Fifth Avenue,\u201d said Aaron Renn, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. And Mr. Trump\u2019s personal fortunes have risen with the comeback of major American cities, with signature real estate projects in New York, Washington and Chicago. But he has portrayed these same cities as dystopias. Mr. Trump has elevated a strategy that is risky to the Republican Party in the long run. Not only have recent Republican candidates neglected cities, but they\u2019ve also run against them, casting urban America as the foil to heartland voters. Rick Santorum and Sarah Palin caricatured coastal cities as unmoored from the \u201creal America.\u201d Ted Cruz derided \u201cNew York values,\u201d as if those values, whichever ones he meant, were alien. Mr. Trump has pre-emptively annulled the votes of Chicago, St. Louis and Philadelphia, cities where he warns the election will be rigged against him. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginably distressing, even by eight years ago, let alone 16 years ago,\u201d said Stephen Goldsmith, a former Republican mayor of Indianapolis and an adviser to George W. Bush in the 2000 campaign. \u201cWe had an opportunity to reach broadly across the country to have an inspiring voice of opportunity, and there\u2019s a set of coherent Republican policies that would amplify that opportunity. We\u2019re doing the opposite. We\u2019re insulting folks who could vote for us.\u201d The history of how the G.O.P. got here is partly about the ideological realignment of the two parties, and the disappearance of liberal Republicans like Jacob Javits, a senator from New York State, and John Lindsay, a mayor of New York City (a Republican who left the party, he said, when it left him). The party even moved away from conservative Republicans like Jack Kemp , the secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the George H.W. Bush administration, who spoke often about urban opportunity. But this history is also about the physical realignment of voters, as the rise of suburbia enabled Democrats and Republicans to move, literally, farther apart. Photo Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City, a Republican, got a lift from demonstrators at the groundbreaking for Flatlands Industrial Park in Brooklyn in 1966. He switched to the Democratic Party in 1971. Credit Neil Boenzi/The New York Times One Word: Race In 1966, white voters in Chicago who\u2019d long supported the city\u2019s Democratic machine began to bolt for the Republican Party. They were alarmed by urban riots, by civil rights legislation in Congress and \u2014 much closer to home \u2014 by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s campaign in Chicago that year for \u201copen housing.\u201d Pamphlets soon began to appear on the stoops of the city\u2019s middle-class bungalows: \u201cYour Home is your castle \u2014 Keep it that way by Voting STRAIGHT REPUBLICAN.\u201d This was the summer, the historian Rick Perlstein writes in his book \u201cNixonland,\u201d when the party of Lincoln changed its mind. Those newly converted Republicans in Chicago voted in 1968 for Richard Nixon. \u201cBut these were the people,\u201d Mr. Perlstein said in an interview, \u201cwho largely would have left the city within 10 years.\u201d Those Chicago voters embody both trends \u2014 party realignment and white flight \u2014 that have remade political geography since then. In the 1950s, in presidential election results compiled by the Stanford political scientist Jonathan Rodden, a county\u2019s population density was a poor predictor of how its residents voted. Today, the pattern is remarkably consistent: The denser the county, the more overwhelmingly its residents vote Democratic. \u201cThis story could be written in one word,\u201d Mr. Perlstein said of that historical arc. \u201cThe one word would be \u2018race.\u2019 \u201d Photo Civil rights demonstrators on Chicago\u2019s southeast side in 1966. Several white homeowners used sprinklers near the sidewalk to discourage the marchers, who were pushing for fair housing. Credit Charles Knoblock/Associated Press In the early days of white flight, two federal policies \u2014 the construction of the interstate highway system and mortgage guarantees for the new suburbs \u2014 pulled whites out of cities even as they were getting pushed by racial tension, desegregation and school busing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe people who go to the suburbs are not a random selection,\u201d said Jessica Trounstine, a political scientist at the University of California, Merced. They were the middle and upper class. They became homeowners. They prized neighborhoods of single-family houses. Those characteristics today all correlate with leaning Republican. \u201cThese population shifts happen for reasons that are external to politics,\u201d Ms. Trounstine said, \u201cbut politics is embedded in who goes.\u201d Metropolitan areas with more highway construction became more polarized over time between Democratic cities and Republican suburbs, according to research by Clayton Nall , a Stanford political scientist. Where highways were built, they helped sort people. Where they led, suburbs became more reliably Republican. They created entirely new places, Mr. Nall argues, with new politics.

Officials announced the reward and the investigators\u2019 conclusion that the fire was arson at the church, Greenville Fire Chief Ruben Brown Sr. said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cVote Trump\u201d is spray-painted on the side of the fire-damaged Hopewell M.B. Baptist Church in Greenville, Miss., Nov. 2, 2016. AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis Authorities went to Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church after it was engulfed in flames Tuesday night around 9 p.m. also, the words \u201cVote Trump\u201d were spray painted on the side of the building, WJTV reported.\u00a0 The pastor said the church hadn\u2019t made any political statements and they don\u2019t know why they were targeted. There is minimal damage outside the church, but the sanctuary is destroyed. The glass windows are shattered, and the pews are charred black. Police don\u2019t have any surveillance video and they haven\u2019t pinned down any suspects. No one was inside when the fire broke out. Fire investigators are working now to determine how they fire started. The church\u2019s beige brick walls still stand, but the pulpit and pews are burned black, and soot stains the brick above and next to some windows. Brown estimated that it was \u201c80 percent destroyed.\u201d \u201cIt definitely will have to be reconstructed from front to back,\u201d he said. Simmons called the arson a \u201cheinous, hateful, cowardly act.\u201d \u201cWe consider it a hate crime ... because of the political message which we believe was intended to interfere with worship and intimidate voters,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThis act is a direct assault on people\u2019s right to freely worship.\u201d The mayor said the FBI and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are assisting the investigation in the Mississippi River city, where about 78 percent of the 32,100 residents are African-American. Mississippi\u2019s top elections official, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said people shouldn\u2019t jump to the conclusion that the church was vandalized for political reasons. Initial reports suggest \u201cthis is not of a political nature,\u201d he told WDAM-TV. The culprits should be prosecuted \u201cto the fullest extent of the law,\u201d he said. State FBI spokesman Brett Car said the agency is \u201cworking with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed.\u201d He did not comment on whether it was being investigated as a possible hate crime. \u201cAt this point, it is too early in the investigation to determine what type of crime this could be,\u201d he said. Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who has been campaigning for his party\u2019s presidential nominee Donald Trump, said \u201cwe expect a suspect will be identified and brought to justice.\u201d\u00a0 Those responsible will answer for this despicable crime against people of faith. We expect a suspect will be ID'ed and brought to justice. https://t.co/vGwzNddTWd \u2014 Phil Bryant (@PhilBryantMS) November 2, 2016 \u201cFirst, anyone who burns a place of worship will answer to almighty God for this crime against people of faith. But they should also answer to man\u2019s law,\u201d Bryant\u2019s statement said. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat whose district includes Greenville, said the fire and graffiti \u201charkens back to a much darker day in Mississippi.\u201d \u201cThe political message of the vandalism is obviously an attempt to sway public opinion regarding the upcoming election,\u201d he wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cI encourage all citizens not to be deterred by this cowardly act and exercise your right to vote at the ballot box.\u201d The Mississippi chapter of the NAACP released a statement Wednesday night saying the fire was reminiscent of a dark period in the state\u2019s history. \u201cDuring the historically black church\u2019s 111-year history, Hopewell served as a meeting place for organizers during the civil rights movement,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is important to remember this same violent action was taken to intimidate and impede African-Americans from voting in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s.\u201d Brown said water from the hoses and heat from the fire also damaged the church\u2019s kitchen and the pastor\u2019s study. It was put out within 12 minutes, but it took an hour and a half to extinguish hot spots, he said. Arson investigators also were at the scene Wednesday collecting evidence. Brown said the cause remains under investigation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any suspect at time, but we are possibly talking to a person of interest,\u201d Police Chief Delando Wilson said. The mayor said \u201cwe will not rest until the culprit is found and fully prosecuted.\u201d The congregation has existed for 111 years, and will rebuild on the same site, said pastor Carilyn Hudson. \u201cThe act that has happened has left our hearts broken but we are strong together,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe are not angry, but our hearts are broken.\u201d Bishop Clarence Green called the fire troubling. He said that in his 21 years as bishop, the church had never been vandalized. \u201cThe last time someone was at the church was Tuesday around 3,\u201d Green said. Asked where the church members will meet this Sunday, Green said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work on that.\u201d In addition, a GoFundMe page has been set up for the church. At last check, the campaign had raised more than $67,000, according to WJTV. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

When it comes to non-white voters, however, Clinton dwarfs Trump, 83 percent to 9 percent.\u00a0 Clinton continues to dominate in areas that have historically predicted the winner of the statewide race. In Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, the former secretary of state leads Trump by a 62 to 29 percent margin. Most of Trump\u2019s overall improvement in Pennsylvania, however, is attributed to his gains in western portion of the state, where he has a 16 point lead over Clinton. And in an election that has seen record low favorability and approval ratings, Clinton\u2019s positive numbers have declined since last month while Trump\u2019s has ticked up. Monmouth University contacted 403 Pennsylvania residents via telephone from October 29 to November 1. The poll has a margin of error of 4.9 percent. A similar poll released by CNN and ORC International showed that Clinton leads Trump by the same margin--4 percent--among likely Keystone State voters. When it comes to important issues, the poll says, voters have more faith in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to handle foreign policy, terrorism, health care and trade with other countries than her Republican counterpart.\u00a0 Voters, however, believe that Trump would approach economy-related issues more appropriately. What\u2019s more, the poll revealed, voters rate Clinton and Trump equally when it comes to immigration-related issues. ",

    "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch November 2, 2016, 2:50 PM Amazon upends Black Friday holiday calendar by starting sales today Email Amazon.com began offering Black Friday deals today, throwing down the gauntlet to its rivals as competition for holiday spending intensifies. New deals will be unveiled through Dec. 22 as often as every five minutes on everything from HDTVs to toys,\u00a0 according to the company.\u00a0 Amazon also is providing \u201ccurated\u201d gift guides that it says will take the guesswork out of shopping for friends and relatives. Special offers will be available for Amazon Prime members and users of its Alexa voice control system. \u201cIn the retail business what you are always looking for is how to get the jump on your competitors \u2013 that\u2019s the game,\u201d said Howard Davidowitz, the head of retail consultancy and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates. \u201cNow, here is the price leader, the fastest-growing retailer in the United States -- they\u2019re getting the jump on everybody. I think it\u2019s brilliant they are going to capture even more market share this way.\u201d Making a new venture into the physical world, online retail giant Amazon is planning to open brick and mortar grocery stores. Wall Street Journal... Amazon\u2019s move is the latest sign of the waning importance of Black Friday -- for decades \u201ccelebrated\u201d on the day after Thanksgiving -- as consumer spending continues to shift online. Retailers also have embraced other intra-seasonal \u201cholidays\u201d such as \u201cCyber Monday\u201d and \u201cSuper Monday\u201d in recent years. Even so, plenty of shoppers still spend on Black Friday, which\u00a0 RetailNext lists as the third busiest day of the year for brick-and-mortar stores. While some retailers began opening their doors on Thanksgiving Day, several chains that have done it in the past are letting their employees celebrate the holiday with their friends because the costs of opening the stores couldn\u2019t be justified by the sales that resulted. Moreover, the additional shopping hours shifted sales that would have happened later in the month and didn\u2019t lead to greater spending. \u201cPeople are going to spend what they spend,\u201d said Randy L. Allen, a senior lecturer in management at Cornell University\u2019s Johnson Graduate School of Management. Amazon might be trying to spread out its holiday shipments into early November to avoid a repeat of the bottlenecks it experienced a few years ago which resulted in customers not getting their holiday gifts on time, according to Allen. Shares of Amazon.com, which have been under pressure lately after the company\u2019s recent disappointing earnings report, fell $8.75, or 1.1 percent, to $776.66 in early afternoon trading.\u00a0 Even so, the stock remains up about 15 percent since the start of the year, handily outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index, which posted a 3 percent gain during the same time. \u00a0\u00a0 Whether other retailers will follow Amazon\u2019s lead in terms of rolling out Black Friday deals weeks before the actual Black Friday isn\u2019t clear \u201cbecause Amazon has obviously geared up to try and do this,\u201d according to Davidowitz.\u00a0 A spokesperson for the Seattle-based company couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. \u201cWhat the American consumer wants is a better and better deal,\u201d Davidowitz said. \u201cWhoever gives it to them wins.\u201d Amazon consumers, though, may find even better deals if they wait. \u201cWhile it is exciting for a large store like Amazon to begin their Black Friday deals, we recommend shoppers to pump the breaks,\u201d suggested Eric Jones of the website BestBlackFriday.com in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 \u201cThere are going to be a few gems here and there, but the actual doorbusters \u2014 the ones that people wait the entire year for \u2014 are still a few weeks away.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

The IRGC \u201cwill be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,\u201d according to the Iranian military commander, who said that these forces would operate with the goal of bolstering Iran\u2019s hardline regime and thwarting potential plots against the Islamic Republic. \u201cThe whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,\u201d Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran\u2019s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was\u00a0 quoted \u00a0as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC. The military leader\u2019s comments come as Iran is spending great amounts of money to upgrade its military hardware and bolster its presence throughout the Middle East and beyond. Iran intends\u00a0 to spend billions \u00a0to purchase U.S.-made planes that are likely to be converted for use in its air force. Congressional leaders and others suspect that Iran has used a large portion of the cash windfall it received as a result of last summer\u2019s nuclear agreement to upgrade its fighting capabilities war machine. \u201cThe IRGC is [the] strong guardian of the Islamic Republic,\u201d Abnoush was quoted as saying. \u201cThe Fedayeen of Velayat [fighting force] are under the order of Iran\u2019s Supreme leader. Defending and protecting the\u00a0Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.\u201d ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima November 2 at 8:01 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @nakashimae Senior FBI officials were informed about the discovery of new emails potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server at least two weeks before Director James B. Comey notified Congress, according to federal officials familiar with the investigation. The officials said that Comey was told that there were new emails before he received a formal briefing last Thursday, although the precise timing is unclear. The information goes beyond the details provided in the letter that Comey sent to lawmakers last week declaring that he was restarting the inquiry into whether Clinton mishandled classified material during her tenure as secretary of state. He wrote in the Friday letter that \u201cthe investigative team briefed me yesterday\u201d about the additional emails. The people familiar with the investigation said that senior officials had been informed weeks earlier that a computer belonging to former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) contained emails potentially pertinent to the Clinton investigation. Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin, shared the computer with her husband, from whom she is now separated. Comey did not notify Congress as soon as he learned about the emails because officials wanted additional information before proceeding, the officials said. Even after Comey received the desired information, major questions still remain \u2014 for instance, how many emails are related to Clinton or contain classified information. Since notifying Congress, Comey has drawn intense criticism from lawmakers in both parties as well as prominent former law enforcement officials for publicizing the investigation so close to the election when so little was known. It is unclear what FBI agents have learned since discovering the emails in early October. But officials say they gained enough information from the email metadata to take the next step, seeking a warrant to review the actual emails. That legal step prompted Comey\u2019s letter to Congress, which has made him a central figure during the stretch run of the presidential campaign. \u201cHe needed to make an informed decision, knowing that once he made that decision, he was taking it to another level,\u201d an official with knowledge of the decision-making process said. Law enforcement officials on Oct.\u00a03 seized the computer belonging to Weiner, who was under investigation for allegedly sending suggestive online messages to a teenage girl. As they examined his computer, investigators quickly stumbled on emails tied to Abedin. She and Weiner separated in August. Abedin, like Clinton, used an email address that was routed through Clinton\u2019s private server. Soon after the investigators found the new trove of thousands of emails, they notified the separate team of FBI agents in Washington that worked on the probe into Clinton\u2019s private email server, officials said. Comey said in July that the investigation was complete and that he would recommend to prosecutors that no charges be brought. After the agents on the Clinton case were notified in early October about the newly discovered emails, they in turn told FBI leaders about them. At that point, the leaders did not believe they had enough information to make a decision about what to do next, officials said. At a rally in at Kent State University, Oct. 31, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the FBI investigation into emails that might be connected to her private email server. She said \"by all means, they should look at\" emails on a computer owned by Anthony Weiner, the husband of her top aide, Huma Abedin. (The Washington Post) The senior FBI officials instructed the agents to do everything they could within legal limits to determine the relevance of the new emails, one official said. That review, including a closer examination of the email metadata, was an attempt to figure out the scope and volume of what the agents had found. An FBI spokesman declined to comment. In notifying lawmakers on Friday about the new investigative steps, Comey said he had been \u201cbriefed\u201d about the newly discovered emails a day earlier but did not mention that he had first heard about them before that. The news media has widely reported that Comey was first told about the emails last week. A formal briefing for Comey with the investigative team was held Oct.\u00a027 at FBI headquarters. At that point, Comey was given a complete presentation of everything the team knew about the trove. \u201cIt was a combination of assessments by the investigative team as to what it might be,\u201d the official said. Much was unknown about the contents and relevance of the thousands of emails. How many were to or from Clinton? Did any contain classified information? How many were duplicates of material the FBI had already reviewed? Was any of this significant to the Clinton email investigation that had been completed? \u201cAt that point, there was no way for Comey to know if the [Clinton investigators] had already seen the emails before or if they were new, old or different,\u201d an official said. \u201cAll of that was just unknown.\u201d But Comey and others felt there was enough information at that point to pursue a warrant, which would permit the investigators on the Clinton case to read the emails, officials said. They could not read them without legal permission because the emails had been discovered in the separate criminal probe involving Weiner. When Comey and the officials decided to seek a warrant, they knew that would involve more people, both at the FBI and the Justice Department. Comey was concerned that the explosive information that they had to renew the Clinton investigation would leak out. \u201cIt could not be done in secret,\u201d an official with knowledge of the investigation said. \u201cIt\u2019s a volatile subject and a major topic in the presidential campaign.\u201d But the overriding factor in Comey\u2019s decision was that he felt he had to tell Congress what he was doing because he had testified under oath this past summer and \u201ctold Congress and the world\u201d that the Clinton email investigation was complete, and now that was no longer true, an official said. Then, Comey had to figure out what to say to lawmakers, when he knew so little. He wanted the letter to be accurate and \u201ccircumspect,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe wanted it to be carefully, thoughtfully done and say no more than his investigators knew,\u201d the official said. After the formal briefing, staffers in Comey\u2019s office contacted senior officials at the Justice Department to notify them about the director\u2019s decision. The next day, Comey sent his letter. Two officials familiar with the case said it is unclear whether investigators will be able to conclude their review of the new emails before the election. President Obama addressed the controversy in an interview posted Wednesday by NowThisNews, saying, \u201cI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don\u2019t operate on innuendo, and we don\u2019t operate on incomplete information, and we don\u2019t operate on leaks.\u201d \u201cWhen this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn\u2019t anything there that was prosecutable,\u201d Obama said.

By Erin Cunningham November 2 at 1:01 PM Follow @erinmcunningham After driving from Pakistan the previous day to a U.N. \u201cencashment\u201d center on the outskirts of Kabul, a family of Afghans wake up at dawn and boil tea after a night sleeping on top of the trucks that carried them. (Andrew Quilty for The Washington Post) KABUL \u2014 Abdulhalim fled the northern city of Kunduz this month after militants and security forces had been clashing for days. Now he\u2019s 200 miles away in Kabul, sleeping in a tent and living on aid. He is part of a looming humanitarian crisis aid agencies here are struggling to contain. Before the current crisis, more than a million people had already been uprooted last year. This year, at least another million Afghans are \u201con the move\u201d inside Afghanistan and across its borders, in what the United Nations warns is an alarming new wave of displaced people. Many, like Abdulhalim, fled violence or conflict; others escaped hardships such as poverty or drought. Still others were forced to return from Pakistan and Iran. Even as the numbers grew, Afghanistan agreed to accept \u00adAfghan asylum seekers deported from the European Union. The deal, signed in October, could lead the E.U. to construct a separate terminal for deportees at Kabul\u2019s international airport, and as many as 100,000 Afghans could return. \u201cThis sudden increase [in the displaced] has put a lot of pressure on Afghanistan, which has had 30 years of war,\u201d said Nader Farhad, spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Kabul. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to put together the infrastructure, to provide the services that are required,\u201d he said, adding that the displaced need everything from food and blankets to jobs and health care. \u201cTo the European countries, we say: Instead of investing in the return of Afghans to Afghanistan, tackle the root causes,\u201d Farhad said. If the United Nations and other aid agencies fail to provide emergency assistance, \u201cit will be a humanitarian crisis,\u201d he said. Families wait outside for a U.N. \u201cencashment\u201d center to open last month on the outskirts of Kabul. Afghan returnees are provided with health checks, immunizations, and needs assessments. (Andrew Quilty for The Washington Post) Massive displacement has plagued Afghanistan for years, beginning with the Soviet invasion in 1979. That conflict kindled two decades of war. When the United States invaded in 2001, some 4\u00a0million Afghans were living in Pakistan and Iran. [ Europe pressing harder on countries to take back deported migrants ] Many of those refugees later returned, driven by hopes for stability and peace. But now, \u00adAfghanistan is witnessing some of its worst violence since the United States helped to topple the Taliban. More than 1,600 civilians were killed in the first six months of 2016, according to a U.N. report released in July. That was the highest number of civilian casualties in the first half of a year since the United Nations began keeping track in 2009. The violence has been driven by Taliban assaults on Afghan cities, putting more civilians in the crosshairs. And the clashes have pushed even more people from their homes. \u201cThe fighting was intense. There was artillery, rockets, aerial bombardment,\u201d Abdulhalim, 38, said of this month\u2019s days-long battle between Afghan and Taliban forces in Kunduz city. Insurgents briefly seized the city at the same time last year. \u201cMy children were screaming, our neighbors\u2019 houses destroyed,\u201d said Abdulhalim, who like many Afghans goes by one name. \u201cWe had no option but to leave.\u201d Afghan children arrive outside the U.N. center on the outskirts of Kabul. (Andrew Quilty for The Washington Post) A man prays beside the truck that carried him and his family to the center. (Andrew Quilty for The Washington Post) In Helmand province, in the restive south, more than 60,000 people have been displaced this year, according to the United Nations, and militants have fought pitched battles in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. At least 5,000 of those displaced in Helmand were forced out only in the past two months, the United Nations says, and thousands more have fled to neighboring provinces and beyond. \u201cIn some provinces, the [armed] groups have more power there, and the government, it is very difficult for us to reach\u201d the affected population, said Sayed Rohullah Hashemi, an adviser to the minister of refugees and repatriation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity to do so, especially in our ministry. The government cannot reach everyone on its own.\u201d In a dusty lot east of Kabul, the U.N. refugee agency has erected a center for the hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees arriving from Pakistan. At least 5,000 refugees cross the border from Pakistan every day. The United Nations gives them a small stipend and vaccinates the children against measles and polio. [ Afghan refugees, settled in Pakistan for decades, are being ordered to leave ] The influx began after Pakistani authorities announced a deadline for Afghan refugees \u2014 of which there were 1.7\u00a0million registered with the United Nations \u2014 to leave. Many of the refugees had lived in Pakistan for decades, or were even born there after their parents had fled Afghanistan. Jumauddin, 27, was born in Pakistan to Afghan parents. Now he is heading to Kunduz province, to the Khanabad district, where Taliban fighters hold sway. He says he has no choice. \u201cKabul is too expensive, and maybe in Kunduz I can plow a plot of land,\u201d Jumauddin said. \u201cI know that there was fighting there even last week, but I have no other option.\u201d More Afghan refugees arrive from Pakistan. (Andrew Quilty for The Washington Post) The government is worried about the return of refugees to areas where insurgents are active. But right now, the Taliban controls more territory than at any time since 2001. \u201cWe are facing the return of tens of thousands of Afghans each month. . . . This will add very much to the vicious cycle of insecurity and joblessness,\u201d said Bashir Bezhen, an Afghan analyst and political commentator. Reports have already surfaced of returning refugees clashing with locals over resources and land. The displaced are often rejected, or pushed into squalid camps. They also face the threat of forced eviction and rarely have access to clean water or food. \u201cThey are the poorest of the poor. They often live in open air,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s Farhad said. \u201cBut they should go back [to their homes] when they feel secure. It has to be voluntary and of their own accord.\u201d In the area where Abdulhalim took shelter, the displaced worried that the government would force them out. The fighting in Kunduz city had subsided, but they couldn\u2019t just pack up and go home. \u201cThey want us gone from here, but we don\u2019t have anything, not even the money to get back,\u201d Abdulhalim said. He first fled Kunduz on foot, with his children and the clothes on his back. Bezhen said that the government \u201cis incapable of creating jobs for these people or of improving the economy in the remote places where they live.\u201d He said criminal and terrorist networks will seek out the jobless and displaced youths. \u201cIt will push Afghanistan into deeper crisis,\u201d Bezhen said.

The potential reach for these ads, just days before Election Day, is pretty enormous: In 2014, the last year the World Series went to a Game 7, approximately 23.5 million people tuned in. Trump will run three ads during the game\u2014spots that cost approximately $200,000 apiece, a campaign source told CBS News. One, \u201cChange,\u201d hammers Clinton for being a Washington \u201cinsider\u201d and says Trump will \u201cturn Washington upside down.\u201d Another, \u201cChoice,\u201d tells voters they will choose between \u201ctwo Americas\u201d on Election Day. The third ad, \u201cCorruption,\u201d attacks Clinton for her \u201cpay to play politics\u201d at the Clinton Foundation and notes the FBI\u2019s new investigation into her private email practices .

    "text": "By David Nakamura November 2 at 11:46 AM Follow @davidnakamura President Obama addressed the FBI's announcement of new emails linked to Hillary Clinton, saying \"I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don't operate on innuendo and we don't operate on incomplete information and we don't operate on leaks.\" (Reuters) President Obama briefly addressed the FBI's reopened investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices for the first time, saying in an interview posted Wednesday that the agency does not \u201coperate on innuendo\" and emphasizing that there is no evidence that the Democratic presidential nominee violated the law. \u201cI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo, and we don't operate on incomplete information, and we don't operate on leaks,\u201d Obama said in the interview with NowThis News, which was filmed Tuesday. \u201cWe operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations, was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable.\u201d [ After another release of documents, FBI finds itself caught in a partisan fray ] The president's remarks came several days after FBI Director James B. Comey's surprise announcement Friday that agents would review thousands of emails potentially connected to Clinton that were discovered as part of a separate inquiry into former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is married to a high-ranking Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. President Obama breaks silence on Comey for first time -- \"We don't operate on innuendo\" ... Here's what he said: https://t.co/zEp13uqCrR \u2014 Jason Morrell (@CNNJason) November 2, 2016 \"I've made a very deliberate effort to make sure that I don't look like I'm meddling in what are supposed to be independent processes for making these assessments,\" Obama said. Of Clinton, he added: \"Setting aside the particulars of this case, I know that she is somebody who has always looked out for the interests of America and the American people first.\" Obama had not mentioned the case during recent appearances at Clinton campaign rallies in Florida and Ohio. This week, press secretary Josh Earnest said the White House would neither \u201cdefend nor criticize\u201d Comey's actions. Earnest also referred to the FBI chief as a man of integrity and good character. But Comey's disclosure, made in a notice to Congress that leaked to reporters, has prompted strong\u00a0criticism of the FBI from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers who have questioned whether Comey violated Justice Department policies by making a decision so close to Election Day that risked shaking up a political campaign. Speaking to reporters Oct. 31., White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama believes FBI Director James Comey is a man of integrity and is not trying to influence the U.S. presidential election by announcing scrutiny of additional emails linked to Democrat Hillary Clinton's private server. (Reuters) \u201cThe president doesn't believe that [Comey] is\u00a0secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party,\u201d Earnest told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cHe's in a tough spot, and he's the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions in administrations led by presidents in both parties.\u201d Aboard Air Force One on Obama's trip to a Clinton rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday, another White House spokesman insisted that \"nothing changed\" on the White House view of Comey despite Obama's remarks in the interview. The president does \"take seriously the longstanding norms and customs\" that have historically limited what law enforcement can say about a pending investigation, the spokesman, Eric Schultz, said. \"You will see the president went out of his way to say he wasn't going to comment on any specific investigation,\" he added. Though the race between Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump already had been narrowing, according to public polls, Clinton has lost more of her lead since Comey's announcement; polls on Wednesday showed the two candidates in a dead heat nationally. A new Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll finds Trump now holds an edge on which candidate is honest and trustworthy, while 59 percent disapproved of Clinton's handling of her email on a personal server while serving as secretary of state. In July, Comey said the FBI's investigation into 30,000 State Department emails that passed through Clinton's private server found that 110 contained classified information at the time she sent or received them, and a \"very small number\" included markings as such. He called Clinton and her aides \"extremely careless\" in their use of email, and suggested that hostile foreign governments could have gained access to them. But he recommended against criminal prosecution, saying there was no evidence that Clinton and her team had intentionally mishandled the information. Obama's interview with NowThis was scheduled as part of a final week campaign blitz as the president seeks to help Clinton by boosting Democratic voter turnout among young people and other groups that heavily supported his victories in 2008 and 2012. politics ",

Solis/AP Photo WATCH Mississippi Church Set on Fire and Vandalized With 'Vote Trump,' Authorities Launch Hate Crime Investigation 0 Shares Email Authorities in Greenville, Miss. have launched a hate crimes investigation after a local church was burned and vandalized with the words \"Vote Trump\" on Tuesday evening. \"This matter is being investigated as a hate crime,\" Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons said in a statement today. \"This act is a direct assault of people\u2019s right to freely worship. Moreover, this matter is being investigated with all deliberate speed and we will not rest until the culprit is found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" The Greenville Fire Department dispatched crews to the Hopewell M.B. Church around 9:16 p.m. on Tuesday after receiving reports of a fire, the department said in a news release today. First responders discovered the church \"engulfed in flames,\" and the building \"was vandalized with the words, 'Vote Trump' spray-painted on the side,\" the release said. Hopewell M.B. Church has a predominantly black congregation, and about 78 percent of Greenville's residents are African-American, The Associated Press reported. Agents with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives , a certified arson investigator and agents with the F.B.I. were at the church scene today. Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo ATF agents gather outside the fire damaged Hopewell M.B. Baptist Church in Greenville, Mississippi, Nov. 2, 2016. \"Vote Trump\" was spray-painted on an outside wall of the black member church. \"The FBI Jackson Division is aware of the situation in Greenville, and we are working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed,\" FBI Public Affairs Specialist Brett Carr said in a statement. The city is asking anyone with information to please contact the city at 662-378-1616 and 662-378-TIPS (8477). A law enforcement source told ABC News that the preliminary investigation determined that the fire appeared to be deliberately set, and it is being investigated as a criminal act rather than an accident. Evidence has been sent to a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives lab for additional analysis. The Trump Campaign put out a statement in response to the fire this evening, saying \"We are deeply saddened for the members of the Hopewell M.B. Church community and condemn in the strongest terms this terrible act that has no place in our society. We are grateful that no one was hurt and we urge witnesses with any information to come forward and help bring justice to those who are responsible.\u201d ABC News' Jack Date and Jason Volack contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

In battleground North Carolina, African American early voting rates are bouncing back from a slow start -- and after Republicans there imposed strict limits on the number of urban polling places during the first week of early voting In Chapel Hill, Obama issued this dire new warning about a Trump presidency: \u201cI hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders.\u201d\u00a0 The Latino vote will also be key for Clinton -- and those numbers are far better. In Florida, Latino early voting is up 139 percent from this point in 2012--driven in part by Trump\u2019s comments about Mexicans . \u201cI mean he starts out by insulting immigrants. He moves on to insult all Latinos,\u201d Clinton said in Florida. \u201cInsults African Americans, insults Muslims. Insults people with disabilities. Insults POWs. And insults women.\u00a0 I mean really.\u201d Obama came to Clinton\u2019s aid on another front today, criticizing the FBI director for telling Congress about new emails that may or may not be significant.

Don\u2019t believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we are slightly behind. We don\u2019t want to blow this.\u201d Trump is running like an underdog--even as new polls show the race in Florida is essentially tied. For a second day, he warned that a Hillary Clinton presidency could be mired in congressional and possibly criminal investigations. \u00a0\u201cIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. Haven\u2019t we just been through a lot with the Clintons? Right?\u201d Despite the public polling, Trump\u2019s team believes he has surged ahead here. It also believes it has drawn even in upper Midwest states like Michigan and Wisconsin. In Eau Claire on Tuesday night, Trump made a play for voters who cast early ballots for Hillary Clinton and are now suffering what he called buyer\u2019s remorse. \u201cA lot of stuff has come out since your vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo if you live here or in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Minnesota, those four places, you can change your vote to Donald Trump.

One of the last run-ins for Scott Michael Greene came less than three weeks ago, when police booted him from a high school football game in his hometown, Urbandale. \"I understand it was a Confederate flag and he was waving [it] during the national anthem, and he had picked out some people of color and was waving it,\" Urbandale Police Chief Ross McCarty said at a news conference announcing Greene's capture Wednesday morning. \"We never charged him with trespassing,\" McCarty said. \"We gave him a trespass warning.\" Scott Michael Greene of Urbandale, Iowa. Des Moines Police Department via AP In trying to piece together what set off the early-morning bloodshed across the Des Moines area, police said they were also investigating YouTube videos purportedly taken by Greene of the football game incident. In one clip, a still image shows a man holding a Confederate flag in front of black spectators. In another nearly 11-minute video, officers ask the person holding the cellphone camera to leave the school property because his flag was causing a disturbance. The man argued that he had a constitutional right to carry the flag. NBC News could not immediately verify all of the videos but interviewed people who were at the game and remembered the confrontation with Greene, after seeing his picture in media reports. No motive has been given in the \"ambush-style attacks\" against the two officers, police said, and it's unknown whether Greene's ouster from the game was a factor.

Anthony Beminio. The men were killed in separate incidents, and both were sitting in their patrol cars when they were targeted, police said. Greene served as a mechanic with the Army from 1989 to 1993 \u2014 spending just under two years in Germany \u2014 but was known to police in his quiet Des Moines suburb for various domestic incidents. He was jailed and charged with interference with official acts in April 2014 after he resisted Urbandale police who were trying to pat him down for a weapon, records show. They described him as hostile and combative. He pleaded guilty and was fined. Police arrived at his apartment complex two days later for a call about harassment. He threatened a man in the parking lot and uttered a racial slur used against African-Americans, according to a complaint. He pleaded guilty and received a suspended jail sentence and probation, and he was ordered to complete a substance abuse and psychological evaluation. In the latest incident, on Oct. 17, just after being ejected from the football game, Greene was involved in an incident against his 66-year-old mother, records show. Police gather evidence at the scene of a shooting Wednesday in Urbandale, Iowa. Charlie Neibergall / AP A criminal complaint says Patricia Ann Greene yelled at her son to remove his daughter's service dog from her home. Scott Michael Greene was wearing his deceased father's dog tags and his mother tried to tear them from around his neck, according to the complaint. He said his mother scratched and hit him in his face, and he used a cellphone to record the fight for evidence. A judge ordered Greene's mother to stay away from her son, and she was later released on a $1,000 cash bond. Patricia Ann Greene's home phone went unanswered Wednesday, and she couldn't be reached for comment. Des Moines and Urbandale police later said they had identified Greene as a suspect in Wednesday's killings through \"a series of leads and investigative tips.\" It was unclear whether either of the shootings was recorded on police cameras. Greene Wednesday night was in police custody at a Des Moines hospital for \"some kind of flare-up of an existing medical condition,\" a police spokesman said. He has yet to be charged. Erik Ortiz ",

Much is unknown about the newly discovered emails, including why they were on Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop in the first place. Ms. Abedin, through her lawyers, has adamantly denied using that laptop. One theory of how the emails ended up there, according to several of the people, is that they may have been inadvertently backed up or downloaded onto an older computer and then transferred from the older computer to the laptop\u2019s hard drive when the older computer was replaced. Mr. Obama, affecting a bit of the local accent, repeatedly said he had come to do \u201cbidness,\u201d name-dropped the Tar Heels basketball team, and could barely contain his laughter as he described some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more provocative remarks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he also directed the millennials in the audience to pay attention as he described the ugly history of the struggle for black voting rights and North Carolina\u2019s more recent effort to make it harder to cast a ballot. Alluding to a 100-year-old black woman and lifelong resident of the state whose voting eligibility was recently questioned, Mr. Obama said North Carolinians would be complicit in what he called \u201cvoter suppression\u201d if they did not show up at the polls. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote you\u2019ve done the work of those who would suppress your vote without them having to lift a finger,\u201d the president warned. He referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated allegations of voting fraud in \u201ccertain areas,\u201d making it clear that he thinks the Republican was talking about black communities. \u201cWhere are those \u2018certain areas\u2019 he\u2019s talking about?\u201d Mr. Obama asked with a knowing tone. Mr. Obama left little doubt about the implications in the state Mrs. Clinton has the best chance to turn from red to blue.\u201cIf Hillary wins North Carolina,\u201d he said, \u201cshe wins.\u201d In North Carolina, which Mr. Obama narrowly lost in 2012, early voting rates among African-Americans and young voters have so far been below the level of four years ago. Democrats have seen improvements in these numbers in recent days as more early voting locations have opened up and they were able to drive out African-American voters at \u201csouls to the polls\u201d events last weekend. On Thursday, Mr. Obama is to campaign in Miami and Jacksonville, two of Florida\u2019s most heavily African-American cities. He is scheduled to return to North Carolina on Friday, when he will appear in Charlotte and Fayetteville, both with sizable black populations, before going back to Orlando on Saturday for the final day of early voting in Florida.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A special team of analysts has been activated to sort and sift through the cache of newly discovered emails that kick-started the dormant Hillary Clinton email probe, two intelligence sources confirmed to Fox News. The sources say the multi-agency task force was re-engaged over the weekend, with analysts working overlapping shifts covering 16 hours a day to identify new classified material. The objective is to gain more clarity on the records recovered from ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer -- to assess if intelligence sources and methods were compromised and to inform FBI Director James Comey in case he faces more pressure for answers on the state of the investigation. Comey\u2019s announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing newly discovered emails in the Clinton case \u2013 discovered during the separate sexting probe of the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin \u2013 drew criticism from Clinton allies who accused him of meddling in the election. The White House, though, has defended Comey. His investigators are proceeding despite the controversy surrounding Friday\u2019s announcement. Sources told Fox News that as of Tuesday afternoon, agents were using computer software to exploit the relevant\u00a0emails from Weiner's laptop. This process is being undertaken by members of the FBI's Computer Analysis and Response Team, or CART. The program being used was developed by FBI forensic computer experts. The program knocks out duplicates from the cache and, with Sunday\u2019s warrant, investigators will then be able to read the email content. The first step is relatively quick. \u201cYou can process a very large set of emails that eliminate duplicates, eliminate redundancies and really focus your attention on the documents in those emails that are new,\u201d said former Justice Department official Thomas Dupree. If new records are identified, a second phase kicks in during which investigators will physically review the emails, then farm them out to the intelligence agencies for final classification. The Donald Trump campaign asserts that highly sensitive documents are on the computer. \u201cThey have probably discovered \u2026 classified information in this 650,000,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a Trump surrogate. The FBI is not commenting. The Justice Department sent a letter to Capitol Hill pledging every available resource to expedite the review before Election Day. Karen Dunn, representing Abedin, told reporters that Abedin was surprised to learn her emails were on the computer. \"From the beginning, Ms. Abedin has complied fully and voluntarily with State Department and law enforcement requests, including sitting for hours-long interviews and providing her work-related and potentially work-related documents,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWhile the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative.\u201d And late Tuesday, the conservative group Judicial Watch released new Clinton emails, uncovered by the FBI in the first review, showing that in November 2010, Clinton\u2019s unsecured server was attacked 10 times in two days. The Secret Service was informed. The FBI director said in July there was no evidence of a breach, though it could not be ruled out. A government official also confirmed Tuesday that Comey and his boss Attorney General Loretta Lynch met for the first time since his decision to re-initiate the Clinton email investigation. The official characterized the meeting as cordial.

STEPHANIE KEITH / Reuters Share advertisement STANDING ROCK, North Dakota \u2014 Police in riot gear shot rubber bullets and used pepper spray on demonstrators \u2014 who call themselves water protectors \u2014 on the shoreline of the Cantapeta Creek, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation here on Wednesday. After a few relatively peaceful days at the campground where thousands have gathered to demonstrate against a controversial North Dakota oil pipeline, demonstrators put out calls on social media to \"make your way to the river\" for a \"river action,\" but to do so \"in prayer.\" In a Facebook Live stream, Cempoalli Twenny, who says he is at Standing Rock to protect the water, said, \"The pipeline is getting really close to the river now, so it's crunch time.\" Play Pipeline Protests: How Things Started 2:31 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161103014805if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/761437763953\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Demonstrators on the shoreline prayed, played drums, sang, and waded into the river towards the base of the hill where armed police stood. A confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site. It was a \"100 percent peaceful protest,\" according to activist Erin Schrode, who was shot in the lower back with a rubber bullet while standing on the shoreline opposite police. Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline.

On Monday, people who identified themselves as water protectors waded across the creek to the hill to request that law enforcement move off the sacred area. According to the Morton County Sheriff's Department Public Information Officer, the police remained there \"to prevent criminal trespass on private property.\" A person pours a pepper spray antidote into a protester's eyes during a protest against the building of a pipeline on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation near Cannonball, North Dakota, U.S. November 2, 2016.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has sued the Army Corps of Engineers for not consulting them on the route of the pipeline. Last week, police in riot gear used pepper spray and armored vehicles to disperse protesters and arrested more than 140 people. \"[President] Barack Obama said we can wait a few weeks.

    "text": "WikiLeaks email shows Justice official alerting Clinton team to House hearing Kevin Johnson , USA TODAY 9:39 a.m. EDT November 3, 2016 3.7k Shares Share Another day, another WikiLeaks email leak. USA TODAY WASHINGTON \u2014 A Justice Department official offered Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta a \"heads-up'' last year to a pending congressional hearing where a Justice colleague was likely to be questioned about Hillary Clinton's email use as secretary of State, according to hacked communications released Wednesday by WikiLeaks. In the exchange, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, writing on a personal email account, appears to alert Podesta to a House Judiciary Committee hearing later that day where the Justice Department's Civil Division chief was slated to testify. \"Likely to get questions on State Department emails,'' Kadzik wrote May 19. The message goes on to inform Podesta of an update in a\u00a0Freedom of Information Act request for State Department communications that \"indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.'' Attached to the Kadzik communication was a message that appears to be forwarded by Podesta to various Clinton staffers, stating: \"Additional chances for mischief.'' Kadzik also was the author of a letter earlier this week providing the Justice Department's response\u00a0to questions posed by House and Senate leaders about the FBI's new review of recently discovered emails that could have a bearing on the previously closed investigation into Clinton's handling of classified information at the State Department. Obama critical of FBI 'leaks' and 'innuendo' in Clinton investigation \"We assure you that the department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,'' Kadzik wrote. Attorney General Loretta Lynch had opposed FBI Director James Comey's decision last week to formally notify Congress of the email discovery, a move that rocked the presidential race in the last days of the general election. The Justice Department did not immediately comment Wednesday on the WikiLeaks release. Asked Wednesday about the relationship between Podesta and Kadzik, Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri characterized the communications as \"stolen emails that haven\u2019t been authenticated.\u201d She said the information was \"leaked for the purpose of damaging our campaign.''

Meanwhile, Donald Trump's electoral-vote total has grown to 180, up from 157 in mid-October. And we have 84 electoral votes in the Tossup column. Likely Dem: CA, CT, DC, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, NJ, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA (182 electoral votes) Lean Dem: CO, ME (3 EVs), MI, MN, NV, NM, PA, VA, WI (92) Tossup: AZ, FL, NE (1 EV), NH, NC, OH, UT (84) Lean GOP: AK, GA, IN, IA, KS, ME (1EV), MO, MT, ND, SC, SD, TX (108) Likely GOP: AL, AR, ID, KY, LA, MS, NE (4 EVs), OK, TN, WV, WY (72) The big changes here: We moved Georgia, Iowa, and Maine's 2nd Congressional District from Tossup to Lean GOP; we moved Nevada from Tossup to Lean Dem; and we moved both New Hampshire and North Carolina from Lean Dem back to Tossup. We attribute these changes to the natural tightening of the race, with Republican voters coming back home to Trump. But we will continue to watch any fallout from last Friday's Comey news. Can Trump scale Clinton's Big Blue Wall in the Midwest? In this tightening race, Trump's Electoral College map is still daunting: Even if he runs the table in Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio, he's still short of 270 electoral votes. Indeed, give Trump ALL of the 84 electoral votes in our Tossup column, and he falls short of 270 (it gets him to 264). So his best -- and maybe only -- path is picking up one of Michigan (where Clinton has led in every public poll since August), Pennsylvania (where another recent poll had her up double digits), or Wisconsin. It's why Trump was campaigning yesterday in Wisconsin, and also why Clinton is now spending ad dollars in Wisconsin and Michigan. And guess what: The Marquette Law poll, the gold standard of Wisconsin polling, comes out with a poll this afternoon. The different paths to 270: Here are a few different scenarios: Clinton - 2012 plus: Clinton could largely match Barack Obama's 2012 performance against Mitt Romney, swapping a win in Iowa for one in fast-changing North Carolina. Potential outcome: Clinton 340, Trump 198. Clinton loses: AK, AZ, GA, IN, IA, KS, ME (1EV), MO, MT, ND, NE (1 EV), SC, SD, TX, UT Clinton wins: CO, FL, ME (3 EVs), MI, MN, NH, NC, NV, NM, OH, PA, VA, WI Clinton - Winning the Sun Belt, losing the Rust Belt - Clinton could lose Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania AND Wisconsin but make up ground in the South and West. Potential outcome: Clinton 303, Trump 235. Clinton loses: AK, GA, IN, IA, KS, ME (1EV), MO, MT, ND, NE (1 EV), OH, PA, SC, SD, TX, UT, WI Clinton wins: AZ, CO, FL, ME (3 EVs), MI, MN, NH, NC, NV, NM, VA Clinton - Winning without Florida and Ohio. It hasn't been done since 1960, but she could do it. Here's one potential path with a potential outcome of Clinton 278, Trump 260. Clinton loses: AK, AZ, FL, GA, IN, IA, KS, ME (1EV), MO, MT, ND, NE (1 EV), NC, OH, SC, SD, TX, UT Clinton wins: CO, ME (3 EVs), MI, MN, NH, NV, NM, PA, VA, WI Trump - Rust Belt Plus.. Trump hopes to throw traditionally blue states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin into play. He could do it, but he'd still have to go on offense in another big state -- like North Carolina or Florida -- too. Here's one such path, with a possible outcome of Trump 279, Clinton 259. Trump wins: AK, AZ, FL, GA, IN, IA, KS, ME (1EV), MO, MT, ND, NE (1 EV), NH, OH, PA, SC, SD, TX, UT, WI Trump loses: CO, ME (3 EVs), MI, MN, NC, NV, NM, VA Trump - A path without Clinton firewall states: Polling in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Hampshire and New Mexico has consistently shown a Clinton advantage. If that wall holds, and if Trump fails to play offense in a classically blue Rust Belt state like Wisconsin, here's what he'd likely have to do. Possible outcome: Trump 275, Clinton 263. Trump wins: AK, AZ, CO, FL, GA, IN, IA, KS, ME (1EV), MO, MT, NC, ND, NE (1 EV), NV, OH, SC, SD, TX, UT Trump loses: ME (3 EVs), MI, MN, NH, NM, PA, VA, WI Nail-biting for Dems? With that Wisconsin poll coming out today, we've observed that Democrats are more nervous right now than they've been this entire general-election race. Is this race as stable as it's always been, and the moves that we're seeing all noise and typical campaign moves? Or is something really going on here? Clinton fired up in Florida Play ",

USA TODAY Sports Charlie Sheen arrives to Cleveland hours before Game 7. (Photo: Michael Singer, USA TODAY Sports) CLEVELAND \u2013 At the beginning of the World Series there was a sizable\u00a0social media push to have Charlie Sheen throw out the first pitch in Cleveland. And though that didn\u2019t materialize, a plan was finalized late Tuesday night to do the next best thing; get Sheen to Game 7. Sheen, better known in these parts as cult figure Rick \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn from the movie Major League, arrived in Cleveland in midafternoon on Wednesday about four hours before first pitch. Donning an Indians hat, Sheen promised he had his trademark \"Wild Thing\" glasses, but he wouldn\u2019t put them on until game time. He also brought a superstitious \u201cJobu\u201d doll from the movie. World Series Game 7 lineups: Indians react to Game 6 failings \u201cI brought this guy, so the Cubs are in serious trouble,\u201d Sheen joked. He was asked what sort of advice his character would give the Indians heading into Game 7, and Sheen turned back the clock. \u201cAct like it\u2019s Game 7,\u201d he said. \u201cEmbrace all those childhood fantasies and walkoff moments that you had as a child and bring them to tonight.\u201d A well-connected promoter and a group of local entrepreneurs with strong ties to the area played a huge role in getting him to the game. Both parties were working independently on the move before realizing their shared goal and collaborating. Together they felt it wasn\u2019t right to have a Game 7 without Sheen in the house. \u201c(Major League) has been part of Cleveland folklore my whole life,\u201d said Tony Madalone, owner of Cleveland T-shirt company Fresh Brewed Tees. Madalone says his company had T-shirt designs ready in case the Indians join the Cavaliers as local title winners. \u201cThis is good for the culture because it\u2019s fun,\u201d said Bobby George, another Cleveland entrepreneur. \u201cWe\u2019re not bringing him in because he\u2019s a celebrity.\u201d Sheen\u2019s mom is from Cleveland, and he said he\u2019s been watching the Indians since June. \u201cIn fact it was in the middle of that 14-game winning streak this year when I sparked up and I told a friend of mine there\u2019s a darkhorse team in the AL,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out for Cleveland. And here we are.\u201d Gallery: Recent Game 7s ",

    "text": "As evidence, the Fed noted that \"job gains have been solid. Household spending has been rising moderately.\" Still, not everything is rosy. The officials also pointed out that \"business fixed investment has remained soft.\" Looking at the good and the bad, the Fed concluded \"near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\" That means the target range for the federal funds rate will remain at 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent for now. For you, it means interest rates that rise and fall with that benchmark will hold steady. So rates on car loans, credit cards and home equity credit lines should remain at current levels. Economists had widely predicted the Fed would stand pat, given how close Election Day is. Rate hikes can upset financial markets \u2014 and such turmoil could unfairly influence voters' perceptions of the economy just before they vote. But if November was too soon, then next month could be just right. \"The Fed continues to inch even closer to a December rate hike,\" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said in a statement. Article continues after sponsorship David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, sees even more than inching. He suggests the Fed is taking clear steps toward a hike in December. \"Only a bad-news economic surprise would stop it this time,\" Wessel said in a tweet. The growing prospect of more expensive loans apparently didn't sit well with many investors, who sold off stocks after the Fed Open Market Committee's statement came out. \"The market may be wondering if there's enough evidence of a stronger economy to warrant a rate hike,\" Krosby said of the across-the-board dip in stock prices. But there may be another reason for the market pullback on Wednesday afternoon, according to some analysts. Top Fed Officials Field Questions From Activists Unhappy Over Monetary Policy \"Typically, the markets would be breathing a sigh of relief after a meeting such as this \u2014 where the Fed did exactly what everyone thought they would do and didn't come out with any surprises,\" Chris Gaffney, president of World Markets at EverBank, said in an assessment. \"But with the election just days away and polls showing the race tightening, markets continue to be worried \u2014 not about a FOMC move but rather what the election results will be.\" By its mid-December meeting, the Fed will have in hand the election results, as well as two more months' worth of data on jobs, covering October and November. Assuming there are no huge surprises, the Fed would be able to nudge up rates, just as it did last December. The central bank has been restraining rates for years, hoping that cheap loans would help revive the economy following the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Policymakers want to get rates back up to more historically normal levels to prevent supercheap loans from giving rise to asset bubbles and consumer inflation. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP November 2, 2016, 10:41 AM Scott Michael Greene, Des Moines area police shooting suspect, captured in Iowa Email Last Updated Nov 2, 2016 1:36 PM EDT DES MOINES, Iowa -- Authorities apprehended a man Wednesday suspected in the early morning killings of two Des Moines area police officers who were shot to death while sitting in their patrol cars in what authorities described as separate ambush-style attacks. Scott Michael Greene Des Moines Police Department Officers from the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Iowa State Patrol took 46-year-old Scott Michael Greene into custody, police said. Des Moines Sgt. Paul Parizek said Greene was suspected in the killings but hasn\u2019t yet been charged. He was being treated at a Des Moines hospital. His arrest came about eight hours after the killings of two officers. CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI-TV reports the arrest happened shortly after 9 a.m. Parizek told reporters that Greene was walking along a gravel road, flagged down a state Department of Natural Resources employee, presented his driver\u2019s license and told the employee to call 911. Police responded to a report of shots fired at 1:06 a.m. and found an Urbandale Police Department officer who had been shot. Authorities from several agencies saturated the area after that shooting, and about 20 minutes later discovered that a Des Moines officer who had responded to the initial killing had been shot in a patrol car at an intersection, Parizek said. The shootings happened less than 2 miles apart and both took place along main streets that cut through residential areas. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody out there shooting police officers. We hope to find him before somebody else gets hurt,\u201d Parizek said at an early morning news conference, during which he stopped briefly as he worked to control his emotions. Parizek later identified the slain officers as Des Moines Police Sgt. Anthony \u201cTony\u201d Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin. Beminio was married and had children, Parizek said. Martin was single. Greene is white. Parizek said the officers killed also were white. Police officers gather evidence at the scene of a shooting Nov. 2, 2016, in Urbandale, Iowa. Two Des Moines area police officers were shot to death in ambush-style attacks while they were sitting in their patrol cars. AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall The shootings follow a spate of police killings, including ambushes of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 and three were killed later that month in Baton Rouge. Des Moines and Urbandale Police later said they had identified Greene as a suspect in the killings, describing him as armed and dangerous. Parizek said investigators determined Greene was a suspect through \u201ca series of leads and investigative tips.\u201d \u201cThere is a clear and present danger to police officers,\u201d Parizek said. He said officers were conducting patrols in pairs for protection. Urbandale Sgt. Chad Underwood said he believes this is the first time an officer in his department has been shot in the line of duty. Wednesday marked the first time a Des Moines police officer has been shot and killed on duty since 1977, when two died in separate incidents months apart, according to the Iowa Department of Public Safety. With Wednesday\u2019s deaths, 114 officers have died in the line of duty in 2016, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page . The number reflects a roughly 6 percent increase over last year. Police in Urbandale, Iowa, set up a blockade after two police officers were shot and killed in separate attacks described as \u201cambush-style\u201d in Des Moines, Iowa, Nov. 2, 2016. Reuters/Brian Frank Urbandale is a suburb of about 40,000 people in the Des Moines metro area with about 50 officers. Des Moines, a city of about 210,000, has about 375 sworn officers. Urbandale officers are equipped with body cameras, but they don\u2019t run constantly and it\u2019s unclear whether there was video of the shootings. The attacks on police this summer in Dallas and Baton Rouge came in the wake of several high-profile police shootings of black men, fueling a national debate about police use of force, especially against minorities - a frequent topic in the nation\u2019s presidential race. Republican nominee Donald Trump has argued that police need the freedom to use greater force, while Democrat Hillary Clinton has taken a more nuanced position of supporting officers while calling attention to what she and others have called examples of bias in policing. Parizek said investigators have no idea what led to the killings, and he speculated that they may never be sure about the shooter\u2019s motivations. He said the officers\u2019 deaths are a blow to all officers in the Des Moines area. \u201cThey are our friends and co-workers,\u201d he said. \u201cDes Moines is not a big city. We all know each other. We\u2019re heartbroken.\u201d Later Wednesday, police in Urbandale confirmed that Greene was removed from a high school football game last month because he displayed a Confederate flag during the national anthem. Urbandale Police Chief Ross McCarty told reporters that officers removed him from the football game. McCarty said some spectators complained after Greene waved the flag in front of spectators who are minorities. Greene shot a video of the Oct. 14 incident that he posted online. He complained to officers that his constitutional rights were being violated because they were throwing him out, but police told him he was on private property and needed to leave. Court records show Greene was jailed and charged with interference with official acts after resisting Urbandale police officers trying to pat him for a weapon on April 10, 2014. An Urbandale officer described him as hostile and combative. He entered a guilty plea and was fined. Two days later Urbandale police were called to answer a complaint of harassment at the apartment complex where Greene lived. The complaint said he threatened to kill another man during a confrontation in the parking lot. \u201cI will kill you n-----. F---ing kill you,\u201d Greene said to the victim, according to the complaint. Greene was charged with harassment. He pleaded guilty and received a suspended jail sentence and a year of probation. Court records show he completed a substance abuse and psychological evaluation. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "PODESTA: DOJ OFFICIAL 'KEPT ME OUT OF JAIL' \u201cAnother filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails,\u201d he wrote. Kadzik likely was referencing a brief submitted on May 18 in which the State Department proposed releasing 55,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails in January 2016. Podesta forwarded Kadzik\u2019s message to a group of top Clinton aides \u2013 including Press Secretary Brian Fallon and adviser Cheryl Mills \u2013 with the cryptic comment: \u201cAdditional chances for mischief.\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump referenced the email during a rally in Miami on Wednesday. He said Kadzik was \u201cfeeding information to the Clinton campaign.\u201d \u201cThese are the people that want to run our country folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe spread of political agendas into the Justice Department \u2026 is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country.\" The relationship between Kadzik and Podesta goes back nearly two decades. When prosecutors were eyeing Podesta for his alleged role in trying to secure a job for then-Bill Clinton mistress Monica Lewinsky, Kadzik successfully represented Podesta. Later, Kadzik took a job lobbying for a presidential pardon for tax cheat Marc Rich. A congressional report indicated Kadzik got the job in part because of his rapport with Podesta. A Justice Department spokesman, though, downplayed the significance of Kadzik\u2019s 2015 email, saying it was \u201cabout public information\u201d and sent \u201cin his personal capacity, not during work hours.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t communicating via official channels because it wasn\u2019t official business,\u201d Kevin Lewis told FoxNews.com. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t emailing as \u2018Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik.\u2019\u201d Lewis, who would not characterize the substance of the email, said officials in the department do not typically provide campaign advice. \u201cIt is not department practice to provide any strategic guidance to any campaign,\u201d said Lewis, who did not answer when asked if Kadzik\u2019s behavior was acceptable to the Justice Department.\u00a0 Kadzik's \"heads up\" may have been of limited use to the Clinton campaign.\u00a0 Benjamin Mizer, a deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the Civil Division, did end up testifying before a House subcommittee hearing at 1 p.m. on May 19. However, it doesn\u2019t appear the email topic came up in his questioning. And it seems the Clinton camp already was well aware of the State Department FOIA case filing. On May 18, Fallon received a copy of the filing from someone inside the Justice Department and forwarded the document to Mills, Podesta and others. It\u2019s unknown who the original sender was because the person\u2019s name was stripped before Fallon forwarded the message. Lewis told FoxNews.com he also didn\u2019t know \u201cwho Brian spoke to.\u201d \u201cDOJ just filed a briefing saying the gov\u2019t proposes releasing HRC\u2019s cache of work-related emails in January 2016,\u201d Fallon wrote. Mills replied: \u201cget out!???\u201d Fallon gave another update to Clinton\u2019s most-trusted aide, Huma Abedin, on May 19. \u201cDOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,\u201d he wrote. Most of the 55,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over were eventually released, with redactions, by March 2016. The Clinton campaign disputed that Kadzik had alerted them to anything about the email release or the House hearing. \"Without authenticating the email itself, the idea the campaign wasn\u2019t aware of a public hearing and a public notice in real time is nonsense,\" Caplin told Fox News in an email.
