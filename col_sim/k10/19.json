    "text": "President-elect agrees to settle Trump University lawsuits for $25 million Trump University launch Donald Trump attends the launch of Trump University in 2005. Donald Trump attends the launch of Trump University in 2005. (Bebeto Matthews / Associated Press) Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump agreed Friday to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits against his now-defunct Trump University for real estate investors, averting a trial in a potentially embarrassing case that he had vowed during the campaign to keep fighting. The settlement came 10 days before jury selection was scheduled to begin in one of the three cases. The complaints accused Trump University, which wasn't an accredited school, of defrauding students who paid up to $35,000 a year to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's real estate secrets. If the proposed settlement is approved by a federal judge, about 6,000 students covered in two-class action lawsuits in San Diego would share $21 million, and Trump will pay $4 million to settle a complaint filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in 2013. Under the terms, Trump admitted no wrongdoing. The settlement lifts what would probably be a major obstacle for Trump as he works to fill key executive branch positions and get acquainted with foreign leaders. The San Diego trial, on a case filed in 2010, was expected to last several weeks, guaranteeing daily news coverage of a controversy that dogged him during the campaign. Trump's political rivals seized on the lawsuits to try to portray him as dishonest and deceitful. Trump brought more attention to them by repeatedly assailing Indiana-born judge Gonzalo Curiel, who oversaw the two San Diego cases. Trump claimed the judge's Mexican heritage exposed a bias. The thousands of former students covered by the San Diego lawsuits will be eligible to receive at least half and possibly all their money back, as much as $35,000, said Jason Forge, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' attorneys waived their fees. Trump has denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he would not settle. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency. \"I could have settled this case numerous times but I don't want to settle cases when we're right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,\" Trump said at the time. Two days after the election, Trump's lead attorney in the San Diego cases, Daniel Petrocelli, said he was \"all ears\" to settlement talks and accepted an offer to have U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller of San Diego broker negotiations. Forge said the agreement was reached an hour before a hearing for Curiel to weigh Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the Jan. 20 inauguration. The plaintiffs' attorney said he \"definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach\" from Trump's camp after the election. \"We were at each other's throat for 6 \u00bd years and were able to find the common ground with them and do something good there,\" Forge told reporters. Schneiderman called the agreement a \"stunning reversal\" for the president-elect, saying Trump \"fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes.\" ",

    "text": "Matt Stevens Contact Reporter The number of dead trees in California\u2019s drought-stricken forests has risen dramatically to more than 102 million in what officials described as an unparalleled ecological disaster that heightens the danger of massive wildfires and damaging erosion. Officials said they were alarmed by the increase in dead trees, which they estimated to have risen by 36 million since the government\u2019s last survey in May. The U.S. Forest Service, which performs such\u00a0surveys of forest land, said  Friday that 62 million trees have died this year alone. \u201cThe scale of die-off in California is unprecedented in our modern history,\u201d\u00a0said Randy Moore, the forester for the region of the U.S. Forest Service that includes California. Trees are dying \u201cat a rate much quicker than we thought.\u201d Scientists say five years of drought are to blame for much of the destruction. The lack of rain has put California\u2019s trees under considerable stress, making them more susceptible to the organisms, such as beetles, that can kill them. \u00a0Unusually high temperatures have added to the trees\u2019 demand for water, exacerbating an already grim situation. The majority of the dead trees are  in the southern and central Sierra Nevada region, officials said, though they warned  that high mortality levels are also creeping into forests in Northern California, notably\u00a0Siskiyou, Modoc, Plumas and Lassen counties.\u00a0 Adrian Das, an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, needs only to step outside his office in Sequoia National Park to see the extent of the damage.\u00a0 \u201cYou look across the hillside on a side of the road, and you see a vast landscape of dead trees,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s pretty startling.\u201d Das said the parts of the forest at lower elevations \u2014 about 5,000 to 6,000 feet \u2014 continue to get hit the hardest. In the higher elevations, it can sometimes appear as if  there is no drought and the trees are much healthier.\u00a0 \u201cWe have sugar pines here \u2014 grand trees that can live for 500 years,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cEverywhere you walk, through certain parts of these forests, at least half of these big guys are dead.\u201d\u00a0 An aerial survey of tree mortality in California In May 2016, an aerial survey of was conducted in Placerville, near the Sacramento area. In May 2016, an aerial survey of was conducted in Placerville, near the Sacramento area. See more videos Although California enjoyed a wet start to the water year in Northern California, the central and southern parts of the state remain locked in what federal officials classify as \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d drought. \u201cThis staggering and growing number of tree deaths should be concerning for everyone,\u201d said Max Gomberg, the climate and conservation manager at the State Water Resources Control Board. \u201cIt helps us realize just how intense and extreme this drought has been \u2014 particularly for Central and Southern California.\u201d A single year of average precipitation, which parts of the state got last year, would not end the drought or cause trees to stop dying, experts said. Even with a historic\u00a0deluge this winter, Moore said, die-off would continue for at least a year or two. Dead trees create various hazards for Californians. For example,  such trees are weak and can fall more easily than healthy trees. \u00a0In October 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency and formed a tree-mortality task force to help mobilize additional resources for the safe removal of fallen and dying trees. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has reallocated $43 million in California this fiscal year to \u201cconduct safety-focused restoration along roads, trails and recreation sites,\u201d the agency said in a statement. Then there is the wildfire danger. California was struck this summer by a series of deadly wildfires that destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee. Officials at the time said some of those fires were fueled by dead trees. When a lot of dead fuel remains on the ground, fires burn hotter and  damage the soil, experts said.\u00a0Whenever rain eventually arrives, the water cannot filter through the soil as easily, so it moves the top layer, creating the potential for mudslides and destroying root systems. \u201cLike a sheet of glass,\u201d said Scott McLean, a battalion chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cWhere\u2019s that water going to go? Quickly downhill.\u201d Once fires burn through the fuel on the ground, they can climb up a \u201cladder\u201d of dry branches and timber until they get into the crown of the tree, McLean said. And once a fire gets to the top of a tree, it can spread quickly \u2014 hopping from tree to tree rather than winding more slowly across the ground. The forest service said longer, hotter fire seasons  are likely to continue  for years to come. Officials  said this and increased development in forested areas is driving up the cost of fighting fires. Some experts, however, have questioned whether there's a correlation between high levels of dead trees and fire severity. Officials say that fire management consumed more than half of the Forest Service\u2019s budget last year. A blaze in Monterey County this summer burned for months, making it one of the costliest fires to fight in U.S. Forest Service history. \"These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire, complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur, and pose a host of threats to life and property across California,\u201d U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

USA TODAY Recording artist Marc Anthony (L) and model Shannon De Lima attend the 15th annual Latin GRAMMY Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Nov. 20, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo: Lester Cohen, WireImage) Marc Anthony and Shannon De Lima are ending their union. E! News and Us Weekly \u00a0report that the 48-year-old Love Is All singer and 28-year-old Venezuelan model have recently separated after two years of marriage. The news comes on the heels of\u00a0Anthony\u2019s\u00a0 headline-making appearance at the 17th annual\u00a0 Latin Grammy Awards , during which the multi-hyphenate entertainer received the Person of the Year award \u2013 as well as a much-talked-about kiss from his ex-wife, singer/actress\u00a0Jennifer Lopez. During his acceptance speech, Anthony compared the moment to \"kissing a sister.\" And Lopez's manager, Benny Medina,\u00a0told\u00a0 TMZ \u00a0the entertainers, who share twins, are \"absolutely, categorically, 100% not back together.\" Nonetheless, Lopez\u00a0offered heartfelt remarks during the tribute to Anthony\u00a0Thursday night.\u00a0\"Marc, you are a living legend who has laid bare your heart and soul on your musical journey,\" she said in Spanish. \"We've learned so much and we've grown so much, and you've always been so many things in my life: my mentor, a twin soul, a father who's not only the person of the year, he's the person of all time.\" \u2014 Latin GRAMMYs (@LatinGRAMMYs) November 18, 2016 Anthony dedicated the honor to his five children and \"all those people who told me I would never make it.\" He did not mention De Lima. Anthony and De Lima were first romantically linked in January 2012, seven months after Anthony and Lopez announced their plans to dissolve their seven-year marriage in a joint statement. Following a brief split in January 2013, Anthony and De Lima reconciled, eventually marrying in a private ceremony in the Dominican Republic in November 2014. They do not have any children together.

(Chicago Tribune) Many of Chicago\u2019s immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal permission express concern for the future following\u00a0president-elect Donald Trump's pledge this week to immediately deport as many as 3 million people. (Chicago Tribune) Marwa Eltagouri , Tony Briscoe and Nereida Moreno Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Lily Martinez had never been involved in activism. But after Donald Trump was elected president, the 20-year-old Little Village resident felt an immediate call to action, determined that his stance on unauthorized immigrants \u2014 saying he intends to immediately deport millions \u2014 would not define her community's future. So the day after the election, she took a train to Trump Tower, joining thousands in protest. Trump's win has prompted alarm in the immigrant community, but it's also sparked a sense of duty among many to actively fight his proposed policies, including those who have never been involved in immigration advocacy. \"I've never been a part of anything like this. It feels like I'm living in a different time period,\" said Martinez, who is a U.S. citizen. \"The fact that I have to stand out on the streets and cry and scream and lock hands with people beside me, it feels like I'm living through the civil rights movement.\" Martinez's own predominantly Latino neighborhood, typically vibrant, is now \"gloomy,\" she said. Elders no longer sit outside on the streets. People fear deportation and don't think they have the resources to obtain the documents they need, so they \"just don't want to show their faces.\" Although Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised Chicago would continue to be a sanctuary city, where local law enforcement cannot ask about residents' immigration status, families and activists are uncertain whether that protection is enough. Trump vowed during his campaign to block federal funding to sanctuary cities, ramp up deportations, increase prison sentences for those who re-enter the country and build a wall along the Mexican border. (John Byrne, Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart) The immigrant community as a result feels powerless, unable to predict either the swiftness or severity of the enactment of Trump's plans. For example, those who've found relief through President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers legal protection to about 742,000 people who were brought to the U.S. as children and stayed here illegally, now fear Trump will rescind the executive order that created DACA. Various pro-immigrant groups are urging unauthorized immigrants to avoid applying for government programs such as DACA, concerned their information could be used to tip off enforcement agencies. About 450,000 unauthorized immigrants lived in Illinois in 2014, compared with about 500,000 in 2009, according to a study released in September by the Pew Research Center. Unauthorized immigrants make up 3.5 percent of Illinois' population and 24 percent of all foreign-born residents. About 71 percent of the state's unauthorized immigrants are Mexican. \"We don't know how to even get ready because we don't know how (Trump's) politics are going to look,\" said Laura Mendoza, a 27-year-old who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 6 and does not have legal protection. \"But we're not gonna go ahead and leave, and do what they want us to do \u2014 'go home' \u2014 because this is home for us.\" It's not clear what Trump's policies, once in office, will be. But before the election, most Trump supporters viewed immigration as a \"very big problem\" in the U.S. and overwhelmingly support his proposed border wall, according to an August survey by the Pew Research Center. Local Trump supporters, such as 32-year-old Adam Keene, of Palatine, still stick with those beliefs but say the issue is complex. It's important to note, he said, that Trump said he plans to immediately deport unauthorized immigrants with criminal histories, something Keene supports. But when it comes to dealing with unauthorized immigrants without criminal backgrounds, there should be an easy path to citizenship \u2014 which could help unite the country, he said. Laura Mendoza Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune Laura Mendoza, 27 is a volunteer with the Resurrection Project and is a DACA recipient. At the Resurrection Project in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood they are giving workshops for people worried about the the Trump presidency.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) \"These aren't easy conversations we're having right now \u2026 there's a lot of opposing viewpoints on this,\" Keene said. \"But I think everyone would agree that if people don't love America, if they don't respect American values and American laws, then they don't have a place in America.\" Futures in flux A 26-year-old Chicago attorney, who asked not to be identified by name for fear of legal repercussions, has kept her legal status a lifelong secret, anxious about the stigma that came with the truth. She was born in Saudi Arabia, where her Indian father had been working, and she and her family moved to the U.S. three months later on a visitor's visa. They overstayed, and her younger brother was born in the U.S. The attorney didn't learn she was an unauthorized immigrant until she was a teenager. But her status posed one obstacle after another: Her options for college were limited, even though she graduated at the top of her class, and she had to build her resume off unpaid internships and minimum-wage jobs. If she were deported, she said, she would be sent to India, a country she has never stepped foot in. Trump's election has her thinking about other options, such as moving to Canada and practicing law there. Or, she said jokingly, she could \"aggressively date\" and marry a U.S. citizen. She finally revealed her status to a friend after the friend mentioned how all unauthorized immigrants \"clean bathrooms and work the fields.\" Video: Mayor Emanuel on immigrants' rights Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at Lurie Children's Hospital about protecting immigrants' rights in wake of Donald Trump's presidential election win. (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at Lurie Children's Hospital about protecting immigrants' rights in wake of Donald Trump's presidential election win. (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"Some of my friends who don't know my story fall into that category,\" she said. \"(Trump supporters) think they're yelling 'Go home' to people who wash their bathrooms ... but they're also yelling 'Go home' to lawyers and doctors and highly accomplished people.\" DACA recipient Erendira Rendon, 31, came to the U.S. from Oaxaca, Mexico, when she was 4. \"I'm worried,\" said Rendon, a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"My parents are 60 years old. My dad has had more than half his life in the U.S. They are still undocumented, and they are getting older. And they can't work forever. And they are not getting some sort of help when they retire.\" Now, she's assisting families through the Pilsen-based nonprofit The Resurrection Project, which aids Chicago's Latino community through organizing, education and community development. \"President-elect Trump ran on the deportation of us, and people elected him,\" Rendon said. \"I just don't understand how you ... vote to tear families apart and deport people that are in your communities. That's what a vote for Trump was. That's what a vote for Trump meant to me.\" Those anxieties were shared by many of the two dozen people who attended an informational workshop Thursday at The Resurrection Project's resource center in Pilsen, where the organization's leaders answered immigrants' legal questions and a licensed clinical counselor walked the group through a breathing exercise to ease their stress. The organization's managing attorney, Julie Reiter Pellerite, fielded a salvo of questions in Spanish: What do I do if I'm detained? If I applied to DACA, will an immigration official come to my home? Should I apply for a renewal? Since the election, she's been screening unauthorized immigrants to see whether they might be eligible for a certain visa or immigrant visa petition for battered spouses. ",

After graduating first in his class at West Point, Mr. Pompeo served as an armored Cavalry officer and was deployed in Germany during the final years of the Cold War. After leaving the Army, he attended Harvard Law School and was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He arrived in Congress in 2011, after a sometimes bitter campaign against Raj Goyle, a Democratic state representative. During the campaign, one of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s aides promoted an article on Twitter that referred to Mr. Goyle, an Indian-American, as a \u201cTurban Topper.\u201d Map: The Two Americas of 2016 In an interview Friday, Mr. Goyle said that Mr. Pompeo personally apologized to him for the incident, but that the campaign staff member was never fired. \u201cAs we are entering an era where relations with Muslim and minority communities in America are extremely sensitive, his record and his approach should be scrutinized during the confirmation hearing,\u201d Mr. Goyle said. Mr. Pompeo has close ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservatives who are among the most significant activists in financing Republican candidates nationwide. Their company, Koch Industries, and its employees have contributed $357,000 to Mr. Pompeo since 2009. He has common cause with many senior Republican lawmakers on a range of issues, including a distaste for the agreement the United States and five world powers struck with Iran in 2015 to significantly limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. In an op-ed this summer on the Fox News website, Mr. Pompeo wrote that the United States should \u201cwalk away from this deal.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, some members of the transition team pushed for Mr. Pompeo because they believe that picking an incumbent lawmaker would help foster better relations between Congress and the intelligence agencies. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Friday that Mr. Pompeo \u201cwill undoubtedly develop a close working relationship with Congress in his new post.\u201d But some Senate Democrats indicated that Mr. Pompeo could face a grueling confirmation hearing, citing some of his past comments, particularly his praise for the C.I.A.\u2019s former detention and interrogation program. That program \u201cwas ineffective, it was brutal and it stands in direct violation of American values,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in a statement. \u201cWe can never return to that dark time.\u201d Ms. Feinstein, a member of the Intelligence Committee, led an investigation into the C.I.A.\u2019s program that produced a voluminous report \u2014 most of which remains classified. In her statement, she said she planned \u201cto speak with Congressman Pompeo about this issue during his confirmation process.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Charlie Savage and Michael S. Schmidt. ",

Let's take a closer look at some of his past positions.

Breitbart has trafficked in racist, sexist and anti-Semitic posts, and the idea of someone from the website working within the White House has outraged some. \u201cDarkness is good,\u201d Bannon continued, arguing his opponents' blindness works to his advantage. \"Dick Cheney.

Putin of Russia. Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU \u2014         General Flynn (@GenFlynn) Feb. 27, 2016 During the transition, General Flynn has been present when Mr. Trump has received his daily intelligence briefing. As national security adviser, he would have the last word on how the president should respond to crises such as a showdown with China over the South China Sea or an international health crisis like the Ebola epidemic. But, like Mr. Trump, he would enter the White House with significant baggage. The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the network\u2019s lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putin\u2019s elbow. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those potential conflicts of interest had led Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team to worry that General Flynn might have difficulty winning confirmation for any post that, unlike the national security adviser role, requires congressional approval, such as director of the C.I.A. But for Mr. Trump, he has one overriding virtue: He was an early and ardent supporter in a campaign during which most of the Washington national security establishment openly called Mr. Trump unfit to lead. General Flynn did not respond to repeated interview requests. Yet in numerous speeches and interviews before the election, and in a book published in August, he laid out a view of the world that sees the United States as facing a singular, overarching threat that can be described in only one way: \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d @FieldofFight -- Obama and Hillary's Refusal to Name Radical Islamic Terrorism: Aiming to 'Dumb Us Down' - Breitbart https://t.co/ZitXKKoaRt \u2014         General Flynn (@GenFlynn) Sept. 24, 2016 All else is secondary for General Flynn, and any other description of the threat is \u201cthe worst kind of political correctness,\u201d he said in an interview three weeks before the election. Islamist militancy poses an existential threat on a global scale, and the Muslim faith itself is the source of the problem, he said, describing it as a political ideology, not a religion. He has even at times gone so far as to call it a political ideology that has \u201cmetastasized\u201d into a \u201cmalignant cancer.\u201d For General Flynn, the election of Mr. Trump represents an astounding career turnaround. Once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation, General Flynn was fired after serving only two years as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He then re-emerged as a vociferous critic of a Washington elite that he contended could not even properly identify the real enemy \u2014 radical Islam, that is \u2014 never mind figure out how to defeat it.

WMAZ Georgia State Promo (Photo: Shane Music) LUDOWICI, Ga. \u2014\u00a0 A U.S. marshal was shot and killed while trying to serve a warrant on a fugitive in south Georgia Friday. The U.S. Marshal Service identified him as Patrick Carothers, age 53 of Macon, a deputy commander and 26-year veteran. He leaves a wife and five children. According to a news release, Carothers was part of a team executing a warrant for Dontrell Montrese Carter. He was wanted for attempted murder of police officers, domestic violence and unlawfully discharging a weapon in September in Sumter County, S.C. The team found Carter in a single-wide trailer near the 11800 block of Tibit Drive near Ludowici. The team was entering the home when Carothers was struck twice, and the team returned fire, hitting Carter multiple times. Carothers was taken to Liberty Regional Medical Center in Hinesville, where he died. Carter, the suspect, later died at St. Joseph's Hospital in Savannah. According to the news release, David Harlow, deputy director of the U.S. Marshal Service, made this statement:\u00a0\u201cOur deputies and law enforcement partners face dangers every day in the pursuit of justice nationwide. The fugitive who killed Deputy Commander Carothers was extremely dangerous, wanted for trying to kill law enforcement officers and deliberately evading authorities. Pat is a hero and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and five children.\u201d 1925 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 38 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fDCvfs ",

The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama Administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the President-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in,\" Jason Miller, communications director for the transition team, said in an email. Last November , NBC reported that Trump \"would certainly implement\" a database that would track Muslims in the U.S.. Speaking to NBC News campaign embed Vaughn Hillyard, Trump said, \"There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases\" and that Muslims \"have to be\" legally obligated to sign into the database. Takei was one of the 120,000 Japanese Americans forced from their homes following the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Takei and his family were moved from converted horse stables in California to an internment camp in Arkansas, and then finally to the Tule Lake Segregation Center until the end of the war. RELATED: Digital Project Aims to Preserve Stories of Incarcerated Japanese Americans He urged Americans to write to members of Congress and the president-elect to oppose a registry. \"Mr. Higbie used the imprisonment of innocent Japanese Americans as a precedent. Yes, it happened, but it is not a precedent. It is the most disgraceful chapter of American history,\" Takei said on MSNBC. \"Allegiance\" made its Broadway debut on November 8, 2015. The show, which was inspired by actor George Takei's early life, tells one story of Japanese-American internment during World War II. Matthew Murphy Takei starred in the Broadway musical \"Allegiance\" in 2015, which told the story of the internment experience. The musical, which closed in February, will be shown in movie theaters on Dec. 13 . Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , and Tumblr . Traci G. Lee ",

Alexandria Duval, who was born in upstate New York, appeared in Albany County Court just after 9 a.m. today for an extradition hearing. The 38-year-old defendant was escorted into the courtroom wearing shackles and a yellow jumpsuit. Terence Kindlon of the Albany County Public Defender\u2019s Office, who is representing Duval, said his client will not go back to Hawaii willingly. Duval returned to New York to mourn her sister's death, according to Kindlon. \"She was not running from anything,\" Kindlon told reporters after the hearing. Duval is due back in court on Dec. 16. It was unclear if she has entered a plea. New York State Police said Duval was arrested on Nov. 11 after she was located at a residence in Albany. Police said Duval attempted to flee before she was taken into custody. She was being held in Albany County Jail awaiting extradition, with bail set at $3 million, according to ABC affiliate WTEN in Albany. Sister Charged With Murder of Twin by Driving off Maui Cliff WPBF PHOTO:In this undated file photo, Alexandria Duval and her identical twin sister, Anastasia Duval, are interviewed in front of their former yoga studio. Prosecutors say Duval intentionally caused the death of her identical twin sister on May 29 when she allegedly drove their SUV off the ocean-side Hana Highway in Maui. Duval survived with critical injuries, while her sister Anastasia was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses said they saw the twins violently arguing moments before the driver seemed to suddenly accelerate and make a sharp left turn. The vehicle then slammed into a rock wall and plunged 200 feet to the rocks below, according to ABC affiliate KITV in Honolulu. After being discharged from the hospital, Duval was arrested and jailed in Maui on a second-degree murder charge, and accused of deliberately causing her sister's death. She had planned to plead not guilty, but a judge later ordered her release after determining there was no probable cause for a murder charge. A grand jury in Hawaii indicted Duval on that charge last month and Maui police issued a warrant for her arrest. The Duval sisters were born Alison and Ann Dadow in the Utica, New York, area. They operated popular yoga studios in Palm Beach County, Florida, from 2008 to 2014 before they changed their names. They moved to Hawaii from Utah in December 2015, according to The Associated Press. ABC News\u2019 Heather Van Arsdel and Lisa Sivertsen contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Michael Flynn, his national security advisor; and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's choice for attorney general. (AFP / Getty Images) Evan Halper and David S. Cloud Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump began filling his Cabinet on Friday with stalwarts of the right, signaling with a trio of top national security and law enforcement selections\u00a0that he will aggressively pursue promises he made\u00a0during the campaign that have caused deep anxiety among immigrant and Muslim communities. Trump\u2019s choices dimmed speculation that he would move to the center as he begins to govern a nation still deeply fractured and on edge as voters try to predict what the president-elect\u2019s frequently\u00a0changing policy agenda means for them. On Friday, Trump provided some clarity. Trump\u2019s attorney general pick, Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, is an anti-immigration crusader deeply disliked\u00a0by civil rights activists. The president-elect\u2019s choice for national security advisor, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is an experienced warrior who has suggested Americans should fear all Muslims. Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who got the nod for CIA director, broke with colleagues on the House Benghazi Committee to co-author a minority report accusing Hillary Clinton of a cover-up. One week after Donald Trump won the presidency, the country he will take over in 65\u00a0days\u00a0lacks a\u00a0precise\u00a0idea of what he will do as the nation\u2019s chief executive.\u00a0 President Obama has tried to push Trump in the direction of pragmatism.

One week after Donald Trump won the presidency, the country he will take over in 65\u00a0days\u00a0lacks a\u00a0precise\u00a0idea of what he will do as the nation\u2019s chief executive.\u00a0 President Obama has tried to push Trump in the direction of pragmatism. The president-elect\u2019s colleagues on Capitol Hill are trying... (Cathleen Decker) The picks renewed the rancor Trump set off earlier in the week when he named as his top White House strategist Stephen Bannon, the media executive who has aligned himself with white nationalists. They presaged a contentious start to the Trump administration, with Democrats and civil rights activists already vowing to use Senate hearings to put the spotlight on the controversial pasts of the selections who must be confirmed, which include Sessions and Pompeo. Trump advisors and GOP lawmakers moved quickly to highlight moments in the careers of the men when they worked with colleagues across the aisle, and reiterated that Trump\u2019s Cabinet members are not there to implement their own agenda, but that of Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. They suggested that Friday\u2019s announcements don\u2019t necessarily indicate Trump is heading in a sharply ideological direction, as many more top spots have yet\u00a0to be filled. GOP establishment favorite and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, for example, is slated to meet with Trump this weekend, months after giving a speech arguing that Trump would be an unqualified and dangerous president.\u00a0Trump is also talking with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley , another favorite of moderates. \u201cThe president-elect wants the best and brightest,\u201d said Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer. \u201cHe is going to meet with people who supported him, and didn\u2019t support him\u201d\u00a0 But the positioning did little to quiet an outcry, with the angriest and fiercest response directed at Sessions. \u201cIf you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,\u201d Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.)\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cNo senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions.\u201d\u00a0 Sen. Jeff Sessions tapped to be next attorney general A brief look at Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions's career and past comments regarding race and civil liberties.\u00a0 A brief look at Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions's career and past comments regarding race and civil liberties.\u00a0 See more videos Sessions, 69, was one of the earliest and most enthusiastic backers of Trump\u2019s presidential bid. While he is generally liked by colleagues in both political parties, he is among the hardest liners on immigration in Congress, and his selection ensures that the limits on immigration and expanded deportations that Trump called for during the campaign are likely to be at the forefront of his administration\u2019s policies. Sessions made racially insensitive remarks that cost him a federal judgeship in 1986, when the Senate Judiciary Committee drilled down on the comments.\u00a0During his\u00a0hearings, four\u00a0 Justice Department lawyers testified that Sessions expressed racist views or endorsed them. He acknowledged in testimony that he called the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and American Civil Liberties Union \u201cun-American,\u201d though he denied believing such statements. Armand Emamdjomeh He testified that he believed\u00a0such organizations may have taken positions \"adverse to the security of the United States.\u201d but has since consistently praised the work of the NAACP. A colleague also testified that Sessions had agreed with a statement that a white lawyer was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to his race for handling civil rights cases. A black lawyer testified that Sessions once called him \u201cboy.\u201d Sessions denied making those statements. If confirmed to be\u00a0attorney general, Sessions would lead an agency that under President Obama has waded aggressively into civil rights issues, particularly after the unrest sparked by the killings of black men by police officers in recent years. Sessions has also opposed strengthening federal enforcement powers under the 1965\u00a0 Voting Rights Act \u00a0and is one of a handful of GOP senators blocking a bipartisan bill to loosen sentencing rules for low-level offenders. Sessions\u2019 Republican colleagues quickly closed ranks around him Friday, suggesting a confirmation is likely. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky praised him, pointing to how Sessions has collaborated with some of the Senate\u2019s most liberal lawmakers on legislation and noting that Obama\u2019s first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., was approved by the Senate without delay. Incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York warned that his cordial relationship with Sessions, with whom he exercises at the gym, does not give the attorney general nominee\u00a0a pass on tough questioning. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,\u201d Schumer said.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, put Flynn in the same category as Bannon, saying the two embody Trump\u2019s \u201cmost divisive rhetoric.\u201d Flynn has been an outspoken\u00a0critic of the Obama administration's approach to Islamic militancy. He has argued that acts of terrorism committed by Muslims are rooted in\u00a0mainstream Islamic faith.

(Jazmine Ulloa and Melanie Mason) Flynn has also been criticized for aligning with Trump in calling for a thaw in relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin . In 2015, he was paid to\u00a0attend a dinner in Moscow hosted by Russia Today, Russia's government-sponsored English-language news channel, and sat at the same table as Putin. But he also wrote critically of Putin and the dangers Russia presents to the U.S. in his book published this year. Flynn spent 33 years in the Army as an intelligence officer, rising to the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, a job that he was forced to leave\u00a0in 2014 after clashing with Obama administration officials, who\u00a0he has said lacked a strategy for taking on a global militant enemy with its roots in a radical interpretation of Islam. From 2004 to 2007, Flynn was head of intelligence at the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command, the secretive organization that\u00a0conducted the most sensitive capture and kill operations against Al Qaeda operatives in Iraq and elsewhere. He was the senior military intelligence officer in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010 and a top advisor to Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. \u201cHe is familiar with the complex set of security challenges we face,\u201d Sen Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \u201cAnd President-elect Trump does not have a lot of experience in this arena.\u201d But Reed also expressed concern with comments Flynn made \u201cin the heat of the campaign.\u201d And Schumer told MSNBC that Flynn\u2019s comments about Muslims are \u201cvery, very troubling.\u201d Donald Trump selects Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA Director Rep. Mike Pompeo. President-elect Donald Trump selected a\u00a0Republican congressman and harsh critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks to be the head of the CIA, according to an official close to Trump's transition team. Rep. Mike Pompeo. President-elect Donald Trump selected a\u00a0Republican congressman and harsh critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks to be the head of the CIA, according to an official close to Trump's transition team. See more videos Pompeo, an Orange County native and former Army officer and aerospace executive, was elected as part of the 2010 tea party wave election. He would take over an agency that was revamped to focus on fighting terrorism after the 9/11 attacks. He has defended as legal the CIA\u2019s waterboarding and other torture, which Trump has said he wants to bring back over the objections of military and intelligence leaders. Pompeo\u2019s nomination to run the CIA \u201cis profoundly disturbing,\u201d Glenn Carle, a former senior officer who was involved in the CIA\u2019s interrogation and detention program, said in a telephone interview from Dubai. Carle, who spent 23 years as a spy before retiring in 2007, has criticized the agency\u2019s brutal treatment of detainees and believes the George W. Bush administration should never have authorized waterboarding and other interrogation techniques. \u00a0 Pompeo\u2019s vocal defense of the legality of the CIA program and criticism of the Benghazi investigation demonstrate a troubling willingness to ignore the facts, Carle said. \u201cMost of my former colleagues are rational people. We serve the executive, but the executive has to be in touch with reality,\u201d he said. Democrats took a less hostile posture toward Pompeo than Trump\u2019s other selections. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of Burbank, called Pompeo \"very bright and hardworking\" even though the two clashed on the Obama administration's handling of the 2012 attacks against a U.S. diplomatic compound and a CIA safehouse in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. Pompeo has harshly criticized Obama\u2019s deal with Iran to freeze its nuclear program \u00a0and has helped block Obama\u2019s plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He fought pitched partisan battles over national security while serving on the House Intelligence Committee, but nonetheless earned a reputation for seriousness and a quick grasp for the complex details of spycraft. \"While we have had our share of strong differences \u2013 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2013 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. Democrats may not be alone in sparring with the Trump Cabinet. Bannon predicts \u201cthe conservatives are going to go crazy\u201d when they see the plan he is pushing for public works spending on the scale of President Franklin D.

At a hearing last week, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, expressed interest in moving toward a settlement. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers were seeking to delay the trial in one of the California cases until after his inauguration on Jan. 20, while also requesting that he be allowed to testify on video. \u201cThe time and attention to prepare and testify will take him away from imperative transition work at a critical time,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli wrote in the request to the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, last week, noting the \u201cthousands\u201d of appointments that President-elect Trump needed to make in the weeks ahead. Judge Curiel, of Federal District Court, who is hearing the two California cases, was thrust into the limelight of the campaign in May when Mr. Trump spent several minutes at a rally denouncing the judge\u2019s decisions in the case, calling him a \u201chater\u201d and questioning his impartiality because of his Mexican heritage . \u201cI\u2019m building the wall, I\u2019m building the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in June . \u201cI have a Mexican judge.

He should have recused himself, not only for that, for other things.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story After he faced days of criticism for his remarks on the judge, Mr. Trump released a statement saying his words had been \u201cmisconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.\u201d He also asserted that he was justified in questioning the fairness of his trial, given various rulings in the case that went against him. Still, he concluded, \u201cwe will win this case!\u201d Even before he was in the throes of his presidential bid, Mr. Trump began mounting a vigorous public defense of himself and Trump University. A website, 98percentapproval.com , touted high marks it received from students. A New York Times report in March, though, showed how some students recalled being pressured to give positive reviews. Trump University, which operated from 2004 to 2010, included free introductory seminars across the country, focusing largely on real estate investing and on learning Mr. Trump\u2019s secrets. Students could then purchase more expensive packages costing up to $35,000. Documents made public through the litigation revealed that some former Trump University managers had given testimony about its unscrupulous and exploitative business practices. One sales executive testified that the operation was \u201ca facade, a total lie.\u201d Another manager called it a \u201cfraudulent scheme.\u201d Other records showed how Mr. Trump had overstated the depth of his involvement in the programs. Despite claims that Mr. Trump had handpicked instructors, he acknowledged in testimony that he had not. ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy One of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s most frequent employers as a speaker was HSM, a company that arranges \u201cexecutive education\u201d events around the world. In 2006, he made eight speeches for the company and was paid $550,000 (his booking agent kept 20 percent of that). At least three times, in 2003 , 2004 and 2006 , Mr. Giuliani was to be among the featured speakers at HSM World Business Forums, along with Bill Clinton. The speeches that have drawn the greatest scrutiny are those he gave from 2012 through last year at events organized by the Mujahedeen Khalq, a dissident group of Iranians that holds a rally in France every year to draw attention to the persecution of its members by the government of Iran. Mr. Giuliani was paid for \u201cthree or four\u201d speeches he delivered to the group, said Robert G. Torricelli, a former senator from New Jersey who served as a lawyer for the M.E.K., as the group is known, as it sought to be removed from a State Department list of terrorist organizations. Mr. Giuliani, after receiving payments from American-based groups of Iranian immigrants who had ties to the Iranian dissidents, gave rousing speeches at these annual rallies condemning Iranian leaders and the Obama administration for negotiating with them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe ayatollah must go,\u201d Mr. Giuliani yelled, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, as thousands stood and cheered him. \u201cGone, out, no more,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Khamenei and other leaders of Iran should \u201cbe put on trial for crimes against humanity for the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people that they have killed.\u201d Paul S. Ryan, a vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, a nonprofit group that examines special interest influence in politics, said there would be no legal prohibition on Mr. Giuliani\u2019s moving from being paid by the group to a government job. But he still found it troubling. \u201cPeople would reasonably question his fitness for this political appointment given that he received payments from supporters of this organization, and these are matters he would be charged with dealing with as secretary of state,\u201d he said. Mr. Torricelli said that Mr. Giuliani had agreed to give the paid speeches because he supported the group\u2019s message, and that he had volunteered his time to participate in negotiations in Europe to help prevent further attacks on refugees from the group who were then living in Iraq. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s work earned him a spot on several lists of the highest-paid speakers in the world, just one spot below Mr. Clinton in one ranking. In one instance in 2006, Mr. Giuliani collected $100,000 for speaking at Oklahoma State University. His contract with the university, which is public, laid out what appeared to be his standard demands beyond a fee. Besides the requests related to air travel, his team required a sedan and an S.U.V., and an extra S.U.V. for luggage when he traveled to other countries. His room tastes were specific: a \u201clarge two-bedroom, nonsmoking suite with a king-size bed, on an upper floor, with a balcony and view if applicable.\u201d He required four more rooms on the same floor for security and staff. Eric C. Money, who led the speakers bureau at Oklahoma State University at the time Mr. Giuliani visited the campus, said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s speech to students and faculty members in the university\u2019s basketball arena had focused on leadership and Sept. 11. Mr. Money said the fee was high, but he did not recall hearing complaints. \u201cThat is what Bill Clinton was getting at the time,\u201d Mr. Money said. \u201cIt was on par. I did not have sticker shock.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the afterglow of his post-9/11 fame, Mr. Giuliani could certainly ignite large rooms. Mr. Giuliani spoke at dozens of events with Zig Ziglar, a motivational speaker. Mr. Ziglar\u2019s daughter, Julie Ziglar Norman, who traveled with her father in those years, said Mr. Giuliani was a crowd favorite, along with her father and Colin L. Powell. \u201cI know everybody always loved what he had to say,\u201d Ms. Ziglar said. \u201cIt was always very pro- American. And he was just beloved. That\u2019s the best way I can describe him.\u201d Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Russ Buettner from New York.

By Greg Miller November 18 at 11:59 AM Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the CIA is a Kansas congressman who is widely respected for his intelligence but also seen as a fierce partisan on polarizing issues including the deaths of U.S. personnel in Benghazi, the leaks of Edward Snowden and the email controversy that engulfed Hillary Clinton. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) has used his perch on the House Intelligence Committee to attack major pillars of President Obama\u2019s foreign policy agenda, including the nuclear deal with Iran . Just hours before his name surfaced as Trump\u2019s CIA nominee, Pompeo tweeted that he looked forward to \u201crolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d [ Iran nuclear deal could collapse under Trump ] In closed-door briefings on Capitol Hill, Pompeo has been an intense critic of a covert CIA program to train and arm moderate rebel forces in Syria, according to U.S. officials who said that dismantling the program \u2014 or at least subjecting it to a major re-evaluation \u2014 would likely be at the top of his agenda if he is confirmed. Pompeo, 52, has no meaningful experience in espionage issues beyond his relatively brief stint as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. But he has earned a reputation as a serious student of national security issues who finished first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served as a cavalry officer in the Army and earned a law degree from Harvard. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that Pompeo is not widely known among the CIA rank and file but that his nomination was greeted at least initially as a reassuring development at a spy agency that has been treated largely with disdain by Trump. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has sparred with Pompeo on Benghazi and other issues, gave the selection tempered praise in a statement released Friday. \u201cMike is very bright and hard-working and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policymakers,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWhile we have had our share of strong differences \u2014 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2014 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA Director.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s congressional background raised early comparisons to that of Porter Goss , who was plucked from the House Intelligence Committee by then-President George W. Bush to lead the CIA and was forced to resign two years later after a turbulent tenure during which one of his principal executives was convicted of corruption charges. Pompeo\u2019s ties to the arch-conservative tea party movement and scant background on intelligence issues were also cited as a cause for concern among some CIA veterans. \u201cThe tea party owns the drones now,\u201d one official said, referring to the agency\u2019s involvement in lethal drone strikes against terrorist groups in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. But former senior CIA officials expressed guarded optimism that Pompeo\u2019s ideological bent can be tempered by the analytic approach he has brought to difficult security subjects. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who has been nominated to lead the CIA by Donald Trump, speaks on Capitol Hill in October 2015. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) \u201cI\u2019m heartened by the choice,\u201d said former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who has been a staunch critic of Trump on security matters. \u201cI would recommend that when he goes to Langley he get out of the car by himself and embrace the workforce,\u201d Hayden said, alluding to the rocky tenure of previous directors who arrived with entourages and agendas that put them at odds with the agency\u2019s powerful and entrenched directorate of spies. In some ways, Pompeo is already part of the intelligence inner circle in Washington. He attended a dinner this week with CIA Director John Brennan at the home of former Republican congressman Mike Rogers, who had previously been seen as a leading candidate for the CIA job under Trump. The gathering included cast and producers of the CIA-themed show \u201cHomeland,\u201d according to a person familiar with the event. Brennan has led a major bureaucratic overhaul of the agency over the past year, a reorganization designed to replicate the structure of the agency\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. Pompeo would face decisions on whether to preserve those changes. Pompeo emerged as a surprise pick for Trump. His name had not surfaced in the flurry of postelection rumors that had largely focused on other potential nominees, including Rogers, who was ousted from the Trump transition team this week, and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the current chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who reportedly turned down a chance at the CIA job. Pompeo reportedly has close ties to the Koch family, Kansas billionaires who have devoted a considerable part of their wealth to advancing a deeply conservative agenda and driving Democrats out of office. Articles in Kansas papers indicate that Pompeo built much of his wealth with investment funds from Koch industries and that his campaigns for Congress have been backed by Koch money. In just five years in Congress, he has built a political following by staking extreme positions in polarizing debates. He has called for Snowden to face the death penalty and for Clinton to be barred from receiving classified information. Pompeo was one of the more outspoken Republican members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, saying that the Obama administration was guilty of a scandal \u201cworse than Watergate.\u201d When the committee concluded its final report in July, Pompeo and a fellow member, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), released a 48-page annex charging \u201cfailure at the most senior levels of government\u201d and calling for additional information on what Pompeo said was the administration\u2019s intentional misrepresentation and concealment of facts. During hearings, his questions to administration witnesses were often among the most accusatory. In October 2015, when Clinton testified for the second time, Pompeo grilled her on her relationship with slain U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. He asked a series of rapid-fire questions about why Stevens did not have her personal telephone number, did not know her personal home address and had never \u201cstopped by your house.\u201d Separately, in remarks that drew sharp criticism from U.S. Muslim organizations, Pompeo said that Muslim leaders who fail to denounce acts of terrorism done in the name of Islam were \u201cpotentially complicit\u201d in the attacks. Pompeo led congressional attacks on the nuclear accord Obama reached with Iran last year, accusing the administration of hiding \u201csecret side deals\u201d from the public, allegations rejected by the White House. At the same time, it is not clear whether Pompeo will be in agreement with the most extreme positions taken by his new bosses, Trump and his designated national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Trump has called for the CIA to resume the use of waterboarding and other interrogation measures widely condemned as torture. Trump has derided the quality of the intelligence from the nation\u2019s spy community, publicly belittling a multiagency conclusion that Russia used cyberespionage methods to interfere in the U.S. election. Pompeo is not known to have publicly backed those positions and in some cases has articulated views that would seem at odds with those of the Trump team. In a speech delivered in Kansas last year after returning from a trip to the Middle East, Pompeo cautioned against equating all Muslims with terrorism, saying that a \u201cline needs to be drawn between those who are on the side of extremism and those who are fighting against them.\u201d Karen DeYoung contributed to this report.

    "text": "By Katie Zezima November 18 at 2:39 PM Follow @katiezez South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley speaks at the National Press Club in Washington in 2015. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley upbraided the Republican establishment on Friday, arguing the party lost its way by ignoring anger and frustration, and that it must return to its core values of limited government and being a party for all people \u2014 including immigrants and people of color. Haley, speaking at the Federalist Society\u2019s National Lawyers Convention in Washington, offered some praise for President-elect Donald Trump, telling the crowd of conservative lawyers that while she was never Trump\u2019s \u201cbiggest cheerleader,\u201d the Republican Party has an unprecedented opportunity to enact conservative policies and must take advantage of Trump\u2019s election. But she called for Republicans to conduct a detailed autopsy of the party\u2019s win \u2014 as it would in defeat \u2014 and said it must remind people that it is the party who will offer opportunities \u201cto all citizens, regardless of their race, gender or where they are born and raised.\u201d Haley met with Trump on Thursday at Trump Tower in Manhattan, stoking speculation she is under consideration for a Cabinet post in the new administration. The governor\u2019s name has been floated for labor secretary, commerce secretary \u2014 even secretary of state. On Friday, Haley spoke of her parents, Indian immigrants who left a comfortable life and came to the United States with $8 in their pockets in search of a better life. [ From the rumored to the named: The latest updates to the Trump Cabinet ] \u201cIf we as Republicans are going to lead effectively and have staying power as a governing power, we must accept that Donald Trump\u2019s election was not an affirmation of the way Republicans have conducted themselves,\u201d she said. Voters, she said, rejected the political class, \u201cand we have no one to blame but ourselves\u201d because the party\u00a0 \u201cmoved toward big government rather than away from it . . . Republicans lost their way.\u201d She also talked about the decision to take the Confederate flag down from the South Carolina statehouse grounds and the impact that the 2015 shooting deaths of nine people at a historically black Charleston church \u2014 which she said were \u201cthe act of a racist\u201d \u2014 had on her and the state. \u201cWhat we saw in the extraordinary reaction to Charleston was people of all races coming together. We didn\u2019t have riots, we had vigils. We didn\u2019t have protests, we had hugs,\u201d she said. Haley noted that \u201cmany honorable people\u201d support hanging the flag out of heritage. \u201cThey are not racists,\u201d she said, noting they twice elected a black senator and Indian American governor. During the legislative debate over removing the flag, she said people listened to one another. \u201cThe flag came down and South Carolina has moved forward.\u201d Haley did not specifically mention the appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, to be Trump\u2019s chief strategist, a move that was blasted by Jewish groups and political operatives on both sides of the aisle who said he is too close to the alt-right and white nationalism, or the appointment Friday of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be attorney general. Sessions was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after former colleagues testified before a Senate committee that he joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were \u201cokay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.\u201d [ Sessions expected to bring sweeping changes to Justice Department ] Sen. Ted Cruz also spoke at the gathering and praised Sessions, saying the senator \u201cis going to make an extraordinary attorney general of the United States.\u201d \u201cHe is a committed and deeply principled conservative, and if those who serve in this administration have even a fraction of his integrity and his commitment to principle, we are going to see an administration that does remarkable things for the people of this country.\u201d The Texas Republican, who met with Trump in New York on Tuesday, reversed himself when asked if he wants to serve on the Supreme Court. In May he said it was \u201cnot a desire of my heart\u201d and had a different view today. \u201cWhat I will say is that history is long and can take unexpected paths,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is absolutely vital that that seat and every other seat that comes vacant on the court be filled by principled constitutionalists who will be faithful to the law,\u201d he said. Cruz said he has spoken with Trump\u2019s transition team and that he has \u201cvery much encouraged that team to use executive authority\u201d not only to roll back President Obama\u2019s executive orders but \u201cto use it in legitimate ways, to reduce the burdens of government.\u201d Cruz urged the roomful of conservative lawyers to serve in a Trump administration \u2014 but also to keep their moral and ethical compass. \u201cBe honest and trustworthy.

    "text": "Obama Blocks New Oil, Gas Drilling in Arctic Ocean By matthew daly, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Nov 18, 2016, 5:20 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Energy Policy and the Environment: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email The Obama administration is blocking new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean, handing a victory to environmentalists who say industrial activity in the icy waters will harm whales, walruses and other wildlife and exacerbate global warming . A five-year offshore drilling plan announced on Friday blocks the planned sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska. The plan allows drilling to go forward in Alaska's Cook Inlet southwest of Anchorage. The blueprint for drilling from 2017 to 2022 can be rewritten by President-elect Donald Trump, in a process that could take months or years. Besides Cook Inlet, the plan also allows drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, long the center of U.S. offshore oil production. Ten of the 11 lease sales proposed in the five-year plan are in the Gulf, mostly off the coasts of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama. Confirming a decision announced this spring, the five-year plan also bars drilling in the Atlantic Ocean. \"The plan focuses lease sales in the best places - those with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure - and removes regions that are simply not right to lease,\" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. \"Given the unique and challenging Arctic environment and industry's declining interest in the area, forgoing lease sales in the Arctic is the right path forward,\" Jewell said. The decision follows an announcement last year by Royal Dutch Shell PLC that it would cease exploration in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas after spending nearly $7 billion. The company cited disappointing results from a well drilled in the Chukchi and the unpredictable federal regulatory environment. Despite that, industry representatives reacted bitterly to the latest announcement, calling the decision blatantly political. \"The arrogance of the decision is unfathomable, but unfortunately not surprising,\" said Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, an industry group. \"Once again, we see the attitude that Washington knows best \u2014 an attitude that contributed to last week's election results,\" Luthi said, referring to Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton . More than 70 percent of Alaskans, including a majority of Alaska Natives, support offshore drilling, Luthi said. The state's three Republican members of Congress also blasted the decision. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she was \"infuriated\" that Obama \"has once again ignored our voices to side with the factions who oppose\" offshore drilling in Alaska. \"Arctic development is one of the best ways to create jobs, generate revenues and refill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline,\" said Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \"Why the president is willing to send all of those benefits overseas is beyond explanation.\" As he prepares to leave office in two months, Obama has worked to build an environmental legacy that includes a global agreement to curb climate change and an ambitious plan to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. He also has imposed stricter limits on smog-causing pollution linked to asthma and rejected the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. All of those accomplishments and others are at risk from Trump's presidency. Trump loathes regulation and wants to increase oil and gas drilling and the use of coal. Trump has said he believes climate change is a hoax and has vowed to \"cancel\" U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. While he has been vague about precise policies, Trump is likely to seek to weaken or kill the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone Obama policy meant to reduce carbon pollution from the nation's power plants as part of an effort to combat climate change. The decision to block Arctic drilling follows a decision this spring to block drilling in the Atlantic. Republican governors in North and South Carolina back drilling off their states' coasts, as does the Democratic governor of Virginia. Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Oceana, an environmental group, hailed the Arctic announcement and praised Obama and Jewell for \"protecting our coasts from dirty and dangerous offshore drilling.\" Rejection of drilling in the Artic and Atlantic \"demonstrates a commitment to prioritizing common sense, economics and science ahead of industry favoritism and politics as usual,\" Savitz said. Nearly 400 scientists signed a letter this summer urging Obama to eliminate the possibility of Arctic offshore drilling. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ",

Michael Flynn his national security adviser on Nov. 18, but Flynn has a history of making incendiary and Islamophobic statements that have drawn criticism from his military peers. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, among the most important jobs in the still-forming Trump administration, has said some pretty incendiary things on the Internet. Before being tapped to advise Trump on national security issues, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was an intelligence officer and head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Obama until he was removed from his command in 2014 over his leadership style. Flynn went on to criticize some of his superiors, including Obama, regarding their stances on Islamist extremism. He also traveled to Russia on a trip paid for by state-run media and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn said that he was using the trip to advance U.S. interests. [ Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] Before joining the Trump campaign and drawing the ire of his colleagues for using his rank to support a political campaign that would often\u00a0disparage\u00a0the very establishment he had just departed, Flynn was\u00a0well-regarded by his colleagues. In his book \u201cMy Share of the Task,\u201d retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal wrote that Flynn was \u201cpure energy\u201d and had an \u201cuncanny ability\u201d to digest information, \u201cmarshal his people, resources and energy to make it happen.\u201d Apart from his military career and political ascension, Flynn also has a digital legacy that is problematic. Below are some of his tweets over the course of the Trump campaign. Ryan Lizza, a writer with the New Yorker, also put a number of Flynn\u2019s tweets on his feed Thursday night.

    "text": "Close Dan Kitwood, Getty Images As Facebook executives issue statements and tweak their policies to quell frustration over the growth of fake news on its platform, one group of students has taken the problem into their own hands \u2014 and came up with a fix for fake news problem in 36 hours flat. At a hackathon at Princeton University this week, student teams were given the straightforward challenge of developing a technology tool in one and a half days. Did fake news help put Trump in the White House? Challenge accepted. According to a\u00a0 report \u00a0in The Washington Post, four undergraduate and grad students \u2014 University of Massachusetts-Amherst master\u2019s student Nabanita De, Purdue freshman Anant Goel, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign sophomores Mark Craft and Qinglin Chen \u2014 channeled frustration at the difficulty of discerning between real news and made-up conspiracy theories disguised as news on Facebook. The team successfully built an algorithm to distinguish between real and fake news on the social network and label the posts so readers can easily tell the difference. They call their system \u201cFiB.\u201d The algorithm is open source but temporarily unavailable due to high demand. It powers a Chrome browser extension that tags links in Facebook as either \u201cverified\u201d or \u201cnot verified\u201d by considering factors such as a source\u2019s credibility and cross-referencing that content with other news sites, The Post reported. If a Facebook post you\u2019re looking at fails the test, the FiB algorithm searches for and shows you real news on the topic. The spread of fake news in recent months has corroded political discourse and trust on the world\u2019s most influential social network. In an analysis of the last three months of campaign coverage, BuzzFeed News concluded that top fake election news stories generated more engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined, including the New York Times, Fox News and CBS News.\u00a0 On Tuesday, Facebook updated its policy language to clarify that it will not display ads on third-party mobile apps and sites that showcase fake news, potentially cutting into their revenue. Google and Facebook try to fight \"fake news\" \u201cWe do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal,\u00a0 misleading or deceptive , which includes fake news,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \u201cWhile implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\u201d However, Facebook\u2019s policy clarification does not touch fake news content shared elsewhere on the site \u2014 i.e. fake news shared by individuals on their personal News Feeds.\u00a0 In the immediate aftermath of the election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg minimized the idea that fake news on his company\u2019s platform had an impact on this campaign season.\u00a0 \u201cTo think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\u201d Zuckerberg said. In a statement last week, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, struck a different tone, and acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s so much more\u201d the company needs to do to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform. In the final days of his presidency, President Obama has emerged as perhaps the most visible critic of the rise of misleading information on Facebook and other social media sites. In a new\u00a0 profile \u00a0of the president and his legacy published in The New Yorker, Mr. Obama said that today\u2019s media landscape \u201cmeans everything is true and nothing is true.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAn explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers\u2019 payroll,\u201d he told The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick. \u201cAnd the capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal\u2014that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarize the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Rosalind S. Helderman November 18 at 5:23 PM Follow @PostRoz President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly bragged he never settles lawsuits despite a long history of doing so, has agreed to a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against his defunct real estate seminar program, Trump University. The settlement eliminates the possibility that Trump will be called to testify in court in the midst of his presidential transition. It ends three separate lawsuits that made claims against Trump University, including a California class action case that was scheduled to go to trial later this month, as well as a second suit in that state and an action filed by New York Attorney Gen. Eric Schneiderman. In a statement, Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten said he believed Trump would have prevailed at trial but settled so Trump could \u201cdevote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation\u201d during his presidential transition. Schneiderman, who had faced harsh attacks from Trump since filing the 2013 suit, said in a statement that his office had sued Trump for \u201cswindling thousands of innocent Americans out of millions of dollars\u201d and that the settlement had come despite significant resistance from Trump for years. \u201cToday, that all changes,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\u201d He said the settlement includes a $1 million penalty paid to New York state for violating the state\u2019s education laws by calling the program a \u201cuniversity\u201d despite offering no degrees or traditional education. Trump did not, however, admit fault regarding the claims that customers were cheated. A lawyer representing former customers in the two California cases also confirmed the settlement at a hearing in San Diego. [ Donald Trump said his \u2018university\u2019 was about education. Actually, it was about \u2018sell, sell, sell!\u2019 ] The Trump University settlement appears to fit a pattern in which lawyers for the president-elect are working to reduce the number of his legal entanglements before he takes office. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s lawyers dropped an unrelated lawsuit he was pursuing in Florida against Palm Beach County in which he had complained about commercial air traffic over his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump has fought the county for years over flight patterns from the county airport, which he has complained cause too much noise at his historic club. New air space restrictions likely to be imposed with Trump\u2019s election could mean that Trump will win the long fight without legal action. Negotiations over the Trump University deal were handled in part by lawyers for Schneiderman, a Democrat, who had filed suit against Trump University in 2013. Schneiderman has called the real estate program \u201ca fraud from beginning to end.\u201d 1 of 8 Here\u2019s what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 11, 2016\u00a0 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/\u201d60 Minutes\u201d via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The fates of the New York case and the two California suits were closely linked because they were all brought on behalf of an overlapping pool of former Trump University customers, said a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing negotiations. Trump is known for aggressively pursuing his business interests in court. Still, he has settled lawsuits many times, despite arguing that doing so only invites further litigation. \u201cI don\u2019t settle cases. You know what happens? When you start settling lawsuits, everybody sues you,\u201d he said on MSNBC in March, responding to a question about Trump University. \u201cI don\u2019t get sued because I don\u2019t settle cases. I win in court.\u201d The Trump University case emerged as a political issue during the presidential campaign. And even as he rose in the polls, won primaries and emerged as the Republican nominee, Trump at times seemed deeply engrossed in the litigation and repeatedly defended the business from the stump. At a rally in San Diego in May, Trump dissected the matter at length, insisting that most customers who had spent money on the real estate program had been pleased. He attacked particular plaintiffs by name, including one who later dropped out of the case, citing the publicity. Trump\u2019s San Diego statements included an attack on Federal District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing the California cases, and a promise: \u201cIf we have a trial, we\u2019ll go all the way,\u201d he said then. \u201cWatch how we win it.\u201d In subsequent interviews in June, Trump continued to press complaints against Curiel, alleging that the Indiana-born judge was biased because of his Mexican heritage. Those comments sparked an uproar that swallowed days of Trump\u2019s campaign and only subsided when his campaign released a lengthy statement in June claiming his comments had been \u201cmisconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.\u201d The cases against Trump University were based on complaints from customers who described their experiences in programs that could cost more than $30,000. The former customers said they were taken in by false promises including advertisements in which Trump promised seminar attendees would learn his personal tricks for succeeding in real estate from instructors he had personally handpicked. In depositions, Trump has acknowledged he did not pick seminar leaders. Trump argued in a written statement that, \u201cwith all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!\u201d Curiel had strongly urged a settlement in the cases pending in his courtroom, where Trump\u2019s lawyers had recently asked for a delay, citing the burdens of the presidential transition. They suggested the trial, which was scheduled to open Nov. 28, would be easier in February or March, after Trump takes office.

USA TODAY Starbucks has 13 holiday red cups this year. (Photo: Starbucks.) Donald Trump supporters are nudging Starbucks servers to announce the name of their candidate by ordering coffee under Trump's name. It is a tradition at Starbucks that servers ask customers for their names, and when an order is ready, shout out those customers' names. Trump supporters are ordering food and drink and telling Starbucks employees their name is Trump, compelling servers to call them to the counter for their orders by shouting out \"Trump!\" The campaign dubbed #TrumpCup on social media is the latest wave\u00a0in what has been a contentious\u00a0campaign and post-election cycle. Some media reports questioned whether the Starbucks effort\u00a0was\u00a0motivated by the fact that CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, for president. But creator Timothy Treadstone said the idea was actually a social experiment in First Amendment rights. Treadstone, a 29-year-old political consultant and social media strategist from Los Angeles, told USA TODAY that he was motivated to start the campaign after seeing video on social media in which a Trump supporter attempts to give his name as Trump at a Starbucks. The audio is muffled, but it appears as if the Starbucks employee is not responding to the repeated\u00a0request and that the employee then asks a coworker to call the police. After seeing the video, Treadstone posted to his Twitter account, @bakedalaska, on Thursday night: \"Operation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share & spread the word.\" \"This is not a protest; it's not a boycott,\" Treadstone said by telephone. \"This\u00a0is a social experiment ... This is just something we\u2019re doing to keep Starbucks accountable.\u00a0We want to help out our economy, keep people accountable and have a little fun.\" Treadmill's comments were in part a response to questions that have emerged on social media in which members of the public asked about the effectiveness of a campaign that would bring more, not less, business to Starbucks. Twitter user @tarzdan_ wrote: \"So let me get this straight, you're going to protest against a company by giving them money?\" Tweeted @CaptainsLog2016: \"I don't think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup through. If you have to buy a product form the place you're boycotting... #FAIL.\" Starbucks released a statement regarding #TrumpCup: \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\" 68 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fEpJxi ",

Demonstrators hold placards calling for the resignation of South Korean President Park Geun-Hye on Nov. 5 in central Seoul. (Ed Jones / AFP/Getty Images) Elaine Ramirez When Park Geun-hye became South Korea\u2019s first female president in 2013, women\u2019s groups saw it as little more than a superficial milestone. They had protested her candidacy, arguing that the daughter of a dictator would never represent real women. Now, with Park facing calls to resign over an influence-peddling scandal, women\u2019s rights supporters fear her presidency has only deepened sexism and misogyny here. \u201cSadly, the failure of President Park Geun-hye is generating hatred against the female sex,\u201d said Nam In-soon, who chairs the Gender Equality and Family Committee in parliament.\u00a0 Gender inequality is deeply entrenched in South Korea. Women on average earn 37% less than men, the biggest gap among the 35 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the country\u2019s 10 biggest companies, women hold 2% of management positions, according to the market research firm CEOScore. Women make up 17% of the elected members of parliament, well below average for Asia and the world\u2019s developed countries.\u00a0 Experts trace that statistic to social conditions and a lack of female role models in politics. Han Myeong-sook, a woman who became prime\u00a0minister in 2006 and served for 11 months, eventually went to jail for corruption, while Park Young-sun, who became the first female floor leader in parliament in 2014, soon quit amid political strife. (Ralph Jennings) Park, the daughter of Park Chung-hee,\u00a0who led South Korea from 1961 until his assassination in 1979, chaired the conservative Grand National Party \u2014 the predecessor to the ruling Saenuri Party \u2014 before running for president. She lost in her first attempt, then won five years later. It was a historic moment for women in South Korea. But whether Park really broke the glass ceiling has been a topic of debate here, centering on whether she ever represented women\u2019s interests. She ran on nostalgia for her father, who is largely credited for modernizing the economy through industrialization and is highly regarded by many old people in rural areas. They remember Park in the presidential Blue House, where she acted as first lady in her twenties after her mother was assassinated. Her presidential campaign never pandered to women\u2019s rights organizations, which  fought against her father\u2019s dictatorship and solidly opposed her candidacy. While she promised affordable child care, paternity leave and more job centers for women, those positions were not radically different from the platforms of her male rivals.\u00a0 In office, she has done little to promote women in government. Just two of her 19 ministers are women. \u201cWomen's activists generally have few positive things to say about her and certainly did not expect much change in the position of women in Korean politics and society,\u201d said Heike Hermanns, a political scientist at Gyeongsang National University. \u201cPark Geun-hye is thus rather an outlier than a sign of progress for women in politics.\u201d Hermanns said the established power structures, in which personal networks play a\u00a0major role, make it difficult for women to obtain higher positions.\u00a0 \u201cAs long as Korean politics remains personalized and relies on outsiders as party saviors, men will dominate as there are so few women who are in such a position,\u201d she said. Experts say the current scandal, in which her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil stands accused of using her influence with the president to extort money from businesses, has damaged women's position in politics and society. \u201cThis situation was actually predictable from the moment she was elected president,\" Nam said. \"If she got on well, it would probably have been assessed that it was because she is the daughter of Park Chung-hee. And if she failed \u2014 just like she did now \u2014 we knew that it would strengthen the voice of discrimination against women.\u201d\u00a0 Conservative media have criticized Choi for \"unladylike\" toughness, luxury tastes and her relationship with Ko Young-tae, her alleged \u201cboy toy\u201d and slush fund assistant.\u00a0 As the 2017 presidential election nears, the country has few women who would stand much chance of being elected. Shim Sang-jung and former presidential contender Lee Jung-hee, both parliamentary leaders of minor liberal parties, are considered too radical to be taken seriously. One exception is Choo Mi-ae, the popular chairwoman of the main opposition party, who has defied many of the country\u2019s political and social norms, marrying a man with a disability and working with former President Kim Dae-jung despite being from a rival region.

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump walks from Trump Tower on Nov. 14 in New York. Carolyn Kaster/AP The possibility that Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could fill a senior position in the White House raises thorny legal questions \u2013 one of which is whether it would run afoul of a federal anti-nepotism statute. Kushner was a close adviser to Trump throughout his campaign, but to officially employ Kushner in the White House would mean navigating the ambiguities surrounding the five-decades-old law. CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration Congress passed the anti-nepotism law in 1967. It's widely perceived that the lawmakers who wrote the statute were motivated in part by President Kennedy's nomination of his brother Robert as attorney general. But the legislation was also directed at much lower-profile nepotism at the time. For example, it was fairly common for congressmen to hire their wives to work in their offices, and many lawmakers wanted to stop that practice. What the anti-nepotism law says The federal anti-nepotism statute provides: \"A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\" \"Public official\" is defined in the law to include the president, and the statutory definition for \"relative\" includes son-in-law. Based on that alone, you might think it's a slam-dunk case to bar Kushner from working for his father-in-law at the White House. Not so fast. What's not settled law is the definition of \"agency.\" The heart of the debate: Does the White House \u2013 or the Executive Office of the President \u2013 count as \"agencies\" under this statute? Article continues after sponsorship How Hillary Clinton's case could help Kushner Perhaps the legal precedent cited most often to make a case in Kushner's favor is from a 1990s lawsuit involving, of all people, Hillary Clinton. When President Bill Clinton appointed his wife to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, a lobbying group filed a lawsuit in the D.C. courts. The central legal question in that case wasn't actually about the anti-nepotism statute \u2013 it was about whether Hillary Clinton's task force had to publicly disclose records. ",

Twitter / CBS San Francisco The thick white foam which resembled snow, came from Signature Flight Support, a business located right next to the airport at 323 Martin Avenue near the San Jose-Santa Clara border. Police said the company was testing its emergency fire suppression system and something went wrong. Video shot by CBS San Francisco\u2019s chopper showed that the foam had spilled out of entrances on both ends of the Signature Flight Support building and out of the vents in the side of the building facing Martin Street. The foam was so thick that it was deep enough to cover some cars on the street and rose almost to the height of a stop sign in one spot. RAW: Fire-suppression foam accident fills San Jose streets SNOW IN SAN JOSE? It may have looked like Christmas came early near the San Jose Mineta International Airport Friday, but it was actually a test of fire-suppression foam by a company on Martin Street that went awry, filling nearby streets with the non-toxic white substance.  Read more about the mishap: http://cbsloc.al/2g4UBFL Posted by KPIX CBS San Francisco Bay Area on Friday, November 18, 2016 People in the area could be seen taking selfies with the foam. A few people actually rode their bicycles through the foam on the street, emerging on the other side of the foam bank covered in the substance. The company said the foam isn\u2019t toxic. Police said they planned to simply let it dissipate rather than using water to try to wash it into street drains. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Ever Javier Palma Romero, 24, a fish processor from coastal El Salvador, with his daughter, Jackeline, 4, faced gang threats in his home town and decided to flee to the United States. (Josh Partlow / The Washington Post) Joshua Partlow, Nick MiroffThe Washington Post Along the route through Mexico, no one was really sure how to say Trump 's name. Smugglers called him \"El Malo\" (the bad one) or \"El Feo\" (the ugly one) and told the migrants they had better hurry north before his wall went up. The U.S. agents who took them into custody said he would be president, and it was a new day at the border. \"They said it to the whole group: We would all be deported because Trump won,\" said Octavio de Leon, 43, a Guatemalan who was detained with his son while crossing into Texas right after the election. President-elect Donald Trump has promised major change to the U.S. immigration system at a time when Central American families are flowing into the United States in growing numbers, many fleeing warlike conditions and poverty back home. U.S. Border Patrol has captured more migrants over the past three months than during the same period in each of the past five years. Trump has pledged to build a towering border wall and deport millions, proposals that have been sketched out so far only in broad terms. In a \"60 Minutes\" interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration in January.\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members,... In a \"60 Minutes\" interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration in January.\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members,... (Amy B. Wang) By winning the election, Trump may have inadvertently made his job even harder. His plans have become a selling point for the smugglers urging people to cross the border before a wall goes up, according to migrants and officials in the United States and Mexico. Others were hoping Clinton would win and offer them some form of blanket amnesty, according to Border Patrol agents. So many families have arrived in recent weeks that U.S. authorities announced last weekend that they are sending 150 agents to shore up this portion of border in the Rio Grande Valley. Here at the border, the obstacles to Trump's plans appear daunting. To hold, quickly process and deport the tens of thousands of arrivals each month, the Trump administration would have to add scores of immigration judges and dramatically expand detention facilities, which have faced legal challenges. A wall could cost billions. Some here welcome a Trump crackdown. Many Border Patrol agents resent what they see as a \"catch-and-release\" approach to the flood of Central Americans. To them, Trump's win has delivered the morale-boosting equivalent of a Red Bull. \"We're going to be able to do our jobs again,\" said Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol agent and a spokesman for their union, which endorsed Trump for president. \"We've turned into a detention agency,\" he said. \"We're not out there enforcing. We're doing jailer work and sometimes babysitting.\" But analysts, lawyers and elected officials on both sides of the border say it is a place that has always defied easy fixes and expensive barriers. --- What is often lost in the debate about border control is the dramatic change in who is trying to migrate. The number of Mexicans caught trying to illegally cross has been dropping - from more than 400,000 in fiscal 2010 to about 177,000 this year. Meanwhile the number of migrants from violence-plagued El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala has nearly quadrupled in the same period, to almost 179,000. Southwest border apprehensions The Washington Post Southwest border apprehensions over the past five years. August, September and October of 2016 have been higher than anytime for those months in the past five years. Southwest border apprehensions over the past five years. August, September and October of 2016 have been higher than anytime for those months in the past five years. (The Washington Post) Many of the Central Americans do not sneak over under the cover of darkness; they are delivered by smugglers to the banks of the Rio Grande and wade across in broad daylight to turn themselves in to Border Patrol. That's because most of the migrants are asking for some type of asylum and, therefore, are entitled to go before an immigration judge to plead their case, rather than being quickly deported. But it often takes months, if not years, for the backlogged courts to determine whether asylum seekers face danger at home and deserve protection. In the meantime, most of the migrants are released from detention after a few days. Often, they do not appear for their court dates. Of the 20,000 families whose legal proceedings ended with deportation orders between July 2014 and August this year, 85 percent did not show up in court, fueling the perception that migrants are gaming the system and intending to remain in the country illegally. Border Patrol union leaders want more agents and immigration judges, plus longer detention periods for asylum seekers awaiting court dates. Sending a stern message will discourage future migrants, said Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent in the Laredo, Tex., sector and a union representative. \"You do have to take some action,\" he said. \"Right now, it's out of control.\" But U.S. courts have already ruled that asylum seekers can't be held simply to deter other migrants from coming. And \"you can't get rid of the due-process proceedings,\" said Lorilei Williams, director of the immigration unit at Staten Island Legal Services, in New York. Asylum applicants are generally entitled to court hearings under the terms of international law.

Granjero, U.S.: A discarded item of clothing left near the banks of the Rio Grande, at one of the places where many Central American families have been crossing into the United States and turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents. (Nick Miroff / The Washington Post) A big increase in judges would take time and money. Rep. Henry Cuellar , D, who represents the Texas border and received budgetary approval for 55 more immigration judges in fiscal 2016, said it was unrealistic to think the courts could quickly accelerate their processing of cases. \"Right now, we're backlogged half a million [cases] with the current judges that we have,\" he said in an interview. \"Practically, you're talking about years and years\" to process those cases. Two years ago, after a flood of families from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala overwhelmed border authorities, the Obama administration launched a public-relations campaign to discourage migrants from making the trip, stepped up deportations of migrants who were denied asylum and pressured Mexico to crack down on its own southern border. Fewer migrants arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2015, but the figures have been climbing this year. Violence and poverty continue to drive people north, along with election-year factors: Some migrants had expected that it might be more difficult to enter the United States if Trump won. Other hoped that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, would win and offer them some form of amnesty, Border Patrol agents said. In October, Border Patrol apprehended 46,195 migrants, nearly 11,000 more than in the same month during the immigration crisis in 2014. In McAllen, at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, which takes in migrants once Border Patrol agents release them for their immigration court appearances, there were days in October when nearly 500 adults and children arrived, forcing authorities to erect tents to house the Central Americans in the parking lot.

Minneapolis Assistant Chief of Police Kris Arneson told reporters Friday that a parent dropping off their child at the day care center \u201crescued\u201d the child and called 911 at about 9:45 am. The child, a 16-month-old boy, is hospitalized but doing \u201cfine.\u201d Arneson said the suspect fled the scene in a minivan, struck a male pedestrian and dragged him several blocks. The pedestrian is expected to survive. The suspect then allegedly hit a bicyclist, also expected to survive, and was later found threatening to jump off an overpass along Interstate 94. Arneson said the woman had to be restrained by a passersby and police when they arrived on the scene. The woman was taken into custody and Arneson said she is currently being evaluated at the hospital. Arneson said the day care center was licensed and that \u201ca handful\u201d of children under six years old were at the facility Friday morning. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Researchers from the University of Leicester, in England, wanted to understand why bagged leafy greens are sometimes at the root of food poisoning outbreaks , so they analyzed the juices from various greens, including lettuce, spinach and arugula (known as rocket in the UK). They smashed the leaves with a mortar and pestle to extract the juices and then analyzed the juices and how they acted in a moist, bagged environment, the way lettuces are commonly sold in stores. They found that the juices from the damaged salad leaves increased salmonella growth 2,400-fold over a control group. They also reported in their study, published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, that even tiny amounts of the juice were able to adhere to leaf surfaces, multiplying the overall virulence of the bacteria in the moist interior of a salad bag. Foodborne illness: The most guilty foods list \u201cThis salad juice can stimulate salmonella growth massively in this salad plastic bag environment,\u201d investigator Giannis Koukiddis, a PhD student, explained in a YouTube video about the research. Even when it was refrigerated, salmonella was able to grow when the juice from cut greens was present. Dr. Primrose Freestone, with the university\u2019s Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, said in a press statement, \u201cSalad leaves are cut during harvesting and we found that even microliters of the juices \u2014 less than 1/200th of a teaspoon \u2014 which leach from the cut ends of the leaves, enabled salmonella to grow in water, even when it was refrigerated.\u201d The juices helped the salmonella attach itself to salad leaves so strongly that even vigorous washing didn\u2019t flush away the bacteria. The juices also helped the salmonella to attach itself more strongly to the plastic bag surface. The researchers say consumers who buy bagged salad should try to eat it as soon as possible after the bag is opened.\u00a0 \u201cWe found that once opened, the bacteria naturally present on the leaves also grew much faster, even when kept cold in the fridge,\u201d Primrose advised. The researchers also said their work shows how important it is for producers to increase safety standards when it comes to packaged greens. \u201cThis strongly emphasizes the need for salad leaf growers to maintain high food safety standards as even a few salmonella cells in a salad bag at the time of purchase could be become many thousands by the time a bag of salad leaves reaches its use-by date , even if kept refrigerated. Even small traces of juices released from damaged leaves can make the pathogen grow better and become more able to cause disease,\u201d said Primrose. Food poisoning: 6 foods to avoid In the U.S., there are about one million cases of foodborne salmonella illness each year, including 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths.\u00a0 Eggs , alfalfa sprouts, pistachios, ground beef, cucumbers and live poultry are among the other foods that have been linked to salmonella outbreaks in the U.S. in recent years. Common symptoms of salmonella food poisoning include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps that strike about 12 to 72 hours after infection. The study authors noted that their research did not look for evidence of existing salmonella in bagged salads; rather, they investigated how salmonella grows on damaged salad leaves and its behavior in the plastic bag environment. Preventing contamination of fresh salad would not only reassure consumers, it \u201cwill also benefit the economy due to fewer days lost through food poisoning. We are now working hard to find ways of preventing salad-based infections,\u201d said Koukiddis. The authors aren\u2019t advising consumers to stop gobbling up nutritious greens (in fact, they themselves still eat bagged salad). The risks for salmonella poisoning from salad in bags is low overall. But follow these tips for safer eating: Buy leafy salads with future use-by dates Prepare and eat salad from bags according to the package directions Eat greens soon as possible after purchase to minimize pathogen growth Don\u2019t store salad bags in the refrigerator more than one day Avoid bags of salad with mushed-up leaves Avoid any bags or salad containers that look swollen \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Jeff Sessions' career Mary Troyan and Brian Lyman, USA TODAY Network 5:50 p.m. EST November 18, 2016 x Share President-elect Trump has picked Sen. Jeff Sessions to be U.S. Attorney General. Here's what you need to know about the Alabama senator. USA TODAY NETWORK Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. speaks to media at Trump Tower, Nov. 17, 2016, in New York. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 Being U.S. Attorney General in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration would be the dream job for Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Eagle Scout from small town Alabama who openly professes his love of the law, his conservative ideology and his intense partisan loyalty. Trump announced Friday he will nominate Sessions to lead the Department of Justice, an agency in which he worked as a U.S. Attorney in south Alabama for 14 years before entering politics. It is a part of his biography he mentions more frequently than any other. \u201cJeff is principled, forthright, and hardworking,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cHe cares deeply about his country and the department he will be nominated to lead.\" But the road to Senate confirmation will be rough based on the reaction from Democrats and a whole host of civil rights organizations who fear Sessions\u2019 views on immigration, civil rights and criminal justice \u2013 many of them dating back to his time before he was in the Senate \u2013 will move the Justice Department in a sharply conservative direction after eight years of President Obama. Among the harshest critiques was from Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who called Sessions \u201canti-immigrant and anti-civil rights.\u2019\u2019 \u201cIf you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,\u2019\u2019 Gutierrez said in a statement. The most important reviews of Sessions\u2019 record, however, will come from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will decide whether to recommend him to the full Senate for confirmation. Senators traditionally show great deference to their colleagues when they are elevated to positions in the executive branch. And there were no signs Friday that any Senate Republican, even those who opposed Trump, had reservations about the appointment. Sessions\u2019 Democratic colleagues were signaling that his path to the Justice Department will not go unchallenged. \u201cSen. Sessions has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for many years so he\u2019s well aware of the thorough vetting he\u2019s about to receive,\u2019\u2019 said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary\u2019s ranking Democrat. \u201cAnd while many of us have worked with Sen. Sessions closely and know him to be a staunch advocate for his beliefs, the process will remain the same: a fair and complete review of the nominee.\u2019\u2019 The confirmation hearings, which could start even before Trump is sworn in Jan. 20, are expected to relive a series of events more than three decades ago in Alabama that had a profound impact on his career. In 1985, when he was U.S. Attorney in Mobile, Sessions\u2019 office brought indictments over allegations of voter fraud in a number of Black Belt counties, an area in Alabama named for the color of the soil but with a majority black population.\u00a0 In Perry County, Sessions\u2019 office charged three individuals with voting fraud, including Albert Turner, a long-time civil rights activist who advised Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and helped lead the voting rights March in Selma on March 7, 1965, known as \"Bloody Sunday\" after state troopers and a local posse attacked the protestors. Prosecutors alleged that Turner, his wife Evelyn, and activist Spencer Hogue altered ballots for a Sept. 1984 primary election. Robert Turner, Albert\u2019s brother and an attorney in Marion, Ala., said in a phone interview Friday that the defendants \u2013 later known as the Marion Three \u2013 were trying to assist poor and elderly voters in casting ballots. In some cases, the defendants said they were helping illiterate voters mark their ballots, and only altered ballots when requested. \u201cThere are and there were large numbers of elderly people in Perry County who need assistance,\u201d said Turner, who helped with his brother\u2019s defense. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get to the polls on their own. As a matter of fact, the technical requirements of completing and mailing (the ballots) were not understood.\u201d Sessions was present at the trial in Selma but left the prosecution in two assistants' hands. He denied the prosecution targeted black voters and said the case stemmed from complaints from local officials.\u00a0 A jury of seven blacks and five whites acquitted the defendants of all charges. The presiding judge threw out more than half of the charges for lack of evidence before the jury received the case. \u201cI thought that the prosecution was unwarranted and had no merit,\u201d Robert Turner said Friday. \u201cI thought it was deliberately done to dissuade black people from voting. I don\u2019t think he did it for a just cause.\u201d The case became the first point of controversy when then-President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions for a federal judgeship in 1985. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., called the prosecution \u201cvery troublesome\u201d and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pushed to delay his confirmation hearing to allow investigations. During the hearings in early 1986, prosecutor J. Gerald Hebert testified that when he asked Sessions about allegations a federal judge called attorney James Blacksher, who is white, \u201ca disgrace to his race\u201d for representing black clients, Sessions replied \u201cWell, maybe he is.\u201d Asked about the remark in 1986, Sessions said, \u201cI do not know why I would have said that, and I certainly do not believe that. The lawyer in question is one of the finest lawyers in the country.\u201d (Blacksher, reached by phone Friday, declined comment.) Thomas Figures, a former assistant U.S. Attorney, resigned from the office in 1985 in protest over the Perry County prosecution. During Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearings, Figures, who was black, alleged that Sessions had called him \u201cboy.\u201d Sessions called Figures\u2019 allegation \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d Figures said two assistant prosecutors overheard the remark, including Ginny Granade. Granade \u2013 now a federal judge in Mobile \u2013 said in a statement at the time that she never heard Sessions refer to Figures by anything other than his given name. Granade\u2019s office, citing the judge\u2019s policy of not discussing political or legal matters, declined comment Friday. Figures, who died in 2015 after serving as a municipal judge in Mobile, also said Sessions said he thought the Ku Klux Klan \u201cwas OK until I found out they smoked pot.\u201d Sessions did not dispute the remark but said it was a joke he did not expect people to take seriously. The testimony, though, led the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2013 then controlled by Republicans \u2013 to narrowly reject recommending Sessions\u2019 nomination to the full Senate. Sessions at the time said it was more important for him \u201cthat people not believe these charges of racial prejudice\u201d than receiving a federal judgeship. \u201cThere is no more important issue for our area than racial harmony,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThe fact that this process has suggested that I and my office have acted otherwise is like a nightmare.\u201d Robert Turner on Friday wouldn\u2019t say directly if Sessions should be attorney general. \u201cI can\u2019t say that a person never changes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of the time, people say what they believe, and their actions follow what they believe, and that\u2019s what I judge people by. When you act consistently in accordance with what you say, I know that\u2019s a part of you.\u201d Sessions left the U.S. Attorney post in 1993 with the arrival of President Bill Clinton, and his political career began. He was not well known outside of Mobile but won a bare-knuckled statewide campaign for Alabama Attorney General in 1994. After defeating the Democratic incumbent, Sessions took over and cleaned house of the Democrat\u2019s appointees who were hired outside the state\u2019s merit system. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll see is a Department of Justice run with honor and integrity, and it will probably be run leaner,\u201d said Armand DeKeyser, Sessions\u2019 former Senate chief of staff and close associate for 40 years. Two years after becoming AG, Sessions cashed in on his newfound statewide popularity and ran for the Senate seat left open by the retirement of Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin. The popular Heflin endorsed the Democratic nominee, then state Sen. Roger Bedford, and the seat seemed likely to remain in Democratic hands until Sessions\u2019 team leveled Bedford with last-minute allegations of using state funds to build a water line to his hunting cabin. Replacing Heflin also had an ironic twist because Heflin was among the Democratic senators who voted against Sessions\u2019 for a federal judgeship 10 years earlier. And Sessions eventually got a seat on the committee that rejected him. While on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions\u2019 support for Democratic attorney general nominees has been mixed. Last year, he voted against Loretta Lynch\u00a0because of her support of President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which shielded millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. \u201cThe Senate cannot confirm someone to this post who is going to support and advance a scheme that violates our constitution and eviscerates congressional authority,\u2019\u2019 Sessions said then. \u201cCongress makes the laws, not the president\u2014as every school child knows.\u2019\u2019 Sessions\u2019 opposition to Lynch came after he voted to confirm Eric Holder in 2009, despite Holder\u2019s role in then-President Clinton\u2019s controversial pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich in 2001. \u201cWhile he made mistakes as deputy attorney general\u2026Mr. Holder comes to the attorney general\u2019s office with an excellent background and states a firm commitment to uphold the rule of law,\u2019\u2019 Sessions said. \u201cLike those before him, President Obama\u2014who knows Mr. Holder well\u2014should be given reasonable deference in his nomination of executive branch officials, absent some disqualifying factor.\u2019\u2019 Contributing:\u00a0Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY ",

Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Bloomberg via Getty Images Ford Escape sport utility vehicles move down the production line at Ford Motor Co.'s Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky. Bloomberg via Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Thursday night to say Ford Motor Co. executive chairman William Ford Jr. had called to say the company would not move production of the Lincoln MKC from its Louisville Assembly Plant to Mexico. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 A second Trump tweet claimed credit for the decision. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Ford, however, said it neither planned to close the Louisville, Ky., plant nor reduce jobs there. The company said it had considered moving Lincoln production to Mexico to increase production of the Ford Escape in Louisville. Trump criticized Ford during the campaign for its decision to move small-car production from Michigan to Mexico. Trump suggested he might impose tariffs on Ford cars assembled in Mexico. Earlier this week, Ford CEO Mark Fields said Trump's election has not changed the company's plans. Reuters reports: \" 'We're going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that's to make room for two very important products we'll be putting back into Michigan plants,' Fields said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show. 'There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.' \"Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said last month he met with Trump. Ford has countered Trump's criticism, saying the company, founded by his great-grandfather, makes more cars and trucks in the United States than any other automaker. \"Fields said with U.S. gasoline prices so low, 'it's very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the U.S.' in the small car segment. If Ford decided to build the Focus small car line in the United States, and had to raise the price, 'we wouldn't sell the vehicle.' \" Article continues after sponsorship Ford has said on previous occasions that it has no intention of closing plants in the U.S. Also, plant closings are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the United Auto Workers Union, and it's not clear if plants could be closed before those agreements expire. Meanwhile Ford said in a statement to NPR, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \"The auto industry is scared,\" says Paul Eisenstein, publisher of The Detroit Bureau, an online newspaper that covers the industry. \"[It] is very seriously scared about the possibility of seeing barriers and trade wars like before the Great Depression.\" ",

Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), the future minority leader, is hamstrung by the \u201cnuclear\u201d rules change on filibusters current Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-N.V.) put into effect three years ago, limiting the procedural filibuster for executive nominations. EPA/MICHAEL REYNOLDS Senate Democrats are not going to be able to block Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions bid to become attorney general. And they can\u2019t do much to stop Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo from assuming the helm of the CIA. And they have only themselves to thank for it. That\u2019s because exactly three years ago, the Democratic Senate majority \u2014 led by Harry Reid (Nev.) \u2014 rammed through controversial rules fundamentally changing the way the Senate does business. They\u00a0unleashed\u00a0in November 2013 what\u2019s called the \u201cnuclear option\u201d allowing senators to approve by a simple majority all presidential appointments to the executive branch and the judiciary, with a big exception for Supreme Court justices. Democrats took the controversial step because they were so frustrated by what they saw as Republican foot-dragging on President Obama\u2019s choices\u00a0for his administration and federal judgeships. Under the new rules, it takes only a simple majority of\u00a0senators to confirm such appointments instead of the 60 typically needed to force Senate action. But now that Trump is in the White House and Republicans control the Senate,\u00a0Democrats have lost their most powerful weapon to block his appointments. Democrats will have 48 seats in the new Senate. The\u00a0architect of the rules change, outgoing Senate Minority Leader Reid (D-Nev.), says he doesn\u2019t regret his decision to go nuclear. \u201cSen. Reid has no regrets on invoking the nuclear option because of Republicans\u2019 unprecedented obstruction,\u201d said Reid spokeswoman Kristen Orthman. \u201cThe nuclear option lets presidents show their true colors and guarantees a nominee a fair up-or-down vote. If Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, that\u2019s their decision and they will have to live with it. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) noted that he opposed the rules change in the first place. \u201cI wanted 60 for Supreme Court and Cabinet, but I didn\u2019t prevail,\u201d Schumer\u00a0said in an interview Friday, in which he also expressed hope that Trump would nominate \u201cmainstream\u201d candidates. \u201cIf it\u2019s somebody who is out of the mainstream,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have.\u201d The problem is, those tools are now severely limited. It would fall to Republicans to join Democrats to stand in the way of any Trump appointment deemed objectionable. \u201cThe most controversial nominees should attract Republican opposition as well as Democratic,\u201d said Thomas Mann, a congressional expert with the Brookings Institution. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, it\u2019s speaking volumes about the Republican Party, and Democrats are relatively powerless to do anything about that.\u201d Republicans warned at the time that Democrats were making a mistake with what they called a \u201cpower grab,\u201d warning they would be sorry about the change when they eventually found themselves in the minority. Democrats defended the decision crucial to forcing action in a\u00a0Washington gripped by partisan warfare.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe important distinction is not between Republicans and Democrats, it is between those who are willing to help break the gridlock in Washington and those who defend the status quo,\u201d Reid said in 2013. In 2013, then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned \u00a0the GOP could easily seize power back in the 2014 elections \u2013 which they did, securing the majority in the Senate. And that\u2019s now what\u2019s happened. Republican senators \u00a0generally rallied around Sessions on Friday after his appointment to lead the Justice Department was announced. \u201cJeff is principled, forthright, and hardworking,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement Friday.\u00a0\u201cI look forward to the Senate\u2019s fair and expeditious treatment of our colleague\u2019s forthcoming nomination, just as it promptly processed President Obama\u2019s first Attorney General nomination.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 But Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) had harsh words for his colleague. \u201cSenator Sessions and I have had significant disagreements over the years, particularly on civil rights, voting rights, immigration and criminal justice issues.\u00a0 But unlike Republicans\u2019 practice of unprecedented obstruction of President Obama\u2019s nominees, I believe nominees deserve a full and fair process before the Senate,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u00a0\u201cThe American people deserve to learn about Senator Sessions\u2019 record at the public Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\u201d Leading Democrats have also been voicing grave concerns about Pompeo,\u00a0a member of the House Intelligence Committee and one of the more vocal members of the House\u2019s Benghazi panel investigating Clinton. Pompeo was also one of the more outspoken opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, leading a campaign to publicize the \u201csecret side deals\u201d between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Kansas Republican has drawn sharp rebukes from U.S.-based Muslim organizations for saying faith leaders who don\u2019t denounce terrorist acts done in the name of Islam are \u201cpotentially complicit\u201d in the attacks. \u201cCongressman Mike Pompeo, a leading cheerleader of the Benghazi witch hunt, is now being asked to fill one of the most serious and sober national security positions there is,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Friday. Republicans could go even further in trying to expand the Democratic rules change, requiring a simple majority to approve Supreme Court nominations, of which Trump stands ready to make at least one. Democrats are hoping they don\u2019t go that far. \u201cWe deliberately said, I said at the time, the Supreme Court is different than the lower courts,\u201d Schumer said in an interview Friday. \u201cThey understand we didn\u2019t change the rules and they didn\u2019t treat [Obama Supreme Court nominee] Merrick Garland well. They shouldn\u2019t be so extreme. We\u2019ll see what happens after that.\u201d 1 of 10 ",

    "text": "Nov 18 2016, 7:29 pm ET Partisan Opposition to Electoral College May Make it Harder to Change by Alex Seitz-Wald advertisement The Electoral College is under fire like never before. But the unprecedented and growing opposition to it, thanks to the partisan leanings of its detractors, may actually make it harder to charge the system. Hillary Clinton won at least 1.4 million more votes than Donald Trump, but still lost the presidential contest because her votes came from the wrong combination of states. That's made her one of just five people in U.S. history to win the popular vote and lose the electoral college. The first three were in the 1800s, and it happened again in 2000 with Al Gore's electoral college loss to George W. Bush. That contest was complicated by other concerns including butterfly ballots and the Supreme Court, making Clinton the first pure victim of the Electoral College in the modern era. Not surprisingly, the outcome has provoked an outpouring of demands for change.

Barbara Boxer Calls for Abolishing Electoral College in Wake of Trump Win California Sen. Barbara Boxer has introduced a bill to do away with the \"outdated, undemocratic\" electoral college. A likeminded petition on Change.org racked up nearly 4.5 million signatures. And more people have searched for information about the electoral college than any point since Google started keeping track. For the tiny cottage industry of experts and activists who have battled each other on this obscure issue from statehouse to statehouse across the country, the attention is a bit dizzying. \"I've never seen this kind of energy in my life,\" said Patrick Rosenstiel of National Popular Vote, the main anti-Electoral College group. \"We would generally have two to three people a day using the 'write your legislator' function on our website. Now we're getting upwards 10,000 to 20,000 every day.\" Traffic on the group's website surged some 25,000 percent after the election, surpassing 1.75 million page views in the following week. But the outcry is coming almost exclusively from Democrats, complicating reformers' attempts to push the issue as a non-partisan reform to already skeptical red-state lawmakers. Rob Richie, the longtime executive director and co-founder of the reformist group FairVote, called the uproar \"a total doubled edged sword.\" \"In the real world of trying to change things, it's very hard with a partisan drive from one side and the other party being against it,\" he said. \"It was in a place that it was starting to win a whole bunch of states and we'll just have to see how this impacts that, since people are getting more tribal.\" Related: More Voters Chose Clinton, but Trump Will Be President To opponents, the Electoral College is an obvious perversion of the one-person-one-vote rule, making tens of thousand voters in Ohio or Florida more important than the tens of millions who happen to live in California (the source of most of Clinton's popular vote lead) or Texas or any of the 37 other non-battleground states. Candidates rarely visit those states, so their issues get ignored and they even get worse treatment from the federal government, according to NPV, which argues that presidents pay special attention to the needs of states they or their party has to win. Play NOV. 8: Chuck Todd: 'There is a Bug' in Our Electoral College System 1:32 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161119014335if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/804213315558\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Eliminating the Electoral College entirely would require a constitutional amendment, which is nearly impossible. The last major attempt on that avenue ended in 1969, when a proposed amendment died by Senate filibuster after overwhelmingly passing the House. Instead, today's reformers have rallied behind a clever work-around that's merely very hard to achieve. It's an interstate compact in which state legislatures agree to assign their electoral college votes to whomever wins the national popular vote, regardless of how their state went. If enough states sign on, it has the effect of circumventing the Electoral College and making sure the winner of the popular vote is the next president. So far eleven states with 165 electoral votes have signed on to the plan, which will only be activated once 270 electoral votes-worth of states pass the compact. The campaign had been making steady progress in both red and blue states, with recent wins in the state legislatures of Oklahoma and Arizona, and real gains in Georgia, where 55 out of 61 state senators sponsored the bill. But Trent England, an Electoral College defender at the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a conservative think tank, thinks the election results has stopped the reformers in their tracks. \"I think their effort is basically done, at least for the foreseeable future,\" said England, who has testified against NPV in statehouses. \"It was a tactical mistake for them to sell this to Republicans as a partisan way for them to win.\" Protesters demonstrate against President-elect Donald Trump outside Independence Hall November 13, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mark Makela / Getty Images Both parties are hypocrites on the Electoral College, complaining about when they lose and defending it when they win. \"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy,\" Trump tweeted moments after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election. After winning the election this year, he changed his tune: \"The Electoral College is actually genius,\" Trump tweeted . Defenders of the Electoral College say it forces political parties to broaden their message beyond regional strongholds and gives rural areas a check on the power of coastal urban centers, which might otherwise come to dominate politics. Swing states change from year to year, they note, while the most populous ones do not. And the system forces candidates to compete in most politically balanced places, which encourages persuasion and provides partisan checks on the integrity of the voting system. \"When candidates have failed to get an Electoral College win, even if they win the popular vote, they've not done a good job of reaching out to lots of different people,\" said Tara Ross, the author of the book \"Enlightened Democracy: The Case for the Electoral College\" and a frequent opponent of popular vote activists in statehouse hearing rooms. This year, for instance, much Clinton's popular vote lead came from California, a liberal state where Republicans were barely even on the ballot thanks to it's so-called \"jungle primary\" system that allowed two Democrats to run against each other in the general election. \"NPV has in the past has been able to tell people in red flyover states, it's going to help you,\" Ross said. \"Now, a lot of voters in red states are thinking oh wow, California and New York really could sway the election.\" Alex Seitz-Wald ",

    "text": "Trump Turns to His Right Flank to Fill National Security Posts By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS Continue reading the main story Photo Senator Jeff Sessions at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday. President-elect Donald J. Trump has selected Mr. Sessions to be his attorney general. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump moved quickly on Friday to begin filling national security posts at the top echelons of his administration, selecting a group of hawks and campaign loyalists who reflect the hard-line views that defined his run for president. Mr. Trump said he would nominate as attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has been a fierce supporter of a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The president-elect also moved to install Michael T. Flynn , a retired lieutenant general who has said that Islamist militancy poses a global existential threat, as his national security adviser. And as director of the C.I.A., Mr. Trump selected Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who harshly criticized Hillary Clinton during the House investigation of the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. All three are regarded, in some ways, as outliers from conventional Republican thinking, shunned at times for strident statements, controversial positions or highly partisan moves. The flurry of announcements indicated that Mr. Trump was gaining control over a transition operation that had been entangled in infighting during its early stages. The results were the first seeds of an administration-in-waiting that will break starkly with that of President Obama. Continue reading the main story Transition officials said Mr. Trump would meet over the weekend with a broad array of potential cabinet members and other advisers as a signal that he wanted to build a diverse team, without regard to political affiliation or support for his presidential bid. Among them are Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee and one of his party\u2019s harshest critics of the president-elect\u2019s campaign, who is a contender for secretary of state, and Michelle A. Rhee, a Democrat who pursued sweeping reforms during her controversy-filled tenure as the District of Columbia\u2019s chancellor of schools. Photo Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been tapped as the national security adviser for the incoming Trump administration, at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times But there was no evidence in Friday\u2019s selections that Mr. Trump, who has hinted that he might pursue a more centrist agenda once he sits in the Oval Office, is inclined to moderate his approach on key questions of national security and civil rights. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Sessions a \u201cworld-class legal mind,\u201d and added that Mr. Pompeo would be \u201ca brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Of General Flynn, he said: \u201cI am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.\u201d Both Mr. Sessions and General Flynn were early and fervent supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, even as many establishment Republicans were criticizing Mr. Trump for inflammatory statements and dismissing his chances of winning the nomination. Mr. Pompeo initially supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican primary, but switched after it became clear Mr. Trump would be the nominee. Mr. Pompeo is also close to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is heading the transition effort. In 1986, Mr. Sessions \u2014 who, if confirmed, would be charged with safeguarding civil rights in the United States \u2014 was blocked from becoming a federal judge by the Senate\u2019s Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee because of previous racially charged comments and actions. In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired.\u201d An African-American federal prosecutor, Thomas H. Figures, said at the time that Mr. Sessions had referred to him as \u201cboy,\u201d and testified that Mr. Sessions had said the Ku Klux Klan was fine \u201cuntil I found out they smoked pot,\u201d a remark Mr. Sessions later dismissed as a joke. OPEN Graphic Aides to Mr. Trump dismissed the past statements, and described Mr. Sessions as a champion of civil rights, citing as evidence a number of desegregation lawsuits he filed while serving as a United States attorney in Alabama, his votes to extend the Voting Rights Act and to confirm Eric H. Holder Jr. as the first African-American attorney general, and his efforts to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. \u201cSenator Sessions is someone who\u2019s universally respected across party lines in the United States Senate,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, calling him \u201cvery well qualified for this position.\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said on Twitter that Mr. Sessions was \u201cwell liked and well regarded, even by those who don\u2019t always agree with him.\u201d He added, \u201cI look forward to supporting his nomination.\u201d First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

But, in a reflection of the tough questions he is likely to face in his confirmation hearing, civil rights groups and their champions in Congress condemned the choice. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic Senate minority leader, \u201cI am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, and want to hear what he has to say.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of General Flynn, which does not require Senate confirmation, was similarly cheered by conservative organizations and met with alarm by Democrats. He has called Islam a political ideology that has \u201cmetastasized\u201d into a \u201cmalignant cancer.\u201d After building a reputation as a respected military officer, he was fired by President Obama after he had served two years as the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency. General Flynn has since been a vociferous critic of a Washington elite he contends has refused to name radical Islam as the enemy, and is therefore doomed to fall short in defeating it. Photo Representative Mike Pompeo was a harsh critic of Hillary Clinton during hearings by the House Benghazi panel. Credit Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press \u201cHis statements about Muslims are profoundly un-American as well as damaging to the fight against terrorism and national security,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cHe has indicated an openness to torture and the destruction of an entire city, both of which are clearly illegal, not to mention immoral and destructive to America\u2019s global leadership.\u201d Mr. Wyden said that the president-elect, who last week chose Stephen K. Bannon, who has promoted hard-right nationalism as the chairman of Breitbart News, appeared to be building \u201ca White House leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his campaign.\u201d Mr. Pompeo, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and Harvard Law School, was elected to Congress in 2010 with substantial financial backing from a political action committee funded by Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan. He has criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s decisions to shut down the C.I.A.\u2019s black-site prisons and to require all interrogators to strictly adhere to anti-torture laws. In 2014, he accused Mr. Obama of refusing \u201cto take the war on radical Islamic terrorism seriously.\u201d After the House Select Committee on Benghazi found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama administration or Mrs. Clinton, who was the secretary of state at the time of the attack, Mr. Pompeo and another Republican member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, said they were convinced there had been a cover-up, and they filed a 48-page addendum that included far harsher criticism of the administration and of Mrs. Clinton. Other Republicans, including the committee\u2019s chairman, declined to add their names to the document. Representative Adam B.

Bill Haslam . According to a court notice filed Friday in Franklin County, Ohio, Jimmy Haslam was served with a notice to appear at the deposition in Knoxville on Dec. 13. The lawsuit was filed by companies that declined to participate in an $85 million settlement between Pilot and 5,500 trucking companies in connection with a scheme to cheat customers out of promised discounts and rebates. The company also paid a $92 million federal penalty. Haslam has denied knowing about the scheme. The scheduled deposition was first reported by journalist Walter F. Roche Jr. 0 Shares ",

The WHO director general designated the disease a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" in February 2016 due to the initial starting outbreak and because there was an \"urgent\" need for research to understand the effects of a Zika infection. After research proved a link between Zika virus infection and birth defects including microcephaly , officials felt a different kind of response was needed, according to their statement. \"The EC [Emergency Committee] felt that Zika virus and associated consequences remain a significant enduring public health challenge requiring intense action but no longer represent a PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] as defined under the IHR [International Health Regulations],\" WHO officials said in a statement today. \"Many aspects of this disease and associated consequences still remain to be understood, but this can best be done through sustained research.\" WHO officials are now advocating for the development of a sustained program with \"dedicated resources to address the long-term nature of the disease and its associated consequences.\" 0 Shares ",

The board\u2019s new plan calls for testing infants and toddlers not just in Flint, but across the entire state. Nikia Wakes\u2019 son, Jaylon, has been having trouble in school lately. In 2015 he tested positive for elevated levels of lead . Now, the seven-year-old is not only struggling with his school work, he\u2019s had anger issues. Wakes blames the water. Nikia wakes and her son, Jaylon, live in Flint, Michigan. Close CBS News \u201cI started noticing behavioral changes,\u201d Wakes says. \u201cLast year, he was suspended from school over 50 times.\u201d Researchers say lead exposure can cause cognitive and behavioral problems. To prevent those sorts of things from happening to other Michigan families, the board established by Gov. Rick Snyder in May made 100 recommendations. Among them, universal blood testing of children at 9 to 12 months and again at 24 to 26 months. And because most lead poisoning comes from old lead paint, the board wants mandatory inspections of rental houses and homes built before 1978, when lead paint was outlawed.\u00a0 Researchers testing the water in Flint, Michigan.\u00a0 Close CBS News \u201cIf you knock on any door inside the city of Flint and ask that family has anything changed for them -- with all the eyes of America on this particular community -- they would say no, I\u2019m still drinking bottled water,\u201d said Michigan Rep. Sheldon Neeley.\u00a0 Wakes says she\u2019s \u201clost all trust in the system. If you don\u2019t trust the system then what\u2019s the answer? Right now i don\u2019t know what the answer is.\u201d Wakes says she sees a lot of anger from her neighbors. \u201cPeople are giving up in Flint. They call this pure Michigan and we\u2019re pure poisoned.\u201d Flint is still using water from Detroit. The EPA announced on Friday the new steps the city must take before it\u2019s allowed to begin supply its own water to residents -- but that includes three months of testing. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The settlement likely means that Trump will avoid becoming possibly the first sitting president to testify in open court. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the settlement \"a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\" Lawyers involved in the cases say the settlement applies to all three lawsuits against Trump University including two cases filed in California. The trial for one of the cases had been scheduled to start Nov. 28. The $25 million figure will be split among the students who sued, minus the legal fees. Trump will also pay up to $1 million in penalties to the state of New York, Schneiderman said.

By Jim Tankersley November 18 at 5:21 PM Follow @jimtankersley President-elect Donald Trump speaks to the media following a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in Washington on Nov. 10. (Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) During a conference call with analysts Thursday morning, Ford Motor Company Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was asked how President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies might affect the automaker's decisions on investing in\u00a0Mexico or in the United States. Shanks said that he couldn't speculate on trade. He pivoted, instead, to Trump's plans to cut taxes and spend more on infrastructure, saying they could \u201cbuild a stronger, more vibrant, growing economy and provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.\u201d Less than 11 hours later, Trump was bragging on Twitter that he\u00a0helped stop Ford from moving an entire factory from Kentucky to Mexico. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 The tweets were exaggerated: Ford's contract with the United Auto Workers prevents it from shutting down the factory in question, the Louisville Assembly Plant, or from laying off workers there without engaging further talks with the union. The company clarified that it had merely decided not to move production of a single vehicle, the Lincoln MKC, out of Kentucky. At the same time, the company said Friday that the\u00a0coming Trump presidency did give it an incentive to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky.\u00a0\u201cWe are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness,\u201d Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said, \u201cand make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.\u201d The events stirred a flurry of confusion on social media that lasted through Friday, and they underscored two fast-emerging realities for U.S. business in the coming Trump era. It appears that large companies such as Ford could, at least to some degree, be set to invest more domestically if Trump and Congress cut its taxes. It also appears that Trump will seize opportunities to claim credit for those investments, and to cast them as victories even if they result in no new U.S. jobs. In the case of Ford in Louisville, \u201cNo one really thought that plant would close,\u201d said Bernard Swiecki, a senior automotive analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, who tracks North American automakers' investment decisions. \u201cThese moves are not at all akin to saving the plant. That was never under consideration by anyone.\u201d What was known publicly before Thursday's developments was that Ford had already announced plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville. Its contract with the UAW called for it to make up that lost production \u2014 and ensure no jobs would be lost in Louisville \u2014 by producing more Ford Escapes, the other vehicle assembled in the plant. The Escape is the far more popular model: Ford has sold \u00a0more than 258,000 of them this year through October, compared with just under 21,000 MKCs. The contract does not say where the MKC production would go. Ford officials said late Thursday that they had intended to move it to Mexico. Union officials said Friday that the company had never indicated that to them. Reports last year suggested a plant in Chicago might pick up the MKC production. Ford did announce plans to move a different line of production \u2014 small cars, including the Ford Focus \u2014 from Michigan to Mexico. It said it would ramp up other production in Michigan to ensure no workers lost their jobs from the move. Trump criticized that decision repeatedly on the campaign trail, but the company reaffirmed this week that it is going forward with that move. So why did Ford cancel a relatively modest, previously unannounced plan to move Lincoln production to Mexico, while maintaining its larger-scale plan to move small-car production there? Privately on Friday, Ford officials suggested that their decision to keep Lincoln production in Louisville was influenced in part by the likelihood that Trump will sign a large cut in corporate income tax rates and move to scale back fuel-economy standards issued under President Obama, which automakers have called onerous. Those policies would affect the financial calculus the company uses when deciding which cars to produce and where to produce them. Swiecki suggested another factor: the auto industry's softening sales growth. Sales were down in October for all of the Big Three American automakers. Ford is on track to sell fewer vehicles this year than it did in 2015, a demand reduction that could mean there was no need to move the MKC production to enable the plant to churn out more Escapes. A joint letter to Louisville plant workers from UAW and Ford officials on Friday seemed to hint at that. \u201cThe company's plan has been to balance out the current model of the Lincoln MKC to allow for additional capacity for the Escape,\u201d it read. \u201cThe company has since reevaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.\u201d The letter said the company's chairman, Bill Ford, had spoken with Trump on Thursday and \u201clet him know of the change in plans.\u201d Some automotive writers suggested \u00a0that with the move, Ford officials were offering Trump concessions in hopes of dissuading him from following through with a campaign threat \u00a0to levy tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports from countries such as Mexico and China. In his call with analysts, Shanks, the company chief financial officer, suggested the company does not know how seriously to take those threats. \u201cI don't want to speculate\u201d on the impacts of Trump's trade policies, Shanks said. \u201cI just don't know, we don't know, none of us know.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d he continued, \u201cI just keep coming back to the fact that it's clear that at least from the campaign positions that Mr. Trump took that they are focused on growth, they are focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., they are focused on building a stronger, more competitive infrastructure, which I think that's great for the country, as well.\u201d business ",

Jeff Sessions as attorney general and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser are the latest signal that his cabinet could run much like his unconventional campaign. The president-elect is increasingly relying on figures who have demonstrated loyalty, share his contempt for elite opinion, and who carry a history of accusations of racism or bigotry that will make them polarizing figures before they assume their job. The choices also raise questions about how to evaluate Trump's government in the aftermath of his election, which caught officials in both parties by surprise. Sessions was Trump's earliest supporter in the Senate, where his fiery opposition to illegal immigration and skepticism toward legal immigration lined up well with Trump's campaign message. As a former U.S. attorney, state attorney general, and longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has a relevant background for the job and Senate Republicans \u2014 even several who clashed with Trump in the campaign \u2014 rushed to announce their support. Related: What You Need to Know About Trump's Latest Top Picks for Key Jobs Sessions' earlier career, not his work in the Senate, is likely to draw the most scrutiny in his hearings. He was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 by a rare bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee after hearings revealed disturbing allegations about his views on race. An African-American colleague said he had called him \"boy\" and that Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan ''were OK until I found out they smoked pot,\" which Sessions testified was a joke. Another colleague alleged he called a variety of civil rights groups, including the NAACP Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, \"un-American\" and \"communist-inspired\" and said that they were \"trying to force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.\" Sessions denied any racial animus at the time and has denied it since then, but the pick guarantees a contentious hearing and will further entrench fears among Trump critics that he'll ignore some Americans, especially vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities, frightened by his election. Trump's transition team provided statements Friday from Trump supporter Pastor Darrell Scott and from Alabama U.S. Attorney Kenyen Brown, both African-Americans, attesting to Sessions' \"character\" and \"integrity.\" They also noted that Sessions participated in desegregation lawsuits early in his legal career, voted for a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act as senator (which passed unanimously in 2006), and supported President Barack Obama's appointment of Eric Holder as the first African-American attorney general.

Record 8:17 p.m. EST November 18, 2016 x Share A humpback whale was spotted swimming up the Hudson River near the George Washington Bridge, the farthest north a whale has been seen in the waterway in recent memory, according to a local group that catalogs marine mammals. USA TODAY NETWORK A whale breaches in The Hudson river as seen from Edgewater, NJ on November 18, 2016. (Photo: Marko Georgiev/staff) WOODLAND PARK, N.J. \u2014 A humpback whale was spotted swimming up the Hudson River near the George Washington Bridge on Friday \u2014 the farthest north a whale has been seen in the waterway in recent memory, according to a local group that catalogs marine mammals. The Palisades Interstate Parkway Police tweeted a photo of a whale breaching the surface of the Hudson just south of the on Friday afternoon. Helicopter footage also showed the whale breaching. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s been documented and there\u2019s no one else keeping these kinds of records,\u201d said Paul Sieswerda, founder of Gotham Whale Watch, a group of \"citizen scientists\" who catalog marine mammals in New York. Sieswerda was concerned that the whale could be hit by a ship in the congested Hudson. Evidence points to great white shark nursery off N.J. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the whale is in good shape and is just chasing fish,\u201d he said. The number of whales swimming around New York Harbor and off the Jersey Shore has increased significantly in recent years. Conservationists have credited cleaner waters for the increase. Less sewage, street runoff and industrial discharges affect the bottom of the food chain, allowing plankton to flourish closer to shore. That in turn provides a food source for small bait fish like menhaden. And whales love to eat menhaden. The presence of more whales has drawn thousands onto whale-watching boats hoping to see the mammals gliding through the ocean and perhaps even glimpse a humpback leaping out of the water. It has also prompted authorities to warn boaters, fearing whales are coming too close to shore. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and New York environmental officials issued alerts to boaters to slow down and watch out for whales following three strikes along the Eastern Seaboard in 2013, including one in May in which a cruise ship dragged a 55-foot finback into the Hudson River. 918 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g6Ou42 ",

By Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima November 18 at 9:44 AM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @nakashimae In December, after presidential candidate Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) introduced a \u201csense of the Senate\u201d resolution affirming that the United States must not bar people from the country because of their religion. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \u2014 a member of the Judiciary Committee, along with Leahy \u2014 voted against the resolution and delivered a 30-minute oration urging fellow senators to join him. The resolution, he warned, would make global migration to the United States a \u201chuman right.\u201d It would mean, he said, that the United States \u201ccould not favor for entry the moderate Muslim cleric over the radical Muslim cleric.\u201d Or that a foreign cleric overseas could demand a tourist visa to deliver a sermon denouncing the U.S. Constitution \u201cand claim religious discrimination\u201d if it was not approved. \u201cI think,\u2019\u2019 Sessions said, \u201cit is a dangerous step.\u201d Although the measure passed the committee, it failed in the full Senate. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet President-elect Trump has chosen Sessions, who has served in the Senate for 20 years, to be the next attorney general \u2014 a position that will give him the platform to shape civil rights policy and to defend the constitutionality of any policies that effectively restrict Muslim immigration, legal and civil liberties experts warn. Sessions has also been dogged with accusations of racism, which sank his nomination to become a federal judge after President Ronald Reagan nominated him 30 years ago. At his Senate hearing, Sessions said he was not a racist, but several Justice Department employees testified that he had used racist language. [ Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fan. Here\u2019s how their relationship began. ] Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, lauded Sessions in a statement Friday as a \u201crespected member and former ranking member\u201d of the committee who has worked with Democrats on major legislation. Grassley predicted that the committee will approve his nomination for consideration by the full Senate. \u201cHe knows the Justice Department as a former U.S. attorney, which would serve him very well in this position,\u201d Grassley said. The appointment of Sessions is expected to bring sweeping changes to the way the Justice Department operated under Loretta E. Lynch and her predecessor, Eric H. Holder Jr., who, when he was nominated to be the first black attorney general, pledged to make rebuilding the Civil Rights Division his top priority. Several former Justice officials and Democratic lawmakers predicted that Sessions would reverse the emphasis on civil rights and criminal-justice reform that Holder put in place. The Department of Justice built up an aggressive civil rights division under President Obama, but under President-elect Trump it would likely take a different approach toward police departments alleged to have overused force. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) [ 10 things to know about Sen. Jeff Sessions ] \u201cFrom his time as U.S. attorney through his service on the Judiciary Committee, he has left serious doubts about whether he would faithfully enforce civil rights laws as attorney general,\u201d former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. \u201cThe Civil Rights Division was gutted during the last Republican administration, and the burden of proof is on Senator Sessions to show that he would not follow that same path.\u201d Sessions voted to confirm Holder as attorney general, but he voted against Lynch, citing her statements that President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration passed legal and constitutional muster. Sessions and other Republicans considered those measures to be presidential overreach. \u201cMs. Lynch has said flat-out that she supports those policies and is committed to defending them in court,\u201d Sessions said at the time. \u201cWe do not have to confirm someone to the highest law enforcement position in America if that someone is publicly committed to denigrating Congress.\u201d Obama\u2019s Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act and successfully argued the historic same-sex marriage case last year before the Supreme Court. Sessions has opposed same-sex marriage and has a zero rating from the nation\u2019s largest LGBT advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, expressed dismay about Session\u2019s nomination. It only adds \u201cto a growing list\u201d of nominees \u201cwith troubling pasts, and troubling histories of bigotry and intolerance,\u201d Hooper said. George J. Terwilliger III, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush and has known Sessions for nearly three decades, disputed the characterization. \u201cI can say unequivocally there\u2019s not a racist bone in the guy\u2019s body,\u201d he said. Democratic lawmakers on Friday promised a tough and thorough vetting and confirmation process. \u201cI know Senator Sessions and we work out in the gym, but the fact that he is a senator does not absolve him from answering tough questions in the confirmation process,\u201d said Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, the incoming minority leader. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and I want to hear what he has to say,\u201d Schumer said. A former aide to Sessions said that, as attorney general, he will make national security and fighting terrorism a top priority. \u201cSessions is of the mind that the most essential duty of government is to protect its citizens,\u201d the aide said. Sessions opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba and bringing terrorist detainees to the United States for trial in federal courts. \u201cHe felt it would needlessly eliminate an important tool in fighting terrorism and would needlessly put our citizens at risk,\u201d the aide said. [ New national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] Jefferson Beauregard \u201cJeff\u201d Sessions, 69, who was born in Selma, Ala., began his career as a prosecutor in 1975 in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Alabama. In 1981, President Reagan nominated him to be the U.S. attorney for that district, where he served for 12 years. In 1986, Reagan nominated him to be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. But at his Senate confirmation hearing, Justice Department lawyers who had worked with him testified that he had made racist and other incendiary statements. One of those lawyers, J. Gerald Hebert \u2014 now the director of the voting rights and redistricting program at the Campaign Legal Center \u2014 said that Sessions had called the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired.\u201d Thomas Figures testified that Sessions said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was \u201cokay until I found out they smoked pot.\u201d Sessions later apologized for the comment, saying he was not serious when he said it. Witnesses also testified that after disagreement between a black and a white member of his staff, Sessions admonished the black staffer to be \u201ccareful what he said to white folks,\u201d and once referred to a black lawyer in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office as \u201cboy.\u201d Sessions denied the allegations, but he was not confirmed. Aides to Session said that he was not insensitive to African Americans and pointed out that as a young Republican at Huntingdon College in the 1966, Sessions campaigned against segregationist candidates such as Lurleen Wallace, who was running for governor to sustain the policies of her husband, then-governor George Wallace, a staunch opponent of desegregation. George Wallace was banned by state law from serving consecutive terms. In 1994, Sessions was elected attorney general of Alabama. He was elected to the U.S. Senate two years later. Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse Trump, in February, first met him in 2005 when Trump was criticizing the United Nations\u2019 plan for a $1.2\u00a0billion renovation of its New York City headquarters. Sessions invited him to testify about it before a Senate subcommittee hearing. After the hearing, they were out of touch until last year, when they had a phone call about immigration policy and Trump tried to get Sessions\u2019s endorsement. Mike DeBonis, Robert Costa, Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to this report. Read more: ",

A New York federal jury found Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, 30, and his cousin, Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas, 31, guilty on one charge each of conspiracy to smuggle drugs. The jury of seven women and five men heard less than two weeks of testimony and returned their verdict after about six hours of deliberation. The men face a maximum sentence of life in prison. The two Venezuelan citizens were arrested in Haiti in November 2015 a few days before a planned air shipment of cocaine from Venezuela to Honduras, where prosecutors said they contacted a Drug Enforcement Administration informant for help in transporting the drugs to the United States. As reported by the Two-Way , the men were traveling with diplomatic passports, but didn't have diplomatic immunity. Their defense lawyers argued that they were victims of a U.S. government sting operation and that the case against them was based on the testimony of the longtime DEA informant who was also dealing drugs. Article continues after sponsorship In his closing statement , U.S. Attorney Brendan Quigley said, \"The defendants thought they were above the law. They thought they could operate with impunity in Venezuela because of who they were and who they were related to.\" ",

Buzz60 In this  2005 file photo, then real estate mogul and Reality TV star Donald Trump, left, listens as Michael Sexton introduces him at a news conference in New York where he announced the establishment of Trump University. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP) In what New York's attorney general called\u00a0a \"stunning reversal,\" president-elect Donald\u00a0Trump agreed Friday to\u00a0settle fraud cases involving Trump University for $25 million. The\u00a0cases involved a\u00a0lawsuit by New York state and two class actions suits in California against the university, which promised to reveal Trump's\u00a0real estate investing \"secrets\" to people who enrolled in the courses. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who filed suit against Trump two years ago\u00a0for what he called \"his phony university,\" said the president-elect agreed to settle the lawsuits for $25 million\u00a0and pay\u00a0an additional $1 million\u00a0in penalties to the state of New York for violating state education laws. The deal does not require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. \"Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cThis would have gone on for a long, long time and would have been a very significant distraction,\u201d said Daniel M. Petrocelli, the attorney who represented Trump in the case. Trump lawyer: lawsuits would have been 'significant distraction' to president Trump had\u00a0publicly vowed not to settle the lawsuits and suggested at one point during his presidential campaign that he might reopen the school, which closed in 2010. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency. \u201cI could have settled this case numerous times, but I don\u2019t want to settle cases when we\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,\u201d Trump said at the time. However, an exclusive analysis by USA TODAY of more than 4,000 lawsuits involving Trump and his companies over the years shows that just isn't true. USA TODAY tracked down the records in thousands of Trump's court battles dating back to the 1980s, in courts coast to coast, and found that the business mogul settled lawsuits at least 259 times. Almost 200 of those were cases where he and his companies were defendants, although the terms of the settlement agreements often are kept out of court records and plaintiffs are required to sign agreements pledging not to disclose details. In hundreds more cases, court records indicate legal disputes were resolved outside court with the details shielded from public view. Also, the USA TODAY database of court records shows today's settlement is unique in its size. While there may be larger settlements in Trump's lawsuits that are shielded by non-disclosure agreements or sealed records -- notably his divorce from Ivana Trump, which remains under seal despite attempts by the media to obtain the records during the presidential campaign -- the $25 million payout is by far the largest Trump's empire has paid out to someone. Dive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits Friday's settlement comes only days before trial was set to begin in\u00a0California\u00a0in one of the class action lawsuits. Trump's lawyers had sought a\u00a0delay in the run-up to his\u00a0inauguration, but the\u00a0judge ruled that the trial go ahead as scheduled and that Trump would\u00a0be required to testify,\u00a0although likely by videotape. Last week, at a pretrial hearing in San Diego, Trump's lawyers said they were open to settlement. U.S. District Court Judge\u00a0Gonzalo Curiel, who is hearing the case in California, brought up the possibility in court of another federal judge, Jeffrey Miller, assisting the parties in trying to find a way to settle the case before trial. \"I can tell you right now I'm all ears,\" Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli told Curiel. The New York attorney general's fraud lawsuit described the \"university\"\u00a0as nothing but a scam designed to fleece would-be real estate developers. The scheme, he charged, lured students with\u00a0false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investing \"secrets\" from his \"hand-picked\" instructors. \"More than 5,000 people across the country who paid Donald Trump $40 million to teach them his hard-sell tactics got a hard lesson in bait-and-switch,\" Schneiderman said in a statement at the time. \"Mr. Trump used his celebrity status and personally appeared in commercials making false promises to convince people to spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn't afford for lessons they never got.\u201d Schneiderman\u00a0 alleged \u00a0the teachers were not personally selected by Trump, despite claims in the university's\u00a0ads, and that the students\u00a0did not ever meet the real estate mogul. The state earlier\u00a0forced Trump University to quit referring to itself as a\u00a0university because it was not licensed as such in New York. The political impact of the settlement is unclear, as are its legal implications to future Trump lawsuits. \"Settling these cases will surely help the President-elect as a political matter,\" Chris Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah who spent the year studying the Trump University cases. He had opined that a civil court finding that Trump and his companies were financially liable for defrauding thousands of Trump University students could technically open the door to Congress pursuing impeachment proceedings against Trump. \"That being said, the settlement will likely help the country turn the page on the sordid details of President-elect Trump's alleged fraud and avoid the embarrassment of his testimony and potential loss at trial,\" Peterson said. Trump, who dismissed Schneiderman\u00a0as a \"lightweight,\" vigorously denied the fraud charges and claimed 98% of the people who signed up for the\u00a0courses expressed satisfaction with them. In 2013 tweet, Trump ridiculed the move\u00a0by the\u00a0New York attorney\u00a0general,\u00a0saying: \"Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No Case!\" Contributing: John Kelly 11563 CONNECT TWEET 24 LINKEDIN 501 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fDh66n ",

    "text": "Donald Trump National Security Adviser Mike Flynn Has Called Islam 'a Cancer' By MARIAM KHAN Nov 18, 2016, 2:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Michael Flynn: Everything You Need to Know 0 Shares Email The man whom President-elect Donald Trump picked as his national security adviser has said he doesn\u2019t believe that all cultures are \u201cmorally equivalent\u201d and once described Islam as \"a cancer,\" comments that have many in the Muslim community worried about what his new job might mean for them. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn served as an adviser to Trump on national security and foreign policy throughout the presidential campaign . Flynn has said he agreed with Trump's initial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, but told Al Jazeera earlier this year it likely \"wouldn't work,\" and that he supports the vetting of Muslims coming from Syria and places where terrorism is a major threat. He also accompanied Trump to his first top-secret national security briefing in August this year, and he was vetted as a potential running mate before Vice President-elect Mike Pence was eventually announced, two senior level sources with direct knowledge told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cI am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,\u201d Trump said in a statement today. \u201cGeneral Flynn is one of the country\u2019s foremost experts on military and intelligence matters and he will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration.\u201d The position of National Security Adviser does not require U.S. Senate approval. Here are some of his controversial comments: Flynn on \u2018Radical Islam\u2019 Flynn, a registered Democrat who had a decades-long military career, served under the Obama administration until reportedly being forced to retire early as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The early retirement resulted from \"the stand I took on radical Islam,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby reportedly said at the time that the retirement had \u201cbeen planned for some time\u201d and that then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel \u201cappreciates [his] service.\" For Flynn\u2019s part, he told Fox News in April 2015, \u201cI've been at war with Islam, or a component of Islam, for the last decade.\u201d Flynn earlier this year released a book -- \"The Field of Fight: How We Can Win The Global War Against Radical Islam And Its Allies\u201d -- that he co-wrote sharing his views on what he called the \u201cglobal war against radical Islam,\u201d calling for the United States to develop a deeper understanding of radical ideology. Flynn wrote, \u201cwe\u2019re in a world war against a messianic mass movement of evil people, most of them inspired by a totalitarian ideology: Radical Islam.\u201d He also said in the book, \u201cI don\u2019t believe all cultures are morally equivalent, and I think the West, and especially America, is far more civilized, far more ethical and moral, than the system our main enemies want to impose on us.\" \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to stop feeling the slightest bit guilty about calling them by name and identifying them as fanatical killers acting on behalf of a failed civilization.\u201d Brooks Kraft/Getty Images Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn delivers a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention, July 18, 2016, at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Flynn, who\u2019s chairman and CEO of Flynn Intel Group, is also a board member of ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center calls \u201cfar and away the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in America.\u201d The organization bills itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest non-profit, non-partisan, grassroots national security organization\u201d that\u2019s \u201ccommitted to recruiting, training, and mobilizing citizens community by community to help protect and preserve American culture and to keep this nation safe,\u201d according to its website. ACT for America did not respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment \u201cMr. Flynn's past Islamophobic statements, and his association with the nation's most venomous anti-Muslim hate group, should disqualify him from serving in any public office,\u201d Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations , told ABC News before Flynn\u2019s official selection. In this tweet from February, Flynn said the fear of Muslims is a rational one: Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions ... \u201c he tweeted, referring to an anti-Muslim video from a third party. \u201cRadical Islam\u201d is a designation that President Obama has refused to recognize. Throughout his tenure as president, he has sought to make a clear distinction between Islam built on peaceful teachings and the acts of terrorism carried out by extremists who adhere to radical interpretations of the religion. Flynn did not respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment left with Flynn Intel. But he said in a statement this morning via the Trump Transition team that, \"I am deeply humbled and honored to accept the position as National Security Adviser to serve both our country and our nation's next President, Donald J. Trump.\" Muslims \u2018All on Guard\u2019 Speaking this summer at an ACT for America event in Dallas, Flynn likened Islam to \"a cancer,\" according to the Dallas Morning News , adding that documents taken from terrorist groups tell followers to \"get into the bloodstream of the opposition,\" which Flynn said he interprets as attacks on Western nations. Muslim activists are troubled by the prospect of a Trump administration that might include Flynn. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is carefully curating a senior team that seem to have one thing in common: a deep seated animosity against Islam and Muslims. [Lt.] General Flynn is one of them, and has been on the record about his sentiments towards Islam and Muslims repeatedly,\u201d said Rabia Chaudry, a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace and a board member of the new Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council that was launched to combat Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. \u201cPutting this man in charge of domestic security matters has the potential of great damage to American Muslims, who are certain to be at top of his \u2018enemy within\u2019 list, rather than white nationals, which both studies and authorities show are the real greatest domestic threat we face,\u201d she said before Flynn\u2019s official selection. Hazem Bata, secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America, says Muslim leaders across the United States \u201care all on guard.\u201d \u201cOur community is preparing for an America that has parts of government openly hostile to Muslims,\u201d Bata said before Flynn\u2019s official selection. \u201cWe are hoping for the best, but getting ready for the worst.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "What to Know About Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump's Pick to Lead CIA By ALANA ABRAMSON Nov 18, 2016, 1:51 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Names Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo His Pick for CIA Director 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald J. Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas to serve as his CIA director. \u201cI am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside President-elect Donald J. Trump to keep America safe,\u201d Pompeo said today in a statement. \u201cI also look forward to working with America\u2019s intelligence warriors, who do so much to protect Americans each and every day. Pompeo, who supported Sen. Marco Rubio during the GOP primaries, is so far the only person named to the Trump administration, other than Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who supported another candidate during the 2016 election. Here are a few things to know about Pompeo: The Basics Date of Birth: Dec. 30, 1963 Age: 52 Birthplace: Orange, Calif. What He Does Now Pompeo represents Kansas\u2019 4th Congressional District. He has accepted Trump's offer to direct the CIA, but needs to be confirmed by the Senate. What He Used to Do Before his 2010 election to represent the district, Pompeo was president of Sentry International, a Midwest company that sells imported pumping units to U.S. gas and oil distributors. Before that, he founded a Wichita, Kansas, company originally known as Thayer Aerospace, which manufactures components for the commercial aerospace, defense and space industries. After graduating from West Point, Pompeo served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army. Education Pompeo attended West Point, where he graduated first in his class, and Harvard Law School, where he was an editor on the Harvard Law Review. Key life-career moments As a congressman, Pompeo served on the House Intelligence Committee, conducting oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies, and the House Select Committee on Benghazi . Pompeo and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, released in June their own addendum to the House Benghazi Committee report that condemned Hillary Clinton 's leadership of the State Department during the deadly Benghazi, Libya, attack, and accused the administration of misleading the public about events there. The supplement was far more critical than the GOP majority report led by the committee chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. Pompeo opposes the Iran deal, arguing in a summer op-ed that it hasn't helped make the United States safer. \"Congress must act to change Iranian behavior and, ultimately, the Iranian regime,\" he wrote on Fox News\u2019 website. He is opposed to closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba , and has also advocating for strengthening U.S. surveillance capabilities. \"Robust surveillance, drawing on a variety of technical and human intelligence and backed up by rigorous investigation of all leads, is the best way to mitigate the threat,\" of terrorism , he wrote in a January 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed. Pompeo also serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 0 Shares ",

Eisenstein advertisement President-elect Donald Trump took credit on Thursday night for saving a Ford manufacturing plant from being moved abroad \u2014 even though the plant was never going anywhere. \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky \u2014 no Mexico,\" he tweeted. The only problem? Ford had never suggested it would close the plant in question, which employs about 4,700 people. In fact, Ford officials made a commitment in its 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant during the next four years. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 After months of erroneously bashing the automaker in speeches and in social media about its production plans, the tweet seemed like a nice start to a beautiful new friendship - or at least a nice change of pace from a long string of inaccuracies. He even followed it up with another one. \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great state of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" he tweeted. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 In actuality, the automaker's plans called for Ford to shift production of the Lincoln MKC to the company's plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, at some point in 2019 in order to increase production of the strong-selling Ford Escape. Related: Trump, Ford Tussle Over Move to Mexico Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker confirmed that Bill Ford spoke with President-elect Trump on Thursday, according to the Detroit Free Press, saying \"Bill shared Ford's continued commitment to invest in the U.S. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" Trump has repeatedly gotten Ford's production plans wrong during his campaign, flogging the automaker and incorrectly claiming it was moving all of its auto production to Mexico.

Todd Ricketts (right) hugs his sister Laura as Tom address the crowd at the Cubs' World Series rally at Grant Park on Nov. 2, 2016. (Charles Rex Arbogast / AP) Rick Pearson Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts is scheduled to meet with Donald Trump on Saturday, a day the president-elect also is to talk to Mitt Romney and retired Marine Corps Gen. Jim Mattis about potential posts in a new White House cabinet. An aide to Ricketts deferred comment on the meeting to Trump's transition team, which announced the president-elect's Saturday schedule to reporters in New York. \"These meetings that the president-elect is holding are showing that he is meeting some of the best, brightest and most qualified people, not only to fill specific roles within the administration, but also to give advice and counsel,\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said. The meetings will be held in Bedminster, N.J. Ricketts was an influential factor in late campaign season fundraising for two allied groups that backed Trump: the Future45 super political action committee and the related independent expenditure 45 Committee, which does not have to disclose its donors. The groups got a late fall infusion of cash via commitments from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, as well as from Joe Ricketts, the patriarch of the family who founded TD Ameritrade. The Adelsons gave $5 million to the super PAC and pledged $25 million more to the effort to back Trump, and Joe Ricketts donated $1 million to the super PAC. Todd Ricketts told supporters in late September that the pro-Trump effort was on its way toward raising $70 million, CNN reported at the time. Todd Ricketts also was an at-large delegate for Trump in the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention in July and took part in Chicago and suburban fundraisers for his presidential candidacy. He is a board member of TD Ameritrade and a business investor and consultant. The Ricketts family's involvement in the Trump effort was a sharp turnaround from the primary campaign, when they funded the anti-Trump Our Principles PAC. That prompted Trump to warn on Twitter in February: \"They better be careful, they have a lot to hide.\" At that time, the Rickettses were heavily invested with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker 's White House bid. Todd Ricketts was a donor to a Walker-aligned super PAC and the family's matriarch, Marlene Ricketts of Nebraska, donated $5 million to it. Also scheduled to visit Trump on Saturday is Romney, the GOP's unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate and a sharp critic of the president-elect during the campaign. There has been speculation that Romney could be offered the post of secretary of state. Mattis, a retired Marine general who served as head of U.S. Central Command, also will meet with Trump. He is being touted as a possible secretary of defense. Others on the Trump list for Saturday include a pair of potential candidates for education secretary: Betsy DeVos, who's from an influential Republican family from Michigan, and Michelle Rhee , a former District of Columbia schools chancellor.

The Iowa-born biochemistry researcher and astronaut is set to break more than just one record during her third-ever visit to the International Space Station . Whitson will also become the first woman to command the orbital complex twice. She already holds the record for the longest time spent in space by a woman with 377 days. Joined by Oleg Novitskiy of the Russian space agency Roscosmos and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency , the crew is expected to arrive at the ISS on Saturday, where an American and two Russians will welcome them. They are tasked with completing a series of scientific experiments until their return in the spring of 2017. The record for the oldest man in space in John Glenn at 77 years old.

By Aaron Blake November 18 at 11:28 AM Follow @aaronblake From left to right, Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump, and sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. watch the second presidential debate. (Tasos Katopodis/AFP/Getty Images) In case there was any doubt, the last 24 hours have sealed it: Donald Trump's family will play a big role in his presidency, if they have anything to say about it. That's problematic for a host of reasons. But the Trumps appear primed to press the envelope of what's\u00a0legal and ethical in the new\u00a0administration. Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, appeared in photos of\u00a0 the president-elect's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday. And the New York Times is reporting that Kushner may test the legal bounds of what he's allowed \u00a0and attempt to join the\u00a0Trump administration. The revelations follow a series of controversies involving Trump's family over the past week . First, Trump's lawyer said that the president-elect's fortune would be put in the hands of his three oldest children -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump. The following day, all\u00a0three were named to\u00a0Trump's transition team, helping him pick who will run his administration. Then it was reported that the high-level security clearances were being sought for those\u00a0three children and\u00a0Trump's son-in-law -- something the Trump campaign eventually denied. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The first move was already questionable, since\u00a0it's customary for wealthy politicians like Trump to set up true blind trusts in which they have no real control over their fortunes and don't know how the decisions they make might enrich themselves.\u00a0And just about everything since then suggests there will be no real firewall between Trump's presidency and his kids; if anything, they might be more involved\u00a0than we previously thought and certainly more involved than just about any previous presidential children. Even if Kushner is the only one to technically join the administration -- and it remains an open question of whether he can -- the presence of Trump's children on his transition team and at a high-profile meeting with top world leaders shows just how Trump plans to involve his family in his presidency. But why is all of this a big deal in the first place? Why wouldn't family members of politicians be allowed to serve in their administrations or take meetings with world leaders? It traces back to the Kennedys. After President John F. Kennedy appointed his 35-year-old brother, Robert, as attorney general -- a basically unprecedented move at the time, involving an office for which few thought the younger Kennedy was qualified -- Congress in 1967 passed an anti-nepotism law. It reads : A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official. But it's not completely clear whether this law applies specifically to White House staff. In other words, Kushner certainly couldn't be a Cabinet secretary, but the Trump team seems to think he could be an adviser. And the possible precedent for that traces back to another famous political family: the Clintons. When President Bill Clinton appointed his wife, Hillary, to head up his health-care efforts, the\u00a0couple was\u00a0sued . It wasn't that the filers\u00a0wanted to nail the Clintons for nepotism,\u00a0but given that she\u00a0could not be an official government employee under the law, they argued that the meeting of her health-care task force should be open to the public. The appeals court decision that resulted might have given Kushner and Trump hope to get around the law in 2016, though some experts are dubious.\u00a0Here's the passage from D.C. Circuit Court Judge Laurence Silberman , which was joined in by Judge Stephen Williams: ...We doubt that Congress intended to include the White House or the Executive Office of the President. ... So, for example, a President would be barred from appointing his brother as Attorney General, but perhaps not as a White House special assistant. ... The anti-nepotism statute, moreover, may well bar appointment only to paid positions in government. ...\u00a0Thus, even if it would prevent the President from putting his spouse on the federal payroll, it does not preclude his spouse from aiding the President in the performance of his duties. In keeping with this ruling, the New York Times reports that a lawyer whom Kushner has consulted with suggested he forgo a paycheck and put his own holdings into a blind trust. Granting for the moment that Trump can shoehorn his son-in-law\u00a0into the White House, though, there remains the question of his proximity to Trump's finances. Trump is already taking heat for not using a true blind trust; the Wall Street Journal editorial board said Friday that he should liquidate his assets and put the cash proceeds in a true blind trust , if only in the name of putting the controversy to rest. As a White House staffer, Kushner would be deeply involved in the decisions that would affect the finances of the Trump Organization that his wife is running. One could argue that the Trump kids serving on the transition team doesn't give them direct control over the levers of government that could affect their fortune. But Kushner would have access to those levers and have potential knowledge of Trump's fortune that Trump himself is not supposed to have. And Ivanka Trump sitting in on meetings with high-profile world leaders only compounds the possible conflicts of interest. So, yes, having Trump's children so close to his presidency is already ethically and legally questionable. And tasking them with controlling his fortune while he's in office and potentially giving one of their spouses an official role in his presidency makes all of this very dicey. But Trump seems to be ignoring the doubters and pressing forward. We'll see how far he can take it. 1 of 10 ",

A news release from the U.S. Marshals Service says the suspect was killed by officers who returned fire. The release says the deputy marshal, 53-year-old Patrick Carothers, was shot twice while trying to serve a warrant at a mobile home in rural Long County, about 55 miles southeast of Savannah. Stewart Cottingham, supervisory inspector for a fugitive task force run by the U.S. Marshals Service, says the suspect was a fugitive wanted in Sumter County, South Carolina. The fugitive, Dontrell Montese Carter, was wanted on charges of attempted murder of police officers, domestic violence and unlawfully discharging a weapon stemming from a September incident, reports CBS affiliate WTOC. Carter was reportedly struck multiple times in a gunfight with officers Friday and was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Carothers, a 26-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service, served as deputy commander of the Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force for more than a year, the station reports. In a statement, U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Director David Harlow said Carothers was married and had five children. He called Carothers a hero and described Carter as \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO \u2014\u00a0Facebook said it would repurchase up to $6 billion of its stock beginning early next year. The Facebook board approved the buyback on Friday, the social media giant said in a regulatory filing after the markets closed. Facebook shares rose 1% to $118.40 in after-hours trading. \"The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities,\" Facebook said. \"The program will be executed consistent with the company\u2019s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to grow the business over the long term.\" Facebook, like other major tech companies, has amassed a stockpile of cash in recent years. Facebook has $26 billion in cash and short-term investments. Tech companies often don't return cash to shareholders, preferring to spend it on acquisitions and other growth opportunities. The decision comes after a precipitous decline in the stock price earlier this month when Facebook warned investors that revenue growth would slow next year. Earlier this week, Facebook said it had\u00a0uncovered more instances in which it had overstated how much consumers interact with its content. Advertisers rely on these measurements when deciding\u00a0to buy ads. And Facebook is grappling with allegations that fake news on the giant social network fueled\u00a0misinformation and sowed division during\u00a0the presidential election and may have even influenced the outcome.

Mike Pompeo, the Kansas congressman Donald Trump picked to lead the CIA, is a former Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate who is widely respected within the intelligence community for his intellect and his low key, analytical manner behind closed doors. He also happens to be a conservative firebrand who sought to blame Hillary Clinton for the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and vehemently opposed the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, which intelligence officials say has kept Iran's nuclear weapons capability in check. Still, many CIA insiders were breathing a sigh of relief over Pompeo's ascension Friday, calling him the most favorable option among the many names the Trump team recently had floated. Intelligence officials regard Pompeo, who has been regularly interacting with them as a member of the House Permanent Subcommittee on Intelligence, as a savvy consumer of their product who respects the agency's role. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Wichita Republican is seen as solid and strong-willed, all of which insiders see as a positives for the CIA \u2026 and for the national security community. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff , called Pompeo \"very bright and hard-working.\" \"While we have had our share of strong differences \u2014 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2014 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director,\" Schiff said in a statement Friday. Rep. Devin Nunes (R.-Calif.) chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Pompeo for \"spend[ing] an immense amount of time in the field all across the world meeting with our intelligence professionals and service members on behalf of the House Intelligence Committee. One of the most respected voices in the House of Representatives on national security issues, Mike will undoubtedly develop a close working relationship with Congress in his new post. I am confident his nomination will be widely supported within the CIA, and I look forward to his fast approval by the Senate.\" Play ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic Mr. Trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of Washington\u2019s establishment in both parties, and his choices reflect that. President George W. Bush established a Republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative ideology, including some officials who challenged him. Mr. Trump\u2019s early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is choosing a national security team that shares his views, and of course every president is entitled to do that,\u201d said Kori Schake, who was the deputy director of policy planning in the State Department under Mr. Bush. \u201cBut the problem is that surrounding yourself with people who share your views tends to reinforce them, leaving you vulnerable to big mistakes.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The people Mr. Trump has selected will thrust the words \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d to the center of American foreign policy in a way that blurs the lines between a war on terrorism and a war on Islam. General Flynn, in particular, has used anti-Muslim language that even the most strident Republicans have avoided. \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL,\u201d he posted on Twitter in February. He has compared Islam to a cancer and described it as a political ideology disguised as religion. Both Mr. Bush and President Obama believed that such language inflamed anti-American sentiment, served as a recruiting tool for terrorists and antagonized countries in the Middle East that the United States needed as allies in the fight against terrorism. Since Sept. 11, 2001, there has been bipartisan consensus that the best way to combat terrorism was to dismantle terrorist networks while avoiding being seen as attacking Islam. Mr. Trump has shown no such qualms. He proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and criticized politicians for tiptoeing around the role religion plays in terrorism. Photo Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, at Trump Tower on Friday. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Mr. Pompeo has said that Muslim leaders contribute to the threat by refusing to repudiate terrorism, though Muslim leaders and advocacy groups have done so repeatedly and often. \u201cSilence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in 2013. \u201cThe thinking here is that, no, religion is the key factor that influences everything else,\u201d said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse.\u201d \u201cThese guys are operating on the assumption that it\u2019s something going on in the religion itself.\u201d An overarching question for the United States government over the past 15 years has been where to set the balance between security and civil liberties. Mr. Trump has said that he gives more weight to security in that balance, and his early staff decisions reflect that view, both in matters of counterterrorism and of traditional law enforcement.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Nov 18, 2016 7:06 PM EST Trump University agreed to settle civil fraud lawsuits for $25 million, the New York attorney general announced Friday. Calling it a \u201cstunning reversal by Donald Trump,\u201d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement Friday that under the settlement, \u201cevery victim will receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws.\u201d Trump transition to the White House - live blog Schneiderman said until now, that Mr. Trump had \u201cfought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals, and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.\u201d One plaintiff in the California class action lawsuit who will receive compensation has mixed feelings about the settlement.\u00a0 \u201cHe conned and swindled me and now six years later he is willing to settle because he is taking office on January 20th? Don\u2019t get me wrong, this $20,000 loss has been a big hardship on me,\u201d the former Trump University student told CBS News\u2019 Laura Strickler. \u00a0But I don\u2019t want you to use my name because I\u2019m afraid someone will see that I fell for [Trump University] and will think I am stupid.\u201d Patricia Rodriguez, a former Trump University student from Bronx, welcomed the settlement. \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s good, perfect,\u201d she told Strickler. \u201cWe deserve to get something back, some money, because we didn\u2019t get anything out of the classes.\u201d Students from all over the country will be contacted, or they can also on their own contact the New York attorney general\u2019s office for reimbursement. \u00a0His office plans to hire an administrator to be the point of contact and distribute the settlement money, Strickler reports. Trump lawyer Alan Garten released a statement saying the Trump Organization was \u201cpleased\u201d the lawsuits have been resolved. \u201cWhile we have no doubt that Trump University would have prevailed at trial based on the merits of this case, resolution of these matters allows President-Elect Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation,\u201d Garten\u2019s statement said. In California, a federal judge on Friday was to consider arguments on President-elect Trump\u2019s latest request to delay a civil fraud trial involving his now-defunct Trump University until after his inauguration on Jan. 20, but the announced settlement applies to the both the California and New York lawsuits.

Donald Trump attends the launch of Trump University in 2005. (Bebeto Matthews / Associated Press) Kristina Davis, Greg Moran A $25-million settlement was reached Friday in three fraud lawsuits filed against President-elect Donald Trump and his now-defunct Trump University real estate seminar business. The agreement\u00a0covers two class-action lawsuits filed in San Diego and a third suit brought by the New York state attorney general. The actions had alleged that Trump defrauded customers into thinking they would learn real estate secrets from professors personally selected by him. The students said they learned little and instead were\u00a0subjected to hard-sell tactics urging them to spend thousands on classes. Under terms of the settlement, Trump will\u00a0not acknowledge or admit any liability or wrongdoing;\u00a0$21 million will be spread among plaintiffs in the two San Diego cases, while parties to the New York case will get\u00a0$4 million. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys agreed to work pro bono, maximizing the amount the students can recover. The 7,000-plus eligible class members should be able to recover at least half \u2014\u00a0and possibly 100%\u00a0of the money they spent on Trump University \u2014\u00a0said plaintiff attorney Jason Forge. Some students had paid up to $35,000 on \u201celite\u201d university memberships that offered a year of mentorship. Some said\u00a0they were encouraged to max out credit cards to pay for the instruction. \u201cStudents will be very pleased to be able to pay their credit card bills and move on with their lives,\u201d plaintiff attorney Rachel Jensen said. During the presidential campaign, Trump on several occasions said that he would not settle the cases. His attorney Daniel Petrocelli said outside court Friday\u00a0that he was\u00a0not sure what path the case would have taken if Trump hadn\u2019t been elected, but that Trump was\u00a0a \u201cfighter.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is pleased to have this case behind him so he can focus on every important issue facing this country,\u201d Petrocelli said. \u201cHe was willing to sacrifice his personal interests to put this behind him and move forward.\u201d The settlement terms were reached in the final hours before a 1:45 p.m. hearing\u00a0in San Diego before U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the two class-action lawsuits. Last week, Curiel suggested both sides meet with veteran U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller to see if a last-minute settlement could be worked out before the first case went to trial Nov. 28. Both sides spent all day Wednesday with Miller, and on Thursday worked to include the New York attorney general\u2019s office in the settlement, Petrocelli said. Because it involves class-action litigation, the deal still must be approved by Curiel. The judge said he needs to make sure it is \u201cfair, appropriate and reasonable.\u201d That is expected to take at least a month. If Curiel grants preliminary approval, then notices will go out to the class members, who can object or opt out of the agreement. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

    "text": "Email Inmates at Illinois' major women's prison have been called \"crazy\" and \"worthless\" by corrections officers, are sometimes placed in an unpadded open-bar \"crisis cage\" and receive harsher discipline than men for similar offenses, a study released Friday says. The federally funded review conducted for the Illinois Department of Corrections found that the mostly nonviolent women at Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln are often classified as higher security risks than necessary, which with disproportionate discipline needlessly extends their stays. Segregation is overused as a punishment and the women get few chances to prepare for community re-entry, contributing to a recidivism rate of 50 percent \u2014 higher than the state's prison population as a whole, according to the report. The National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women's assessment is harshly critical of the 2013 decision by former Gov. Pat Quinn's administration to close a women's prison in Dwight and move nearly 2,000 women into Logan, which was designed for 1,500. The \"poorly planned, rushed and chaotic\" move \"set the tone for the culture that exists at Logan today,\" it said. Corrections director John Baldwin pledged additional staff training. Illinois is one of about a dozen states to undergo the assessment, for which states had to compete. The report advocates taking a different approach to incarcerated women because of their different emotional responses to stress and their histories. Ninety-eight percent of imprisoned Illinois women have experienced physical abuse, 75 percent have been sexually abused, and 85 percent have encountered emotional abuse. At the time of the review, 42 percent of the inmates qualified as seriously mentally ill. Although women make up only a fraction of the population at Illinois' overburdened prisons, making life better at Logan is worth the effort, said Donna Collins, a Rhode Island state prison administrator who has helped implement gender-response changes in that state and was among the speakers scheduled to address a forum Friday in Chicago. \"Women are the backbone of the family,\" Collins said. \"You're hurting the community if you continue to re-incarcerate women.\" The study said there is inadequate training for staff members to deal with women's emotional responses. In interviews, staff members called inmates \"crazy\" and said they \"talk too much,\" resulting in more discipline and good-conduct credit days taken away. But women are more relational and prefer to discuss things, as opposed to men, who tend to shut down, Collins said. And women often don't relate well to prison security staff because they were typically at odds with authorities on the street, said Colette Payne, who spent five stints in prison beginning at age 14 and was part of the assessment team. \"If I've been raped and you are yelling at me like my abuser, I see you as that person,\" said the 49-year-old who now runs a support group for former women inmates. \"I'm looking at you like you're my abuser, that's where the tension comes in.\" Payne was shocked to see the use of the so-called \"crisis cage,\" where women are placed in a stand-alone cell without privacy or padding; the department has pledged to replace it. The report notes that inmates making \"crisis calls,\" in which they feel a threat to themselves or others, increased dramatically from early 2014 to late 2015, and monthly suicide attempts increased tenfold since the Logan consolidation. The report praises the state Corrections Department for agreeing on necessary change and constructing a mental-health unit at the prison. Baldwin, who also addressed the Chicago forum, called the haphazard 2013 consolidation \"a setup for failure\" and said the agency is adding staff training, \"from how to work with women who have a mental illness to how to be more effective in communicating with offenders.\" Ed Caumiant, corrections liaison for the prison guards' union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the union is ready to work with the department on adequate staffing as well as training. Deanne Benos, a former Corrections assistant director whose Chicago-based Women's Justice Initiative coordinated the project, said one reason Illinois succeeded in the competitive grant process was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's criminal justice reform pledge. He wants to reduce the prison population by 25 percent by 2025. \"Meaningful changes can be made with limited resources,\" Benos said. \"Even changing some of the rules and operational practices at Logan can have a dramatic impact on the facility.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Contact Political Writer John O'Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .

Alice Fordham/NPR hide caption toggle caption Alice Fordham/NPR Iraqi soldiers pose on a tank they captured from ISIS in a small base a few miles east of Mosul. Alice Fordham/NPR The Iraqi soldiers posing for photos next to a pile of captured ISIS weaponry \u2014 mortar shells, tanks, even a tunnel-boring machine \u2014 are battle-hardened. They have been fighting ISIS all over the country since 2014, when about a third of Iraq fell to the extremists. Speaking at a little base in northern Iraq, they say the fight for ISIS' largest stronghold, Mosul, is different. \"In Anbar, there was just us and them,\" said Cpl. Qusay al-Jubouri, referring to the province west of Baghdad where the ISIS-held cities were deserted by civilians during battles earlier this year and last year. \"We knew everyone inside the city was an enemy \u2014 in any house, we could attack them. But here, the problem is all the civilians stay in their houses.\" The U.N. estimates as many as a million people, maybe even more, still live in Mosul. ISIS fighters use civilians' rooftops as sniper hideouts and sneak through narrow streets on motorcycles. \"ISIS is using civilians as human shields,\" said Jubouri. Eyewitnesses inside the city and displaced people who've fled say the extremists have forced civilians deeper into the city, making crowded neighborhoods even more densely populated. Article continues after sponsorship Military officials and their advisers from the U.S.-led coalition have repeatedly stressed that protecting civilians is a priority in this fight. Jubouri agreed, but noted that it is very difficult to use airstrikes, tank rounds or indeed any weapons against ISIS inside Mosul, for fear of hitting civilians. Enlarge this image Maj. Gen. Maan al-Saadi of Iraq's elite counter-terror forces believes Iraqi forces will take control of the area of Mosul they've already entered within a month or two. \"I cannot say when exactly,\" he said. \"But soon.\" Alice Fordham/NPR hide caption toggle caption Alice Fordham/NPR Maj. Gen. Maan al-Saadi of Iraq's elite counter-terror forces believes Iraqi forces will take control of the area of Mosul they've already entered within a month or two. \"I cannot say when exactly,\" he said. \"But soon.\" Alice Fordham/NPR The offensive has been going on for a month. The array of Iraqi security forces, paramilitaries and international allies still face, in many areas, stiff resistance from ISIS in the rural outskirts of the city. But the army and counter-terror forces east of Mosul moved relatively quickly through villages deserted by civilians, and are now inside the city. \"We entered,\" said Gen. Shaker al-Shwaily. \"But our movement became slower.\" Shwaily is with the 9th division of the Iraqi army, an armored division, and said in the narrow streets of Mosul, his tanks and Humvees get stuck and become easy targets. The fight really needs more infantry, he says, but he's not sure when it might arrive. In the weeks before the offensive to retake Mosul began, military and civilian leaders said they expected resistance groups inside the city to rise up against the extremists. That hasn't happened, at least not yet, but Shwaily didn't seem surprised. \"These are poor people,\" he said. Ground down by years of what is essentially a siege and under total ISIS control, Shwaily couldn't see that they would have the resources to fight back. At a nearby camp for the displaced in Hassan Shami village, a man who fled heavy fighting in Mosul a week ago said he didn't expect to see significant resistance to ISIS there. \"It's hard for us to resist them,\" he said. \"We don't have weapons, and also we have children with us.\" ISIS fighters know who everyone is, where their families live. They would take revenge on the family of any rebels, he said. The man spoke anonymously because he is still afraid of ISIS. But he said although their fighters are brutal, they are no longer numerous. \"I think their numbers are small,\" he said. \"But they try to deceive the security forces by hiding themselves between houses and moving around on motorcycles.\" They shoot from one house, then another, hoping to give the illusion of numbers. Iraqi forces patrol the Zahra neighborhood of Mosul on Nov. 16. Army and counter-terror forces have reached some parts of the city, but other forces are facing stiff ISIS resistance on the outskirts.

Army and counter-terror forces have reached some parts of the city, but other forces are facing stiff ISIS resistance on the outskirts. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Despite what analysts call the \"compression\" of fighting around the city \u2014 and the fact that anti-ISIS forces haven't even reached the city limits in some areas \u2014 Iraqi commanders remain optimistic. Maj. Gen. Maan al-Saadi of the elite counter-terror forces said he thought Iraqi forces would take control at least of the eastern side of the city, which they've already entered, within a month or two. \"I cannot say when exactly,\" he said. \"But soon.\" He said his men have stopped using vehicles at all and are moving forward in small groups on foot, block by block, trying to isolate houses with ISIS fighters to kill them at close range. The extremists are still using car bombs, booby traps and snipers. \"But it is getting less,\" Saadi said. About two weeks ago, his men were being hit by as many as 40 car bombs a day. On one recent day, he said, beaming, there were only five. ",

Touted cost controls won't have real impact for decades. Mayor Eric Garcetti (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Los Angeles officials often boast about how they stemmed the rising cost of employee pensions, an expense that has hobbled cash-strapped cities throughout California. Former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said changes he oversaw in 2011 and 2012, which included lower pensions for new employees and higher retirement contributions from city workers, were \u201cthe most far-reaching effort in the nation.\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti echoed that assertion this year, saying L.A. had \u201cdone the most pension reform in the country of any big city.\u201d This series is a partnership of Yet the numbers tell a story jarringly at odds with the political rhetoric, a Times analysis found. Today, Los Angeles taxpayers are underwriting retirement benefits that are among the nation\u2019s most generous \u2014 at a cost that has never been higher. The city\u2019s general fund payments for pensions and retiree healthcare reached $1.04 billion last year, eating up more than 20% of operating revenue \u2014 compared with less than 5% in 2002. L.A.\u2019s vaunted pension reforms have not cut the city\u2019s pension costs; at best, they have modestly slowed their rate of growth. Since the changes took effect, general fund contributions to the retirement system have grown an average of $66.6 million a year \u2014 roughly twice as fast as all other spending controlled by the mayor and City Council. City budget analysts say the increases will slow over the next five years, to $36.1 million annually. Even so, retirement costs would continue to consume roughly 20% of operating revenue. The effects can be measured in services forgone and civic ambitions deferred. With the money put into its pension funds over the last two years alone \u2014 nearly $2 billion \u2014 the city could have fixed every one of its broken sidewalks, built or leased housing for more than 25,000 homeless people or restored 11 miles of the concrete-clad Los Angeles River to a natural state. The Pension Gap: Read the story L.A.\u2019s pension burden, while severe by national standards, is not unusual for California. Six  of the state\u2019s 10 largest cities \u2014 Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, Sacramento, Oakland and Bakersfield \u2014 devoted more than 15% of their general fund budgets to pensions and retiree healthcare during the 2015 fiscal year, The Times found.  San Jose contributed the greatest  share \u2014 almost 28%. Those cities face a common obstacle: In California, a stream of court rulings over the last half-century have shielded public employees from cuts to their retirement plans, restricting cost-saving measures to new hires. Those reductions take decades to be fully reflected in a  municipality\u2019s bottom line. L.A.\u2019s taxpayers are also paying the price for questionable decisions made years ago. The city\u2019s annual pension bill has effectively been doubled by the need to pay down debt to the retirement funds created by years of benefit enhancements and overly optimistic financial projections. The resulting shortfall is estimated by independent analysts at more than $20 billion. City officials today continue to use the same bullish accounting, raising doubts about elected leaders\u2019 claims to have lightened the pension burden for future taxpayers. Garcetti, who exercises direct influence over the city\u2019s retirement policy through his appointments to the pension funds\u2019 boards of trustees, declined to be interviewed for this story. ADVERTISEMENT His spokeswoman, Connie Llanos, said the mayor had negotiated labor contracts that slowed the increase in workers\u2019 salaries \u2014 a key determinant of pension costs \u2014 and in some cases scaled back future employees\u2019 pensions. \u201cWe\u2019ve held strong on our commitment to get our finances in order and secured strong and fiscally responsible labor deals with our employees that hold the line on raises and secure pension and salary reforms, saving the city billions,\u201d Llanos said in a statement. City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, L.A.\u2019s top budget official, said the city has been hamstrung by legal limits on the reach of reforms and previous public officials\u2019 financial decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s not a management problem. It\u2019s a math problem,\u201d Santana said. \u201cWe\u2019re the case study of having done all the hard things governments have done to manage our pensions. At the same time, we\u2019re still saddled with this huge obligation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a national, systemic issue, and there really isn\u2019t a simple way out.\u201d 8000000000 Sources: City budget officials, LACERS and LAFPP actuarial reports.

Projected Does not include Department of Water and Power. City of Los Angeles general-fund revenue \u2018A Hole They Dug\u2019 After 33 years with the Los Angeles Police Department \u2014 much of it in the Special Investigation Section, a controversial surveillance squad whose exploits inspired the 1993 Hollywood thriller \u201cExtreme Justice\u201d \u2014 John Tortorici looked forward to his retirement in 2002. His neighbor was less upbeat. \u201cHe was a self-employed computer guy,\u201d said Tortorici, a former detective whose pension was $109,232 last year, according to city records. \u201cHe said: \u2018I have nothing. I don\u2019t have a pension. I\u2019m going to have to sell this house when I retire.\u201d Eventually, Tortorici said, the man moved to Arizona. A 71-year-old native of the San Fernando Valley, Tortorici said he feels no embarrassment over his pension. \u201cWhat I\u2019m getting, I\u2019m entitled to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city said, \u2018We\u2019re going to take care of you.\u2019 I expect it to do that.\u201d Yet he doubts that L.A. can sustain such largesse for future generations. \u201cIt\u2019s a hole they dug for themselves, years ago, not knowing,\u201d Tortorici said over coffee near his home in Newbury Park. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to do the way we\u2019re doing it now.\u201d No retirement plan better illustrates the lingering consequences of past financial choices than the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions fund. Since the 1960s the fund\u2019s benefits have been amended five times, creating a kind of fossil record of the gradual enlargement of public-safety pensions. The high-water mark came in 2001 with the retirement plan known as Tier 5. Modeled on a deal state legislators approved in 1999 for California Highway Patrol officers, Tier 5 allowed public safety workers to retire at age 50 with up to 90% of their salaries, including cost-of-living increases of up to 3% a year. The fund\u2019s previous plans had capped pensions at 70% of final salary. Tier 5 was opened to existing police and fire employees as well as new hires. As a result, workers with decades of service were allowed to migrate to the new plan en masse, retroactively taking advantage of its generous provisions. American public safety workers have historically enjoyed sturdy retirement benefits in recognition of their willingness to risk life and limb. Even against that backdrop, however, L.A. is an outlier. For the last 15 years, the police and fire fund\u2019s average pension payments have been among the highest of any state or municipal plan in the country, according to an annual survey by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, the Center for State and Local Government Excellence and the National Assn. of State Retirement Administrators.

Graphics reporting by Peter Jamison Lorena Elebee / @latimesgraphics Pension and retiree healthcare payments (including pension obligation bonds) as a percentage of general-fund revenue in California\u2019s largest cities (2014-15): 0 San Diego figures are budgeted rather than actual. Long Beach San Francisco In 2014 \u2014 the survey\u2019s most recent year of complete data \u2014 the fund\u2019s average pension of $62,964 exceeded those for New York City firefighters ($60,136), New York City police officers ($44,133) and Chicago police officers ($49,535), among others. Members of the Los Angeles City Employees Retirement System, which covers most workers outside the police and fire departments, received an average pension of $40,871. (A third L.A. pension fund, for employees of the Department of Water and Power, is funded by water and electricity sales, not tax dollars.) Corina Lee, who sits on the board of the union representing LAPD officers, said the 2001 benefit expansion was needed to stop the departure of officers for agencies, such as the California Highway Patrol, with more attractive pension plans. \u201cWe had to do something to retain our men and women, and to recruit men and women from across the country,\u201d Lee said. Public employee unions and their allies on the political left have come under frequent criticism for their role in governments\u2019 pension problems. But the circumstances of Tier 5\u2019s creation belie a simple narrative of Democrats abetting Big Labor avarice. The campaign for the 2001 ballot measure that established the new pension plan was led by then-Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican and former venture capitalist. In a recent interview, Riordan, now 86, said he based his support on the city pension funds\u2019 reports of a combined $2.2-billion surplus. He said it was a mistake. \u201cBack then, our pension funds were tremendous. We didn\u2019t owe anything. Putting this in seemed like an easy thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWith hindsight, we shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Others also failed to question the assumptions behind Tier 5. City budget analysts projected, incorrectly, that administrative changes to the pension fund written into the initiative would not only offset the cost of richer pensions, but actually save money. The ballot measure passed with 72% of the vote. Three years after police officers and firefighters began enrolling in Tier 5, the city pension funds\u2019 surplus had turned into a $4.3-billion deficit. Within a decade, that deficit had grown to $9.5 billion, as retirement costs continued to climb while the pension funds\u2019 investments lost money. Marianna Black, a retired librarian, collects a $58,935 pension and lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Mid-Wilshire. (Christina House / For The Times) Limits of Reform L.A.\u2019s deficits were part of a nationwide decline in the health of pension plans whose investment holdings were pummeled by the dot-com and housing busts. Some public officials took dramatic action. Rhode Island suspended cost-of-living increases to retirees\u2019 pensions and shifted investment risk to employees through 401(k)-style retirement plans. Marianna Black worried that such sweeping changes might be coming to L.A. Black, 74, retired in 2002 after working as a city librarian for 35 years. She collects a $58,935 pension and lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Mid-Wilshire. \u201cIf they took away my pension I\u2019d be out on the street,\u201d Black said. \u201cI need it for rent, for groceries, for everything.\u201d In California \u2014 at least for now \u2014 she has no cause for concern. Under the so-called California Rule, which originated in a 1955 state Supreme Court ruling striking down efforts to raise city employees\u2019 retirement contributions in Long Beach, governments cannot make changes to a pension plan that diminish its value for active or retired workers. Judges have forbidden even changes that leave untouched the benefits workers have already accrued, ruling that public employees are entitled for their working lives to whatever pension terms were in place on their first day on the job. By contrast, private-sector pension systems may modify their plans moving forward so long as they preserve accrued benefits. For retired government employees \u2014 who in the city of L.A. do not receive Social Security benefits \u2014 that legal precedent is a vital safeguard in an ever-more-expensive state. (Among other things, the California Rule prevents Rhode Island-style suspensions of cost-of-living increases.) Yet it presents a challenge to cities seeking to reduce their pension burdens, limiting cuts to the pension plans of workers hired after changes are adopted. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take about 30 years for that to matter,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Aubry, associate director for state and local research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cThat\u2019s a trickle.\u201d In 2011, Los Angeles modified its pension plans for newly hired police and firefighters, striking a deal with unions that reduced the minimum pension available after 20 years of service and sought to eliminate \u201cpension spiking,\u201d in which employees contrive to earn unusually large salaries during their final year of work to secure a higher pension. But because those already on the job could keep the plans they had, the changes\u2019 impact so far has been slight. Nineteen out of every 20 active and retired employees covered by the police and fire pension system are unaffected by the reforms, according to the system\u2019s most recent valuation report. After several years of negotiation, city officials and labor leaders agreed late last year to a new retirement plan for civilian workers that cut maximum pensions and increased workers\u2019 contribution rates to 7% of their paychecks from 6%, among other changes. City budget officials say it is too early to measure the effects of those changes. The city has achieved greater savings through a deal struck with its workers to contribute part of their pay toward their future healthcare costs. Until 2011, those costs were picked up entirely by taxpayers. Civilian workers agreed to contribute 4% of their paychecks toward retiree healthcare, while police officers and firefighters could either pay 2% or have their retiree health subsidies frozen at the rate offered in 2010. The contributions have saved $380.4 million since they went into effect, city budget officials say, or an average of $76.1 million a year. (The changes were legal because courts have not interpreted the California Rule as protecting active public employees\u2019 retiree health benefits.) ADVERTISEMENT Politicians elsewhere have been less wary of bucking the California Rule, but their example is not encouraging. San Jose city officials in 2012 gave its workers a choice between accepting less generous pension benefits or pitching in more of their own pay. \u201cWe started with the math,\u201d said former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have an impact quickly, you have to do something about current employees.\u201d San Jose\u2019s pension reforms were approved by 69% of voters in a June 2012 ballot measure. Within 18 months, however, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge struck down key provisions of the measure as a violation of workers\u2019 vested pension rights. The San Jose City Council ultimately renegotiated the package of changes so that it did not affect current employees\u2019 pension plans. Critics of the California Rule glimpsed an opening for change in August, when a state appellate court ruled that active public employees\u2019 pensions could be trimmed as long as the cuts were \u201creasonable.\u201d The ruling is on appeal to the state Supreme Court. \u2018Fix the numbers\u2019 Public pension funds, like their private-sector counterparts, live and die by the success of their investment portfolios. In many years, the return on those investments \u2014 typically a mix of securities dominated by stocks\u2014 provides half or more of a retirement system\u2019s revenue. The rest comes in the form of annual contributions from employees and taxpayers. In many cities and states, including L.A., workers\u2019 contributions are a fixed percentage of their paychecks. That means taxpayers are called on to fill the gap when investment income falls short. That call has come more and more frequently amid the economic tumult of the last 15 years.

L.A. is in that danger zone. 60 ",

Think of his Huffington Post/RYOT outfit\u00a0as the Vice of virtual reality. A scrappy group of globe-trotting video journalists out for social change, HuffPost/RYOT has been tapped by Google to serve as the VR \u201cbreaking news\u201d unit for its\u00a0new Daydream platform and headset. \u201cVR is a world we\u2019re excited about, because you\u2019re no longer telling people a story,\u201d says Mooser, 37, the co-founder of RYOT and the video frontman for RYOT's new VR programming. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re having them experience it.\u201d Daydream is Google\u2019s $79.99 higher-resolution answer to Google Cardboard, the cheap $15 viewer to watch VR via mobile phones. The segments are viewed via a YouTube VR app through the newly released\u00a0Daydream headset. Last week, RYOT was in Haiti\u00a0and most recently was in North Dakota, covering protests to a proposed pipeline. Additionally, RYOT just debuted two VR shows via the Hulu VR app with Daydream. There's a comedy series, Virtually Mike and Nora,\u00a0and The Big Picture,\u00a0a globe-trotting VR news show hosted by Mooser. The shows get 30-day exclusives to Daydream, then will be available for viewing, again via the Hulu app, on more VR outlets \u2014 Facebook's Oculus, Samsung Gear and Sony PlayStation VR. (For the 99.99% of you who don't have Daydream, you can see RYOT's 360 work on its ryot.huffingtonpost.com website, the RYOT and HuffPost Facebook page and on YouTube.) The news show is shot in the field\u00a0but edited here in a small storefront near\u00a0a liquor store and vintage collectible shop. VR has become a hot commodity for media companies looking to the next big thing to lure in audiences and advertisers. USA TODAY produces the weekly VRtually There \u00a0VR show, which focuses on getting viewers \"first-person perspectives\" in action-oriented settings, and\u00a0The New York Times produces a daily 360 news segment on its website. The RYOT team was\u00a0an early mover\u00a0in VR, notes Jamie Byrne, the director of partnerships for YouTube, which made the firm a natural candidate to work with. \u201cWe wanted to try something people wouldn\u2019t expect in VR, which is breaking news,\" he says. RYOT co-founder Bryn Mooser at RYOT studios in Los Angeles \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) Though Google has signed up many partners to produce VR programming to be seen via Daydream \u2014 including CNN, BuzzFeed, Tastemade and The New York Times \u2014 few folks will get to experience it. The headset \u00a0works with only one phone, Google\u2019s new Pixel, which was released in October. Many more will watch VR on YouTube or Facebook, which both show 360 clips that can be viewed by moving the mouse or your finger to see all the angles. Mobile and desktop VR\u00a0\u201cis a great place to start ... a baby step,\u201d Mooser says,\u00a0but a good headset takes you \u201cinside the story. It\u2019s different from watching news on TV. You\u2019re not watching, you\u2019re experiencing it.\u201d RYOT's virtual reality production studio sits next to a liquor store in Los Angeles. \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) Hulu, best known for presenting network TV shows on demand on set-top boxes such as the Roku and Apple TV, is dipping its toes into VR because \u201cwe want to embrace innovation and change,\u201d says Noah Heller, Hulu\u2019s \u00a0vice president of partnerships. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, but these are learnable times.\u201d Beyond RYOT, Hulu has 40-50 pieces of VR content available for viewing, for free, on the five main VR platforms, including programming from National Geographic and shows from ABC, NBC and Fox, adapted for VR Viewing. Producing VR content is a time-intensive, laborious process made difficult when multiple cameras are used to show all sides to a scene \u2014 top, bottom, left and right. The views\u00a0have to be \"stitched\" together in editing, which\u00a0can take days\u00a0or weeks. The RYOT team uses\u00a0a bunch of different VR cameras to shoot the stories\u00a0but primarily the Google Jump system, which is 16 GoPro cameras tied together on a rig, using Google software to automatically stitch\u00a0the 16 angles together into one. Using the Jump camera and software, RYOT can get the breaking news pieces produced within 48 hours. (The camera and software are not available to the general public.) RYOT was acquired by Verizon\u2019s Huffington Post this year for what CNBC said was $10 million-$15 million. Mooser wouldn't comment on the pricing, except to say the prices quoted were lower\u00a0than what was paid. Joining Huffington gave RYOT a \u201cbigger platform\u201d to speak to, Mooser says. \u201cThe reach of the Post is extraordinary,\u201d he says.

Flynn as his national security adviser, a position that, unlike the other two, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate. \u201cThe president-elect is a man of action, and we\u2019ve got a great number of men and women with great qualifications who look forward to serving in this administration,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters in New York. \u201cOur agency teams arrived in Washington D.C. this morning, and I am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward.\u201d [ Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fan. Here\u2019s how their relationship began. ] The announcements were greeted with widespread applause from Republicans, but Democrats and civil rights groups denounced Sessions and Flynn for their hard-line views on Muslims and immigrants that have put them in close alignment with Trump. The criticism could portend a messy Senate confirmation process for Sessions, though several of his GOP colleagues, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), lavished praise on him. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet And Senate Democrats will not be able to filibuster Trump\u2019s nominations to executive branch positions, having eliminated that option in 2013 for all nominations except Supreme Court justices. Flynn has spoken out frequently against radical Islam and clashed with the Obama administration while serving as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, from where he was ousted in 2014. Sessions supported Trump\u2019s call last year for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and has called for deporting millions of people who are in the country illegally. In a statement, Trump called Sessions one of his most trusted campaign advisers and cited his \u201cworld-class legal mind.\u201d \u201cJeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him,\u201d Trump said. Trump said he was pleased to have Flynn at his side \u201cas we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.\u201d Late Friday, Robert L. Woodson Sr., who heads the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington and advises House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on poverty issues, said he is under consideration to be secretary of housing and urban development in Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Woodson is scheduled to meet with Trump in Bedminster, N.J. on Saturday. If selected, Woodson, who is black, would add diversity to Trump\u2019s team. Also Friday, Trump spoke by phone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, and the two men \u201cunderlined NATO\u2019s enduring importance,\u201d according to a statement from a NATO spokeswoman. During the campaign, Trump had said he might reconsider the United States\u2019s commitment to the alliance. Stoltenberg invited Trump to Brussels for the NATO Summit next year. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be CIA director, close allies say. Here's what we know about him. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) GOP officials working with the Trump transition operation said that the president-elect plans to meet Friday with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), amid reports he is being considered to be U.S. ambassador to Israel. Also spotted at Trump Tower on Friday was Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), reportedly a candidate for defense secretary. Among those Trump will meet with on Saturday are former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who has been cited as a possible candidate for secretary of state, former D.C. public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts and retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, whose name also has been mentioned as a potential defense secretary nominee. Meantime, the Trump transition named agency landing teams for the departments of Defense, State and Justice, along with the National Security Council, to help smooth the transfer of power in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration Jan. 20. Sessions, 69, was Trump\u2019s first endorser in the Senate and quickly became the then-candidate\u2019s chief resource on policy, but the fourth-term senator has been dogged by accusations of racism throughout his career. In 1986, he was denied a federal judgeship after former colleagues testified before a Senate committee that he joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were \u201cokay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.\u201d \u201cIf you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,\u201d Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said in a statement. \u201cNo senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions.\u201d The NAACP wrote in a Twitter message that Sessions\u2019s nomination is \u201cdeeply troubling, and supports and old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values.\u201d Sean Spicer, a Republican National Committee spokesman who has been assisting the Trump transition operation, said on a conference call with reporters that the nominees\u2019 personal view \u201cisn\u2019t what matters. You are serving the president-elect of the United States and his views . . . Everybody who serves in a Trump administration will serve Donald Trump and Mike Pence. They will implement their vision and their ideas.\u201d South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), appearing at a Federalist Society convention in Washington, did not mention Trump\u2019s nominees in her remarks. But Haley, whose parents immigrated from India, urged the Republican Party to remind the public that it is the party who will offer opportunities \u201cto all citizens, regardless of their race, gender or where they are born and raised.\u201d Sessions served as a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as Alabama\u2019s attorney general. In a statement, he said there was \u201cno greater honor\u201d than to lead the Justice Department. \u201cI enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump\u2019s vision for \u2018one America,\u2019 and his commitment to equal justice under law,\u201d Sessions said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), a key Judiciary Committee member who had been wary of Trump during the campaign, intends to support Sessions\u2019s nomination, his office said. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), also at the Federalist Society convention in Washington, said that Sessions would make an \u201cextraordinary\u201d attorney general. \u201cHe is a committed and deeply principled conservative,\u201d Cruz said. Several Senate Democrats pledged a rigorous confirmation review. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who will become Minority Leader in January, said Sessions\u2019s rhetoric and opposition to a comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 make him \u201cvery concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division.\u201d But some conservatives suggested it would be politically damaging to Democrats if they attempt to block Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cMr. Trump has a plane and double-digit victories where Senate Democrats are up for reelection,\u201d said Leonard A. Leo, executive vice president of The Federalist Society. \u201cObstructing his nominees will be a political loser.\u201d Pompeo, 52, was elected to the House in 2010 as part of the first wave of so-called tea party lawmakers. A U.S. Military Academy and Harvard Law School graduate, he has a varied background. He served as a U.S. Army cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company, serving as president of an oil-field equipment manufacturing firm and \u2014 in a brief, little-known chapter of his early career \u2014 was an attorney with the Washington, D.C. mega-law firm Williams and Connolly. He currently serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and is a close ally of Pence. \u201cHe has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens,\u201d Trump said of Pompeo in a statement. Notably, Pompeo backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Trump in the Republican presidential primary. In May, a Pompeo spokesman gave a somewhat tepid endorsement, saying the congressman would \u201csupport the nominee of the Republican Party because Hillary Clinton cannot be president of the United States.\u201d Pompeo is a vocal critic of President Obama\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran. \u201cI look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d he tweeted Thursday, before his offer to become CIA director was public. The choices of Sessions and Pompeo follow Trump\u2019s decision to offer the position of national security adviser to Flynn, and confirm the president-elect\u2019s desire to assemble his Cabinet by naming national security and law enforcement leaders first. [ Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] At the same time, Trump is soliciting the help of Romney, a mainstream consensus figure who had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s candidacy, in assembling his government. Trump sought a meeting with Romney, who had fiercely criticized him during the campaign, to broker peace \u2014 and Sessions, a vice chairman of Trump\u2019s transition, told reporters that Trump could consider the 2012 GOP presidential nominee for an administration position, perhaps secretary of state. The presence of Flynn and Romney in Trump\u2019s orbit sends mixed signals to already jittery leaders around the globe, as well as officials in Washington\u2019s foreign policy community, about the tone and substance of the Trump administration\u2019s posture to the world. Flynn, who would hold the most powerful national security position, is a retired three-star general and decorated intelligence officer who established a close relationship with Trump while campaigning at his side this year. His behavior and a string of controversial and dark statements about Islam, among other topics, have alarmed many of his former colleagues. Trump\u2019s selection of Flynn comes after the president-elect enraged Democrats and civil rights groups by appointing Stephen K. Bannon, former chairman of Breitbart News, an alt-right news site that has become a forum for the white nationalist movement, as his chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House.

    "text": "The U.S. Capitol in Washington is pictured on Oct. 31, 2016. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump this morning announced his picks for three of the most prestigious jobs in the executive branch -- Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Rep. Mike Pompeo as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security advisor. Two of those jobs require a check from the legislative branch -- a Senate confirmation vote. Here's how the process works: WHO NEEDS SENATE CONFIRMATION? All cabinet-level officials , except the White House chief of staff, require Senate confirmation, including: the secretaries of agriculture, commerce, defense, education, energy, health and human services, homeland security , housing and urban development, interior, labor, state, transportation, treasury, and veterans affairs, as well as the attorney general, director of the Office of Management and Budget , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Trade Representative, ambassador to the United Nations , the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and the administrator of the Small Business Administration. Hundreds of other senior posts and agency heads (1,212 to be exact) require Senate confirmation too after background checks. Essentially, heads of agencies and a lot of deputies need to be confirmed, whereas adviser positions for the president do not. For example: CIA director: yes; national security advisor: no. The level of Senate confirmations has created a backlog within committees on Capitol Hill and left agencies understaffed. The Washington Post reported in 2013 that when Janet Napolitano resigning as Secretary of Homeland Security, there were 15 vacant leadership positions in that department. WHEN DOES THE PRESIDENT SEND APPOINTMENTS TO THE HILL? Before a nomination can formally move to the Hill, the candidate must submit several forms and undergo a fair amount of vetting by the White House and FBI. What is gathered in this process (by looking at, for example, financial disclosure reports, criminal checks and questionnaires about ties to foreign governments) could be used by the president or president\u2013elect to withdraw a nomination or present it to the Senate as evidence in hearings. In 2004, Congress passed legislation to \"encourage a President-elect to submit, for security clearance, potential nominees to high-level national security positions as soon as possible after the election,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. The goal was to \"reduce the elapsed time between a new President\u2019s inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team.\" WHAT DOES THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS LOOK LIKE? 1) A nomination is given to the relevant Senate committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee, for example, will handle the attorney general nomination. 2) That committee can then hold hearings, vote to move the nomination straight to the Senate floor for a vote, or not move on it at all (in which case the committee effectually kills the nomination.) 3) After hearings, the committee then votes to report a nomination to the full Senate via simple majority. It can vote too to report the nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. If a committee sits on an appointment, the full Senate can vote to invoke cloture and move the nomination along. 4) If a nomination clears committee, it moves to the Senate floor for a simple majority vote. Filibusters are not an issue here, because Democrats changed Senate rules three years ago to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most nominations. Supreme Court picks are still subject to filibuster. WILL TRUMP HAVE THE VOTES? The GOP barely kept its majority in the Senate after this election, but rejections of major appointments are rare. Republicans have 51 seat right now, but will likely have 52 by January (Louisiana\u2019s race is in a run off, but ABC News' race rating is solid Republican). But that number includes Sen. Sessions, who was just announced as Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general. That fact alone raises some questions. Will Sessions vote for himself? When Secretary of State John Kerry was in the Senate and confirmed, he voted \u201cpresent.\u201d Could some Republicans deflect? Yup. Could there be a tie? Maybe. Would Republicans need to use soon to be Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s vote as a tie-breaker? Possibly. WHEN DO HEARINGS START? Hearings can and will likely start pretty soon after the 115th Congress is sworn in Jan. 3, 2017. The hearing and legislative schedule has not been set yet. A nominee cannot be confirmed, however, until after the president-elect is sworn in on Jan. 20. FUN FACT The first time the Senate rejected a nomination was on Aug. 5, 1789 -- Benjamin Fishbourn to be the naval officer for the Port of Savannah. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "\u00a0 RAWANDIZ, Iraq \u2013 \u00a0It would be idyllic if it wasn't so dangerous. Fog swirls over the snow-dusted mountain range as the sunlight fades and the late fall cold settles on this rugged portion of a war-torn country reached only by a single, curling road. With the sprawling Iranian countryside as a distant backdrop, a dozen men trek up the steep mountain path, hunched under the weight of rucksacks laden food, electronics and the most coveted Iranian-bound cargo of all: alcohol. \"Other things are okay to smuggle during the day,\" one local operative said. \"But alcohol? Only in the dead of the night.\" Related Image Expand / Contract Hundreds of men, on foot and on horseback, haul the contraband booze into Iran, risking their lives in the process. (FoxNews.com) One smuggler estimates that 15 men die each month at this very peak, felled by gunfire from an Iranian border patrol tower that looms above, landmines left over from the bloody 1980s war between Iran and Iraq or the harsh elements. The men are traversing one of more than 20 bootleg routes that straddle the border, and they make their deadly jaunt at night. On foot or horseback, hundreds of men meet Kurdish suppliers on the road below, picking up liquor that arrives in the beds of pickup trucks, just before the Iranian border stations and in full view of an enormous checkpoint portrait of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Smugglers, mostly poor farmers from both sides of the border, typically make around $60 per trip, which takes about six hours from pick-up to drop-off. Their suppliers make far more for their role in defying Tehran\u2019s hard line on booze. The demand for alcohol inside Iran has risen steadily since it was outlawed following the 1979 Revolution. Consumption is deemed a \"crime against God,\" and is punishable with lashes or even execution for multiple offenses. Most of the alcohol smuggled in is purchased in bulk from Armenia. Absolut vodka, Johnnie Walker scotch and counterfeit Grey Goose are among the popular labels. By the time it makes it through Kurdish territory and into the Islamic Republic, the price has tripled. Related Image Expand / Contract Trucks like this one bring the alcohol to the men who complete the trip on foot. (FoxNews.com) The nuclear inspection deal that lifted sanctions on Iran and pumped billions of dollars into its economy had no effect on the price of illicit liquor, one smuggler told FoxNews.com. \"The rate remains steady,\" he said. \"After all, we all know it is not the people of Iran that are getting that money to spend.\" Smugglers are not the only source of alcohol for Iranians. Illicit breweries and makeshift stills bubble inside Iranian homes, feeding an addiction second only to opiates. In recent years, Iranian authorities have begrudgingly acknowledged the growing problem, and in 2013 opened Iran's first and only detox center in Tehran. Soon, the alcohol destined for Iran may have to be smuggled in to Iraq, as well. Late last month, Iraq\u2019s Parliament approved a bill to ban alcohol. It's not yet clear when the ban might take effect, or if it will even survive a Supreme Court challenge, but many critics see it as an ominous reflection of Iran\u2019s influence on its neighbor. They predict a ban will lead to the same black market that now quenches Iran\u2019s thirst for alcohol. \"For decades, Iran has wanted to control Iraq and this is their opportunity to bring more conservative Islamic values into Iraq and shape it into its own second Shiite Iran,\" said Juliana Tamoorazi, the founder of U.S.-based Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an Assyrian who fled Iran as a refugee after the revolution. \"A bi-product of this legislation is the further marginalization of persecuted minorities, it appears laws like this want to push minorities out of the country.\" Khalid Rumi, a member of Iraqi Parliament and a leader of the nation\u2019s embattled\u00a0Mandaen religious community, said decrees such as the alcohol prohibition \"choke minorities and force them to leave,\" but are an even more sinister threat. \"This isn't just about suppressing minorities, it is about targeting personal freedoms for everybody,\u201d Rumi said. \u201cThe danger isn't only banning alcohol, there is a bigger goal to target more personal freedoms.\u201d Many Iraqis who spoke to FoxNews.com said they won\u2019t part willingly with alcohol or any of the personal freedoms they now enjoy. If a ban is passed, the smuggling route will begin at Iraq\u2019s own border and lead into the war-torn nation. \"To pass this law is one of the most stupid decisions ever made,\" said 29-year-old Baghdad-based financial expert and author Rusly Almaleky.

Jeff Sessions. Rep. Mike Pompeo. Rudolph W. Giuliani. Of the 66 names we\u2019ve heard have been floated or confirmed for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, 85 percent so far belong to men. They\u2019re vastly white. Many sprang from the private sector. Many represent hard-right Washington. (Check out the full list here .) This assembly, of course, is highly tentative. Trump is expected to\u00a0pick 22 future leaders of the government by Inauguration Day, and we\u2019re still two months away. It\u2019s too early to say whether the next administration will be more gender-mixed or a total boy\u2019s club. By Friday, Trump\u2019s candidate roster featured 10 women. They include South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arizona governor\u00a0Jan Brewer and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. They\u2019re all white, except for Haley, whose parents are Indian, and Sacramento first lady Michelle Rhee, the daughter of South Korean immigrants. Trump the real estate executive has said that he filled top roles with women. Trump the presidential candidate announced an economic advisory team\u00a0 of 13 white men . The Trump campaign did not respond to The Washington Post's requests for comment.\u00a0 Critics say the look of Trump's roster doesn't\u00a0reflect the American people. \u201cThat\u2019s not just politically incorrect \u2014 it will lead to poorer decision making,\u201d wrote Valerie M. Hudson and Christina Asquith this week for Newsweek. \u201cAnd given that Trump has said he plans to expand the U.S. military and take a harder-line approach towards adversaries such as ISIS, it\u2019s also potentially dangerous.\u201d Not that President Obama\u2019s Cabinet perfectly matched the population that voted him into the White House: Thirty-two percent of his administration is female. George W. Bush\u2019s team during his second term as president, meanwhile, was 18 percent female. Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00a0built a cabinet with an equal number of men and women. When asked why, he said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d \u201cBy advancing these types of policies, we allow the people best suited to lead to rise up without being hampered by biases,\u201d economist Florence Kondylis said \u00a0of Trudeau's decision. Hillary Clinton had pledged to do the same. She told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow in May, \u201cI am going to have a Cabinet that looks like America, and 50 percent of America is women, right?\u201d Research from Carnegie Mellon and MIT suggests that mixed-gender groups more skillfully solve problems than all-male groups, largely because diversity protects against perilous blind spots and women generally score higher on social intelligence tests. Psychologists Anita Woolley, Thomas Malone and Christopher Chabris knew individuals varied in their cognitive ability. They wanted to understand whether some groups, like some humans, were smarter than others. They found in a 2011 study that groups with more women tended to perform better than groups with mostly men. \u201cIn theory, yes, the 10 smartest people could make the smartest group, but it wouldn\u2019t be just because they were the most intelligent individuals,\u201d Wooley told the Harvard Business Review . \u201cWhat do you hear about great groups? Not that the members are all really smart but that they listen to each other. They share criticism constructively. They have open minds. They\u2019re not autocratic.\u201d In other words, she said, they possess traits women, more often than men, are socially conditioned to develop. Another study from Duke University found that male leaders are judged more harshly when they ask for help, so they may be more likely to act on an impulsive decision, rather than seek out counsel from people better versed in a subject. In a relaxed environment, researchers haven\u2019t unearthed major differences in male and female decision-making. But Stephanie Preston, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, saw in her 2007 research that women, again and again, made more safe, advantageous decisions under pressure, while men, when faced with stress, were more likely to gamble and lose.

    "text": "Trump University-related lawsuits settled for $25 million Published               November 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday agreed to settle three fraud lawsuits linked to Trump University for $25 million, FoxNews.com confirmed. The settlement ends a dispute that has followed Trump throughout his presidential campaign and raised questions about how he would handle it after being sworn in as president in January. Students at the now-defunct school claimed they were duped into paying thousands of dollars to learn the secret of Trump\u2019s real estate success. Trump's legal team negotiated the settlement with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the law firm that brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of students who attended the for-profit school. \u201cIn 2013, my office sued Donald Trump for swindling thousands of innocent Americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at Trump University,\u201d Schneiderman said in a written statement. \u201cDonald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes.\u201d Schneiderman said the $25 million to be paid by Trump or one of his business entities includes restitution for students and $1 million in penalties to the state.

See Predictions Map \u2192 The settlement comes just days before the class action lawsuit in California was to begin. The deal doesn't require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. Trump has strongly denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he wouldn't settle. A federal judge in California had been set Friday to consider arguments on Trump's latest request to delay a trial until after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump's attorneys said in a court filing last week that preparations for the White House were \"critical and all-consuming.\" Six months ago, when they unsuccessfully sought a delay until after Inauguration Day, lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli said the period between the election and swearing-in is extremely hectic for a president-elect but that it was preferable to a trial during the campaign. \"The task is momentous, exceedingly complex, and requires careful coordination involving the respective staffs and teams of both President (Barack) Obama and President-Elect Trump,\" Trump's attorneys wrote. \"In fewer than three months, the President-Elect must be prepared to manage 15 executive departments, more than 100 federal agencies, 2 million civilian employees, and a budget of almost $4 trillion.\" Trump's attorneys also raised the prospect of having the president-elect testify by video recording before the trial begins in the class-action lawsuit on Nov. 28. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",
