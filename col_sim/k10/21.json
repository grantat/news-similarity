Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay said baby Sophia was found alive after authorities executed a search warrant before dawn at a Dallas home, The Wichita Eagle reported ( http://j.mp/2g8ozZK ). He said the baby is in protective custody and is doing well. \"This is the best possible outcome to a very sad case,\" Ramsay said at a news conference. Two adults were in custody and being interviewed Saturday, Ramsay said. He also said more suspects could be identified, but provided few details, saying \"it is still an active investigation.\" No one has been charged. \"It's a complicated case and we want to make sure we get it right,\" Ramsay said. Police said investigators established late Friday that someone who knew the mother had fled to Dallas with the baby. The baby was reported missing, the same day her mother, 27-year-old Laura Abarca-Nogueda, was shot to death in her west Wichita apartment. The FBI had joined the search for the baby, and investigators worked around the clock since Sophia went missing, he said. \"Hard work and the collaboration with the FBI is really what made this (closure) come about,\" he said. Sophia will be reunited with relatives \"as soon as possible,\" he said. Dallas police \"dropped everything\" to assist in the case once investigators learned Sophia was there, Ramsay said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: The Wichita (Kan.)

A crash in Echo Park killed two women and injured two others. (Patrick T. Fallon / For The Times) Anna M. Phillips and Matt Stevens Contact Reporters Two people\u00a0were killed and two others critically injured when a car\u00a0crashed at an intersection in Echo Park on\u00a0Sunday morning, authorities said. The crash occurred shortly after 9 a.m. at Sunset Boulevard and Rosemont Avenue, said Erik Scott, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department . The car sheared a fire hydrant and crashed into a light post, he said.\u00a0 Fire officials initially said the vehicle struck two women, killing them instantly. Los Angeles police later said the crash involved a \u201cvehicle versus three pedestrians,\u201d two of whom were declared dead at the scene and one of whom was taken\u00a0to a hospital in critical condition. \u00a0 \u00a0 The male driver of the car  had to be extracted from the vehicle,   authorities said.  He\u00a0was also taken\u00a0to a hospital and was listed in critical condition. LAPD Officer Irma Mota said it was not immediately clear whether speed or alcohol was involved in the crash. She said no arrests have been made, adding that officers are on the scene and the investigation is ongoing.\u00a0 Later in the morning, the damaged sedan remained on the sidewalk. The car appeared to have sheared off the bottom of a light post. Both car doors remained open. About a dozen police officers combed the crash scene, which was covered with debris from the car and street light.\u00a0At least two blocks were closed to traffic. Nearby residents said they didn\u2019t see or hear the crash. Johnny Wendell, 60, said the area where the crash occurred is \u201can incredibly dangerous intersection,\u201d noting that there are serious vehicle accidents there every few months. Rosemont intersects Sunset just a few hundred yards from where Sunset abruptly jogs left in front of a fire station. \"This bend is notorious,\" Wendell said. \"Usually what happens is cars come from the west, heading east, and tear up this street.\" Wendell said the crash occurred near one of the few crosswalks\u00a0in the area. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump's pick for chief of staff, Reince Priebus, has vowed that White House counsel will ensure Trump avoids all conflicts of interest with his business ventures during his administration. Last week, Trump held a meeting at Trump Tower with three Indian business partners building a Trump property south of Mumbai. His daughter Ivanka Trump, a vice president at the Trump Organization and one of the family members who will be in charge of Donald Trump's businesses after he takes office, attended his meeting last week with the Japanese prime minister. About 100 foreign diplomats met at the Trump International Hotel in Washington last week, and some of them viewed spending money at the president-elect's\u00a0hotel as an easy, friendly gesture, The Washington Post reported. [ For foreign diplomats, Trump hotel is place to be ] Jake Tapper, host of CNN's \u201cState of the Union,\u201d cited\u00a0these examples in an interview with Priebus on Sunday and asked: \u201cAs White House chief of staff, you're supposed to look out for any political or ethical minefields. Is it seriously the position of the Trump transition team that this is not a huge cauldron of potential conflicts of interest?\u201d \u201cObviously we will comply with all of those laws and we will have our White House\u00a0counsel review all of these things,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWe will have every 'i' dotted and every 't' crossed, and I can assure the American people that there wouldn\u2019t be any wrongdoing or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making.\u201d [ Why Donald Trump\u2019s family being in the White House is problematic, explained ] According to the Congressional Research Service , there is \u201cno current legal requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.\u201d Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Priebus called it a \u201ctruly unique situation\u201d to have a president-elect with such international business interests. Trump \u201cis now going to work toward focusing 24-7 on being president of the United States,\u201d he said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The Trump White House will set up a legal system to avoid conflicts of interest, Priebus said. \u201cAll these rules are going to be followed,\u201d he told\u00a0host Chuck Todd. \u201cThere's going to be no violation of any of these rules, I can assure you of that . . . As we move forward, those matters are going to be clearly spelled out, and you're going to be aware of it.\u201d On CNN, Priebus addressed whether Trump would cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities on his first day, as he had promised. [ Fact Checker:\u00a0What exactly are \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 in immigration policy? ] Priebus said that the administration\u00a0will explore the issue and \u201cresolve some of these major problems happening all across the country\u201d but that federal funding is a \u201cmatter of negotiation.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something for the new administration to decide and something that we\u2019re going to all be working on and looking into,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a general matter, I totally agree . . .\u00a0the idea that a city would decide to ignore federal law, and then want the federal government to help them anyway, is an inconsistent position for those local governments to continue to engage in. And so I think this is a matter of negotiation.\u201d politics ",

USA TODAY Herb and Loralea Grey of Beaverton, Oreg. pose in the living room of their home with children Joel, 22, and Grace, 19.   They are worried about what happens to their plans.  Health insurance since the ACA has cost the Greys most of their income. Loralea Grey says \"hopefully everyone will ban together for good, so the nonsense going on with protests will stop,  and possibly healthcare might be reworked in the end... time will tell. I didn't vote for either of them and so can't be blamed.\"  --    Photo by Craig Mitchelldyer, Freelance ORG XMIT:  CM 135757 Obamacarefuture 11/13/2016 [Via MerlinFTP Drop] (Photo: Craig Mitchelldyer for USA TODAY) The post-election confusion over the fate of Obamacare has only complicated the already difficult choices faced by middle class consumers who are worried they\u00a0can't afford their health insurance options\u00a0this fall. Premiums and deductibles soared\u00a0in many parts of the country after the departure of several large insurers from the Affordable Care Act exchanges for 2017. That's led many to fret about how to either afford insurance or how to get by without it. Loralea Grey, whose husband is self employed,\u00a0says they are\u00a0living a \"middle-class nightmare\" because of the law. They grew used to the necessary sacrifices to afford the premiums and out-of-pocket costs for their \"catastrophic\" insurance before the ACA, she says. This year they were facing a\u00a0premium increase of nearly 40% with a $7,000 deductible per family member. They've decided they can't scrimp anymore to afford plans through the ACA exchange. \"How is this possible or allowable?,\" she asks. \"When I contacted the Oregon insurance commissioner, I received a response back telling me I should feel free to shop around; as if I wasn\u2019t smart enough to have already done that?\" Trump election helps spur top Obamacare signups this month ACA-funded \"navigators\" and the call center for the federal Healthcare.gov\u00a0deal with thousands of people a day with challenges finding coverage, and the most\u00a0find solutions, says Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \"For the majority of people, coverage is affordable and coverage is something that changes their lives in many ways,\" says Slavitt. \"I won't say there isn't an overall problem with health care affordability in this country\" \u2014\u00a0but drug and hospital prices are part of the problem too, he says. Some of those worried about affordability questioned whether they needed to sign up for insurance after Donald Trump's election as president. \"People would call and say, 'We have a new president. He\u2019s going to repeal it, so I don\u2019t have to buy insurance,\" says Ronnell Nolan, CEO of Health Agents for America, who also sells insurance. \"While we hope for change and at least address the affordability, I tell them we have to act as if everything\u2019s status quo.\" Regulators approve higher health premiums to strengthen Obamacare insurers In North Carolina, the cheapest option with a \"decent network\" of doctors and hospitals for Jim Harrison's\u00a061-year-old wife would cost $1,421 a month with a $7,150 deductible. (He is on Medicare.) Because he is retired and that isn't affordable, the family got a hardship exemption from the mandate to have insurance. \"So against our better judgment, she is going to go without health insurance next year ... but we put all of our retirement assets at risk should something catastrophic happen,\" he says, \"I never thought we would be in this situation.\" Going without insurance does, indeed, put the family in financial danger. The ACA prohibits insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. Before the law took effect, it was often impossible for people with cancer to afford or even get insurance\u00a0\u00a0The law also prohibited lifetime maximums for\u00a0benefits. Kim Thiboldeaux, CEO of the patient group Cancer Support Community, warns against going without a plan that protects them from a costly disease or accident. \"Patients in past were hitting annual lifetime caps and becoming uninsured,\" says Thiboldeaux. \"This is a critical issue for cancer patients.\" Among the alternatives: \u2022\u00a0Catastrophic insurance. These plans, which typically had lower premiums and were mostly insurance against the costliest diseases or accidents, were grandfathered in the law for a couple years but are no longer an option to meet the insurance mandate. Young people under age 30 can\u00a0get catastrophic plans\u00a0on the exchanges and people older than 30 \u2014\u00a0such as Harrison's wife \u2014\u00a0can\u00a0also buy these plans if they get a hardship exemption. So can those whose ACA plans are canceled because they don't comply with the law. This option doesn't work for the Greys as the least expensive plan they could find costs $1,475 a month and has a $7,000 deductible per family member. \u2022\u00a0Christian ministry health sharing plans. Most of these programs are available to people active in a Christian church or \"fellowship\" who sign statements that they abide by a Christian lifestyle. \u00a0It is a large pool of money that similarly minded Christians pay into to reimburse certain health care costs other members face. \u00a0Money is sent to the organization and either reimbursed to the member or sometimes directly to the health care provider. Michael Gardner, spokesman for the Christian\u00a0Medi-Share, emphasizes that it \"isn't insurance in any way shape or form.\" \u00a0The Greys are considering joining their local Christian health ministry for health benefits and says it would cost about $500 a month, even though it \"obviously won't cover anything like an actual policy,\" Loralea Grey says. \u2022\u00a0Other health sharing plans. \u00a0You don't have to be Christian to enroll in an ACA-compliant health sharing plan by\u00a0Liberty Direct, which tweaked the language a bit to make far more people eligible.\u00a0Still, there is a \"morals clause,\"\u00a0so someone who caused a drunk driving crash wouldn't\u00a0have their health care paid for, although members might voluntarily chip in, says Corey Durbin, president of Shared Health Alliance . Corey Durbin, president of Shared Health Alliance. \u00a0(Photo: Shared Health Alliance) His company combines benefits that include a co-pay drug card and a $0 co-pay doctor program with any health share program for a package he says usually costs\u00a050% less than traditional health insurance. There's also a $1 million cap per incident annually with some health share programs, which Durbin says would be very hard to reach. Caring for a very premature infant could reach that cap, Durbin says. \u2022\u00a0Community health centers.\u00a0\u200bCommunity health centers that were once the only option for the uninsured seeking non-emergency care are serving millions more people than they did before the ACA, according to\u00a0 a report \u00a0by\u00a0the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. The number of uninsured people they serve has declined only slightly, due in part to people who can't afford co-payments and deductibles, said Maria-Elena Young, a co-author of the report.\u00a0Other factors are patients wanting to stay with their center physicians, immigrants and others not eligible for Medicaid or other insurance in their states. For now, the Greys are getting by with two old cars \u2014\u00a0a 2005 minivan and a 1986 Volvo \u2014\u00a0for their family of four working adults. Son Joel, 22, just got a job that allows him to buy group insurance, but that still leaves Grace, 19, and her parents. If they don't opt for a Christian health sharing plan, Loralea is considering getting Grace an unsubsidized plan and doing without insurance for herself and her husband. Joel Grey, 22, is shown driving to his new job - which has employer-provided coverage - in the family's 1986 Volvo with its taped-on side mirror. \u00a0(Photo: Loralea Grey) Loralea Grey says they can't afford to get rid of the mold in her attic and she buys her asthma inhalers in Mexico for $2 to save money.\u00a0She didn't vote for former secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u00a0or Trump \u2014\u00a0\"so I can't be blamed,\" she laughs \u2014\u00a0but hopes something is done so\u00a0middle-class families\u00a0don't have to spend nearly all of their disposable income on insurance. \"Hopefully everyone will band together for good and possibly health care might be reworked in the end,\" she said.

Jeff Sessions , will be confirmed despite opposition to his nomination from civil rights and immigrant advocacy groups. \"He\u2019s a good man. He will be confirmed and he deserves it,\" Priebus told ABC's Martha Raddatz in an interview on \"This Week\" Sunday. In 1986, Sessions was denied a federal judgeship following allegations that he had called the ACLU and the NAACP \"un-American\" and made racist remarks directed at colleagues. The NAACP released a statement calling Sessions' nomination \"deeply troubling.\" \"Based on the disdain for our nation\u2019s civil rights laws that Senator Sessions has consistently demonstrated throughout his career, his fitness to be the chief protector and enforcer of them falls into dire question,\" the statement said . Sessions denies the allegations to this day. \"This is something that happened that 30 years ago,\" Priebus said. \"This is something that I think is very political, very unfair, and I would hate to be judged -- and I think you would, and everyone out there -- to be judged over a phrasing of one single thing that I\u2019ve said.\" Priebus also addressed Trump's meetings with high-profile figures yesterday, including former GOP presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney , at his estate and golf club in Bedminister, New Jersey, telling Raddatz part of the purpose of the meeting was to help bring the country together. \"Bringing people in that were once rivals, saying, 'Let's lead together. Let's talk about the future of our country.' They did talk about opportunities for Governor Romney.\" Priebus wouldn't rule out the possibility of Romney serving in a Trump administration, telling ABC's Martha Raddatz \"anything is possible\" when asked how likely it is the former Republican presidential candidate could be nominated for secretary of state. But, he also noted there are other people still in the running for the post, including former New York City Mayor and loyal Trump ally Rudy Giuliani and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley . ",

Giuliani, 72, lacks both federal government and foreign policy experience, but the former Republican mayor and federal prosecutor has curried Mr. Trump\u2019s favor for his strong law-and-order stances.\u00a0 The possibility that Giuliani could represent the United States as its chief diplomat has even some Republicans worried, however. On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul slammed Giuliani for being \u201cunrepentant\u201d in his support for the Iraq war, saying he and another possible contender, Ambassador John Bolton, \u201chaven\u2019t learned any of the lessons\u201d from the Middle East conflict.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re very diplomatic,\u201d Paul said of Bolton and Giuliani, who will have to go through a vetting process and Senate hearing before they can be confirmed to a Cabinet post. \u201cAnd I think you want the chief diplomat to be diplomatic.\u201d Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, is also in the running to lead the State Department, according to several Trump surrogates and staff. The president-elect met with Romney Saturday in Bedminster.\u00a0 Romney, a vocal critic of the Mr. Trump during the campaign cycle, spoke briefly with reporters following their meeting. \u201cWe had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance,\u201d Romney said of Mr. Trump. \u201cWe discussed those areas and discussed our views on those topics.\u201d\u00a0 Former CIA director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, the former head of Central Command, was also seriously considered for the top diplomat slot. Mr. Trump gave the matter serious thought, according to Garrett, consulting military advisers like Jack Keane and even News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch, who the president-elect has been in touch with frequently since his election victory.\u00a0 Petraeus resigned his post at the CIA in 2012 , following an extramarital affair with his biographer. The general also pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information while heading the agency. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

John McCain, R-Ariz., laughs while speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Halifax on Saturday, Nov.19, 2016. (Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press via AP) 0 Shares Email A leading Republican voice on national security matters said Saturday he doesn't care what President-elect Donald Trump says, the United States will not reinstate waterboarding. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said at the Halifax International Security Forum that any attempt to bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court. \"I don't give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do. We will not waterboard. We will not do it,\" McCain said to applause during a panel discussion. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, said extreme interrogation techniques are banned under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. During the campaign, Trump said he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding, which was used against suspected terrorists during the George W. Bush administration. McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said waterboarding doesn't work and makes it hard for the U.S. to claim moral superiority. \"What does it say about America if we're going to inflict torture on people,\" he said. McCain also expressed support for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and said the United States should not back out of the not-yet-implemented Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a candidate, Trump said NAFTA should be renegotiated and opposed the TPP, arguing that such trade agreements cause significant job losses in the U.S. \"I think we are going to pay a terrible price for abandoning the TPP,\" McCain said. \"You are going to see Chinese assertion of economic influence in the region, and possible dominance. All of these countries are now going to join with China in trade agreements and we're going to be out in the cold. Historians will judge us very harshly.\" In its eighth year, the Halifax International Security Forum has attracted top defense and security officials from Western democracies. Trump has dominated the discussions. Rose Gottemoeller, NATO's Deputy Secretary General, said in a panel discussion that NATO?Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg?had spoken with Trump on Friday. \"The two men agreed about the enduring importance of the NATO alliance and the enduring importance of increased defense spending,\" Gottemoeller said. Trump suggested during the campaign that he might review NATO members' financial contributions before deciding whether to honor commitments under the alliance's mutual defense clause. He also raised concerns among U.S. allies with his effusive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin . 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Attrition impossible to ignore, overcome for Bears in scary loss to Giants Photos from the Bears-Giants game at MetLife Stadium on Nov. 20, 2016. David Haugh Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad Jennings by dropping his head and ramming the crown of his helmet into 336-pound Bears defensive end Akiem Hicks . Floyd bounced off and instantly fell to the turf, lying on his stomach. Everybody waited for Floyd to get up, but he didn't. He stayed still for what seemed like an eternity. As the long wait started, teammates stopped and Bears coaches and executives just stared at the sight of Floyd being immobilized on a backboard. A season devoted to development suddenly found its most important project in peril. Nothing else that happened against the Giants mattered as much. \"It was fairly difficult to (watch),\" Bears defensive end Willie Young said. Added quarterback Jay Cutler: \"When you see something like that, it's scary and puts things in perspective.'' The disappointment of another Bears defeat was compounded Sunday by another round of serious injuries to key players. Four starters left and did not return to the 22-16 loss to the Giants. Outside linebacker Leonard Floyd (neck) and Zach Miller (broken right foot) were the most severely affected. ... The disappointment of another Bears defeat was compounded Sunday by another round of serious injuries to key players. Four starters left and did not return to the 22-16 loss to the Giants. Outside linebacker Leonard Floyd (neck) and Zach Miller (broken right foot) were the most severely affected. ... (Rich Campbell) Bears coach John Fox eased concerns in the locker room by reporting that Floyd showed \"pretty good movement skills\" news that improved later when the rookie was released from a local hospital in time to fly home with the team. Teammates like Young feared the worst until Floyd pumped his fist and flashed a smile as he was being wheeled off the field. \"That's what eased my mind,'' Young said. \"I know what this game means to him.'' What this game meant to the Bears in a lost season paled in comparison. It officially goes down as loss No. 8, but context demands acknowledging the injured bodies piling up even faster than the defeats. That's not making excuses as much as mentioning attrition that Fox had been reluctant to acknowledge until recently \u2014 a rash of injuries as bad as he has experienced in coaching. \"I've been doing this a little bit, so it's hard to remember 27 years ago, but it's in the top five, that's for sure,'' Fox said. Sunday's leading ground gainer was the guy driving the medical cart. At this rate, the Bears team doctors will receive MVP votes. It's so bad the Bears should consider replacing the orange \"C\" on their helmets with a red cross. Bears right guard Kyle Long will require two surgeries before he gets back into football action. Long will undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his right ankle suffered last Sunday in the loss at Tampa. The surgery isn\u2019t considered serious and it will be done before Long has surgery to... Bears right guard Kyle Long will require two surgeries before he gets back into football action. Long will undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his right ankle suffered last Sunday in the loss at Tampa. The surgery isn\u2019t considered serious and it will be done before Long has surgery to... (Brad Biggs) Besides Floyd, starting cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc left Sunday's game with a concussion and nose tackle Eddie Goldman never dressed because of a bum ankle. Offensively, the Bears lost tight end Zach Miller to a broken foot and guard Josh Sitton , who limped away with a walking boot on his right foot. All told, as Cutler tried to rally the Bears for the go-ahead touchdown, the offense was missing three of five starting offensive linemen, tight end Miller and wide receivers Kevin White (leg) and Alshon Jeffery (PED suspension). \"It's crazy,'' Cutler said of the missing bodies. On one key third down in the fourth quarter, Cutler's primary receivers were two undrafted free agents: wide receiver Cameron Meredith and rookie tight end Ben Braunecker. Cutler had to look around the huddle and wonder if he was playing in Week 11 or the fourth exhibition game. Blame Cutler for the interception with 1:11 left \u2014 his back foot slipping affected the velocity of the pass \u2014 but the intended target was Marquess Wilson, hardly a player experienced in making something out of nothing. Put everything on Cutler's shoulders if you wish, out of habit, but more than one play spelled the Bears' demise. Their margin for error remains too thin to drop interceptions (Adrian Amos) and fail to recover muffed punts that bounce into their arms (Josh Bellamy). They can't drop four passes as running back Jordan Howard did. Nor can they let Eli Manning, never known as nimble, use his feet to make game-changing plays. \"Well, you get down the depth chart,'' Fox said of the effects of injuries. \"This is a resilient group, working hard and preparing hard.''

Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016. Rich Campbell Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Bears locker room late Sunday afternoon contained the familiar elements of their sad season. Hushed tones, somber faces and a couple of walking boots symbolized a team that was beaten down and beaten up in a 22-16 loss to the Giants. The Bears blew a 10-point first-half lead and lost four more starters to injury, a dispiriting combination that promises to test their resilience. The bad news: The Bears' depleted offense failed to build on a 16-6 lead. The Giants held them to 101 yards in the second half after the Bears gained 214 in the first. \"You look at the first half and we're kind of walking the ball up and down the field,\" quarterback Jay Cutler said. \"In the second half, it's a completely different story, and they didn't do that many things differently.\" The Bears gained only five of their 93 rushing yards after halftime. The Giants loaded the box at times and were better clogging holes. That strained a passing attack that entered the day short-handed and faced more attrition as the game progressed. For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad... For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad... (David Haugh) With Alshon Jeffery serving the start of his four-game suspension, tight end Zach Miller caught a 19-yard touchdown on the opening drive. But he broke his right foot in the second quarter. And in the third quarter, left guard Josh Sitton left with a right ankle injury. Eventually the Giants put Cutler under constant duress behind a line that was missing three opening-day starters. He was sacked four times in the second half, and they pressured him into an interception in Giants territory that sealed the game with 1 minute, 11 seconds remaining. \"I was pissed,\" said left tackle Charles Leno, who was beaten by Olivier Vernon for a sack in the fourth quarter. \"I want to go out there and perform better. I'm going against a good rusher, but that's no excuse. I look back and (Cutler's) getting hit again. It's just disappointing. We've got to keep him upright.\" The Bears' scoreless second half left the defense with no margin for error. The Giants scored touchdowns on their first two drives of the half to take the lead for good. The decisive score was a 15-yard pass from Eli Manning to rookie wideout Sterling Shepard, who beat cornerback Demontre Hurst on a slant-and-go. \"Took my eyes off of him as he was going in, and he popped it up on me,\" said Hurst, who was forced into action after starting cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc suffered a concussion. \"Eye discipline was bad for me on that play. I should have been on it the whole way and anticipated the route.\" Photos from the Bears-Giants game at MetLife Stadium on Nov. 20, 2016. The good news: For most of the first half, the Bears were so efficient on offense that you wondered how it was the same group that turned the ball over five times and scored only 10 points against the Buccaneers seven days before. Cutler was 11-for-14 passing for 126 yards and a touchdown before halftime, good for a passer rating of 128.0. Jordan Howard added 72 yards on 12 carries as the Bears used a similar approach to what kept them competitive for stretches in 2015 when injuries depleted the receiving corps. The combination of short passes, Cutler's accuracy on downfield shots and successful run blocks irritated wind-chilled Giants fans. \"We were dominating the ball, running the ball well,\" Leno said. \"He was making some good play-action throws. When the second half comes around, we've just got to be a team to finish. We've got to find that 'it' inside of us and get the job done.\" ",

    "text": "Trump Agrees To Settle Trump University Lawsuits For $25 Million Trump Agrees To Settle Trump University Lawsuits For $25 Million Embed Embed President-elect Donald Trump has settled three outstanding lawsuits related to his now-defunct Trump University. The New York Attorney General announced the $25 million settlement Friday. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President-elect Donald Trump has agreed to pay $25 million to settle three lawsuits that targeted his now-defunct Trump University real-estate seminars. As part of the settlement, he admits no wrongdoing. NPR's Ina Jaffe has been following the case. Thanks for being with us, Ina. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: President-elect Trump said - did not admit wrongdoing. So what are the indications as to why the suit was settled? JAFFE: Well, Alan Garten, the general counsel for the Trump organization, released a statement saying that there was, quote, \"no doubt that Trump would have won a trial.\" But he said the resolution of the lawsuits allows the president-elect to devote his full attention to the important issues facing the nation. SIMON: Where does that $25 million go? JAFFE: $1 million will go to the state of New York, which brought one of the lawsuits. The rest of the money will go to the plaintiffs. All of them are former students of Trump University. Now, these are class-action suits. And there could potentially be thousands of plaintiffs. But the attorneys for the two other lawsuits said in the statement that they won't be taking any fees, so that all the money can go to their clients. SIMON: Ina, bring us back to what these cases were all about, if you could. JAFFE: Well, they were about whether Trump University really did what Donald Trump said it would. In videos and print ads, he said that the instructors would be, quote, \"the best of the best,\" all of them hand-picked by Trump himself. And potential students were told they would learn his real-estate investing secrets. SIMON: Now, Mr. Trump often points out that the school, at least on the website, had an overwhelmingly favorable rating from former students. But the plaintiffs say that it wasn't like that at all. JAFFE: Really, that's exactly what they say. They argue that the whole point to this school was to keep selling students increasingly expensive seminars. First, there was a free introductory course where students were told they could make tens of thousands of dollars in just a couple of months using Trump's investment techniques. But to learn those, they had to sign up for another seminar that cost about 1,500 bucks. And at that seminar, they were sold another course that cost as much as $35,000. They claim that students were encouraged to go into credit-card debt and even cash out their 401(k)s to pay for these top-level courses. SIMON: The settlement was reached. Well, one of these suits was about to go to trial on Monday, wasn't it? JAFFE: Yeah, it was, though attorneys for Trump wanted it delayed because he was too busy with the transition. But, clearly, his schedule wasn't going to get any easier once he became president. So the judge in the case was urging both sides to settle. SIMON: Donald Trump, Ina, has said in a number of interviews that he doesn't like settling lawsuits, that he prefers to see things through. JAFFE: Right. He says settling only encourages people to sue him, which is why earlier attempts to settle had been fruitless. And if you want to know what the process was like, here's a statement from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman which gives you an idea of what the process was like. He wrote, Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. SIMON: Well - and now they'll get $25 million, right? JAFFE: I guess. SIMON: NPR's Ina Jaffe, thanks so much for being with us. JAFFE: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

    "text": "Privacy Policy Mr. Trump\u2019s five current projects in India are worth around $1.5 billion, making it Mr. Trump\u2019s most active development market outside North America, Mr. Mehta, the managing director at Tribeca Developers and the Trump Organization\u2019s representative in India, told The Indian Express last week. In most cases, Mr. Trump does not invest in the projects, but instead allows the developers to use his name in return for an undisclosed sum in royalties, according to industry analysts. Though each agreement is structured differently, in many cases the brand receives a percentage of sales, meaning Mr. Trump stands to benefit directly from increased revenues. Publicity materials focus heavily on Mr. Trump and his family. One pitch promises that \u201cthe experience of owning a Trump-branded property and living the Trump lifestyle is unparalleled.\u201d Customers requesting information about the units receive an email illustrated with a large photograph of Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, seated thoughtfully before a window. The Trump name, Sagar Chordia told The Business Standard, is so valuable that apartments in the towers sell for 35 percent more than comparable apartments in other developments. Similar projects have been undertaken by Armani, the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton, said Ramesh Nair, the international director at Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants, a global real estate company. \u201cIt\u2019s a branding project,\u201d Mr. Nair said. \u201cThere is no skin in the game. You are lending your name. You give some specifications for the project. And you will generate some free publicity.\u201d Photo Trump Towers Pune in Pune, India. Credit Ayesha Venkataraman But sharing your brand name with Indian developers could backfire. Over the past decade, many unscrupulous developers here allowed projects to stall midway for lack of ready capital and used home buyers\u2019 deposits to begin work on the next project, leaving families stripped of their savings to protest helplessly. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Nair said Mr. Trump so far had partnered with well-regarded firms, but warned that a poor choice could damage not only Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation, but that of the United States, given the corruption typical of Indian land deals. \u201cIf that small university can get him into trouble, you can imagine what could happen with India\u2019s \u2018squeaky-clean\u2019 real estate sector,\u201d Mr. Nair said, referring to the fraud lawsuit against Trump University, which Mr. Trump settled last week for $25 million. \u201cTomorrow they could have 100 buyers standing outside the U.S. Consulate, saying, \u2018Give me back my money.\u2019\u201d Industry observers differed on whether Mr. Trump\u2019s brand image would help increase real estate sales. India\u2019s luxury housing market has been weak for years, and has been further damaged by a new government drive to stamp out untaxed cash transactions. So far, some boldface names have reportedly purchased units at the Trump Towers Pune, including the Bollywood actors Rishi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor . The Chordia family, which has close ties to Sharad Pawar, the chief of India\u2019s Nationalist Congress Party, is particularly enthusiastic in its embrace of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has made targeted appeals to Indian-Americans for financial support, holding a major fund-raising event in October in Edison, N.J. , a city with a large number of Indian residents, where Mr. Trump called himself a \u201ca big fan of Hindu.\u201d On the morning of the election, Sagar Chordia described giving a party for 800 people in honor of Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit there, in 2014. Vijayta Lalwani, a local journalist who interviewed Sagar Chordia as the final results came in, described him as \u201cecstatic.\u201d Mr. Bhakta, the former consultant to Trump\u2019s development group, said he was confident that more collaborations were forthcoming. He said Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. has typically taken the lead on advancing deals in India, but that the president-elect also spends ample time with Indian partners. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cEvery time I have been there with clients from India, we always have a heart-to-heart with Senior,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is very much passionate about the India story.\u201d Many in Pune said they believed demand for the apartments would rise. Mohan Devasi, 21, a laborer, said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump when he \u201ccaught a glimpse of him\u201d in Pune in 2014. He had heard Mr. Trump was a \u201ca close friend of Narendra Modi\u201d and that he had promised to take a hard line on Muslims. \u201cHe is right now the American president, which means he is the most powerful person in the world,\u201d said Partha Sikder, 25. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that liberty. People will obviously want the apartments more.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate partners are also taking steps to keep the focus on the president-elect. Sagar Chordia told reporters from The Indian Express that he is planning to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.

Winter storm and lake-effect snow warnings stretch from northern Michigan into upstate New York and Vermont, as the first major wintry blast of the season pummels the United States. Snow is already falling rapidly in some parts of the Midwest, and the blizzard-like conditions have been blamed for at least three deaths. ABC News The winter storm was located over the northern Great Lakes early Saturday morning and is moving eastward. Forecasters expect the heaviest accumulations of snow to pile up in the eastern Great Lakes snow belt and the Adirondacks in New York this weekend through Monday night. ABC News Snowfall of up to 2 feet is expected to accumulate in some areas through Sunday night. In northern Minnesota, 10 to 18 inches of snow has fallen across much of the region and there were reports of up to 2 feet of snow in some areas. Over 20,000 homes and businesses were reported to be without power in Minnesota on Friday night due to blizzard-like conditions. Wind gusts up to 70 mph were reported from Minnesota to Michigan, according to ABC News senior meteorologist Daniel Manzo. \"The wind combined with a major blast of cold air will cause bitter wind chills through much of the country,\u201d Manzo said. \u201cWinter is on our doorstep!\u201d Dave Schwarz/ST. Cloud Times via AP A man walks in the snow near the entrance to the St. Cloud Public Library, Nov. 18, 2016 in St. Cloud, Minnesota. The Minnesota State Patrol reported hundreds of crashes, dozens of injuries and at least three deaths as the snowstorm swept across the Midwestern state. The worst of the storm has since moved out of that area, and less-than-stellar conditions are expected further east. \"By late Saturday night and into Sunday, we will be seeing widespread lake-effect snow through the western Appalachians and into interior parts of the Northeast,\" Manzo said. \"The big question is how much snow will make it down to the major cities.\" The Argus Leader via AP Cassie Maurer, with QT Cakes, puts the finishing touches on a snow man in front of the shop during a snow storm, Nov. 18, 2016, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Parts of interior New York could see upwards of 10 to 20 inches of snow in areas where it\u2019s falling persistently. And widespread regions of upstate New York could receive 12 to 18 inches, according to Manzo. \u201cMaybe some flurries make it to New York City on Sunday night -- it is possible,\u201d Manzo added. Joe Ahlquist/The Argus Leader via AP Philip Peter shovels snow in front of the restaurant during a snow storm, Nov. 18, 2016, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. There were also reports of residents digging out after snow piled up in parts of Nebraska and the Dakotas earlier this week. The Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s White House transition effort is starting to look like a 2016 GOP presidential primary reunion, with former rival Rick Perry scheduled for talks Monday as part of an apparent effort to mend fences and build party unity ahead of Inauguration Day. On Sunday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a primary rival-turned Trump backer, was part of a parade of officials who visited the president-elect, who moved his transition team's headquarters for the weekend from Manhattan to Trump\u2019s private golf club in Bedminster, N.J. The most high-profile visit this weekend was the arrival Saturday of former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who during the 2016 campaign called Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and publically backed several of the other 16 major candidates whom Trump vanquished in the primary. Trump, a first-time candidate, in turn called Romney a \u201cchoke artist\u201d for his failed 2012 White House bid against President Obama. Both men suggested their roughly 90-minute meeting went well. But it remains unlcear whether apologies were exchanged or if Romney is interested in the secretary of state post. \u201cThey did have some private time together, and you can ask either one of them what they talked about,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d However, Pence did confirm the widely-held assumption that Romney is indeed being considered to run the State Department, as Trump attempts to fill dozens of Cabinet-level posts and other high-level jobs. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 He also said that Trump \"wants to focus out of the gate\" on repealing \"ObamaCare\" -- a plan that new Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York acquaintance of Trump\u2019s, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he\u2019ll strongly oppose. Other contenders for secretary of state are said to be former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who met with Trump on Thursday. Trump on Saturday also met with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, a possible candidate for defense secretary. He later said on Twitter that Mattis was \u201cvery impressive\u201d and called him a \u201ctrue General's General!\" Also Sunday, Trump met with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, a possible secretary of commerce; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is also purportedly in the running for secretary of state; and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach served as an adviser to the Trump campaign on immigration issues and has a background in designing laws cracking down people who are here illegally. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a finalist in the hard-fought GOP primary, last week visited Trump at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. \u201cI think we had a very good and productive conversation about how we can work together to really deliver on the promises made to people,\u201d Cruz said afterward on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d On Friday, Trump picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism.

    "text": "James Mattis Has Emerged as a Favored Contender for Defense Secretary By Martha Raddatz Nov 20, 2016, 3:57 PM ET 0 Shares Star Mike Segar/Reuters President-elect Donald Trump (L) and Vice President-elect Mike Pence (R) greet retired Marine General James Mattis for a meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Nov. 19, 2016. 0 Shares Email Retired Marine Corps Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, has emerged as a favored contender for nomination as secretary of defense in the Trump administration, ABC News has learned, winning strong public praise from the president-elect and an endorsement from retired Gen. Jack Keane. Keane, who met with Trump earlier this week at Trump Tower, told ABC News that he was offered the job as secretary of defense but withdrew his name from consideration because of other commitments and personal reasons. (He lost his wife earlier this year). Trump transition officials would not confirm whether an offer was made but indicated the president-elect had been very interested in Keane, even as he expressed reluctance to accept a cabinet appointment. Keane told ABC that at the meeting last week he recommended Mattis and retired Gen. David Petraeus to the president-elect as candidates for the defense secretary job. Trump met with Mattis on Saturday at Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, after which Trump said the retired general, who formerly headed the U.S. Central Command, was \"the real deal.\" Today, Trump tweeted that Mattis \"is being considered for secretary of defense.\" General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Federal law requires that defense secretary appointees are at least seven years removed from active duty, so an appointment of Mattis would require a waiver from Congress, if he were nominated and confirmed. Such an action is not without precedent. Gen. George C. Marshall, who served as Army chief of staff and as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during World War II , needed a waiver to serve as secretary of defense under President Harry Truman . He is believed to be the last defense secretary who needed a waiver. 0 Shares ",

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told reporters that the officer, Benjamin Marconi, 50, was writing a ticket after a traffic stop on the south side of the city's public safety building at 11:45 a.m. (12:45 p.m. ET). The vehicle seen fleeing the scene after the shooting in San Antonio. San Antonio Police Department A black sedan with chrome rims that McManus described as either a Nissan or a Toyota then pulled up behind the police vehicle. McManus said a black man wearing a gray shirt and gray pants got out of the car, walked up to the Marconi's driver's side window and fired once, striking the officer in the head. Then, McManus said, \"He reached in again, firing a second time.\" The suspect, who McManus said is between 5'7'' and 6'0'' and possibly has a beard, walked back to his car, pulled around the officer's vehicle and drove through police headquarters' parking lot. Post by NBC News . Marconi, a 20-year veteran, was pronounced dead at a local hospital, he said. A former colleague of Marconi's, retired detective Roy Naylor, said that Marconi was a sex crimes detective who \"excelled\" at his work. \"He was a great father, he was a great officer,\" Naylor told NBC News. He said that Marconi had two children from previous marriages, as well as grandchildren. McManus, who said the suspect was still at large, said investigators had not yet determined a motive. But he compared the shooting to targeted attacks on police officers earlier this year. In Dallas , five officers were killed and 12 were injured when a sniper opened fire during a protest on July 7. Ten days later, in Baton Rogue , three more officers were killed and three were injured in what authorities described as an ambush. SAPD Detective Benjamin Marconi SAPD \"It's happened here,\" McManus said, adding: \"It's everyone's worst nightmare.\" In a statement Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbot used Marconi's killing to argue that police officers should be considered a protected class. Related: 'Blue Lives Matter': Louisiana Hate Crimes Bill to Protect First Responders \"Attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice, which is why I look forward to signing my Police Protection Act into law - making targeted attacks against law enforcement a hate crime,\" he said.

    "text": "Leonard Floyd able to travel with Bears after scary head, neck injury Photos of the Bears' first-round pick in 2016. Rich Campbell Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The disappointment of another Bears defeat was compounded Sunday by another round of serious injuries to key players. Four starters left and did not return to the 22-16 loss to the Giants. Outside linebacker Leonard Floyd (neck) and Zach Miller (broken right foot) were the most severely affected. Floyd was released from the hospital Sunday evening, an uplifting development after a scary sequence in the fourth quarter. He traveled with the team back to Chicago. Floyd dived headfirst into defensive end Akiem Hicks while trying to make a tackle. When the crown of Floyd's helmet hit Hicks, his head and neck compressed. He fell to his hands and knees before trainers eased him to the ground. He stayed down for about eight minutes. A group of medical personnel stabilized Floyd's head and neck, turned him over and put him on a backboard. They also removed the face mask of his helmet. Bears players emptied off the sideline to wish him well as the cart drove away with him on board. \"He even shook my hand ... and that's what eased my mind,\" outside linebacker Willie Young said. For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad... For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad... (David Haugh) \"I just touched him on his leg and walked back off,\" outside linebacker Pernell McPhee said. \"All prayers go out to Leonard.\" Miller will miss the rest of the season after his foot was stepped on in the second quarter. He came to the sideline and threw his helmet in disgust. \"I think he kind of knew right away from experience,\" coach John Fox said. Miller suffered a season-ending Lisfranc injury in his left foot in 2014. Although that diagnosis wasn't revealed in this case, Miller is at least familiar with the physical and mental pain associated with a foot injury. It was an especially disappointing turn for him after his 19-yard touchdown catch on the opening drive. And it further depletes a passing attack that's already without suspended receiver Alshon Jeffery and injured wideout Kevin White (left leg). Left guard Josh Sitton injured his right ankle in the third quarter and left the game. He initially suffered the injury against the Jaguars on Oct. 16 and missed two games. Eric Kush replaced him. Cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc suffered a concussion on a missed tackle attempt in the first half. Demontre Hurst replaced him. \"Don't let all these rule changes confuse you about the game of football,\" Young said. \"This is a very physical sport. It's an eat-or-be-eaten kind of deal.\" Rich Campbell, Brad Biggs on Bears' 22-16 loss to Giants Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016. See more videos Drop zone: The Bears are desperate for their young defensive backs to start making plays on the ball. So when Eli Manning floated a pass toward safety Adrian Amos in the red zone in the second quarter, it had the potential to be a meaningful moment in an otherwise dreary stretch of the season. Amos got both hands on the ball, but he dropped it. Instead of Amos recording his first career interception, the Giants salvaged a field goal. \"Just concentrate on the ball,\" Amos said. \"Take your eye off the ball, seeing end zone.\" Extra points: Rookie safety Deon Bush made his first career start and played most of the game. Coaches had said he needed to improve his mental command of his responsibilities in order to earn playing time. ... Nose tackle Eddie Goldman was inactive. He aggravated his sprained left ankle last Sunday against the Buccaneers and has missed seven of the last eight games. ... Marquess Wilson had one catch for 35 yards on four targets in his season debut. ... Deonte Thompson 's 40-yard kickoff return in the first half was the Bears' longest of the season. ",

    "text": "By Philip Rucker November 20 at 3:08 PM Follow @PhilipRucker When President-elect Barack Obama announced his nominee for attorney general eight years ago, he introduced Eric H. Holder Jr. at a news conference with extensive remarks about his qualifications and then handed the podium over to Holder to outline his vision for the Justice Department. When President-elect Donald Trump announced his nominee for attorney general on Friday, he introduced Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to the nation with a four-sentence quote delivered to the press corps via email. The president-elect was ensconced at Trump Tower in Manhattan. And over the weekend, as his nominee\u2019s record of racially charged statements drew sharp criticism, Trump did not appear with Sessions or say anything more about him. So it has gone for Trump, who spent the 12 days after being elected president mostly out of public view and rejecting, at least for now, some of the pre-inaugural rituals of Obama and other presidents. A postelection news conference? Not for Trump. A Veterans Day event to underscore the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to wounded warriors? Not for Trump. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet A visit to a deli or a convenience store, or just a step outside on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to take in the crisp fall air and greet people \u2014 the kinds of routine photo opportunities that Trump the candidate did to show he was in touch with everyday Americans? Not for the president-elect. \u201cTrump\u2019s an anomaly of seeming to be hiding right in plain view and not wanting to interact with the press corps or the general public,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cMost presidents-elect are immersed in how other presidents did it, and Trump\u2019s almost defiant in wanting to do it his way.\u201d [ Trump signals intent to keep hard-line promises with choices for senior national security posts ] Brinkley said it is \u201codd\u201d that Trump has not been holding public events to announce his major appointments so far. That approach not only deprives the media and history of photos and video of the moments but also leaves it to journalists to introduce the nominees to the nation. \u201cIt may be that he\u2019s weary of the press pool or he\u2019s afraid of protests or he\u2019s tired or his speechwriters are tired, but he\u2019s not framing for the public who these men are that he\u2019s choosing and why they are the right people for these all-important posts,\u201d Brinkley said. Jason Miller, communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team, said that the president-elect has been focused entirely on selecting key government personnel and developing policies for the start of his administration. \u201cSince the election, President-elect Trump\u2019s singular focus has been on forming his administration and preparing for the orderly transfer of power in January, and the results thus far have been outstanding,\u201d Miller said. He added, \u201cIn fact, the president-elect is ahead of schedule compared to many of his predecessors, a positive sign for what\u2019s to come.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump calls out to the media as Mitt Romney leaves the Trump National Golf Club on Saturday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s absence from the limelight has been notable considering his well-known thirst for public attention and love of stagecraft. After a campaign in which he fed off the energy of his boisterous crowds, Trump for nearly two weeks now has avoided much interaction with his future constituents. He has given no remarks nor made symbolic appearances designed to offer reassurance to the 53 percent of Americans who voted against him \u2014 and to begin, as he put it in his election-night victory speech, \u201cto bind the wounds of division.\u201d To be sure, Trump spent the Thursday after the election in open view. Cable news channels covered the landing of his plane at Washington\u2019s Reagan National Airport live, then his Oval Office visit with Obama, then his tour of the U.S. Capitol and meetings with Republican leaders there. Trump and his family also sat for a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with CBS\u2019s Lesley Stahl. Otherwise, however, Trump has rarely been seen by the public as he keeps up a busy schedule of private meetings and job interviews. One of the only times Trump left the tower was Tuesday to attend a private family dinner at 21 Club, a midtown Manhattan steakhouse \u2014 an outing for which he ditched the press pool . Grainy cellphone video captured Trump cheerfully promising fellow diners that he would cut their taxes. Trump did not allow journalists to cover his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which took place inside his gold, marble and crystal-adorned Trump Tower penthouse apartment. In an unusual move, Trump\u2019s oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, who helps run the family\u2019s real estate businesses, sat in on the meeting, as did her husband, Jared Kushner, an influential adviser to the president-elect. Trump retreated Friday night to his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., where he spent Saturday and Sunday meeting with a parade of possible Cabinet members , including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a candidate for secretary of state. [ Trump mulls a secretary of state: Clone, crusader, statesman or clean slate? ] As their guests arrived, Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence would open the door to the clubhouse and greet them, shake hands and pose for the cameras. Late Saturday, reporters got in a few quick questions as Trump walked to his SUV before dinner. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing tremendous talent \u2014 people that, like I say, we will make America great again,\u201d Trump said, invoking his campaign slogan. On Sunday morning, Trump and Pence attended services at Lamington Presbyterian Church, a white-steepled, 18th-century house of worship in Bedminster where the bells were ringing upon their arrival. Aides did not permit the press pool to follow them inside, claiming to be honoring a request from church officials. Some observers who have been concerned by his lack of public outreach said they were willing to cut Trump some slack. In the weeks leading up to the election, after all, it was not Trump but Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton who felt assured of victory and already was contemplating what she would do in the immediate aftermath to signal a coming together. \u201cI\u2019ll just say this: Trump has been a bit behind on transition stuff \u2014 in no small part because I doubt anybody in his transition leadership thought he was going to win,\u201d Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wrote in an email when asked to assess the president-elect\u2019s activities. \u201cI think he could make some public appearances in the spirit of his victory speech, and that would be a needed and good thing,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cI\u2019m sure he misses the roar of the crowd, but the question is, will he have the discipline to seek unifying \u2014 not divisive \u2014 cheers now that he is president-elect?\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama who helped shape the then-president-elect\u2019s image during the 2008 transition, said he was struck by Trump\u2019s approach. He noted that in 2000, George W. Bush, who was assuming office after losing the popular vote and after a month-long recount, kept up \u201ca very smart tempo of events to put the election behind him and build momentum for his agenda.\u201d For Trump, Pfeiffer wrote in an email, \u201cit\u2019s an odd choice to not try to build some good will with the public in the wake of an election victory. Especially after an election as divisive as this one, Trump could have made some doubling gestures to try heal the country or reach out to the plurality that votes against him, yet he has done none of that.\u201d George Gigicos, the Trump campaign\u2019s advance team director, told reporters last week that Trump is planning \u201ca victory tour\u201d after the Thanksgiving holiday. The tour would get the president-elect back on the road and in front of the citizenry \u2014 though it is unlikely to take him to parts of the country that were hostile to his candidacy. Asked where the president-elect might travel, Gigicos said, \u201cObviously to the states that we won and the swing states we flipped.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

President Barack Obama pauses while answers question during his news conference at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Lima, Peru on Sunday, Nov. 20. (Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons Contact Reporters In a brief, presumably\u00a0final, face-to-face encounter, President Obama on Sunday appealed\u00a0to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill\u00a0agreements\u00a0to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine\u00a0and work with the U.S.\u00a0 to bring order to chaos in Syria. The night before, Obama sat with his Chinese counterpart to note important cooperation on climate change and regional security issues, particularly with regard to North Korea, before President Xi Jinping warned that relations with the U.S. were at a \u201chinge moment.\u201d Left unsaid in the diplomatic readouts by American officials\u00a0 was the specter of President-elect Donald Trump and the likelihood that he would take a far different approach in managing the most complex U.S. relationships abroad. Under different electoral circumstances, Obama\u2019s trip this week \u2014 his last, scheduled presidential tour overseas \u2014\u00a0could have been something of a valedictory march: a sweeping speech on democracy in its birthplace, Greece; a final fond farewell and early endorsement in Berlin for his most important partner, German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; and an economic summit in Peru of Asian and Pacific leaders. White House officials had even envisioned a chance of\u00a0putting a bow on Obama\u2019s strategy of reorienting U.S. attention to\u00a0Asia by persuading\u00a0a lame-duck session of Congress to consider\u00a0the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal. Trump\u2019s election put an end to all that. Instead, Obama was warning about the threats to democracy in an era of \u201cactive disinformation\u201d that left the public struggling to separate fact from fiction. He and Merkel sternly lectured Trump from a distance\u00a0about the obligations of leadership and the need\u00a0to abide by international norms of behavior. When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jagged exclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats . Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewer House seats and perhaps a dozen fewer governors than in 2009, during President Obama \u2019s first... When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jagged exclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats . Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewer House seats and perhaps a dozen fewer governors than in 2009, during President Obama \u2019s first... (Mark Z. Barabak) In a Sunday night news conference before leaving Peru, Obama said he thinks \u2014 though he can't guarantee \u2014 that Trump may govern more moderately than the way he campaigned. \u201cI can't be sure of anything,\u201d Obama said of Trump\u2019s approach. But the presidency, he said, \u201chas a way of shaping your thinking and in some cases modifying your thinking because you recognize the solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility America has as the most powerful country in the world.\u201d Obama had\u00a0thought he would be handing off leadership of the Western powers\u00a0to Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of State who ran a campaign largely on a platform of continuing Obama\u2019s policies. Instead he appeared ready to pass that mantle\u00a0off to another leader, Merkel, who now plans to seek a fourth term as chancellor. \u201cI do believe that Chancellor Merkel and Germany are a linchpin in protecting the basic tenets of a liberal, market-based democratic order that has created unprecedented prosperity and security for Europe, but also for the world,\u201d Obama said in a joint interview with German television and print reporters.\u00a0 In his news conference, however, he cautioned against any U.S. withdrawal from leadership of global institutions, warning that for all the world\u2019s problems, the globe is\u00a0far safer, more secure and prosperous than it was when the current international system was put into place. \u201cThe United\u00a0States really is an indispensable nation in our world order,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore that\u00a0order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of 30 years,\u201d he noted. \u201cIn the second one, 60 million people were killed,\u201d he added, \u201centire continents in rubble.\u201d In Asia, \u201cyou routinely saw famines of millions of people,\u201d he said. America can\u2019t carry the sole burden of sustaining the modern global system, but other countries can\u2019t replace U.S. leadership. If the U.S. shuns the role of heading the global order,\u00a0\u201cthen it collapses \u2026 there\u2019s nobody to fill the void,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a burden we should carry proudly,\u201d Obama added, \u201can extraordinary privilege.\" As he concluded his trip, Obama also made it clear that he plans to govern through\u00a0to the final day of his term, without regard for what Trump may have in the works. In his brief\u00a0conversation with Putin, for example, he said he held fast to his position that Russia should respect the sovereignty of Ukraine and work for a peaceful resolution in Syria. He also made it clear that his administration will move ahead with new environmental rules, even though Trump and the Republicans may not like them. The\u00a0proposals are well-considered rules that have been under scrutiny and public discussion for a long time, he said, and they shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. \u201cI feel strongly these are the right things to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to do them.\u201d Still, though, a postelection funk continued among the White House staff, defying Obama\u2019s best efforts to shake them out of it\u00a0 and his\u00a0frequent pleas to just about everyone to give the new president-elect time to prove skeptics wrong. Those traveling with the president could not help but monitor the president-elect\u2019s appointments to key positions.\u00a0Many of Obama\u2019s aides considered the choices curious, in some cases troubling and in almost all cases a signal of\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0intention for a clean break with the policies of the last eight years. They also digested the feedback of foreign leaders who had manage to speak with Trump directly after the election, hopeful to put concerns to ease but not always finding reason to. Obama spent his two terms\u00a0working to strengthen global institutions, both out of his conviction that collective action is the best way to achieve success, but also to reduce the burden on the United States to singularly solve the world\u2019s problems. The president now has little choice but to put his faith in those institutions to bring along, or ultimately stand up to, a successor who appears to have very a different vision for U.S. leadership in the world. The task before Obama over the last few days \u2014 to try to explain how his successor might act \u2014 seemed nearly impossible, given the\u00a0adversarial history between the two men and the uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s contradictory\u00a0pronouncements on foreign policy throughout the campaign. Based on a single face-to-face meeting in the Oval Office days after the election, Obama felt assured enough to make one commitment to the international community: that Trump understood and would remain committed to the NATO alliance. When it comes to the more thorny issues of confronting Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria and keeping up the campaign against Islamic State, Obama locked arms with key partners to send a different message to Trump: color within the lines. \u201cWhat I can guarantee is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues,\u201d Obama said Sunday\u00a0night. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way this office works.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

By Terrence McCoy November 20 at 5:44 PM Follow @terrence_mccoy LONG BEACH, Calif. \u2014 Fewer than 2,000 readers are on his website when Paris Wade, 26, awakens from a nap, reaches for his laptop and thinks he needs to, as he puts it, \u201cfeed\u201d his audience. \u201cMan, no one is covering this TPP thing,\u201d he says after seeing an article suggesting that President Obama wants to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership before he leaves office. Wade, a modern-day digital opportunist, sees an opportunity. He begins typing a story. \u201cCAN\u2019T TRUST OBAMA,\u201d he writes as the headline, then pauses. His audience hates Obama and loves President-elect Donald Trump, and he wants to capture that disgust and cast it as a drama between good and evil. He resumes typing: \u201cLook At Sick Thing He Just Did To STAB Trump In The Back\u2026 .\u201d Ten minutes and nearly 200 words later, he is done with a story that is all opinion, innuendo and rumor. He types at the bottom, \u201cComment \u2018DOWN WITH THE GLOBALISTS!\u2019 below if you love this country,\u201d publishes the story to his website, LibertyWritersNews.com, and then pulls up the Facebook page he uses to promote the site, which in six months has collected 805,000 followers and brought in tens of millions of page views. \u201cWE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN!\u201d he writes, posting the article. \u201c#SHARE this 1 million times, patriots!\u201d Then he looks at a nearby monitor that shows the site\u2019s analytics, and watches as the readers pour in. \u201cDown with the globalists,\u201d writes a woman in Cape Girardeau, Mo., one of 3,192 people now on the website, 1,244 of whom are reading the story he just posted. \u201cDown with the globalists!\u201d writes a man in Las Vegas. Consider these points before sharing a news article on Facebook. It could be fake. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Now 1,855 are reading the story. \u201cDOWN WITH THE GLOBALISTS !!!\u201d writes a woman in Helena, Mont. Now 1,982. At a time of continuing discussion over the role that hyperpartisan websites, fake news and social media play in the divided America of 2016, LibertyWritersNews illustrates how websites can use Facebook to tap into a surging ideology, quickly go from nothing to influencing millions of people and make big profits in the process. Six months ago, Wade and his business partner, Ben Goldman, were unemployed restaurant workers. Now they\u2019re at the helm of a website that gained 300,000 Facebook followers in October alone and say they are making so much money that they feel uncomfortable talking about it because they don\u2019t want people to start asking for loans. Instead, Wade hums a hip-hop song and starts a new post as readers keep reading, sharing and sending in personal messages. One comes from a woman who frequently contacts his page. \u201cYOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST TO REPORT THE TRUTH,\u201d is one of the things she has written, and Wade doesn\u2019t need to look at her Facebook profile to have a clear sense of who she is. White. Working class. Midwestern. \u201cAnd the economy screwed her.\u201d He writes another headline, \u201cTHE TRUTH IS OUT! The Media Doesn\u2019t Want You To See What Hillary Did After Losing... .\u201d \u201cNothing in this article is anti-media, but I\u2019ve used this headline a thousand times,\u201d he says. \u201cViolence and chaos and aggressive wording is what people are attracted to.\u201d Wade, left, and Goldman have little else in their apartment aside from their laptops. (Stuart Palley for The Washington Post) \u201cOur audience does not trust the mainstream media,\u201d Goldman, 26, says a little later as Wade keeps typing. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely easier to hook them with that.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a ton of thought put into it,\u201d Wade says. \u201cOther than it frames the story so it gets a click.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cWe\u2019re the new yellow journalists,\u201d Wade will say after a day and night when the number of people following LibertyWritersNews on Facebook will swell by more than 20,000. \u201cWe\u2019re the people on the side of the street yelling that the world is about to end.\u201d But for now, it\u2019s only 7 p.m., readers on both coasts are still awake, and there are several more stories that need posting. An itinerant lifestyle Everything about the lives of Wade and Goldman has the flimsy feel of something that can be taken apart in a matter of hours, boxed up and carted away, from the fake bylines they use \u2014 Wade is Paris Swade; Goldman is Danny Gold \u2014 right down to the rental they found on Airbnb. It is stripped of accoutrements, except for some clothes strewn across the bedroom floors, a pair of laptops and a PlayStation 4. They say they plan on spending two more months here and don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll be after that. Every evening, they write stories on the couch, watch them go viral, schedule more for morning, head off to bed, and now, on another morning, comes Goldman, creaking down the steps. \u201cMy article got banned,\u201d Goldman says, explaining Facebook had removed a trending piece headlined: \u201cRight After LOSING The Election, Hillary Clinton Just Humiliated Herself In Worst Way Ever!!\u201d \u201cF--- Facebook,\u201d Wade says, knowing its algorithms sometimes assume that rapidly shared articles are spam and temporarily blocks them if posted by an alternative outlet. \u201cThey had a spam filter.\u201d Wade calls their server technician in Texas. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we have to do to get through these spam filters,\u201d Wade says into the phone. \u201cBut we\u2019ve probably lost thousands of dollars because of them.\u201d Goldman sits on the couch, logs onto an advertiser\u2019s website and looks up how much money they\u2019ve nonetheless made. \u201cSuper great election sales,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were some days where we were getting $13, $14 per 1,000 views.\u201d Between June and August, they say, when they had fewer than 150,000 Facebook followers, they made between $10,000 and $40,000 every month running advertisements that, among other things, promised acne solutions, Viagra alternatives, ways to remove lip lines, cracked feet, \u201cdeep fat,\u201d and \u201cthe 13 sexiest and most naked celebrity selfies.\u201d Then the political drama deepened, and their audience expanded fivefold, and now Goldman sometimes thinks that what he made in the last six months would have taken him 20 years waiting tables at his old job. Wade and Goldman now have a lawyer and an accountant, employ other writers and are expanding so quickly that they\u2019re surprised to think the majority of their adult lives were spent scraping by. They graduated from the University of Tennessee \u2014 Wade in 2012 with an advertising degree and Goldman in 2013 with a business degree \u2014 but could only find unpaid internships and ended up working at a Mexican restaurant. On weekends, they would sell water bottles at college football games, and Goldman scalped tickets. Neither thought much about politics. Raised in liberal homes, they both voted for Obama twice, but as they struggled to find better jobs, they began to doubt those votes, their college education and the progressive values with which they were raised. They moved to California, first Wade, then Goldman, and started an advertising business that quickly failed. But it did attract one client who ran numerous alt-right Facebook pages. He needed more writers, and in 2015 Wade and Goldman started doing stories and getting paid based on how many clicks they got. The first story Wade did aggregated a South Korean news report that claimed an anonymous source had said that a North Korean scientist had defected with data from human experiments. Wade knew he needed a picture to sell the story to readers. He searched online for an image of a human experiment that, as he describes it, would make people think, \u201cWhat is that? I got to click.\u201d He found what he recalls was a \u201ctotally misleading\u201d photograph of a fleshy mass and made it the featured image. He wrote the headline, \u201c[PROOF] N. Korea Experiments on Humans,\u201d published the story and made $120 off 10 minutes of work. It was, he says, a revelation: \u201cYou have to trick people into reading the news.\u201d Now settled into the career that has grown from that revelation, Wade turns the television to Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist with nearly 1.4 million followers on Facebook, who is the opportunist they would most like to become. Wade clicks on the LibertyWritersNews site, which says at the bottom, \u201cYou Can Count On Liberty Writers News,\u201d begins typing a new story, and looks up to watch Jones yell into the camera. But it isn\u2019t Jones\u2019s monologue that Wade notices. It\u2019s his setup. \u201cWe want to start filming in a studio like that,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThat stuff works on Facebook.\u201d What works on Facebook and what doesn\u2019t work occupies many of the conversations between Wade and Goldman. Explicitly telling people to prove that they support Trump by sharing their stories works, so they do that. Neither of them is particularly religious, but their readers are, so in their writing they ask God to bless the president-elect, and that works, too. So does exaggeration: \u201cOBAMA BIRTH SECRETS REVEALED! The Letters From His Dad Reveal Something Sinister... .\u201d And stoking fear: \u201cTerrorists Have Infiltrated the US Government! Look Who They Want to ASSASSINATE!!\u201d And inflaming racial and gender tension: \u201cBREAKING: Michelle Obama holds Feminist Rally At HER SLAVE HOUSE!\u201d And conspiracy theories: \u201cBREAKING: Top Official Set to Testify Against Hillary Clinton Found DEAD!\u201d Wade now finishes a new post calling House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) a traitor because \u201cour audience hates Paul Ryan.\u201d He shares a story he wrote on their Facebook page claiming that former president Bill Clinton will soon go to jail, not because Clinton will soon go to jail, but because his audience wants to hear that Clinton is a criminal. \u201cAll successful journalism has shock value,\u201d Goldman says as he and Wade sit at their computers later that day. \u201cThere was once a lot more competition among newspapers,\u201d Wade says. \u201cIt was like a race to see who could write the craziest s---.\u201d \u201cAnd whoever wrote the craziest s--- won,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cThere used to be a joke that every single day a new world war started,\u201d Wade says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what sold papers.\u201d Now Wade writes on their Facebook page that \u201cTHOUSANDS\u201d of protesters are marching \u201cwith MEXICAN FLAGS,\u201d and meanwhile Goldman types his own article. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wade asks. \u201cMegyn Kelly,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cGoing to do great.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Wade says. \u201cPeople love Megyn Kelly.\u201d Writing for audience There are times when Wade wonders what it would be like to write an article he truly believes in. \u201cIn a perfect world,\u201d he says, it would have nuance and balance and long paragraphs and take longer than 10 minutes to compose. It would make people think. But he never writes it, he says, because no one would click on it, so what would be the point? Instead, as 4,000 people are on the website one night, Wade and Goldman keep writing and feeding, writing and feeding. Wade writes about a rumor he has seen on Fox News\u2019s website, which says \u201cthe new batch of anti-Trump protesters has been bankrolled by individuals like billionaire liberal activist George Soros and groups like Moveon.org.\u201d \u201cDude,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThe left has been, like, manufacturing the protest.\u201d Goldman, meanwhile, is typing a story \u2014 \u201cIt was a literal Hell Storm at DNC headquarters today\u201d \u2014 and laughing at what he has written. \u201cGod, I just know everything about this statement is so wrong,\u201d he says, and adds, still laughing, \u201cWhat is a hell storm?\u201d He finishes it as Wade is putting an old headline on his story about Soros, one that has nothing to do with what he has written but once brought in a lot of page views. He shares it on their Facebook page and watches as readers stream into the website \u2014 first a few hundred, then nearly 1,000. \u201cBoom, dude, look at that,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThat one is doing super well.\u201d Goldman scans through what Wade had written. \u201cWhen are we going to go after this traitor!\u201d it says. \u201cIt is time to take this traitor out! He should be pursued to the depths of hell and beyond.\u201d He looks up and smiles nervously. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a less violent way to say that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to change that one, actually,\u201d Wade says, suddenly looking panicked as he grabs his laptop and moves to replace \u201ctake this traitor out\u201d to \u201ctake this traitor down.\u201d \u201cDown is so much better sounding than out,\u201d Goldman says. But the comments are already coming in fast. \u201cArrest and hang him for war crimes,\u201d one woman writes of Soros. \u201cThis man should go straight to F@#KING HELL,\u201d another woman posts. \u201cI gladly volunteer to take this Traitor to America out,\u201d another says. \u201cJail is way too good for him.\u201d Goldman and Wade often tell each other they aren\u2019t creating anything that\u2019s not already there, that they\u2019re simply fanning it, that readers know not to take their hyperbole and embellishments seriously. And even if the comments suggest otherwise, they try not to pay them too much attention. People will say anything on Facebook, they remind themselves. They tell one another they\u2019re only minor participants in a broader \u201cmeme war\u201d between outlets such as The Other 98% (other98.com) on the left and Nation In Distress (facebook.com/NationInDistress) on the right, but then they see the protests in the streets, the divisions in America, and wonder if their work is making things worse. What if one of their readers actually does harm Soros? Would they be complicit? Is their website dangerous? Or is it savvy entrepreneurship? Their opportunity? And if it is opportunity, how far can they go with it? One afternoon, Goldman has an idea. \u201cIt would be a perfect time to open up a small liberal newspaper right now,\u201d he says as he types a post with, \u201cThe Democratic party is finished! Just wait til you see what happened today... .\u201d \u201cIt would,\u201d Wade says. \u201cThere is so much animus on the left right now.\u201d \u201cYou could get more traffic than we do now,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be very hard to argue the other side for me,\u201d Wade says, as he types a post that says, \u201cLIKE + SHARE IF YOU LOVE TRUMP! It\u2019s time to heal the nation. All the lies that we have been fed about him were wrong. He is not a Nazi, he is not a Xenophobe, he is not Deplorable, he is not racist and he is about to make America great again!\u201d Goldman keeps typing. So does Wade. There are 2,268 readers on their website, and it\u2019s time to get more. national News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

It's complicated Sergey Kovalev vs. Andre Ward Al Bello / Getty Images Andre Ward lands a left jab against Sergey Kovalev during their light-heavyweight title fight. Andre Ward lands a left jab against Sergey Kovalev during their light-heavyweight title fight. (Al Bello / Getty Images) Lance Pugmire Contact Reporter What makes perfect sense has real potential to develop into a perfect mess. Unbeaten Andre Ward\u2019s come-from-behind, unanimous-decision victory Saturday night to claim three light-heavyweight belts from previously undefeated Sergey Kovalev was a bout that realized the hype and hopes. The third meeting of unbeatens ranked in boxing\u2019s mythical top-five pound-for-pound list fulfilled expectations and boosted the profiles of two more fighters at a time boxing could use more name brands. It also had\u00a0a rematch clause. Russia\u2019s Kovalev (30-1-1) and his promoter, Kathy Duva, barely let minutes expire from Saturday\u2019s defeat by three judges\u2019 scores of 114-113 before invoking their intention to exercise their contractually agreed-upon rights. Ward and his side were not so quick. The Oakland fighter recovered from a second-round knockdown and a major scorecard deficit to sweep the final six rounds on two of the judges\u2019 cards and claim a decisive 12th\u00a0round from two judges who had the bout tied after 11. Although Kovalev objected to the scoring, pointing to possible \u201cpolitics\u201d that favored the last U.S. men\u2019s Olympic boxing gold medalist, Ward boasted more accuracy in punching success, landed more jabs and was game until the end. \u201cAfter the knockdown, I needed every single round. Responding to adversity, we got a tough victory and we did what champions do,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWe can take a big shot and get up.\u201d Ward (31-0) suggested from the success he had in the second half against Kovalev that he believed a rematch would be a more convincing victory. He acknowledged there was controversy, but said the rematch is up to his manager, James Prince and his lawyer. Prince later opened negotiations cryptically. \u201cAll things are possible,\u201d Prince said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to soak in this one we have here now. We\u2019re never scared, you know what I mean? We know what it is. When the time and place comes in, we\u2019ll start talking about that. \u201cWe\u2019re driving the ship now. [Kovalev\u2019s team] drove it the first time. We\u2019re behind the wheel on this one.\u201d Duva was quick to react to that claim, reminding that the contract gives her significant control over terms of the rematch, with protective language that would discourage Ward from deviating from Chapter Two. Photos from the boxing card featuring Andre Ward defeating Sergey Kovalev for the light-heavyweight title fight on Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Most importantly, Duva said, both she and Ward\u2019s side have to agree to any request he\u2019d make to fight someone else. Such an agreement would likely involve a payoff from Ward to Kovalev. Given the debate over who won, there certainly isn\u2019t a better option for Ward than Kovalev after the Oakland fighter earned a $5 million guaranteed purse Saturday. But there are interesting alternatives. Ward has previously discussed a possible date against former middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., which would sell, and he could also opt to unify the light-heavyweight division against World Boxing Council champion Adonis Stevenson, who called out Ward \u00a0on social media late Saturday. Several fighters from Stevenson\u2019s promotional company, Premier Boxing Champions, attended Saturday\u2019s fight and met with Ward, with a PBC official explaining, \u201cIt was just about supporting a great guy [Ward] and going to a big fight. The guys don\u2019t worry about those politics.\u201d And while it\u2019s unclear if Ward is still connected to rapper Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation Sports promotional company, Duva and Roc Nation endured a notoriously rocky co-promotion fraught with petty disagreements. Duva further heightened the tension between herself, Ward and his trainer, Virgil Hunter, by telling a reporter of Jay Z and James Prince, \u201cI come from a different type of business.\u201d While Duva said she was referring to their work in the music industry, Ward and Hunter interpreted the comment differently and sniped at her during fight week. \u201cThat\u2019s why I say, \u2018Why did they get $5 million and you only got $2 million [for Kovalev] then,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cShe puts off that air, that superior air, that entitlement air. She\u2019s upset because it didn\u2019t work.\u201d ",

Dmitri Lovetsky/AP NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson arrived at the International Space Station this weekend, making her the oldest woman in space at age 56. On the mission, she's projected to once again become the U.S. astronaut with the most time spent in orbit. This is Whitson's third mission on the space station; she'll soon become its commander for the second time. Collectively, she's spent more than a year of her life in space. When Whitson lands back on Earth in spring of 2017, she'll have amassed more time in orbit than Jeff Williams, who set a new U.S. mark in September with total off-planet time of 534 days . That's if the return date of Whitson's Soyuz MS-03 craft remains in May, as reported by Space.com . A previous NASA release had placed the return date in late April. Here's how NASA summarizes Whitson's career in orbit: \"The Iowa native completed two six-month tours of duty aboard the station for Expedition 5 in 2002, and as the station commander for Expedition 16 in 2008. She has accumulated 377 days in space between the two missions, the most for any U.S. woman at the time of her return to Earth. Whitson has also performed six spacewalks, totaling 39 hours and 46 minutes.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "Close CBS News President Erdo\u011fan is not the only one in Turkey disillusioned with America right now. So are many of his countrymen, who feel that their Western allies care more about their own interests than Turkey\u2019s. Most of the tension and anti-Americanism can be traced back to the night of July 15th here in the heart of Istanbul. Factions of the Turkish military shut down the Bosporus Bridge that connects Europe and Asia and launched a coup to overthrow the elected government. It wasn\u2019t long after that F-16s commandeered by a rogue faction of the Air Force streaked fast and low across the skies of Istanbul and Ankara\u2026sonic booms shattered windows. The plotters used tanks and troops, to seize strategic buildings and military bases, and shut down Istanbul\u2019s main airport. And in something never seen before in the capital of NATO country, the parliament in Ankara was bombed, and helicopter gunships strafed the presidential palace. Soldiers stormed television stations and announced that Turkey was under martial law. President Erdo\u011fan, was on vacation with his family when he learned a coup was underway. He wanted to address the country, but had no access to the media. So he used the FaceTime app on a borrowed phone to call into a Turkish television station. He pleaded for people to take to the streets and fill the squares. Tens of thousands responded. Facing down tanks and helicopters. As volleys were fired into crowds, Erdo\u011fan boarded a plane and flew towards Istanbul. Steve Kroft: were you afraid for your life and the lives of your family members? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: Steve, in our faith there is a concept. We surrender ourselves to death. If you\u2019re the leader you have to communicate the message of immortality to your people. Because I believe if a leader hides behind a rock, then the people will hide behind a mountain. His return to Istanbul proved to be the turning point by daybreak the coup attempt had failed. More than 200 were dead. Who is Fethullah Gulen? Erdo\u011fan immediately blamed the revolt on his arch-enemy, an elderly and exiled cleric name Fethullah Gulen, whose followers had infiltrated the highest levels of the Turkish military, judiciary, and civil service. For the past 17 years, Gulen has been leading a reclusive life in the United States on a 26-acre retreat in the Pocono Mountains. For months, Erdo\u011fan has demanded that his American ally return Gulen to Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: This man is the leader of a terrorist organization that has bombed my parliament. We have extradited terrorists to the United States in the past. And we expect the same thing to be done by the United States. The U.S. is insisting that the extradition process must be handled through U.S. courts to evaluate the evidence. The delay has created widespread suspicions here that the U.S. government is protecting Gulen and that its intelligence agencies may have been involved or had advance knowledge of the coup. Members of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government have suggested that publicly. The U.S. has denied it. Steve Kroft: Do you believe that there was any U.S. involvement? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: I\u2019m not going to blame the United States. But that\u2019s what my people will think. Why are you still keeping that man? So as long you harbor him there, I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t get offended. But this is the-- perception of the Turkish nation and the Turkish people. Steve Kroft: I\u2019m taking it from your answer that you have done nothing to discourage the Turkish people from believing that. Turkish past and Turkish present Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: I cannot deceive my people. I cannot deceive my people here. Because I\u2019m suffering right now. The United States is not suffering. But I\u2019m suffering because of the 241 martyrs that we have buried. Erdo\u011fan had begun a crackdown on the Gulenist movement and other perceived enemies before the attempted coup. After it, he used a state of emergency to begin a massive effort to purge them from government and Turkish society. More than 30,000 people have been arrested or detained including generals, judges, prosecutors, mayors, members of Parliament, teachers and journalists. Another 100,000 people have been fired or suspended from government jobs. And 150 media outlets have been shut down. Steve Kroft: Some critics in Turkey and some people in the United States have said that this is an overreaction. This is a crackdown on the political opposition, not a crackdown on terrorists? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: In Turkey, they attempted to destroy my state. And of course, we could not remain silent. We could not remain indifferent. And these measures are being taken by prosecutors and judges in full accordance with the rule of law. There are not many people in Turkey today eager to publicly criticize the government. Soli \u00d6zel is an academic and a prominent political commentator. Soli \u00d6zel: I think this has gone beyond only the Gulenists. A lot of teachers have been dismissed who probably have nothing to do with the Gulenists. A lot of newspaper people have been dismissed although they have nothing with the Gulenists. And I think a lot of people who really had nothing to do with the coup attempt itself are now being burned. Steve Kroft: Do you think the government is becoming more and the presidency is becoming more authoritarian? Soli \u00d6zel: We are moving in that direction, yes. The presidency has now accumulated a lot more power than is stipulated in the constitution. And it will continue to accumulate more. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: This is misperception. It is out of the question. We have saved our country from the hands of a heinous coup. And we are very much determined to protect our democracy. There is a strong bent of authoritarianism that runs through Turkish history and Turkish life and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s message and actions have played well with the public. After the failed coup, his approval rating jumped to 68 percent. Much of that support comes from more traditional, conservative Muslims, who have long been marginalized in Turkish society. Erdo\u011fan has embraced them, courted them and included them in his government. Ece Temelkuran: He is a brilliant politician when it comes to talking to common people and with their discourse. Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish writer who chronicles the country\u2019s cultural and political changes. She believes this is all part of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vision for a new Turkey. Ece Temelkuran: The new Turkey does not ask you to be more religious. It asks you to be more obedient. It has to be obedient. It has to be male, conservative, religious and, you know, supporting the governing party. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s new Turkey has been a source of concern in Washington. While the two NATO allies still share the same goals of replacing the Assad government in Syria and defeating ISIS, each country has its own special interests and priorities. And in some cases its own allies. The United States is obsessed with ISIS. Turkey is obsessed with Kurdish separatist groups that have been waging a decades-long war inside their country. This is where it gets complicated. The U.S. is supporting and arming Kurdish groups that Turkey considers bitter enemies, and they have responded by bombing the U-S allies. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: You cannot defend another terrorist organization just because they are fighting ISIS as well. You cannot make a distinction between a good terrorist organization and a bad terrorist organization. But this is something that we did not come to an agreement with the United States about. Into all this acrimony between Erdo\u011fan and the United States has stepped Russian President Vladimir Putin, one of first world leaders to express solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup. Since then the two countries have finalized a major pipeline deal\u2026 and agreed to step up military and intelligence contacts. Steve Kroft: Are you reevaluating your alliance and relationship with NATO and the United States? Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: Right now, such a thing is not in question. We are moving in the same direction with NATO that we have always done. According to one informed observer, what Erdo\u011fan is really looking for is an answer to this question: Is the U.S. truly committed to use all of its power, including its military, to preserve order in the region, stop terrorism and protect the interests of Turkey. Yes, or No? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer because the Middle East is such a messy place. But right now it looks like the answer from Donald Trump may be yes. His aides have described Turkey as a vital ally and called for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen and Trump himself has suggested he has high hopes for a closer relationship. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

So should the NFL even consider the city for future expansion? USA TODAY Sports In this Oct. 2, 2005, file photo, Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, Mexico is shown prior to the start of a regular season NFL game between the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers. Eleven years after the network telecast an NFL game from Mexico City, it will do so again when the Raiders \"host\" the Texans on Monday night. (Photo: MARCO UGARTE, AP) MEXICO CITY \u2013 As the National Football League seeks to further broaden its international reach with Monday\u2019s\u00a0clash between the Oakland Raiders and Houston Texans, the match-up is already guaranteed to be the high point of the season in one regard. Azteca Stadium sits at 7,280 feet above sea level, higher than\u00a0Denver\u2019s Sports Authority Field at Mile High, which is by far the NFL\u2019s most-elevated venue at 5,280 feet. The height, plus the atmospheric conditions of Mexico\u2019s capital, could cause significant issues for the players. \u201cAzteca Stadium is the worst place to ever play a sporting event,\u201d former United States national team soccer star Eric Wynalda told USA TODAY Sports. Dallas Cowboys aren't just America's Team. They're Mexico's, too \u201cYou can\u2019t breathe. The pollution is so bad that if you don\u2019t have some form of rain that\u2019s brought all that down you are going to be sucking wind. \u201cThey (will) break a record for how many oxygen masks they have on the sidelines. The combination of being that high up with pollution is just devastating to the body.\u201d The U.S. soccer teams \u00a0Wynalda played on are among many sporting visitors to the venue that have struggled desperately. The altitude of Mexico City, added to the smog that accumulates in the bowl-like natural topography that surrounds it, gives home teams a huge advantage. Both the Raiders and Texans are in the same position of unfamiliarity, \u00a0each being coy on the measures they are using\u00a0to combat the elements. Local sports medicine and respiration doctor Jorge Avendano Reyes warned that the players are in for a rough ride. \u201cThere can be headaches, dizziness, sensation of fatigue, accelerated heartbeat, hyperventilation,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cWe can also have respiratory symptoms, when we are exposed often to the pollution. Raiders' Marquette King punts, dances, has fun \u201cThe amount of oxygen that reaches the cells decreases, leading to the faster heartbeat and cardiac activity. The body tries to ventilate more quickly.\u201d The Azteca is an iconic venue in Mexico, \u00a0the only stadium to have hosted two soccer World Cup finals. Teams familiar with the surroundings\u00a0claim that the complaints of visitors are nothing but sour grapes. Yet science suggests otherwise. Reyes said bigger players such as linemen would find things more testing than leaner athletes, while adding that typical oxygen masks may do little to help aid respiration. \u201cWe\u2019re on an equal playing field,\u201d Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown said. \u201cNo one\u2019s more used to the altitude than the other team, so we\u2019re all going out there with the same struggle, if there will be a struggle.\u201d Some players believe the slower pace of American football, rather than the constant movement of soccer, may help lessen the effects. Wynalda disagrees. \u201cYou don\u2019t really feel it until you stop and when your heart starts to beat and tries to slow down,\u201d Wynalda said. \u201cYou just have these moments where you click out. You almost feel like you are going to pass out. The players stop for a second, you try to catch your breath, and then it is almost like you\u2019ve just had a very long blink, and something bad happens. \u201cFor American football I really am curious to see how these guys handle it. It is going to have a massive effect on their body. These are some big bodies out there, 300 pounds\u00a0people who are trying to get oxygen into their muscles and to their brains. I think you will see a lot of delay of game penalties.\u201d Conventional wisdom suggests that teams should either come in two weeks early to allow the body to adapt to the conditions \u2013 or very late to reduce the amount of time for the elements to make an impact. Given that the former option was impossible, both teams were due to arrive on Sunday. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

By Amy B Wang November 20 at 3:38 PM Follow @amybwang \u00a0 Will Trump allow waterboarding? \"We're\u00a0going to have a president who will never say what we'll never do,\" says Gov. Mike Pence. pic.twitter.com/GuFaQPXM8q \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) November 20, 2016 In his first round of Sunday show interviews since the election, Vice President-elect Mike Pence did not rule out the possibility that President-elect Donald Trump could reinstate waterboarding as an interrogation technique during his administration. On CBS Sunday, \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson brought up Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)\u00a0and his comments Saturday at the Halifax International Security Forum. At a panel discussion there, McCain vehemently insisted that any attempt to bring back waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would be quickly challenged in court, the Associated Press reported . Dickerson pointed out to Pence that Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), whom Trump plans to nominate as director of the CIA , supports Trump's position that perhaps waterboarding should be reinstated. Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus on Nov. 20 defended Trump's picks for his incoming administration. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Dickerson then played a clip of\u00a0McCain's remarks at the Halifax summit from Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do. We will not waterboard. We will not torture,\u201d McCain said, emphasizing certain words with a point of his finger, to applause. \u201cMy God, what does it say about America if we're going to inflict torture on people?\u201d Pence seemed unfazed after he watched the video. \u201cWell, I have great respect for Senator McCain,\u201d he told Dickerson. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that going forward, as he outlined in that famous speech in Ohio, is that a President Donald Trump is going to focus on confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism\u00a0as a threat to this country.\u201d \u201cWe're going to have a president again who will never say what we'll never do,\u201d Pence added. [ Trump\u2019s CIA pick is seen as both a fierce partisan and serious student of national security issues ] Trump said during the campaign that he would reinstate the use of waterboarding against terrorism suspects \u2014 a practice that Congress made illegal after its use during the George W. Bush administration. Torture is banned under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. On Jan. 22, 2009, newly elected President Obama signed three executive orders \u00a0that reversed Bush administration policies on the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists. One of the orders, signed two days after Obama took office, banned the use of waterboarding and other methods he called torture. \"First, I can say without exception or equivocation that the United States will not torture,\" Obama said at a press conference about the executive orders. He added that \"America's moral example must be the bedrock and beacon of our global leadership.\" The Bush administration and the CIA had previously denied torturing detainees. In a 2009 report by The Washington Post , then outgoing CIA director Michael V. Hayden said that waterboarding was used only on three high-level al-Qaeda operatives, all before 2004. At a rally last November in Columbus, Ohio, Trump promised to reinstate waterboarding\u00a0and perhaps other methods of torture beyond it. \u201cWould I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would \u2014 in a heartbeat,\u201d Trump said as the crowd cheered . \u201cAnd I would approve more than that. Don't kid yourself, folks. It works, okay? It works.\u00a0Only a stupid person would say it doesn't work.\u201d Trump repeated \u201cIt works\u201d multiple times. \u201cBelieve me, it works,\u201d he told the Columbus crowd. \u201cAnd you know what? If it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway, for what they're doing. It works.\u201d Trump doubled down on his pledge to bring back waterboarding at another rally a few months later in South Carolina , as well as in several interviews throughout the campaign. However, former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) said after the election that Trump\u2019s waterboarding remarks were just \u201ccampaign talk ,\u201d according to CNN . McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has for decades spoken out against extreme interrogation techniques. In an account first published in the May 14, 1973 issue of U.S. News & World Report , McCain described being tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. Among other cruelties, he recounted being beaten every two to three hours until his left arm was broken and his ribs were cracked. After four days, McCain\u00a0said he at last gave in and signed a \"confession\" to crimes he had committed against the North Vietnamese people. \"I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point,\" he wrote. \"I had reached mine.\" In a 2011 guest column for The Post , McCain wrote that information gathered from those tortured is not always reliable, and that use torture could put future American prisoners of war at greater danger: I know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners sometimes produces good intelligence but often produces bad intelligence because under torture a person will say anything he thinks his captors want to hear \u2014 true or false \u2014 if he believes it will relieve his suffering. Often, information provided to stop the torture is deliberately misleading. Mistreatment of enemy prisoners endangers our own troops, who might someday be held captive. While some enemies, and al-Qaeda surely, will never be bound by the principle of reciprocity, we should have concern for those Americans captured by more conventional enemies, if not in this war then in the next. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of Trump's many opponents during the Republican presidential primary race, followed Pence on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and said he agreed with McCain. \u201cWe should telegraph to the world that we're better than this,\u201d Paul told Dickerson. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Pence also appeared on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d where the issue of waterboarding did not come up. Host Chris Wallace raised increasing criticism \u00a0\u201cfrom all sides\u201d about Trump and his potential conflicts of interest. [ How President Trump could use the White House to enrich himself and his family ] Already there have been numerous reports of such potential conflicts. Some have expressed concern that Trump's many hotels, condos and golf courses could be venues through which people could curry favor with the incoming president. Last week, dozens of\u00a0foreign diplomats gathered at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and at least one said that not staying at the hotel might be considered \u201crude,\u201d The Post Washington reported . Pictures showing that Trump's daughter Ivanka was present at a meeting last week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also raised questions about the separation between the Trump administration and his business dealings. Trump has said that three of his adult children, including Ivanka, will take over his businesses after he assumes office, and that they have not requested high-level governmental security clearances. [ Why Donald Trump\u2019s family being in the White House is problematic, explained ] The New York Times also reported that Trump met last week with Indian business partners who are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex near Mumbai. Wallace asked Pence whether anyone seeking to win favor with Trump could do so through a deal with the Trump Organization. Pence brushed aside the possibility. \u201cI\u2019m very confident working with the best legal minds in the country the president-elect and his family will create the proper separation,\u201d he told Wallace.

Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog The Bears weren\u2019t expected to beat the Giants at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, except according to the insane. The Giants came in with four straight wins. They\u2019ve proven to be a contender for the NFC East title and the postseason. The Bears came in with four losses in their last five games. They\u2019ve proven to be a contender for the first overall draft choice. What\u2019s more, the Bears were going to play without Alshon Jeffery because of the wide receiver\u2019s stupidity when it came to taking supplements. That left John Fox \u2019s team searching for players who could make something happen. Fox\u2019s offense, the one he said was still here no matter that Adam Gase went to Miami, needed playmakers. Or perhaps Fox\u2019s offense needed a playcaller to find the playmakers if they existed in more than someone\u2019s fantasy or bad coaching. The Bears fell to 2-8 after losing 22-16 to the New York Giants. A late interception by Jay Cutler in the fourth quarter iced the game for the Giants. Leonard Floyd, the Bears' first-round draft pick from Georgia, was removed from the field on a stretcher with 5:53 to go in the game. The entire... (Chicago Tribune staff) As that search for playmakers occurred, and as that search continues to occur this season, let\u2019s remember that Fox wanted productive tight end Martellus Bennett traded because Fox apparently doesn\u2019t like or can\u2019t coach players with personalities, maybe both. Whatever the case, the point is that Fox has a pattern of neutering the Bears offense of talent, a self-inflicted wound that can\u2019t be dismissed because of injuries. In fact, because of injuries, Fox\u2019s stubbornness and inflexibity that have led to a pathetic record becomes more acute. It certainly became more acute still when injury-prone tight end Zach Miller limped off the field before halftime with a foot problem that prevented him from finishing the game, costing Jay Cutler his most productive target in the first half. That\u2019s highlighted just one of the many holes the Bears created for themselves in offensive talent and depth. Somebody wanted guard-center Matt Slauson cut from an offensive line that Slauson proved he could lead. Maybe it wasn\u2019t Fox, but he certainly could\u2019ve stopped that decision because he seems to be making more than his share of personnel decisions on offense, and finding some reason for his continuing to do that is painful and difficult. If you want to argue that Brandon Marshall had to go because the franchise bosses said so, then fine. Explain why Jeffery isn\u2019t a No. 1 receiver when everybody\u2019s double-teaming him. Bears right guard Kyle Long will require two surgeries before he gets back into football action. Long will undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his right ankle suffered last Sunday in the loss at Tampa. The surgery isn\u2019t considered serious and it will be done before Long has surgery to... Bears right guard Kyle Long will require two surgeries before he gets back into football action. Long will undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his right ankle suffered last Sunday in the loss at Tampa. The surgery isn\u2019t considered serious and it will be done before Long has surgery to... (Brad Biggs) If you want to argue that Matt Forte could leave because the running backs by committee could cover it, then fine. Explain why none of them can catch the ball out of the backfield as well as Forte. Or at all. A couple painful examples were Jordan Howard \u2019s consecutive drops in the flat in the fourth quarter. Howard dropped passes all over the place. For all his talents as a runner, be has been exposed as a lousy pass catcher. But before that, bad coaching hurt an offense that needs every bit of smarts it can find. The Bears defense had just forced the Giants to punt, so the offense took over with 12:49 to go and trailing by just six points. A TD and an extra point would\u2019ve given the Bears the lead, if not the win. More than 12 minutes remained. That\u2019s plenty of time. That\u2019s certainly plenty of time to concentrate on running the ball to make it easier on the offensive line that was finding different bodies in different positions. But interim offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains, who must have a bonus clause for abandoning the run at the worst time, called a pass play that the Giants turned into a sack in the shadow of the Bears goal posts. So there you go: A head coach neutering the offense of talent, which neuters the roster\u2019s depth, compounded by an offensive coordinator who doesn\u2019t seem to know what kind of roster and game he has in front of him. You can argue that it was close down to the end. That would only make a sucker believe the Bears have something going on offense. They don\u2019t. And they might never if Fox continues to make offensive roster decisions. ",

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Donald Trump's pick to be U.S. attorney general, speaks to reporters at Trump Tower on Thursday. As a sitting senator, Sessions may have a leg up on his confirmation. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Donald Trump's pick to be U.S. attorney general, speaks to reporters at Trump Tower on Thursday. As a sitting senator, Sessions may have a leg up on his confirmation. (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press) Noah Bierman Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump won election by torching every rule in the political book, calling government officials \u201cvery, very stupid\u201d and promising to hire the best people to fulfill \u201cevery dream you\u2019ve ever dreamed.\u201d Now, as Trump assembles his governing team, he and the Republican-controlled Senate are facing their first test of what that means, and whether the old confirmation rules \u2014\u00a0where those serving the president are subject to intense scrutiny over past comments, deeds and potential conflicts of interest \u2014\u00a0still apply. Republican senators already have begun to debate how much leeway to give Trump, and which, if any, battles\u00a0to fight with a leader who ran against both Washington and the Republican Party that many of them continue to revere. The GOP will hold a narrow majority in the Senate when Trump takes office in January. Nominees no longer need 60 votes to win approval, except to the Supreme Court, thanks to rule changes Democrats made in 2013 to make confirmations easier. Even though Trump\u2019s nominees can win confirmation without Democrats, they can only afford two Republican defections to secure victory\u00a0if Democrats are united. That places extraordinary power \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0pressure \u2014\u00a0on Republicans who choose to dissent from Trump, should they decide to do so. President-elect Donald Trump began filling his Cabinet on Friday with stalwarts of the right, signaling with a trio of top national security and law enforcement selections\u00a0that he will aggressively pursue promises he made\u00a0during the campaign that have caused deep anxiety among immigrant and Muslim... President-elect Donald Trump began filling his Cabinet on Friday with stalwarts of the right, signaling with a trio of top national security and law enforcement selections\u00a0that he will aggressively pursue promises he made\u00a0during the campaign that have caused deep anxiety among immigrant and Muslim... (Evan Halper and David S. Cloud) The risks are many. Voters who backed Trump, having chosen the ultimate outsider, may want more of the same from the people leading government agencies. And\u00a0Trump showed during the election that crossing him invites retribution that could exact\u00a0a large political price among Republican voters.\u00a0 Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), selected Friday as attorney general, was rejected by the Senate for a federal judgeship in 1986 over accusations of racism and is the Senate\u2019s leading immigration hard-liner. As a sitting senator, however, he likely has a leg up in winning confirmation from his colleagues, but that\u00a0is not a sure thing. Two of Trump\u2019s leading candidates for secretary of State, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton,\u00a0could also face opposition. Kentucky Rep. Sen. Rand Paul, an early GOP opponent of Trump\u2019s, took a public step last week in declaring\u00a0opposition to both men\u00a0because they supported the war in Iraq. Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisors, also faces scrutiny for his work on behalf of foreign governments and an Iranian opposition group that was officially designated as a terrorist organization at the time Giuliani represented them. Most Republicans have yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s future picks, particularly as many names remain in the talking stages. Still, they have urged Trump not to defy all convention, pointing to the complexity of leading government agencies. \u201cThey\u2019re large. They\u2019re bulky. They\u2019re complicated,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican. \u201cIt takes a little bit of time to get up to speed on them.\u201d \u201cI would hope that he\u2019s not just trying to pick different people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to pick competent people.\u201d Some Democrats believe Trump will flood the Senate with so many controversial picks that lawmakers will be forced to accept some who would ordinarily provoke a fight. \u201cThey\u2019re going to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the Senate,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former Democratic leadership aide. Manley named several Republicans, including Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, who might join Democrats in opposition to some of Trump\u2019s picks. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a conservative Republican who was one of Trump\u2019s most high-profile critics during the campaign, might also be a target for Democratic alliances. But Manley\u00a0did not believe they could count on more than a few battles. Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis\u00a0who specializes in Congress, agreed. When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jagged exclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats . Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewer House seats and perhaps a dozen fewer governors than in 2009, during President Obama \u2019s first... When Hillary Clinton lost her White House bid, it was a jagged exclamation mark punctuating several painful years for Democrats . Come January, the party will have at least 11 fewer U.S. senators, 63 fewer House seats and perhaps a dozen fewer governors than in 2009, during President Obama \u2019s first... (Mark Z. Barabak) \u201cI don\u2019t think any of those Republican senators are going to make opposition to Trump nominees a habit,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThey are going to be very selective.\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who shares Paul\u2019s skepticism of domestic spying programs and other instruments of the war on terror, predicted an alliance between him and Paul could pose a hurdle to some of Trump\u2019s plans. \u201cRegistries of Muslims \u2026 constitutional values,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cWhat the Senate has historically said is you get beyond partisanship.\u201d\u00a0 But Paul drew an immediate rebuke from one of\u00a0his colleagues. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, another Republican who waged a short bid for the presidency and was critical of Trump during the campaign, said Paul has little influence in the Senate. \u201cThe fact that Rand Paul doesn\u2019t like either one of them helps me reach my decision,\u201d Graham said of Giuliani and Bolton. Trump\u2019s selections deserve the benefit of the doubt if they are qualified, Graham said. He pointed to some of President Obama\u2019s choices for Supreme Court and key Cabinet posts who earned his vote, despite ideological differences, because they met the qualification test. So far, Graham said Thursday, there is no one being talked about by Trump whom he could not stomach. Graham even offered unsolicited praise for Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s 35-year-old son-in-law, who would face potential problems with anti-nepotism laws and conflicts of interests should he serve in the White House. \u201cIf his son-in-law is a valued advisor, I\u2019m all for his son-in-law helping him be a good president,\u201d\u00a0he said. Trump\u2019s selection Friday of Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.)\u00a0to lead the CIA is an example of a sharply ideological nominee whose credentials are not likely to be questioned. The former Army officer, a Harvard Law School graduate, was one of the most relentless critics of the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the 2012 assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound\u00a0in Benghazi, Libya,\u00a0an issue that united Republican partisans\u00a0even as it infuriated Democrats. Trump may reserve his most controversial choices for slots that do not require Senate confirmation. One of Trump\u2019s first selections, Steve Bannon for a lead White House advisory role, has immediately put Democrats on edge and made some Republicans uncomfortable\u00a0because he has been accused of promoting white nationalism. Ret. Army\u00a0Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for national security advisor, has made\u00a0inflammatory comments about Muslims. He also has drawn fire for\u00a0his role as a paid lobbyist for foreign clients. Both have been chosen for jobs on which the Senate has no say.\u00a0 Democrats see Bannon as an ominous sign that Trump will not make efforts to modify the sharp rhetoric and racially charged campaign promises he made before the election. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who lost his bid for the vice presidency with Trump\u2019s election, said he did not want to prejudge Trump\u2019s other choices. But like many Democrats, he was eager to throw the spotlight on Bannon. \u201cWe should never normalize connections to anti-Semitism\u00a0or white nationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to continue to make sure that we talk about because that shouldn\u2019t be a one-day news story and then, \u2018Well, OK, that\u2019s the new normal.\u2019\u201d Still, it is unwise to underestimate how senatorial egos can ensure that few, if any nominees emerge from the confirmation process without at least a few blisters. Even administrations with more expertise and preparation than Trump\u2019s have faced excruciating battles, and losses, from those in their own party. Obama wanted former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)\u00a0to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, but withdrew the nomination, despite holding a big Senate majority, because Daschle had underpaid income taxes. President George W. Bush had to withdraw Harriet Miers\u2019 nomination to the Supreme Court, despite GOP control of the Senate, in part because senators thought she lacked relevant experience and was too much of a presidential crony. President Bill Clinton dropped two picks for attorney general after news surfaced that they had employed nannies who came to the country illegally. And President George H.W. Bush suffered a big defeat his first year when the Senate rejected his nomination of former Sen. John G. Tower of Texas to be secretary of Defense. Bush underestimated the number of senators whom Tower had alienated over the years, and allegations of drunkenness and multiple affairs led to his rejection, 53 to\u00a047.

Merkel is the leader of the conservative German Christian Democrats party. Carsten Koall/Getty Images German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she'll seek another term in the office she's held since 2005, holding a news conference Sunday that ends speculation at a time of intense change in the European Union. Merkel, 62, made it official in a news conference held by her party, the Christian Democratic Union. \"I told the CDU that I was ready to stand again,\" she said,\" according to Deutsche Welle . \"This election will be even more difficult than those we have had before as we are facing a strong polarization.\" Those words echo what Merkel said this past week , when President Obama paid his final visit both to Germany, the country he visited as a candidate, and to Merkel, the only leader of a major Western power who was in office when Obama was elected. Merkel and Obama spoke about the need to find unity, and to reach those who've been marginalized by political and economic change. Merkel said: \"Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together; trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days \u2014 trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place. \"But those that belong purportedly to certain groups say, 'We are the people, and not the others' \u2014 that is something that we cannot allow to happen.\" Article continues after sponsorship The sentiment exists both in Germany and beyond \u2014 and it's up to world leaders to answer the question, she said.

USA TODAY NETWORK Donald Trump has doubled down on his feuds with the cast of 'Hamilton' and 'Saturday Night Live.' (Photo: NBC/Getty Images) President-elect Donald Trump isn't done bashing Hamilton \u2014 at least not until the Sunday morning talk shows are done taping or perhaps the country has forgotten about the $25 million he paid to settle the Trump University fraud case on Friday, whichever comes first. The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior And on Sunday morning, he renewed his feud with Saturday Night Live and Alec Baldwin , who returned for the cold open of this week's show, playing him as weary of the transition and nervous about taking office. \"I watched parts of Saturday Night Live last night,\" he tweeted. \"It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" Baldwin wasn't having it, reminding the president-elect that we've entered the next stage, where presidential actions count more than words. \"Equal time?

At just after midnight on Election Day, panicked immigration rights activists gathered for a conference call to strategize. A few days later, more than 80 representatives of 57 progressive groups convened in the offices of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights in Washington. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mood was intense, angry and unforgiving, according to people who attended the confidential organizing session, which included representatives from labor, environmental groups, immigration activists, gay rights and civil rights organizations. Jim Messina, who managed Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, offered brief remarks at the meeting, cautioning against any attempts to compromise and work with Mr. Trump. \u201cPush back at every level,\u201d Mr. Messina urged. No one in the room objected, one attendee said. Nan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, started calling law firms in Washington the day after the election, beginning the process of opposition research on Mr. Trump\u2019s likely Supreme Court nominees . Dozens of lawyers eagerly signed up for what is sure to be a heated battle over the direction of the court for a generation. Photo President Obama said he would be \u201cconstrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen.\u201d Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times \u201cThey want to get involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are worried about the new administration.\u201d Neera Tanden, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton and the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said her organization had begun hosting daily meetings and conference calls as it plots the best way to resist Mr. Trump. She called Mr. Trump\u2019s first appointments extreme and said they had helped to \u201cstiffen the spines\u201d of Democrats. And she said the election had sparked a grass-roots awakening, with largely peaceful protests across the country. Two planned rallies in Washington \u2014 one for immigration and civil rights on Jan. 14, and another focused on women the day after the inauguration \u2014 were devised mostly by social media campaigns. Activists in Washington expect hundreds of thousands of people to gather for the second rally. But Ms. Tanden warned of dangers posed by the Trump administration, and warned against treating them \u201cin normal Washington political terms.\u201d \u201cI think the issue is, we do have the makings of an administration that could do more damage to democratic norms than any presidency in my lifetime,\u201d she said. Some Democrats say they are eager for Mrs. Clinton to re-emerge after a period of recovery interrupted so far only by a speech to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund on Wednesday.

Photo Hillary Clinton supporters cheering as Mr. Obama spoke about Puerto Rico at a campaign event in Florida before the election. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Mr. Schumer has already alarmed some progressives in Washington with his talk of trying to cut deals with the new president on issues where their interests align. But he said on Friday that Democrats in the Senate would not hesitate to confront Mr. Trump. \u201cWhen he takes a divisive, nasty turn, when he just sides with special interests and gets co-opted by the Republican right, we will oppose him tooth and nail,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview. That is not nearly enough for some liberal activists, who view Mr. Trump not as a traditional policy adversary to be challenged but a fundamental threat to democracy who must be confronted and destroyed.

USA Today Network Suzanne Russell, (Bridgewater, N.J.) Courier News 8:23 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 Colleen Channer of Scotch Plains, Pamela Brug of Westfield and Amalia Duarte of Mendham prepare to protest in front of Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. (Photo: Suzanne Russell/staff photo) BEDMINSTER, N.J. \u2014\u00a0Julie Otis of Bernardsville was so proud on Nov. 8 to take her 8-year-old daughter into the voting booth with her, for what she was sure was going to be the election of the first woman president. \"And then I had to wake her up on Nov. 9 and tell her the man she understands is a bully, who says terrible things about women, has been elected and that is when we both burst into tears,\" said Otis. \"I'm so proud the first eight years of her life were under (the policies of President) Barack Obama and I had hoped that would continue.\" Trump  slams 'SNL,' doubles down on 'Hamilton' With the wind fiercely blowing and snow flurries drifting in the air, Otis was among a small, but vocal group of people, mostly women, who protested Sunday outside Trump National Golf Club on Lamington Road as\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team met throughout the day with potential cabinet members. At one point during the day, he\u00a0said it was \"OK by me\" if a boycott against the Broadway show Hamilton: An American Musical\u00a0was instituted because of a short speech Friday night by a member of the diverse cast directed toward Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was attending the performance.\u00a0According to pool reports, Trump also declined to answer questions about a proposed settlement for lawsuits involving the defunct Trump University.

After the meeting at 4:30 p.m., the two shook hands, and in response to a question from pool reporters about how the meeting went, Trump\u00a0said: \"Very well. Very good.\" When asked about how the meeting was,\u00a0Christie said: \"Great.\" Sunday's meetings were\u00a0anything but great to the small band of protesters outside the golf club.\u00a0The group was part of Action Together NJ in association with Pantsuit Nation New Jersey, which represents some individuals who, in the wake of the\u00a0presidential election, decided to channel their disappointment over the election outcome into action, according to Amie Babischkin, group administrator. The group organized Sunday's March for Women to demonstrate support against the divisiveness represented by the upcoming administration and Trump, she said. The small rally was aimed at offering unity and solidarity for all regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity. The protesters drew honks of supports from some motorists passing by on the rural\u00a0two-lane roadway with homes set far off the road. One man driving a black Volkswagen was heard yelling out \"Trump rules\" as he drove past. Protesters in front of Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. \u00a0(Photo: Suzanne Russell/staff photo) \"I think it's important that we oppose Trump at every step, otherwise we normalize his position. One of his first selections was a white nationalist. Then he's got (U.S. Sen.) Jeff Sessions, who previously said that grabbing a woman by the pussy was not a sexual assault. So he's going to be the attorney general,\" said Otis. Colleen Channer of Scotch Plains said Sessions also called a black congressman \"boy.\" \"Too racist to serve on the federal bench in 1986, but 2016, it's all good,\" said Otis, adding she wants Trump to see he does not have a mandate. \"He didn't win New Jersey. He didn't win Somerset County. Unfortunately, he did win suburban college white women, but not me. And I think it's important that we continue to make our voices heard.\" Amalia Duarte of Mendham said a lot of Facebook groups have popped up in the wake of the election results. She learned about Sunday's protest through one of the groups. Trump's turn? Republican presidents rule recessions \"I've been watching what's been happening in New York and other cities and this feels like something where I need to have my voice heard. What disturbs me about Mr. Trump is his rhetoric,\" she said. \"He talks about coming together and still is very divisive.\" Duarte said Trump started his campaign talking about immigrants as criminals and rapists, then make fun of\u00a0(U.S. Sen.) John McCain, then made fun of a reporter with a disability, then said no more Muslims should come into the country. While people can have a difference of opinion and policy, she feels that Trump has crossed a line, and she\u00a0wanted to connect with other people who feel the same way she does. Pamela Brug of Westfield, who helped organize the event, said the protest was to show Trump women have something to say and they don't agree with what he stands for. \"Our voices need to be heard. We are not going away,\" she said, adding as an African American she wants to see more movement on issues related to racial injustice. ",

Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 20, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump is greeted at the front steps of Lamington Presbyterian Church in Bedminster, N.J. Mike Segar/Reuters By Sari Horwitz November 20 at 7:28 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Job seekers, advisers and would-be allies paraded through Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., over the weekend as President-elect Donald Trump worked on filling his Cabinet. By Sunday, Marine Gen. James Mattis had emerged as a leading contender for secretary of defense. Members of the Trump team took to the Sunday talk shows. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who heads Trump\u2019s transition, and the incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks so far and elaborated on Trump\u2019s more controversial campaign promises, including the reinstatement of waterboarding and a ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump, who met Saturday with Mattis, called him \u201cthe real deal\u201d and a \u201cbrilliant, wonderful man.\u201d In a tweet early Sunday morning, Trump said \u201cGeneral James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General\u2019s General!\u201d A person familiar with transition discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that no decision has been reached about whether Mattis will join the Trump administration. Now a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, Mattis has publicly criticized Obama\u2019s defense and national security policies. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, whom Trump met with on Saturday for more than an hour, is under \u201cactive and serious consideration\u201d to serve as secretary of state, Pence said. \u201cI know the president-elect was very grateful that Governor Mitt Romney came here to New Jersey yesterday,\u201d Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe spent the better part of an hour together with him. And then I know that the two of them actually had some private time together. I would tell you that it was not only a cordial meeting but also it was a very substantive meeting.\u201d It is still an open question whether Romney, once a fierce critic of the president-elect, would be willing to serve in a Trump administration. After Trump and Pence attended services at nearby Lamington Presbyterian Church in Bedminster, they began back-to-back meetings with a dozen people, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been ousted as chairman of Trump\u2019s transition team; former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said \u201cthere definitely is a possibility\u201d that more Cabinet announcements could be made Monday. In his interview on CBS, Pence did not rule out the possibility that Trump could reinstate waterboarding as an interrogation technique against accused terrorists during his administration, a practice that Congress made illegal after its use during the George W. Bush administration. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), speaking Saturday at the Halifax International Security Forum, insisted that any attempt to bring back waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would be quickly challenged in court. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe will not torture. My God, what does it say about America if we\u2019re going to inflict torture on people?\u201d Pence said he has \u201cgreat respect for Senator McCain\u201d but added that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a president again who will never say what we\u2019ll never do.\u201d \u201cWhat I can tell you is that going forward, as he outlined in that famous speech in Ohio, is that a President Donald Trump is going to focus on confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism as a threat to this country,\u201d Pence said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff Reince Priebus on Nov. 20 defended Trump\u2019s picks for his incoming administration. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) In December, as a candidate, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country. Asked about the idea of such a ban, Priebus, who appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, said \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule out anything, but we\u2019re not going to have a registry based on a religion.\u201d Priebus was asked on another Sunday television show about a tweet in February by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom Trump has chosen as his national security adviser. Flynn tweeted \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL.\u201d \u201cIs that the official policy of the Trump administration, that fear of Muslims is rational?\u201d asked Jake Tapper, host of the CNN show. \u201cWell, of course not,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cLook, I think, in some cases, there are radical members of that religion that need to be dealt with, but certainly we make it clear that that\u2019s not a blanket statement for everyone. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to lead.\u201d Priebus also vowed that Trump\u2019s White House counsel will ensure that Trump avoids all conflicts of interest with his business ventures during his administration. Last week, Trump held a meeting at Trump Tower with three business partners building a Trump property south of Mumbai. His daughter Ivanka Trump, a vice president at the Trump Organization and one of the family members who will be in charge of Donald Trump\u2019s businesses after he takes office, attended his meeting last week with the Japanese prime minister. Tapper cited those examples and asked Priebus, \u201cAs White House chief of staff, you\u2019re supposed to look out for any political or ethical minefields. Is it seriously the position of the Trump transition team that this is not a huge cauldron of potential conflicts of interest?\u201d \u201cObviously we will comply with all those laws and we will have our White House counsel review all of these things,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWe will have every \u2018i\u2019 dotted and every \u2018t\u2019 crossed, and I can assure the American people that there wouldn\u2019t be any wrongdoing or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making.\u201d [ Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump\u2019s biggest fan ] Priebus also defended Trump\u2019 s choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general . Several minority and civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, have spoken out against the selection week, sharply criticizing Sessions and referring to accusations of racism that kept him from a federal judgeship in 1986. \u201cIt is outrageous and outright dangerous to have one of the most racist politicians in Congress, who has made it his life\u2019s mission to hurt Latinos, immigrants and African Americans, as the head of the Department of Justice,\u201d said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, a group dedicated to increasing the number of Hispanics in office. Sessions has denied that he is racist or insensitive to minorities. Priebus called such criticism \u201cvery political, very unfair\u201d during an interview with Martha Raddatz on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Priebus said that Sessions should not be judged on accusations of statements he made decades ago and called Sessions an \u201cunbelievably honest and dignified man who started his career working against George Wallace.\u201d In 1966, Sessions campaigned against Lurleen Wallace, who was running for governor to keep in place the policies of her husband, then-Gov. George Wallace, a staunch proponent of segregation. But Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming minority leader, said that Sessions \u201cis going to need a very thorough vetting.\u201d \u201cMany of those statements, they\u2019re old but they\u2019re still troubling,\u201d Schumer said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cAnd the idea that Jeff Sessions, just because he\u2019s a senator he should get through without a series of very tough questions \u2014 particularly given those early things \u2014 no way.\u201d The consideration of Mattis, who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East from 2010 to 2013, could be seen as a rebuke to President Obama. Mattis was said to have consistently pushed the military to punish Iran and its allies, including calling for more covert actions to capture and kill Iranian operatives and interdictions of Iranian warships. Former defense officials said Mattis\u2019s views on Iran caused him to fall out of favor with the Obama administration , which was negotiating the Iranian nuclear deal at the time. Mattis, who also clashed with the administration over its response to the Arab Spring and over how many troops to keep in Iraq, was forced to retire earlier than expected to clear room for his replacement at U.S. Central Command. In another development, the New York Post reported that future first lady Melania Trump and the couple\u2019s 10-year-old son, Barron, will stay in New York and not move to the White House after Donald Trump is inaugurated in January so that Barron can continue to go to his school on the Upper West Side. When Trump was asked by reporters Sunday afternoon about the story and whether Melania and Barron would join him in the White House, he said, \u201cVery soon. After he\u2019s finished with school.\u201d His spokesman, Miller, said, \u201cNo formal statement has been released yet with regard to the family and their transition plans to Washington. But the one thing I will say is that there\u2019s obviously a sensitivity to pulling their 10-year-old out of school in the middle of the school year.\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Amy B Wang, Kristine Guerra, Greg Jaffe and Missy Ryan contributed to this report.

(L'Osservatore Romano/pool photo via AP) 0 Shares Email Pope Francis says sleeping six hours \"like a log\" each night is part of his secret for managing job stress. Italian Catholic TV channel TV2000 asks Francis, in an interview being broadcast Sunday, how he manages to look \"never stressed\" even while tired and even with his 80th birthday approaching on Dec. 17. Francis jokingly asked his interviewers if they're angling for an answer like \"a special tea.\" Instead, he replied, he's helped greatly by prayer. He adds: \"Then I sleep well, thanks to the Lord. I sleep like a log,\" six hours a day. He figures sound sleep probably boosts his health. Francis says he has had some spinal column problems, but says they're resolved. He also paces himself, saying: \"I do what I can and nothing more.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy \u201cTremendous talent \u2014 we\u2019re seeing tremendous talent,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Saturday. \u201cPeople that, like I say, we will \u2018make America great again.\u2019 These are really great people. These are really, really talented people.\u201d By the evening, however, Mr. Trump had announced no appointments, leaving reporters waiting on the cold, gusty day to speculate about Mr. Trump\u2019s brief comments. \u201cWe made a couple of deals,\u201d he said mischievously as his weekend of interviews drew to a close. Mr. Giuliani is apparently in competition with several others for the secretary of state position, including David H. Petraeus, the retired four-star general who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s C.I.A. director before leaving amid revelations that he had provided classified information to a woman with whom he was having an affair. Photo Mr. Trump with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, on Sunday. Mr. Giuliani is apparently in competition with several others for the secretary of state position. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics during the 2016 campaign, met with the president-elect on Saturday. If he becomes secretary of state, he could be a moderating influence on the hard-liners Mr. Trump has chosen for attorney general, national security adviser and C.I.A. director. \u201cI can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program. Mr. Trump\u2019s consideration of General Mattis, who is widely respected throughout the military, could also signal an effort to ease concerns among members of the Washington establishment about the shape of his cabinet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story General Mattis, who led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein, later commanded American troops during the hard-fought battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in 2004. But his argument for a tougher military posture against Iran at times clashed with the views of Mr. Obama and his national security team. General Mattis, who would be the first former ranking general to become defense secretary since George Marshall in the early 1950s, would need a congressional waiver to take office because federal law stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years. General Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013. As Mr. Trump moves to complete his national security team, he may soon turn his attention to domestic affairs. Aides have said members of the transition effort\u2019s economic and domestic policy teams will fan out to meet with agency officials starting on Monday. Mr. Obama, asked Sunday at a summit meeting in Lima, Peru, about stances Mr. Trump has taken that align with the views of his nascent national security team, said: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that the president-elect won\u2019t pursue some of the positions that he\u2019s taken. But what I can guarantee is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That\u2019s just the way this office works.\u201d Mr. Trump also continued his practice of early-morning bursts on Twitter this weekend. Before attending church with Mr. Pence, Mr. Trump condemned the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d for its onstage appeal on Friday night to the vice president-elect \u2014 who was in the audience \u2014 to uphold the rights of a \u201cdiverse America.\u201d \u201cThe cast and producers of \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote . In another Twitter post , the president-elect expressed his disapproval of \u201c Saturday Night Live ,\u201d calling it a \u201ctotally one-sided, biased show \u2014 nothing funny at all.\u201d Mr. Trump was portrayed on the show as being overwhelmed by the prospect of being president. Even as Mr. Trump bemoaned the actions of the cast of \u201cHamilton,\u201d a smash hit on Broadway, Mr. Pence said on Sunday morning that he was not offended or bothered. In an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Pence said he would \u201cleave it to others\u201d to decide whether the theater was an appropriate place for a political message. \u201c\u2018Hamilton\u2019 is just an incredible production and just incredibly talented people,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIt was a real joy to be there.\u201d Michael S.

    "text": "White Nationalists Celebrate \u2018an Awakening\u2019 After Donald Trump\u2019s Victory By ALAN RAPPEPORT and NOAH WEILAND NOV. 19, 2016 Continue reading the main story Photo Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the far right, addressing a conference on Saturday in Washington. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 For years, they have lurked in the web\u2019s dark corners, masking themselves with cartoon images and writing screeds about the demise of white culture under ominous pseudonyms. But on Saturday, in the wake of Donald J. Trump \u2019s surprising election victory, hundreds of his extremist supporters converged on the capital to herald a moment of political ascendance that many had thought to be far away. In the bowels of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, three blocks from the White House, members of the so-called alt-right movement gathered for what they had supposed would be an autopsy to plot their grim future under a Clinton administration. Instead, they celebrated the unexpected march of their white nationalist ideas toward the mainstream, portraying Mr. Trump\u2019s win as validation that the tide had turned in their fight to preserve white culture. \u201cIt\u2019s been an awakening,\u201d Richard B. Spencer, who is credited with coining the term alt-right, said at the gathering on Saturday. \u201cThis is what a successful movement looks like.\u201d The movement has been critical of politicians of all stripes for promoting diversity, immigration and perceived political correctness. Its critics call it a rebranded version of the Ku Klux Klan, promoting anti-Semitism , violence and suppression of minorities. Intellectual leaders of the movement argue that they are merely trying to realize their desire for a white \u201cethno-state\u201d where they can be left alone. Mr. Trump, with his divisive language about immigrants and Muslims, has given them hope that these dreams can come true. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI never thought we would get to this point, any point close to mainstream acceptance or political influence,\u201d said Matt Forney, 28, of Chicago. \u201cThe culture is moving more in my direction.\u201d Emboldened by Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican Party, Mr. Forney said he expected people openly associated with the white nationalist movement to run as candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. The rise of populism and the decline of political correctness, he said, present a rare opportunity. Robert Taylor, 29, described the conference as a \u201cvictory party.\u201d Mr. Taylor was a committed libertarian, he said, working for Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaigns and even moving to New Hampshire for a project organized by the like-minded. If Hillary Clinton had won the election, he said, he would have advocated secession. \u201cI thought I had all the right answers and had read all the right books,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard about the alt-right movement, and it just lit a fire in me.\u201d Mr. Taylor said that with Mr. Trump, \u201cwe have breathing room; we have a little time.\u201d Mr. Trump has shrugged off any suggestions that he has connections to the alt-right. But his hard-line views on immigration and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy have captivated members of the movement. His appointment as chief strategist of Stephen K. Bannon , who has called Breitbart News, the website he long ran, a platform for the alt-right, has reinforced the notion that the incoming president is on their side. The white nationalist embrace of Mr. Trump was on display Saturday at the gathering, which was the annual conference of a group called the National Policy Institute. Guests nibbled on chicken piccata while discussing ways to reorient America\u2019s demographics. Many of the attendees, who were mostly white men, wore red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. T-shirts emblazoned with Mr. Trump\u2019s face sold quickly. While the enthusiasm inside the conference was evident, the resistance to the alt-right remains powerful. A recent surge in hate crimes and reports of verbal and physical assaults on minorities are putting new pressure on groups that promote racism. Many sites will not host their events, and some of their members have had their social media accounts suspended in response to vicious trolling of Jewish journalists and critics of Mr. Trump. A large group of protesters marched around the Ronald Reagan Building, which, as a federal property, could not decline to host the conference.

The city named the park for the late rapper, who was Jewish, in 2013. He died of cancer in 2012 at the age of 47.\u00a0 \u201cHe was also someone that taught non-violence in his music and his life,\u201d Ad-Rock said. Well over 100 people including families with young children stood together to denounce\u00a0 incidents of hate across the city and around the country since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, CBS New York reported. The playground named for Adam Yauch had been vandalized with swastikas and the words \u201cGo Trump!\u201d\u00a0 Photos show the swastika and words were spray-painted on playground equipment in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.\u00a0 . @beastieboys Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn Heights was left defaced with ugly symbols of hate today.

The playground includes basketball courts, a community garden, a greenhouse, fitness area, an open play space, drinking fountains and a dog run. During the Sunday rally, those in the crowd held signs that read \u201cracism is not welcome here\u201d and \u201cyes we care.\u201d\u00a0 Ad-Rock slammed the act for celebrating Nazi Germany. \u201cSomeone in New York City linking Nazi Germany to Donald Trump in a \u2018hell yeah\u2019 kind of way in a park where children play,\u201d he said.

Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016. Ereck Flowers doesn't blame Pernell McPhee one bit. It was perfectly clear to the Giants left tackle what McPhee was trying to do midweek when he proclaimed, \"We gonna tear their ass up\" in promising to punish quarterback Eli Manning at MetLife Stadium . \"Those guys, they've got to do something to try to get themselves going and I applaud them for that,\" Flowers said after the Giants rallied from 10 points down to defeat the Bears 22-16 Sunday, their fifth consecutive victory. \"Unfortunately, you still have to go out there and play.\" That's about the last place you want to be in the NFL with your opponent feeling sympathy for your plight. There is nothing lovable about these losers, however, as the Bears stumble along toward the finish line before they can return to the task of rebuilding the roster ... again. The Bears value McPhee for the fiery passion he brings on the field, but he made more noise Wednesday with his remarks than he did with his play Sunday. A situational player because of a knee injury that sidelined him the first six weeks, McPhee was hard to find until he knocked Manning down on a third-and-10 pass late in the fourth quarter. It forced an awkward throw along the boundary for running back Rashad Jennings that Demontre Hurst nearly picked off. If only it had led to a turnover. For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad... For eight excruciating minutes, Bears pass rusher Leonard Floyd just lay there on the field at MetLife Stadium , surrounded by doctors, coaches, players, fear and hope. With 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the Bears' 22-16 loss to the Giants on Sunday, Floyd attempted to tackle running back Rashad... (David Haugh) That one hit was about it for McPhee, who was credited with one tackle in press box statistics. The Bears failed to get a sack for just the second time this season as Manning completed 21 of 36 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns. The pass rush had been producing with nine sacks in the previous two games, a spark created by McPhee's return Oct. 20 in Green Bay. But the Giants have been doing a solid job of protecting the not-so-nimble Manning this season as they entered with only 12 sacks allowed. Perhaps McPhee would have been well served to know New York has allowed the second-fewest sacks in the NFL since the start of the 2014 season \u2014 70. Instead, he got the attention of Manning's line. \"I think somebody said something,\" center Weston Richburg said. Was No. 92 a marked man? \"I don't think we allowed sacks,\" Richburg said. \"That speaks for itself.\" Photos from the Bears-Giants game at MetLife Stadium on Nov. 20, 2016. The Bears are stumbling along, now 2-8 and off to their worst start after 10 games since 2002, when they started with an identical record and finished 4-12. Injuries continue to take a toll as four starters were knocked out with outside linebacker Leonard Floyd going to a local hospital to have a neck injury examined before traveling home with the team. Initial reports were encouraging. Tight end Zach Miller had his season ended with a broken right foot. Left guard Josh Sitton left with a right ankle injury and cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc landed in the concussion protocol. With a serious shortage of players, the Bears have no margin for error and they need to catch multiple breaks. They need to create game-changing plays and ride a wave of momentum. They failed to make that happen, and the Giants marched through them with nine- and seven-play drives in the third quarter to score a pair of touchdowns and take the lead for good. McPhee fell back on the reliable loser's lament used by pass rushers: The ball came out too quickly. If only those quarterbacks would be statues more often. \"He did a great job of getting the ball out fast,\" McPhee said. \"He did a great job of mixing up his play-calling. I think we came in prepared and ready to rush. It's just we never got him behind the chains.\" ",

Later Sunday, two other officers were wounded in incidents in Florida and Missouri. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus identified the slain officer as 20-year veteran\u00a0Detective Benjamin Marconi, 50. He\u00a0said the suspect has not yet been apprehended, and a motive is not known. McManus said\u00a0Marconi had pulled over a car\u00a0for a traffic violation outside Public Safety Headquarters in downtown. While Marconi was inside his squad car\u00a0writing a ticket, a black vehicle pulled up behind him and the driver got out, walked up to the detective\u2019s window and shot him\u00a0in the head, McManus said.\u00a0Then the suspect reached into the window and shot Marconi a second time, he said.

Obama urged his fellow Democrats to try to work with Trump's team if what it's doing is good for the country. But he cautioned that if the Trump administration begins to attack American values, he might be compelled to speak up, and so would the Democratic Party. \"As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes,\" he said. Speaking at a news conference at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, Obama \u2014 on his last foreign tour \u2014 was at times reflective and humorous, candidly discussing his views on the United States' position as a world leader and touching on the strife within his own party.

Obama said he was \"very clear about the strong differences we had on policy.\" \"The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us,\" he said. Instead, Obama said, he focused on the \"bloodshed and chaos\" that has destroyed Aleppo and bolstered the Assad regime, and he reiterated the need to arrive at a humanitarian cease-fire in Syria.

But to Syrian refugees, she is an unlikely champion. Milana Vayntrub as Lily for AT&amp;T AT&amp;T Milana Vayntrub, who plays the popular ad character, is trying to mobilize the world to help a group of people she barely knows \u2014 but with whom she has an emotional connection. To that end, the Los Angeles-based actress has set up a website with the ironic name of Can't Do Nothing that has already raised thousands of dollars for refugee relief and convinced more than a million people to join her efforts by giving their time or money. Related: Bombing in Syria's Aleppo Kills 20, Knocks More Hospitals Out of Service With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to block Syrians from the United States, Vayntrub says there's even more need to \"do something now.\" \"I think a lot of Americans forget that they are not originally from here, that somebody in their past was a refugee,\" she told NBC News. Vayntrub, who is Jewish, would know. She was 2 when her family fled religious persecution in the former Soviet Union and started a new life in Los Angeles. But the escaping Jews back then did not face the strident opposition the Syrians face now. And Vayntrub said her inbox is often jammed with angry emails from Trump supporters and others. \"If this election has shown us anything it's that this country is divided into two groups that don't understand each other,\" she said. Vayntrub also admitted that she's gotten pushback from her father, Alexander, who she says is \"not so keen\" about what she is doing. \"He's got conflicting perspectives of Muslims,\" she said. \"He understands that refugees are not so different from us. But he also has a lot of fear.\" Play Stunning Video Shows Rescuers Rushing to Save Children From Rubble 0:57 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161121050323if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/813235779946\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> In 1989, the Vayntrubs were part of the wave of Jews who fled the Soviet Union for the west. They were from Uzbekistan, then a mostly-Muslim Soviet Republic two years away from declaring independence from Moscow. \"There was a lot of discrimination against the Jews at that time,\" she said. \"Both my parents were born there but we were considered outsiders. We had some family in LA who offered to help us get there. So when they got the chance to leave, my parents took it.\" One of their first stops was a refugee camp in Ladispoli, Italy, where the toddler made her television debut when a FOX News reporter asked her where she was headed. \"America,\" she said, nestled in her father's arms. And off to America they went. The family settled in West Hollywood where she grew up \"feeling like an American.\" At age five, Vayntrub got her start in show business appearing in Mattel Barbie commercials. Later, she joined the Upright Citizens Brigade, an improv comedy group, and began landing parts in movies like \"Life Happens\" and the TV show \"Silicon Valley.\" She also helped launch the YouTube comedy channel Live Prude Girls that made her an indie darling. Then in November 2013, AT&T picked Vayntrub to be their Lily. It was in January, while on a vacation in Greece with her dad, that Vayntrub stumbled across her cause. Thousands of Syrians, desperate to escape the brutal civil war tearing their country apart, were arriving by the raft-full on the island of Lesbos. Volunteers help migrants and refugees on a dingy as they arrive at the shore of the northeastern Greek island of Lesbos, after crossing the Aegean sea from Turkey on March 20, 2016. Petros Giannakouris / AP Moved by their plight, Vayntrub canceled her flight home and headed there to document the unfolding tragedy. \"I didn't know what I could do but I knew I couldn't sit idly by,\" she said in the video on her site. \"I do know what it's like to be an outsider.\" Vayntrub admits that until she saw first hand what was happening, the Syrian refugee crisis had not been on her radar. And when she realized the enormity of the tragedy, \"I felt pretty helpless.\" So once she was back home, Vayntrub got busy and launched Can't Do Nothing. \"It's been a tremendous help to us,\" said Lexi Shereshewsky, executive director of The Syria Fund. \"It's raised thousands of dollars in donations for our organization. And it's brought in a whole new community of people willing to get involved.\" Asked who Vayntrub is reaching, Shereshewsky said \"I imagine it's a millennial audience.\" Sergie Attar of the Chicago-based Karam Foundation, another nonprofit that aids Syrian refugees, agreed. She said what Vayntrub is doing is even more vital now that Trump is president-elect. Vayntrub said she has heard from a few Syrians in the U.S., but is pretty sure the greater diaspora has no idea who she is or what she has been doing \u2014 and that \"it really doesn't matter.\" \"Refugees don't know the AT&T girl,\" she said. \"It's not a part of their reality. It's a totally different world.\" Corky Siemaszko ",

(Photo: Special to The Register) DES MOINES \u2014 Cleo Hawthorne didn\u2019t know that he and his brother Clifford may be the oldest male twins in the world. On Tuesday, the 103-year-old got a ride from the nursing home in Atlantic to visit his ailing brother in Shady Oaks Care Center in Lake City. Clifford didn\u2019t have much time left, and they had a history together that dated back to Dec. 31, 1912. World\u2019s oldest person dies in New York at age 116 \u201cThey were identical in every way; they even went on walkers the same time a year or so ago,\u201d said Clifford\u2019s son Darrell Hawthorne of Lohrville. \u201cImagine the shock when the people at the nursing home saw him come in with his walker. There were a lot of looks.\u201d Cleo hadn\u2019t got the news sent by email to a relative. Clifford had died Monday. \u201cCleo was in total shock. He didn\u2019t want to let go,\u201d Darrell said. The brothers and family members never knew they would be the oldest twins in the world until the funeral director inquired with the Guinness World Records. Its online records list brothers Pierre and Paul Langerock of Belgium as the oldest, born July 8, 1913, when the Hawthorne boys were already 6\u00a0months old. Guinness officials said that records must be challenged and verified with records. Merrill Hawthorne said the family didn\u2019t give it a thought. The twins were born to Page and Mary Hawthorne on a farm near Prescott, Iowa, in Adams County, where the two began their century-long brotherhood. One could hardly be distinguished from the other physically, but their personalities were also similar, family members said. Soft spoken men with a gentle sense of humor. Cleo and Clifford Hawthorne of Iowa may have been the oldest living twin brothers before Clifford died Monday. In the high school photos below Clifford is on the right. \u00a0(Photo: Special to The Register) \u201cThey loved to wrestle and box with each other,\u201d said their sister Linda Key, 96, of Atlantic. \u201cAnd they liked to run around the barn throwing corn cobs at each other. I thought it was the dumbest thing. But they enjoyed each other immensely.\u201d Cleo Hawthorne said he always got along with his brother. \u201cIf we had a disagreement, Dad told us to get the boxing gloves and settle it,\u201d he said. The twins developed into fine athletes. But their father said only one at a time could play football because he needed the other to do chores, Key said. So they came to agreement. One would play one year, the other would play the next. \u201cIf we had a disagreement, Dad told us to get the boxing gloves and settle it.\u201d Cleo Hawthorne Yet they ran together on the Prescott High School track team. It was the only time Key saw their brotherly competitive spirit lead to hurtful comments, when Cleo was a bit wounded that the coach said he should try to wear out opponent runners so his brother could take the race. \u201cWe were half-milers and milers and we always ran one and two,\u201d Cleo said. The boys sold collie dogs in their formative years and worked as farmhands through the Depression, said Clifford\u2019s son Merrill Hawthorne of Lohrville. He said that as the economy worsened, his father\u2019s pay went from $40 a month, to $30 to $15. Eventually, both worked in creameries, which Merrill said kept them out of World War II because it was viewed as essential to the homeland. They held their wedding ceremonies together on Nov. 28, 1937. While Cleo went on to work in a creamery in Corning for more than 40 years, Clifford began farming outside Lohrville before retiring and moving to Farnhamville near Fort Dodge. Both lost their spouses, but family members would drive them to meet halfway between their homes for dinner. Cleo Hawthorne, left, and Clifford Hawthorne are twin brothers from Iowa who may have been the oldest in the world before Clifford's death Monday.  They are shown here at their 100th birthday party. \u00a0(Photo: Special to The Register) Yet each maintained a driver\u2019s license well into their 90s to get around town and faithfully took daily walks. \u201cThey never smoked and never got drunk,\u201d said Key. Cleo was the oldest but the two often joked that if Clifford was born a few hours later he would have been a year younger. Cleo said Thursday he was unaware of the possibility that he and his brother might have been the world's oldest twins. What he knows is that his brother of 103 years died because his body simply wore out. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too little of him the last several years because he was 100 miles away,\u201d Cleo said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss him.\u201d Follow Mike Kilen on Twitter: @mikekilen 1973 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gbbsH2 ",

Iraqi troops faced stiff resistance Saturday from Islamic State militants as they pushed deeper into eastern Mosul, backed by aerial support from the U.S.-led international coalition, a senior military commander said. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla) 0 Shares Email Iraqi troops on Sunday fortified their positions in Mosul neighborhoods retaken from the Islamic State group as their advance toward the city center was slowed by sniper fire and suicide bombings, as well as concern over the safety of civilians. \"The biggest hindrance to us is the civilians, whose presence is slowing us down,\" Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the special forces told The Associated Press. \"We are soldiers who are not trained to carry out humanitarian tasks.\" A few hundred civilians emerged from rubble-strewn front-line neighborhoods on Sunday. They included women and children, some of them carrying bags, small suitcases or waving white flags. Mosul is still home to more than 1 million people. The government sent half-dozen trucks loaded with food aid into the recently liberated areas. Chaos broke out in one neighborhood, where residents climbed on top of the trucks and began helping themselves. Women extended their hands in desperation, trying to get a share of the aid. Young boys chased the trucks and jostled and pleaded for food packages. \"It's hunger that makes people behave like this,\" said Mohammed Farouq, a 27-year-old resident. \"Some families took many boxes, while others did not take any. This is unfair.\" Fethi Mahmud Abdulla, another resident, pleaded for people to keep the lines. \"People are tired, so tired. Some of them take aid five or seven times,\" he said. Al-Aridi said his men were searching homes in areas retaken from IS, looking for militants and vehicles rigged with explosives. Troops in those areas continue to be hit by mortar rounds, sniper fire and suicide bombers, he said. In the newly liberated areas, roads are blocked by car wrecks and sandbags, and tanks are deployed on wider streets. Snipers on high buildings watch for suicide bombers or other intruders. Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil said four civilians were killed and another four wounded when a suicide car bomb exploded before it could reach the troops it was targeting late Saturday. The troops laid siege Sunday to the Al-Zohour neighborhood, about eight kilometers (five miles) from the city center. The arrival of the troops at the neighborhood's fringes prompted hundreds of civilians to emerge from their homes waving white flags. The special forces later drove IS from two other neighborhoods. The Iraqi military launched a campaign on Oct. 17 to retake Mosul, Iraq's second largest city and the extremist group's last major urban bastion in the country. Most gains have been made by the special forces operating in the section of Mosul east of the Tigris river. Other forces are advancing on the city from different directions, and the U.S.-led coalition is providing airstrikes and other support. IS captured Mosul in the summer of 2014 as part of a blitz that placed nearly a third of Iraq under their control. Iraqi troops, federal police and allied Shiite and Sunni militias have over the past year pushed IS militants from most of the vast Sunni province of Anbar, west of Baghdad, and areas to the north and east of the Iraqi capital. Army troops arrived on the outskirts of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, to reinforce state-sanctioned Shiite militias , who have captured the town's airport and are preparing to retake the town, according to two senior militia officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Prior to its capture by IS, Shiites constituted the majority of Tal Afar's estimated 200,000 residents. Human Rights Watch said in a report Sunday that Sunni militiamen fighting alongside the Iraqi military detained and beat 22 men from villages near Mosul and recruited 10 children from displaced camps in the area to join the fight against IS. \"The Iraqi authorities should investigate any alleged acts of torture and cruel and inhuman treatment in custody and charge those responsible for war crimes, including anyone with command responsibility who should have known about the crimes and failed to take all reasonable measures to prevent them,\" said the New York-based advocacy group. \"The U.S. should press the Iraqi government to ensure that the troops they are supporting don't have fighters under 18 in their ranks,\" said Lama Fakih, HRW's deputy Middle East director. In Baghdad, four separate bomb attacks targeted commercial areas on Sunday, killing at least 10 civilians and wounding 34, according to police and health officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Baghdad has for more than a decade been the scene of near daily bomb attacks blamed on IS and other Sunni militants. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for any of Sunday's attacks. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Hussein Malla in Mosul, Iraq, Sinan Salaheddin and Murtada Faraj in Baghdad contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

To see more images from the game, click on the photo above. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) Nov. 20, 2016, 4:34 p.m. Dolphins score twice in final five minutes to rally past the Rams Jared Goff \u2019s first start for the Rams was far from spectacular. There were no touchdown passes. No awe-inspiring completions. And for nearly all of Sunday\u2019s game against the Miami Dolphins, it did not appear that any would be required. But a dominant Rams defense finally wilted, giving up two touchdowns in the final five minutes of a 14-10 defeat at the Coliseum. Ryan Tannehill \u2019s touchdown passes to Jarvis Landry and DeVante Parker helped the Dolphins overcome a 10-0 deficit. The Rams got the ball back with 29 seconds left but could not advance past their 48. Goff\u2019s Hail Mary pass was knocked down in the end zone to end the game. The Rams fall to 4-6 heading into next week\u2019s game at New Orleans. The Dolphins won their fifth game in a row to improve to 6-4. Goff completed 17 of 31 passes for 134 yards. Rams running back Todd Gurley rushed for 75 yards in 20 carries, including a 24-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Tannehill completed 24 of 34 passes for 172 yards and two touchdowns, with an interception. Miami running back Jay Ajayi rushed for 77 yards in 16 carries. Goff did not start fast. On the first play of the first series, the Rams were called for a false start penalty. Goff\u2019s first pass was tipped, and on third down he was slammed to the turf after throwing away a pass. But the second series went more smoothly. After the Dolphins were called for a facemask penalty, Goff completed a short pass to rookie tight end Tyler Higbee and then threw a strike to receiver Kenny Britt for a 19-yard gain to the Dolphins\u2019 24. On the next play, Gurley took a hand off and ran off-tackle for the touchdown and a 7-0 lead. It was Gurley\u2019s longest run of the season. The Rams added a field goal by Greg Zuerlein in the third quarter, but Zuerlein\u2019s 48-yard attempt in the fourth quarter hit the upright. The miss came after Rams Coach Jeff Fisher opted to try a field goal rather than going for it on fourth and one at the Dolphins\u2019 30. Nov. 20, 2016, 4:28 p.m. Dolphins come from behind to defeat Rams, 14-10 It came down to the rookie quarterback. The Rams, down by four, started on their 41-yard line and needed a touchdown.\u00a0 Jared\u00a0Goff completed a seven-yard pass to Kenny Britt before throwing two incomplete passes. Goff tried a Hail Mary pass on the final play. It fell incomplete. That's the ballgame.\u00a0 Nov. 20, 2016, 4:22 p.m. The Dolphins lead the Rams, 14-10, in the fourth quarter With 36 seconds remaining in the game, Ryan Tannehill completed a nine-yard pass to DeVante Parker for a touchdown. The Dolphins lead the Rams, 14-10.\u00a0 Tannehill completed a 15-yard pass to Kenny Stills, and Aaron\u00a0Donald was called for roughing the passer after a slight shove. Jay Ajayi\u00a0was tackled for a two-yard loss before Parker caught consecutive passes for 12 and nine yards. Ajayi then rushed for 17 yards in consecutive carries. The Rams' defense has played great, but even they are susceptible to giving up some points. Nov. 20, 2016, 4:11 p.m. The Rams' defense must hold to win this game Jared Goff took a hit as he delivered a six-yard pass to Brian Quick , four yards short of a first down.\u00a0 Johnny Hekker booted a 44-yard punt, and the Dolphins will have the ball at their 25-yard line.\u00a0 Todd Gurley rushed for five\u00a0yards before Lance Kendricks was called for a false start on second down to back the Rams up. Facing second and 10, Gurley was tackled at the line of scrimmage. Nov. 20, 2016, 4:05 p.m. Dolphins cut the Rams' lead to 10-7 late in the fourth quarter Lindsey Thiry Jarvis Landry caught a short pass\u00a0at the Rams' five-yard line, was getting wrapped up, and then his offensive line pushed him all the way into the end zone for a touchdown. The Rams lead the Dolphins, 10-7, with 4:02 left in the game. The scoring drive covered 77 yards in eight plays and took 2:38. Ryan Tannehill completed consecutive passes for\u00a015 and 12 yards to DeVante Parker.\u00a0 The Dolphins also picked up extra yards when Alec Ogletree was called for a personal foul for a late hit on Landry out of bounds, after Landry caught a five-yard pass for the Dolphins' first third-down conversion of the game. Nov. 20, 2016, 3:57 p.m. Greg Zuerlein misses a 48-yard field-goal attempt Lindsey Thiry Greg Zuerlein's\u00a048-yard field-goal attempt hit the upright and was no good. The Dolphins took over at their 23-yard line after they picked up a 10-yard penalty during the field-goal attempt. Jared Goff completed three passes during the drive, including a seven-yard pass to Kenny Britt, a three-yard pass to Lance Kendricks for a first down and a six-yard pass to Britt. The Rams are two for 10 on third down. Nov. 20, 2016, 3:46 p.m. Dominique Easley sacks Ryan Tannehill Dominique Easley sacked Ryan Tannehill\u00a0for a second time, and the Dolphins punted for a 10th time. The Rams' defense has been outstanding. The Dolphins are zero for 10 on third down.\u00a0 Mark Barron nearly picked off Tannehill on second down. It was one of several near-interceptions this afternoon for the Rams' secondary. (Maurice Alexander did intercept Tannehill in the third quarter.) The Dolphins have 118 total yards, and the rain continues to fall at the Coliseum. Nov. 20, 2016, 3:41 p.m. Rams punt as they struggle on third down Jared Goff scrambled for four yards, and the Rams' sideline erupted watching the rookie quarterback's effort on third down ... but the play was called back as Greg Robinson was called for holding. The series resulted in a three and out.\u00a0 The Rams' offensive woes continue, but the unit\u00a0has shown the slightest improvement.\u00a0 Nov. 20, 2016, 3:37 p.m. Rams' defense continues to make it difficult on Dolphins The Dolphins punted, again. The Rams' defense has played great. Also, the Dolphins' offense looks terrible. Jay Ajayi was tackled at the line of scrimmage, Dominique Easley\u00a0sacked Ryan Tannehill and Tannehill's third-down pass was thrown \u2014\u00a0complete \u2014\u00a0far short of the first-down marker before Trumaine Johnson tackled DeVante Parker. The Rams and Dolphins are a combined one for 17 on third-down conversions. (That's not good.) Nov. 20, 2016, 3:29 p.m. Rams lead the Dolphins, 10-0, in the third quarter Finally, more points!\u00a0 If only three of them. Greg Zuerlein kicked a 46-yard field goal, and the Rams lead the Dolphins, 10-0, in the third quarter.\u00a0 No points had been scored since early in the first quarter. The scoring drive covered 49 yards in 10 plays and took 6:05. Todd Gurley continues to get chances carrying the ball.\u00a0He rushed for 14 yards in three carries to start the drive before Tavon\u00a0 Austin caught a 28-yard pass. Pharoh Cooper made his first reception of the game, catching about a nine-yard pass from Jared Goff and then fighting for an extra yard to pick up the first down. Then, Goff scrambled for six yards, and two plays later, after the Rams\u00a0were called for an illegal snap, the rookie quarterback managed to avoid a few defenders to keep the Rams\u00a0within field-goal range. Nov. 20, 2016, 3:15 p.m. The Rams' defense continues to shut down the Dolphins Lindsey Thiry DeVante Parker looked like he made a spectacular circus\u00a0catch, but it was ruled incomplete. The Dolphins challenged the call, but it stood, and they punted for an eighth time. Eight of Miami's nine series have ended in punts;\u00a0the ninth was an interception made by Maurice Alexander. The Rams' defense has had an outstanding day, holding the Dolphins to 130 total yards. If only the offense could produce more points ... and yards. The Rams\u00a0have 128 total yards of offense.\u00a0 Rams injury update: Linebacker Josh Forrest is out for the game.\u00a0 Nov. 20, 2016, 3:09 p.m. Maurice Alexander intercepts Ryan Tannehill What a wild turn of events ... that resulted in a Rams punt. Go figure. Lance Kendricks caught a 10-yard pass, fumbled and the Dolphins recovered at the Rams' 37-yard line. Next play, Maurice Alexander intercepted Ryan Tannehill in the end zone and the Rams started\u00a0at their 20-yard line. After a couple of long carries in the first half, the Rams have been unable to spring Todd Gurley for another big one. However, a questionable penalty against the Dolphins \u2014\u00a0pass interference \u2014\u00a0on third down helped the Rams\u00a0move down the field. But the drive quickly stalled. Benny Cunningham rushed for one yard, Jared Goff's pass through the middle to Gurley fell incomplete and Kendricks dropped a third-down pass.\u00a0 Nov. 20, 2016, 2:53 p.m. Dolphins go three and out to start second half T.J. McDonald intercepted Ryan Tannehill... until he didn't. McDonald dropped the pass, but nevertheless, the Dolphins punted. Aaron Donald tackled Jay Ajayi\u00a0for a two-yard loss, and Tannehill completed a five-yard pass to MarQueis Gray. Strong start for the Rams in the second half. Nov. 20, 2016, 2:34 p.m. Rams lead Dolphins, 7-0, at halftime Alec Ogletree and Mark Barron wrapped up Jay Ajayi on third down to force the Dolphins to punt for a sixth time.\u00a0 Dion Sims caught a four-yard pass before Robert Quinn was called offsides.\u00a0 The next play, Quinn atoned for the penalty and sacked Ryan Tannehill. The Dolphins were unable to work their way out of the second and 20 situation. \u00a0 Nov. 20, 2016, 2:26 p.m. Jared Goff sacked for the first time, Rams punt Jared Goff thought he avoided one sack, then another, before boom \u2014\u00a0two Dolphins players wrapped him up for a nine-yard loss. Johnny Hekker\u00a0punted. Goff completed a 20-yard pass to Lance Kendricks to convert on third down for the first time in six tries.\u00a0 Goff was nearly intercepted two plays later, throwing a 50-50 ball to Tavon Austin on the near sideline, but it fell incomplete. Rams injury update:\u00a0Josh Forrest questionable to return because of a knee injury. Nov. 20, 2016, 2:18 p.m. The Dolphins punt for a fifth time T.J. McDonald leveled Ryan Tannehill\u00a0as his pass fell incomplete and the Dolphins punted for a fifth time. The Dolphins are 0-for-5\u00a0on third down. Jay Ajayi\u00a0rushed for 20 yards in four carries. Michael Brockers tackled him for a one-yard loss.\u00a0 Trumaine Johnson nearly intercepted\u00a0Tannehill, but Tannehill's pass was just over Johnson's reach.\u00a0 Tannehill has completed eight of 11 passes for 41 yards. Nov. 20, 2016, 2:07 p.m. Rams offense goes three and out Lindsey Thiry The Rams went three and out. Todd Gurley rushed for three yards, Tavon Austin rushed for a yard and Kenny Britt caught a four-yard pass. I'm no offensive coordinator, but it seems counterproductive to have Austin, 5-feet-8 and 175 pounds, try to run the ball up the middle. Jared Goff has completed five of 10 passes for 41 yards. Nov. 20, 2016, 2:04 p.m. The Rams' defense has forced four punts Lindsey Thiry This game became chippy\u00a0-- fast. Two scuffles have broken out between the Rams and Dolphins. No flags after the first tussle, but there were\u00a0offsetting personal fouls on the second.\u00a0 Jay Ajayi rushed for two yards and Kenny Stills caught a three-yard pass before he was hit with a monster tackle from Maurice Alexander, who jumped to his feet and started banging his own helmet in excitement (Causing the first skirmish).\u00a0 Lamarcus Joyner sacked Ryan Tannehill on third down.\u00a0 The Dolphins punted and Josh Forrest and Michael Thomas were called for fouls.\u00a0 This game isn't high scoring, but so far it has been exciting to watch. The Rams' defense is playing lights out and the offense... is showing progress.\u00a0 Nov. 20, 2016, 1:57 p.m. Brian Quick stopped short of a first down; Rams punt Lindsey Thiry Jeff Fisher elected to challenge the spot of Jared Goff's third-down nine-yard completion to Brian Quick, but lost the challenge and the Rams punted. The Dolphins will start on their 12-yard line after a nice tackle by Bradley Marquez on special teams. Todd Gurley rushed for 18 yards before Goff threw two incomplete passes. The first, deep to Kenny Britt -- who was well defended on the far sideline. It was a nice throw. The second, an overthrow to tight end Tyler Higbee. ",

Clouds backdrop the downtown Los Angeles skyline as seen from the 110 Freeway during a rainstorm Sunday. (Patrick T. Fallon/ For The Times) Floods and Flooding A winter storm moved into Southern California on\u00a0Sunday afternoon, bringing scattered showers and warnings of more significant rainfall and possible flooding in some areas in the\u00a0evening. The rain was already causing traffic tie ups on roads and freeways throughout the region, officials said. Forecasters warned of flooding in parts of downtown Los Angeles, Pasadena, Alhambra, the South Bay and elsewhere. Scott Sukup, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service\u2019s Oxnard office, said an average of 0.5 to 1.0 inches of rain is expected to fall throughout the Los Angeles basin, with heavier rain possible in the mountains. The \u201cmain part of the storm\u201d is expected to begin around 6 p.m. Sunday, Sukup said. It will continue until around 4 a.m. Monday.\u00a0 \u201cThe bulk of the rain should be done before rush-hour,\u201d Sukup said. Forecasters also expect 3 to 8 inches of snow in the San Gabriel Mountains above 7,000 feet. Where the heaviest rain falls will depend largely on where thunderstorms occur, which Sukup\u00a0 said is hard to predict. The Weather Service has issued a flash-flood watch for burn areas where heavy rain could result in debris flows. The agency also issued a flood advisory Sunday afternoon, warning that the scattered showers that have already hit could cause flooding in\u00a0areas throughout the region.\u00a0 The storm has the potential to be the largest in the L.A. area this fall. So far, the basin has only gotten about 0.5 inches. If Sunday\u2019s storm does end up dumping an inch of rain on the region, that would \u201cput us above normal for the season,\u201d\u00a0Sukup said.\u00a0 As the storm moves through the area, residents should expect overnight low temperatures in the 50s,\u00a0Sukup said.\u00a0 Northern California is also being hit by rain this week, which is producing more much-needed snow in the parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains, a key source of water for California as the state deals with a fifth year of drought. https://twitter.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/800447703599681538 ",

Republican presidents rule recessions Matt Krantz , USA TODAY 5:30 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 x Share Trump's skepticism of free trade, and determination to get \"better deals\" from Mexico and China, brings the risk of \"tit-for-tat protectionism\" that could have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, said Alan Levenson, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook In this Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 file photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election night rally, in New York. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) History could portend a bad omen for President-elect Donald Trump: recessions are more common under Republican presidents. Every Republican president since Teddy Roosevelt in the early 1900's endured a recession in their first term, according to an analysis from Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at\u00a0stock research firm CFRA.\u00a0Four Republican presidents suffered through two recessions while in office and Republican President Dwight Eisenhower presided over three. Meanwhile, Democrats have largely skated past the recession quicksand. Four in five Democratic presidents saw no recessions during their terms since 1945,\u00a0Stovall says. While history isn't gospel, the track record makes the odds that a recession might appear during President Trump's term all the more likely, Stovall says. \"From a probability perspective, a recession is very likely in President Trump\u2019s first term in office,\" he says. Interestingly, recessions aren't the only indicator of economic slowdown that appear during times of Republican presidents. Real GDP growth, a measure of economic activity in the U.S., averaged 3.33% during the 64 years and 16 presidential terms going back to President Truman in the mid-1940s, according to a 2013 research paper by professors of economics Alan Blinder and Mark Watson at Princeton University. With a Republican in the White House, though, the economy's growth slowed to 2.54%, the economists found. With a Democrat in office, growth jumped to 4.35% on average. A variety of other economic indicators, such as per capital GDP, stock market returns,\u00a0real wages and the change in\u00a0the unemployment rate, are also more robust with a Democratic president, the economists found. Unemployment fell by 0.8 percentage points with a Democratic president on average, while it rose 1.1% with a Republican. \"The U.S. economy has performed better when the President of the United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance,\" according to the report titled \"Presidents and the Economy: A Forensic Investigation.\" Academics and market historians are trying to figure out why the economy tends to stall out with a Republican president. Such\u00a0research that is all the more timely given Trump's largely unexpected win for the high office this month. Research offers a few suggestions, including: * Random \"good luck.\" Democrats have had the fortune of being in office when favorable random shocks go their way during their terms,\u00a0Blinder and Watson found. Big drops in oil prices, positive boosts in productivity and also optimistic consumer outlooks tend to occur during Democratic administrations, they said. None of these factors are tied directly to the actions of the president, the professors found, These three factors explain upwards of 62% of the better economic performance. * Lag times for policies to kick in. Evidence pointing to better economic growth under Democrats is an illusion created by the timing of when presidents enter office, says Timothy Kane at the Hoover Institution think tank at Stanford University. \u00a0Factoring in the one-year lag between the time a new president is elected and when the policy effects kick in, \"there is no statistically significant advantage for either party in the White House,\" Kane says. Presidents inherit problems that were created by policy decisions before they were elected, Kane says. Presidents Reagan,\u00a0Bush\u00a0and Obama faced recessions after they were inaugurated in\u00a01981, 2001 and 2009, respectively he says. * The business cycle. The economy follows a natural progression of expansion, peaking and contraction which is more powerful than the president, Stovall says. \"I think the business cycle trumps\u00a0the presidential cycle, and Fed policy is most important of all,\" he says. Currently, leading indicators like housing starts, consumer confidence and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index\u00a0don't signal a looming recession. ",

Yesterday, the New York Post reported that there was uncertainty surrounding the prospect of Mrs. Trump and her son leaving New York City. Trump himself prompted doubt about the family's plans to fully relocate with his continued preference to return home to Trump Tower whenever possible, but confirmed to NBC News on Sunday that he intends to live in the White House. Related: Ivanka Trump's Company Scrambles Over '60 Minutes' Bracelet Criticism Though Trump's transition team has an office in Washington, D.C., Trump has remained ensconced in his Trump Tower suite and held most of his transition meetings over the past two weeks in the building, as well. The issue of Donald Trump's residency has been just one of many questions surrounding his family's potential involvement in his presidency, which include what critics says are conflicts of interest when it comes to the real estate mogul's business. Even as Melania and Barron plan to move to the White House, the president-elect is expected to spend part of his time at Trump Tower and his vacation time at his various properties around the United States. This weekend, he retreated to his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for a change of scenery, but continued meetings with cabinet prospects.

Melania Trump largely avoided the spotlight of her husband's campaign and stayed off the trail but has indicated she's open to taking on more of the traditional activities of a first lady now that her husband has been elected. And while presidents have emphasized privacy for their young children in the past, Trump's adult children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have taken outsize roles as campaign strategists, confidantes and surrogates and look likely to fill similar roles in his White House. Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump have all been in and out of Trump Tower this week along with a stream of campaign advisers and potential cabinet appointees, but the depth of their involvement with the transition is unclear \u2014 and has already sparked controversy. Trump's children are expected to manage his business in his stead as he focuses on the White House, but those plans have raised questions over whether Trump will truly be free of conflicts of interest or the influence of his business interests with close family members overseeing them. The Wall Street Journal in an editorial Thursday urged Trump to liquidate his stake in the Trump Organization to avoid the appearance of impropriety. Related: Jared Kushner Could End Up at the Heart of Trump White House Critics worried about the intertwining of Trump's White House, family and business interests found cause for concern in Trump's decision to let his daughter Ivanka sit in on his recent meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Some former government officials told the New York Times that Ivanka's presence was inappropriate, in part because she's an executive at an international corporation and topics discussed there could influence her business, but also because of national security concerns. A source close to the family, when asked by NBC News about the appearance of conflict from Ivanka Trump's presence at this week's meeting with the Japanese prime minister, provided the following statement: \"Mr. Trump has always encouraged Ivanka and his children to attend meetings with him. This meeting in question was very informal. However, they obviously need to adjust to the new realities at hand, which they will.\" Play ",

    "text": "World Leaders at APEC Summit Take Aim at Trump Over Trade By joshua goodman and ben fox, associated press LIMA, Peru \u0097 Nov 19, 2016, 5:38 PM ET 0 Shares Email Several U.S. allies took aim at Donald Trump's views on global trade, while China's president made an impassioned call against the sort of protectionism favored by the president-elect at a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders on Saturday The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is taking place in Peru as world leaders are on edge over Trump's campaign pledges to protect U.S. jobs by backing out of the not-yet-implemented Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said NAFTA benefits workers and companies on both sides of the border. Still, he expressed concern that the U.S. could be turning its back on a bilateral trade relationship responsible for moving $1 million worth of goods every minute. \"In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,\" Pena Nieto told business leaders. \"Mexico, like the entire world, is about to initiate a new stage with the U.S. and in commercial terms we want to give the right value to this strategic relationship between Mexico and the U.S.\" New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key spoke more bluntly, saying the \"tremendous despair\" triggered by Trump's trade views can't be allowed to slow down economic integration by the rest of the world. \"Even if the United States doesn't want to engage in free trade, President Trump needs to know other countries do,\" said Key. He said it's still possible to save the 12-nation TPP negotiated by the Obama administration by introducing cosmetic changes making it acceptable to Trump or carving out a less ambitious pact among TPP signatories that leaves out the U.S. \"I personally think that President Trump will be very much like chairman of the corporation Trump is,\" he said. \"He's a flexible business guy. He's going to realize he has a role to play.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered perhaps the most-forceful defense of free trade, given the size of his economy. In his kickoff speech from Peru he said the best response to rising protectionism would be for APEC's 21 members to negotiate a free trade area encompassing the entire Pacific Rim. \"Closed and inclusive arrangements are not the right choice,\" Xi said, taking a veiled stab at the TPP, which excludes China and is widely seen as an attempt to reassert U.S. dominance in Asia. \"Building a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for long-term prosperity.\" Xi's remarks came as Chinese state media blasted Trump for \"trade-bashing\" rhetoric that threatens global economic stability. \"The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,\" official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary piece published Saturday. President Barack Obama warned against a rush to judgment on Trump, saying at a town hall on the margins of the summit that it's too early to conclude that the new administration will wipe out trade deals and create international problems. \"Don't just assume the worst,\" he said. \"Wait until the administration's in place\" before drawing conclusions. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Franklin Briceno and Paul Traynor contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Saquon Barkley and Andre Robinson scored on short third-quarter runs and the Nittany Lions (9-2, 7-1) limited Rutgers (2-9, 0-8) to 87 yards in total offense in winning their seventh straight game, their longest streak since 2011. The win kept Penn State tied for first place in the Big Ten East with Ohio State and Michigan, who face each other in Columbus, Ohio. If the Buckeyes win and the Nittany Lions take their home finale against Michigan State, Penn State goes to the title game, having beaten the Buckeyes. Trace McSorley added a 27-yard scoring pass to Mark Allen, and backup quarterback Tommy Stevens scored on a 12-yard run in the fourth quarter. Full college football coverage at CBSSports.com NO. 2 OHIO STATE 17, MICHIGAN STATE 16 EAST LANSING, Mich. - Mike Weber ran for 111 yards and a touchdown, and No. 2 Ohio State held off Michigan State 17-16 on Saturday after the Spartans missed a 2-point conversion with 4:41 remaining. Ohio State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten, No. 2 CFP) can now move on to next weekend\u2019s showdown with rival Michigan, but only after withstanding a spirited challenge from a Michigan State team that derailed the Buckeyes\u2019 national title bids in two of the previous three seasons. The Spartans (3-8, 1-7) were down 17-10 when LJ Scott scored on a 1-yard run with 4:41 to play. Michigan State went for the lead, but Tyler O\u2019Connor\u2019s pass on the 2-point conversion attempt was intercepted in the end zone. Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said he\u2019d planned all week for the Spartans to go for 2 if a situation like that came up. The Spartans got the ball back one more time, at their own 20 with 2:04 remaining. Tyquan Lewis sacked O\u2019Connor on the first play, and then Gareon Conley intercepted him on the second. Scott ran for 160 yards and also scored on a 64-yard catch-and-run in the first minute of the game, but the Ohio State defense didn\u2019t allow much more after that. J.T. Barrett threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to Curtis Samuel in the first quarter, and the game was tied at 10 at halftime. Weber\u2019s 4-yard TD run in the third gave the Buckeyes the lead for good. NO. 1 ALABAMA 31, CHATTANOOGA 3 TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - Jalen Hurts passed for three touchdowns and ran for 68 yards to help Alabama overcome a slow start against FCS team Chattanooga. With the offense struggling to get going, the Crimson Tide (11-0) spotted the Mocs (8-3) the game\u2019s first three points and didn\u2019t really shake them until late in the third quarter. The defense had a more Bama-like performance, and hasn\u2019t given up a touchdown in 13 quarters. Hurts was 15 of 21 for 136 yards a week after torching Mississippi State for 347 yards. He had a 47-yard TD pass to Calvin Ridley and added two 1-yarders to Gehrig Dieter, including one in the final minutes that made the score look a little closer to what most expected. Damien Harris rushed for 91 yards, and a touchdown and Ridley gained 94 yards on seven catches. NO. 4 MICHIGAN 20, INDIANA 10 ANN ARBOR, Mich. - De\u2019Veon Smith ran for two touchdowns in a 3:33 span late in the third quarter, finishing with a career-high 158 yards rushing, to help Michigan shake off Indiana. John O\u2019Korn made his first start for Michigan (10-1, 7-1, No. 3 CFP), replacing the injured Wilton Speight, and struggled to lead an offense that was averaging 45 points and 232 yards passing. O\u2019Korn was 7 of 16 yards for just 59 yards. His best play was a 30-yard run, escaping a collapsed pocket on third down to set up Smith\u2019s 34-yeard run that put the Wolverines up 13-10 with 4:02 left in the third. Smith\u2019s 39-yard run later in the quarter put them ahead 20-10. Richard Lagow was 14 of 29 for 191 yards for Indiana (5-6, 3-5). NO. 5 CLEMSON 35, WAKE FOREST 13 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. - Deshaun Watson ran for two touchdowns and threw for another score, and Clemson wrapped up a spot in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game. Wayne Gallman rushed for a season-high 161 yards and two touchdowns, including a 42-yarder on fourth-and-inches that started the scoring for the Tigers (10-1, 7-1, No. 4 CFP). Playing with something to prove after a last-second loss to Pittsburgh, Clemson reeled off touchdowns on its first four possessions to take a 28-0 lead and then essentially went into protection mode while holding the Demon Deacons to 197 yards - its fewest since the opener against Tulane. Watson was 23 of 33 for 202 yards and sandwiched a pair of short scoring runs around a pretty 15-yard touchdown pass to Mike Williams, checking out after Gallman\u2019s second TD with 10:50 to play. Cade Carney had a 1-yard touchdown run for Wake Forest (6-5, 3-4). NO. 6 WISCONSIN 49, PURDUE 20 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - T.J. Watt returned an interception 17 yards for a touchdown, and Wisconsin scored 35 points in the final 8 1/2 minutes of the first half. Alec Ingold and Bradrick Shaw each scored twice during the flurry, helping the Badgers (9-2, 6-2 Big Ten, No. 7 CFP) to their fifth straight win overall and 11th in a row in the series. They can wrap up the West Division title and earn a spot in the conference championship game with a victory next weekend at home against Minnesota. Corey Clement rushed for 112 yards and a touchdown for Wisconsin. Purdue (3-8, 1-7) closed out its home schedule with a sixth straight loss, five under interim coach Gerad Parker. NO. 7 WASHINGTON 44, ARIZONA STATE 18 SEATTLE - Jake Browning overcame a sluggish start to throw for 338 yards and two touchdowns, and Washington routed Arizona State to stay in the College Football Playoff mix. Washington (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12, No. 6 CFP) will likely move up in both the AP Top 25 and the CFP ranking after snapping a 10-game losing streak to the Sun Devils (5-6, 2-6). Browning completed 27 of 44 passes with 12 of those going to John Ross for 95 yards. Myles Gaskin ran for 127 yards and a 45-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Washington\u2019s victory sets up one of the biggest Apple Cup games ever Friday in Pullman against rival Washington State, with the winner claiming a spot in the Pac-12 championship game. The two are tied atop the Pac-12 North standings after Washington State\u2019s 38-24 loss at Colorado on Saturday. NO. 8 OKLAHOMA 49, NO. 10 WEST VIRGINIA 28 MORGANTOWN, W.Va. - Baker Mayfield threw two touchdown passes and ran for two more scores and Oklahoma scored four times off turnovers to beat West Virginia in the snow. Oklahoma (9-2, 8-0 Big 12, No. 9 CFP) turned a marquee matchup into a rout from the start, building a 28-0 lead early in the second quarter before the Mountaineers tried a late comeback. The Sooners kept their long-shot playoff hopes alive and can win the conference title in their regular-season finale in two weeks against Oklahoma State. West Virginia (8-2, 5-2, No. 14 CFP) was eliminated from the conference race. Samaje Perine ran for 160 yards and two TDs, Joe Mixon had 147 yards and a score, and Dede Westbrook had 100 yards receiving, including a 75-yard TD. After Oklahoma\u2019s hot start, the Sooners kept the ball mostly on the ground. Mayfield finished 9 of 15 for 169 yards, all season lows. West Virginia\u2019s Justin Crawford rushed for 331 yards, the third-highest total in school history. OREGON 30, NO. 11 UTAH 28 SALT LAKE CITY - Justin Herbert threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Darren Carrington with 2 seconds remaining to lift Oregon past Utah, which was eliminated from the Pac-12 championship race. Herbert led the Ducks (4-7, 2-6) on a 10-play, 75-yard drive in just over 2 minutes, capping it with the TD pass to Carrington. He was initially called out of bounds, but that call was reversed after a replay showed Carrington got a foot down inbounds. Herbert passed for 324 yards and three TDs. He also scored on a 1-yard run in the fourth quarter. The Utes (8-3, 5-3, No. 12 CFP) had taken a 28-24 lead with 2:18 remaining off a Troy Williams 30-yard touchdown pass, but the Ducks then began their comeback drive. Royce Freeman led the Ducks\u2019 ground game with 129 yards. Joe Williams rushed for 149 yards and a touchdown for Utah. NO. 12 COLORADO 38, NO. 20 WASHINGTON STATE 24 BOULDER, Colo. - Sefo Liufau threw for 345 yards, ran for 108 more and scored three touchdowns in Colorado\u2019s victory over Washington State in a matchup of unlikely Pac-12 division leaders. Phillip Lindsay added 144 yards rushing and two TDs for the Buffaloes (9-2, 7-1, No. 10 CFP), who can wrap up the Pac-12 South and a spot in the conference title game by beating Utah at home next week. A loss would give the South to No. 15 Southern California. Liufau briefly left in the fourth quarter only to return and pick up a crucial third-and-short that led to a game-sealing TD run by Lindsay. Luke Falk threw for 325 yards and three scores for Washington State (8-3, 7-1, No. 22 CFP). The Cougars had won eight in a row. NO. 13 OKLAHOMA STATE 31, TCU 6 FORT WORTH, Texas - Mason Rudolph ran for two touchdowns and threw for another score, and Oklahoma State earned a Big 12 title shot with its seventh consecutive victory. The Cowboys (9-2, 7-1, No. 11 CFP) will be conference champions if they beat No. 8 Oklahoma in their regular-season finale after an open date. Oklahoma State scored on its only two drives in the third quarter to go ahead 24-6. Chris Carson had a bruising 19-yard TD run when he got through three tacklers and Rudolph scored on a 2-yard keeper immediately after a 63-yard catch-and-run by Chris Lacy, TCU (5-5, 3-4) had a chance to take the lead in the final minute of the first half after a 40-yard run by quarterback Kenny Hill. But Kyle Hicks took direct snaps in a wildcat formation on consecutive plays from the 1, getting stopped short on a third-down run and then overthrowing an open receiver. Justice Hill had 154 yards rushing on 16 carries for Oklahoma State, and Carson had 146 yards on 17 carries. Lacy had four catches for 109 yards. NO. 14 WESTERN MICHIGAN 38, BUFFALO 0 KALAMAZOO, Mich. - Zach Terrell passed for a career-high 445 yards and four touchdowns, helping Western Michigan remain undefeated. Corey Davis had 13 catches for 173 yards and two touchdowns, breaking the Mid-American Conference record for career receptions. Davis also holds the MAC records for career yards receiving and touchdown catches. Michael Henry added six receptions for 121 yards as the Broncos (11-0, 7-0, No. 21 CFP) stayed in contention for a major bowl bid. They need a win against Toledo next week and a victory in the MAC championship to have a chance at the Cotton Bowl. Jordan Johnson had 95 yards rushing for the Bulls (2-9, 1-6). NO. 15 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 36, UCLA 14 PASADENA, Calif. - Sam Darnold passed for 267 yards and hit De\u2019Quan Hampton for two touchdowns, leading Southern California past UCLA in the Los Angeles rivals\u2019 86th crosstown showdown. Ronald Jones II rushed for 121 yards and two TDs for the surging Trojans (8-3, 7-2 Pac-12), who won their seventh straight game after a dismal start to the season. USC claimed the Victory Bell for the second consecutive year, overcoming Darnold\u2019s two early interceptions and eventually taking apart UCLA\u2019s solid defense for 527 total yards. Jordan Lasley caught two first-half touchdown passes from Mike Fafaul for UCLA (4-7, 2-6). After five losses in their last six games, the Bruins are assured their first losing season in coach Jim Mora\u2019s half-decade in charge. NO. 21 FLORIDA 16, NO. 16 LSU 10 BATON ROUGE, La. - Florida stuffed LSU\u2019s Derrius Guice on a do-or-die run from the 1 in the final seconds, and the Gators held on to wrap up the Southeastern Conference\u2019s East Division. The stop capped a defensive struggle in which LSU converted a fourth-and-10 play on its final drive, only to get stopped on back-to-back runs from the 1 to end the game. Florida\u2019s Austin Appleby completed only seven passes on 17 attempts, but one of his connections went for a pivotal 98-yard touchdown to Tyrie Cleveland. Eddy Piniero scored the rest of Florida\u2019s points on field goals of 36, 24 and 34 yards. LSU (6-4, 4-3 SEC, No. 16 CFP) controlled most of the game and held considerable statistical advantages, outgaining Florida (8-2, 6-2, No. 23 CFP) 423 yards to 270 and holding possession for 34:02. But on three occasions, the Tigers failed to score after driving inside Florida\u2019s 10 - the first time because of Guice\u2019s fumble in the first half and the second time because of a botched field goal in the third quarter. The loss likely cost the Tigers a Sugar Bowl bid. NO. 17 FLORIDA STATE 45, SYRACUSE 14 SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Dalvin Cook ran for 225 yards and four touchdowns to become Florida State\u2019s career rushing leader. Cook entered the game needing 19 yards to break Warrick Dunn\u2019s 20-year old school record for rushing (3,959) and did so with a 41-yarder in the first quarter. He finished the first half with 104 yards to become just the sixth player in Atlantic Coast Conference history to reach 4,000 yards and the first to do it in three years. Florida State (8-3, 5-3, No. 17 CFP) won for the fifth time in six games and handed Syracuse (4-7, 2-5) its third straight loss. Syracuse starting quarterback Eric Dungey again warmed up before the opening kickoff but did not play for the second straight game. The sophomore has been out since suffering a vicious hit to the shoulder-head area in the first quarter against Clemson two weeks ago. NO. 18 AUBURN 55, ALABAMA A&M 0 AUBURN, Ala. - Jeremy Johnson accounted for three touchdowns, and Auburn made the most of its final tuneup before the Iron Bowl with a victory over FCS opponent Alabama A&M. Starting in place of the injured Sean White, Johnson was 14 of 19 for 147 yards and a touchdown and rushed for two more. It was Johnson\u2019s first start of the season and the first game he received substantial playing time in since the opener against Clemson. Kerryon Johnson ran for 108 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries before being lifted for freshman Kam Martin at halftime. Kamryn Pettway, who entered the week leading the SEC in rushing, missed his second consecutive game with a left leg injury. Among the other Tigers to sit out the final home game of the season were running back Stanton Truitt, H-back Chandler Cox and cornerback Carlton Davis. Auburn (8-3, No. 15 CFP) outgained Alabama A&M (4-7) 598-130, and had its first shutout since the first game of the 2008 season. NO. 19 NEBRASKA 28, MARYLAND 7 LINCOLN, Neb. - Terrell Newby ran for a career-high three touchdowns for Nebraska, and Ryker Fyfe passed for 220 yards and a score filling in for injured starter Tommy Armstrong Jr. The Cornhuskers (9-2, 6-2 Big Ten) stayed alive in the West Division. They must win at Iowa on Friday and Wisconsin must lose to Minnesota for Nebraska to go to the conference championship game. Maryland (5-6, 2-6) lost for the sixth time in seven games and has been outscored 149-13 over three weeks. Fyfe prevailed over Max Bortenschlager in a battle of backup quarterbacks. Armstrong injured his hamstring scoring the winning touchdown in last week\u2019s game against Minnesota. He didn\u2019t practice this week and was not in uniform Saturday. Perry Hills was dressed but didn\u2019t play for the Terrapins because of shoulder problems. NO. 23 TEXAS A&M 23, UTSA 10 COLLEGE STATION, Texas - Jake Hubenak threw for 248 yards and a touchdown, and Myles Garrett had 4 1/2 sacks to help No. 23 Texas A&M get back on track. The Aggies (8-3) were in desperate need of a victory after consecutive losses to Mississippi State and Mississippi ruined their shot at the College Football Playoff. The Roadrunners (5-6) cut the lead to three early in the second quarter after a one-handed touchdown grab by Josh Stewart. The Aggies then scored the next 13 points, capped by a 47 yard run by Trayveon Williams to make it 23-7 in the third quarter. Garrett was finally healthy after missing two games and being limited in several others because of a high ankle sprain. He finished with eight tackles, broke up a pass and forced a fumble. Instead of limping as he has been in recent weeks, Garrett was harassing UTSA\u2019s two quarterbacks all game. WYOMING 34, NO. 24 SAN DIEGO STATE 33 LARAMIE, Wyo. - Josh Allen threw two touchdown passes, including a 29-yarder to C.J. Johnson with 1:07 left, and Wyoming stopped a 2-point conversion attempt by San Diego State with no time on the clock. Allen completed 16 of 31 passes for 282 yards and also rushed for 56 yards. Brian Hill added 131 yards on 31 carries and two TDs for the Cowboys (8-3, 6-1 Mountain West). Johnson had five catches for 85 yards. Christian Chapman completed 15 of 26 passes for 211 yards and two TDs for San Diego State (9-2, 6-1). Chapman\u2019s last TD pass was a 23-yard desperation heave that Quest Truxton caught on the rebound with no time left. Aztecs coach Rocky Long elected to go for the win and Chapman\u2019s 2-point pass attempt was knocked away by defensive back Antonio Hull. Rashaad Penny and Juwan Washington both returned kickoffs for touchdowns for the Aztecs. Penny\u2019s was 93 yards, and Washington\u2019s 92 yards. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "NSA Director Mike Rogers Could Be Removed in Restructuring By Luis Martinez Nov 20, 2016, 4:44 PM ET 0 Shares Star Alex Wong/Getty Images National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers, commander of U.S. Cyber Command, speaks on cyber security at Georgetown University on April 26, 2016 in Washington, DC. Rogers joined FBI Director James Comey to address the sixth annual International Conference on \"Cyber Engagement: Discussing Critical Policy Alternatives,\" held by Georgetown University's Master of Science in Foreign Service CyberProject. 0 Shares Email President Obama is considering a recommendation by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to separate the commands of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command that could lead to the removal of Admiral Mike Rogers who heads both commands. Rogers' potential removal as the head of the National Security Agency was first reported by the Washington Post. The White House, the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the reports. According to a U.S. official, in September Carter and Clapper recommended to Obama a split between the commands of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command that would result in the removal of Admiral Mike Rogers as the head of both commands. The NSA is responsible for collecting international signals intelligence. U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) is responsible for the defense of military computer networks, but can also conduct offensive cyber operations, as it has done recently against ISIS' cyber networks. If the recommendation to split the commands is approved it could result in separate individuals respectively heading the NSA and Cyber Command. Rogers assumed leadership of both commands in April, 2014, a term that would likely end next April. In an unusual move, on Thursday Rogers met with President-elect Donald Trump . No readout was given of what they discussed. Should U.S. Cyber Command become a new combatant command, it would be up to the Defense Secretary to recommend the four star officer to head the new head of the command. Though it is a four star command, in a complex arrangement U.S. Cyber Command falls under U.S. Strategic Command, one of the nine combatant commands. If President Obama agrees with the recommendation, Admiral Rogers or another military officer could be named to head Cyber Command and a civilian could head the NSA. A new head of the NSA would require the input of both the Defense Secretary and the Director of National Intelligence. In response to the possibility that Rogers could be removed as the head of the NSA, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, sent a letter to Carter and Clapper praising Rogers performance. \"Since Admiral Rogers was appointed as NSA Director in April 2014, I have been consistently impressed with his leadership and accomplishments,\" Nunes said. \"His professionalism, expertise and deckplate leadership have been remarkable during an extremely challenging period for NSA. I know other members of Congress hold him in similarly high esteem.\" Nunes asked Carter and Clapper \"to provide a full explanation of the allegations contained in the Post article\" and said he would convene an open hearing \"at the earliest possible opportunity.\" \"I'll give them the benefit of the doubt if they can provide documentation and correspondence where they've had concerns with the admiral's performance,\" Nunes said in an interview with ABC News. \"My guess is, I'll hear crickets.\" The California Republican says he believes the leak behind the initial story was \"100-percent politically motivated,\" following Rogers visit with Trump in New York City, and referred to the administration, Defense Department the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as \"sad, pathetic losers\" for the charges about Rogers's performance. Nunes, who is a member of Trump's transition team, said Rogers would be a \"qualified candidate\" to join the incoming administration. Of the debate over separating the commands of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, Nunes said the issue is \"quite complicated\" and \"not something that should be rushed into.\" 0 Shares ",

Related Image Expand / Contract Det. Benjamin Marconi was shot and killed while writing a ticket in his patrol car on Sunday. (SAPD) The officer, 50-year-old Det. Benjamin Marconi, was shot after he pulled a driver over for an unspecified traffic infraction near police headquarters at around 11:45 a.m. local time, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said during a news conference. While Marconi sat in his patrol car writing a ticket, a second vehicle pulled up behind him. The killer emerged from the second car and fired at Marconi through the passenger-side window of the squad car. The gunman then reached inside the car and fired a second shot at Marconi before walking back to his car and fleeing the scene through the police department parking lot. Both shots fired at Marconi, a 20-year veteran, hit him in the head, McManus said. Marconi was pronounced dead at San Antonio Military Medical Center at 12:30 p.m., FOX29 reported . \"This is everyone's worst nightmare. You never want to see anything like this happen,\" said McManus, who then ticked off several other cities that recently had police officers targeted and killed. \"Unfortunately, like Dallas, like Baton Rouge, it's happened here now.\" DEPUTY RESPONDING TO SUSPICIOUS PERSON CALL IS KILLED Police released a still image of the suspected gunman\u2019s vehicle speeding away from police headquarters. Authorities were still looking through video footage to help identify the gunman. McManus said police did not believe the driver who was stopped by Marconi had any relationship with the gunman. Late Sunday, police released an image of a person they said might have information on the murder. \"We consider this suspect to be extremely dangerous and a clear threat to law enforcement officers and the public,\" said McManus, who added that after the shooting officers had been instructed to not make traffic stops alone. The chief said investigators are looking into all leads and motives, including whether it could be related to an officer-involved shooting earlier Sunday in the city. In that incident, McManus said, police fatally shot a man who pointed a gun at officers outside an apartment following a seven-hour standoff. \"Hopefully, we'll solve this one real quick,\" McManus said. Some streets downtown were blocked off with police tape as officials investigated the slaying. The shooting came less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001. Ten days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars. \"It's always difficult, especially in this this day and age, where police are being targeted across the country,\" McManus said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the slaying a \"horrific act of violence.\" Abbott said in a statement that \"attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice.\" San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor extended condolences to the family of the slain officer and the entire police force.

    "text": "Nov 20 2016, 1:34 pm ET Donald Trump's Administration Will Have to Hire as Many as 4,000 People by Carrie Dann A man who rose to fame using the catchphrase \"you're fired\" now faces the gargantuan task of assembling a presidential administration capable of running the most powerful nation in the world. And that involves hiring people. A lot of people. According to the Partnership for Public Service , a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that began working with both major party nominees earlier this year to help prepare the eventual winner to begin the transition process, the incoming administration will be charged with filling the jobs of as many as about 4,000 political appointees. Related: Mike Flynn, Jeff Sessions, Mike Pompeo: Meet Trump's Latest Top Picks That's a heavy lift for any new administration, and a particularly daunting one for a president-elect who was reportedly surprised to find out after winning the election that he would have to replace the White House staff at the end of President Barack Obama's term. And while the president-elect has wide authority to select several hundred incoming members of the White House staff \u2014 like his chief advisers and communications teams \u2014 more than 1,000 incoming appointees must be confirmed by the United States Senate. That includes big-name posts like the heads of the Defense, State and Justice Departments, but also a host of assistant and deputy secretaries, cabinet advisers and ambassadors. \"It's just a very, very complicated task, particularly when you get outside the White House staff,\" said Mark Abramson, the president of Leadership Inc. and an expert on government executive management. The new administration must also assemble an infrastructure capable of selecting the armies of policy professionals, lawyers, scientists, schedulers, speechwriters and press secretaries who populate each federal agency. Beyond White House staffers and positions requiring Senate approval, there are also more than 2,000 political appointees included in the leadership of the engines of government, from the USDA to the Justice Departme nt to NASA. Related: Why Putin's Latest Move Sets a Scary Precedent Incoming Cabinet secretaries may want to fill those jobs with their own loyalists, but may also face pressure from the White House to select or discard certain applicants. In many cases, they may end up leaning for months on career professionals already familiar with the jobs as they assemble their personalized teams. Meanwhile, Trump has proposed a hiring freeze for many federal employees, aimed at ultimately reducing the size of the federal government through attrition. A huge initial challenge for applicants to jobs requiring a greenlight from the Senate will be vetting, a task for which many \u2014 perhaps most \u2014 potential contenders may be unprepared. \"If you're going to get a Senate appointment, you have to get financial clearances, security clearances, FBI field investigations,\" said Abramson, who added that such background research can be particularly lengthy for candidates without significant previous experience in government. \"There's a lot of pieces to the puzzle and there's an enormous amount of applicants,\" he added. \"It's going to take a long time to get sorted out.\" Carrie Dann ",

    "text": "Dan Sipple/Ikon Images/Getty Images Dan Sipple/Ikon Images/Getty Images Rachael Garrity posted a farewell message on Facebook. She told her \"friends\" \u2014 that's how she puts it in an email to NPR, in quotes \u2014 that she would delete her account. An email from her son followed: Are you OK? \"I am finding Facebook to have a negative impact on my continuing to keep a positive feeling regarding some of the people I have known longest and cherish most,\" writes Garrity, who has worked in not-for-profit marketing and publishing since the 1970s. I unfriended nearly everyone. ... I am building my own wall now. Susan Brubaker Knapp Garrity was one of more than 150 people who have shared their stories with NPR, recapping how they are recalibrating their attitude toward social media after this year's election. Donald Trump's surprise victory ended an emotional roller-coaster of a presidential race, which has left Facebook, Google and Twitter scrambling to rein in a proliferation of fake news and harassing behavior . \"What was really shocking to me was how many people who I consider to be smart were sharing things that were not so smart, definitely obviously fake but matched whatever viewpoint that they pushed or agreed with,\" says Michael Lowder. He's Garrity's grandson \u2014 and he shared her story with NPR because, true to her word, she has quit Facebook, where NPR posted the call-out . Article continues after sponsorship From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg As for himself, Lowder has no plans to abandon social media \u2014 and a few people wrote in to say they are actually doubling down, regretting not speaking out more before the election, or feeling freed to speak their minds now that Trump is president-elect, or finding support in like-minded communities. But the vast majority of emails \u2014 some of them nearing 1,000 words in length \u2014 read like testimonials to a therapist: I'm having a hard time focusing. I have questioned my friendships. I can't stop scrolling. I'm exhausted. One email to NPR ended with: \"It was good to get that off my chest.\" People are turning off TVs (one even canceled her cable \u2014 mass media are not off the hook, either), deleting social apps from their phones, rationing time spent on Facebook and Twitter, and shrinking their digital friend lists. Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating, drawn-out illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma. Emily Prymula, Wadsworth, Ill. Facebook is a source of news for a majority of American adults , but in the vitriol and propaganda of the 2016 election, its proverbial public square for many users has devolved into a never-ending Thanksgiving-dinner debate \u2014 or an omnipresent Speakers' Corner . As Lowder says his father put it, opining on social media is the equivalent of shouting off a soapbox in the street: a declaration, rather than discussion. This view, of course, cuts against the way Facebook views itself. \"Friends and family come first\" was said to be its guiding value in a shakeup of the News Feed algorithm revealed in June . Susan Brubaker Knapp writes: \"The day after the election, the hate and darkness got to be too much. I unfriended nearly everyone. Now I have three friends: my husband and children. ... I do hold (Facebook) responsible for helping to spread disinformation that contributed to both the election results and the level of vitriol and hate in this country. I am building my own wall now.\" A similar sentiment from Todd Neigum: \"(The election) simply turned me off of Facebook. I started by unfollowing people I've known for 40 years. Neighbors, friends, family doesn't mean I have to wade through untold numbers of gloating, trashtalking, flamethrowing posts.\" Much of the consternation does come from the supporters of Hillary Clinton, who find themselves inundated and overwhelmed by news about a candidate they oppose. But then there are people like Tin Samuel, a tech consultant from Kansas City, Mo., who did vote for Trump. Zuckerberg Denies Fake News On Facebook Had Impact On The Election Back in 2015, Samuel set up a second profile, splitting his closest connections from more professional ones, theoretically carving out a space to comfortably express his opinion. It hasn't worked out that way, he writes, as people who disagree with him \"lob insults\" and he has found he's censoring himself on both profiles: \"It's not just strangers that are engaging in this kind of behavior. It's people I've known for 20 years. ... It's one thing when you're insulted by a stranger on an NPR or CNN newsfeed. It's quite another when you're being threatened by someone who knows where you live. ... \"For the rest of the year at least, I'm going to stop talking about politics altogether online, and focus on the topics and things that I find more interesting. Technology, silly cat memes, Brazilian dance music, and food videos. You know, all that stuff the internet was always supposed to be about to begin with.\" And actually, a few people have reported creating a dual presence on the platform, turning to a new profile void of political pages and opinionated friends or family. Writes health care worker Jackie Prack from Greenville, S.C.: \"The election was the last straw for me. In the days after, all I saw was hate. From both sides. ... I decided that day to get rid of my original Facebook and create my 'new' Facebook ... full of running, bikes, breweries, cat videos, satire, art, music, hiking, food, and good people. ... If the world is falling apart, my head is solidly in the sand right now ... and it's nice down here.\" Rationing of social media time has been a common response, too. Clicking on Facebook in the morning is like blunt trauma to the brain https://t.co/Q5hzgum1jx \u2014 Rani Molla (@ranimolla) November 18, 2016 Greg Jeffers, a teacher from Rowlett, Texas, describes himself as a \"deeply religious\" person and a social conservative \u2014 he voted for Evan McMullin , a former CIA officer who is a Mormon. Jeffers says before the election, he obsessively shared \"every article I was reading on Facebook\" and getting into arguments with friends and friends of friends, who as conservatives supported Trump. Unlike many users struggling to burst or embrace ideological bubbles formed on Facebook, Jeffers faced a different challenge: \"Since (Trump) won, I realized I would have at least four more years of being ideologically separated from my tribe. I also realized that I had become a meaner, more cynical person. ... \"I decided not to totally delete Facebook. It really is a good way to stay in touch with people. But, I did decide to have my wife change my password. And I decided that I would allow myself an hour a week (30 minutes on Saturday and 30 minutes on Tuesday or Wednesday) to peruse Facebook and stay caught up.\" Jeffers writes that he's thinking of shifting his time from Facebook arguments to something practical, spending time with his wife and daughters, his students, his church family. \"Maybe I can, through my church, teach ESL to refugees,\" he writes. Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016? And then there's Emily Prymula from Wadsworth, Ill., who says, in her rebound from social media overdose, she began researching how to run for local elected office: \"I can't make a difference or change someone's opinion through a Facebook discussion, but I can do so through being present in my community.\" She describes herself as an independent, which she says turned her news feed into an \"ideological battleground\": \"Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating, drawn-out illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma, trying to convince one another that their preferred course of treatment had less severe side effects and a better long-term outcome for the patient. ... I turned off my notifications, and vowed to only post positive news about my life for my family and friends.\" Monica Eskin makes an interesting observation: \"There is a reason that voting is anonymous: so it doesn't destroy your ability to live with your neighbors. As their neighbor I know less about them than I do as their (Facebook) friend, and maybe that's the way it is supposed to be with your neighbors and coworkers, etc.\" But of course, many emails make the counter-point: \"Let's be honest, most political conversation happens on social media these days ... for better or for worse,\" writes Carmen Jenkins, who describes herself as a moderate, pro-life, anti-Trump Republican. \"If I want to have a voice in this conversation, I better engage,\" she says. \"I better engage in a way that promotes dialogue rather than shutting it down with judgments and generalizations.\" How effective Jenkins and others like her will be just might determine how social media shapes up (is it too soon to say this?) for the next election.

AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption AFP/Getty Images Indian rescue workers search for survivors in the wreckage of a train that derailed near Pukhrayan in Kanpur district on Sunday. AFP/Getty Images In the early hours of Sunday morning, a passenger train veered off track in northern India, killing at least 115 people, police say. More than 150 additional travelers are injured. Fourteen coaches of the train, traveling from the northeastern city of Patna to the central city of Indore, derailed in the village of Pukhrayan, near the industrial city of Kanpur, in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Several passengers were sleeping at the time of the crash, which occurred around 3:10 a.m. Railway officials and medical teams are attending to the scene, using gas cutters and cranes to pull out hundreds of trapped survivors after coaches crumpled on impact, reports the Associated Press. National Disaster Response Force workers are also being deployed. \"It is a delicate situation,\" said Daljeet Chaudhary, a director general of police, reports broadcaster NDTV . Local media are reporting a higher death toll, which has been rising as rescue workers gain more access to the mangled coaches.

My thoughts are with the bereaved families. \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 20, 2016 The cause of the derailment remains unknown. As NPR's Julie McCarthy reports from New Dehli, the Transport Ministry has ordered a full investigation into the incident, and has announced compensation for relatives of those who have died. Article continues after sponsorship The Transport Minister, Suresh Prabhu, tweeted \"the strictest possible action will be taken against those who could be responsible.\" Crashes are relatively common on India's rail network, the world's fourth largest. While it's trains shuttle more than 20 million passengers daily, the state-owned Indian Railways is fitted with outdated safety, signaling and communication technology. An accident involving two trains in Madhya Pradesh in August last year left 24 dead, which officials blamed on flash floods. ",

(Brendan McDermid/Reuters) This post has been updated. President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Sunday that future first lady Melania Trump and their 10-year-old son, Barron, will remain in New York after\u00a0he\u00a0becomes president, as first reported in the New York Post . When asked about the family\u2019s relocation plans post inauguration Trump, 70, told reporters that he would immediately settle into the executive mansion and that Mrs. Trump and his youngest son, a fourth grader at a Manhattan prep school, would move \u201cVery soon. After he\u2019s finished with school,\u201d according to McClatchy White House Correspondent Anita Kumar .\u00a0Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller confirmed that there was \u201cobviously a sensitivity to pulling out a 10-year-old in the middle of the school year.\u201d \u201cThe campaign has been difficult for Barron, and she is really hoping to keep disruption to a minimum,\u201d an unidentified person \u201cclose to Trump\u2019s transition team\u201d told the New York Post in an article published online early Sunday. Melania\u00a0Trump\u2019s decision to not to live in the White House, at least for now, appears unprecedented. Nearly every first lady has taken up residence there. According to the White House Historical Association, George Washington and his wife, Martha Washington, did\u00a0not live in the White House because it hadn\u2019t been built yet. Also, first lady Anna Harrison, whose husband, William Henry Harrison, was the ninth president of the United States, never moved into the executive mansion because her husband died one month after his swearing-in. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed interest in spending time regularly at his penthouse at Trump Tower in New York. Here are some changes that could happen in order to make that request a reality. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) Melania Trump, 46, told People\u00a0magazine \u00a0in September 2015 that her primary role was not as a campaigner or a political figure but as a mother to Barron, the youngest of the five Trump children, echoing a sentiment expressed by self-described \u201cmom in chief\u201d Michelle Obama when her husband was first elected president. \u201cMy husband is traveling all the time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBarron needs somebody as a parent, so I am with him all the time.\u201d A rare figure on the campaign trail, Melania Trump remains a mystery to most. We know she thinks her husband has a \u201cgood heart\u201d and is a \u201cgreat negotiator,\u201d that she plans to take on\u00a0cyberbullying as first lady and that the white jumpsuit she wore during her husband\u2019s presidential victory speech was designed by Ralph Lauren. But\u00a0not much else. The question of whether she planned to move to Washington after her husband\u2019s swearing-in had been batted around since the summer . Donald Trump\u00a0reportedly plans\u00a0to spend as much time as possible at the couple\u2019s tony penthouse at Trump Tower in Manhattan\u00a0and at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. \u00a0 ",

The flight took off without the passengers, at least some of whom \"had been drinking,\" en route to Alicante, Spain, according to Kim Daenen, a Brussels Airlines spokeswoman. \"During taxiing, there were a few passengers who were being unruly and also aggressive toward our crew,\" Daenen said. All of the passengers were part of the same group, which had all been booked together on the flight, SN3771, she said. \"The captain asked for them to stay calm,\" but they didn't listen, she said. So before taking off, she said, \"the captain decided to go back to the gate. ... We had to think of the comfort of the other passengers.\" She would not give any more details about the passengers, such as what type of group they were or what nationality they were. 0 Shares ",

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- Jimmie Johnson tied Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with a record seven NASCAR championships when the hard-luck breaks of racing turned Sunday\u2019s title-deciding finale into his crowning moment. Johnson probably had the worst car of the four championship contenders at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but a strange sequence of events opened the track for him to take the title over Carl Edwards, Joey Logano and defending champion Kyle Busch. \u201cThere was no way on earth,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the race was unfolding for us like we needed it to to be the champs. But we kept our heads in the game.\u201d Edwards was in position to win until a caution with 10 laps remaining set up a wild sequence that ruined his title hopes. Edwards tried to block Logano on the restart, wound up wrecked, and it was Johnson who drove through the wreckage to take the championship lead. Johnson had to withstand two more restarts, including one in overtime, to score his first career victory at Homestead in the most monumental race of his career. The title was there for the taking for Edwards until the fateful sequence that changed history. He was leading when Dylan Lupton brought out a caution with 15 laps remaining, and it forced Edwards to hold off the competition on a restart with 10 to go. Logano, so masterful on restarts for two years now, tried to dart around Edwards on the bottom. Edwards refused to yield and tried to fend off the move by blocking Logano low. Contact between the two sent Edwards hard into an interior wall, then all the way across the track for a second hit. He had been the most dominant driver of the Chase contenders, but was left with a wrecked car. \u201cHe came down right in front of me,\u201d Logano said on his radio. Edwards stood on the track and watched the replay of the accident, and appeared to mutter \u201cdamn,\u201d hands on hips, before he began a long walk to Logano\u2019s pit box. Once there, he stopped at Logano\u2019s pit box before continuing a journey on foot through the infield to make the mandatory stop at the care center. He acknowledged he was aggressive protecting his position from Logano. \u201cI was racing for my life up to that point,\u201d he said. \u201cI just pushed the issue as hard as I could because I figured that was the race there. I had to push it, I couldn\u2019t go to bed tonight and think that I gave him that lane.\u201d Edwards felt it was important to assure Logano\u2019s team it was just a racing incident, but he made it clear he was rooting for teammate Busch to win. The benefactor of Edwards\u2019 error, though, was Johnson, who had darted through the wreck ahead of Busch and Logano. Crew chief Chad Knaus pumped his fists in joy, all too aware that a dog of a night had just turned into the race of their lives. Logano wasn\u2019t giving up his effort, though, and headed to pit road to take on new tires for a final restart. \u201cThis guy on a restart with five laps to go, I\u2019ll take him every day of the week,\u201d crew chief Todd Gordon said. Logano restarted eighth but was a bull as he pushed his way through traffic and into third place, behind Johnson, after a caution forced another restart. This time, Johnson got the start of his life and jumped into the lead. He didn\u2019t look back, only forward at the history book. \u201cLuck came our way and we were able to win the race and win this championship,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

After the show portrayed the president-elect as a man in over his head, Trump tweeted early Sunday that he had seen parts of the show and declared it \"totally one-sided, biased\" and had \"nothing funny at all.\" Alec Baldwin, who portrayed Trump on the show, responded in a tweet of his own to the president-elect's request for equal time. \"Election is over,\" Baldwin wrote. \"There is no more equal time.\" ... @realDonaldTrump Equal time? Election is over. There is no more equal time. Now u try 2 b Pres + ppl respond. That's pretty much it. \u2014 ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) November 20, 2016 The show began with Baldwin's President-elect Trump appearing uncharacteristically anxious, at one point chanting the mantra \"Big beautiful boobs and buildings\" to ease himself out of a panic attack after Googling to find out what ISIS is and after asking Siri how to kill them. Baldwin's Trump is also quick to throw away all of his pre-election promises when put to task. \"Scrap it,\" Trump says when told it will be hard to find and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. \"Let's just keep it,\" he says when told a lot of people actually like Obamacare. \"Don't do it,\" he says of it being hard to hire a special prosecutor to put Hillary Clinton in jail. \"Scrap it.

    "text": "San Antonio Cop Fatally Shot While Giving Out Traffic Ticket By Michael Edison Hayden Nov 20, 2016, 8:40 PM ET 0 Shares This undated stock photo shows a San Antonio police car in San Antonio, Texas. 0 Shares Email A San Antonio police officer was shot and killed while writing a traffic ticket, a shooting that officials indicated appeared to be a targeted attack. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told the press that while the officer was writing a ticket, someone pulled up behind the squad car, stepped out of his vehicle and shot the officer twice, once in the head. The shooter then drove off. \"It's always difficult, especially in this this day and age, where police are being targeted across the country,\" McManus said. \"Unfortunately, like Dallas, like Baton Rouge, it's happened here,\" he added, referring to cities where police officers were killed in targeted attacks. \"Attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement, referring to his desire to sign the Police Protection act, a law that would make targeted attacks on police officers a hate crime. McManus identified the officer who was killed as Det. Benjamin Marconi, 50, a 20-year veteran. San Antonio Police Department The San Antonio Police Department takes a moment to honor SAPD Detective Benjamin Marconi, who lost his life this morning. He said Sunday night that the suspect had not been caught, and investigators had not identified a motive, but it did not appear there was any relationship between the shooter and the person who had been pulled over. Police scanner recordings offer a frightening account of what took place, and indicate that the attack took place in the vicinity of police headquarters. \"I've got an officer down in front of headquarters,\" the voice on the recording said. \"Black male in a black Nissan. I need EMS right now in front of headquarters.\" The San Antonio PD posted a photo of a man on its Facebook page this evening, asking for help identifying him and saying he \"might have information on the murder.\" San Antonio Police issued a photo on social media of the black Nissan fleeing the scene after the shooting. \"This is the vehicle seen fleeing headquarters after the shooting. The suspect is described as a black male wearing a hoodie, baggy pants, and beard. Approximately 5'7. Please call Crime Stoppers at 224-STOP with any info,\" the post said. \"We consider this suspect to be extremely dangerous and a clear threat to law enforcement officers and the public,\" McManus said. The shooting comes in what has been a year of heightened tensions surrounding police. Following the widely covered police shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in St. Paul, Minnesota, a gunman killed five police officers in Dallas who were protecting a protest rally. Also in July, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Earlier this month, Urbandale, Iowa resident Scott Michael Greene allegedly shot and killed two police officers in an ambush-style attack. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "How Fake News Goes Viral: A Case Study By Sapna Maheshwari Image Images posted on Twitter by a marketer in Austin, Tex., the day after the presidential election. Credit Eric Tucker, a 35-year-old co-founder of a marketing company in Austin, Tex., had just about 40 Twitter followers. But his recent tweet about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations against President-elect Donald J. Trump fueled a nationwide conspiracy theory \u2014 one that Mr. Trump joined in promoting.\u00a0 Mr. Tucker's post was shared at least 16,000 times on Twitter and more than 350,000 times on Facebook. The problem is that Mr. Tucker got it wrong. There were no such buses packed with paid protesters. But that didn't matter. While some fake news is produced purposefully by\u00a0 teenagers in the Balkans \u00a0or\u00a0 entrepreneurs in the United States \u00a0seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. Here, The New York Times deconstructs how Mr. Tucker\u2019s now-deleted declaration on Twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon. It is an example of how, in an ever-connected world where speed often takes precedence over truth, an observation by a private citizen can quickly become a talking point, even as it is being proved false. Nov. 9, shortly after 8 p.m. Eastern Image CreditSnopes Mr. Tucker, who had taken photos of a large group of buses he saw near downtown Austin earlier in the day because he thought it was unusual, saw reports of protests against Mr. Trump in the city and decided the two were connected. He posted three of the images with the declaration: \u201cAnti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin\u201d Mr. Tucker said he had performed a Google search to see if any conferences were being held in the area but did not find anything. (The buses were, in fact, hired by a company called Tableau Software, which was holding a conference that drew more than 13,000 people.) \u201cI did think in the back of my mind there could be other explanations, but it just didn\u2019t seem plausible,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he had posted as a \u201cprivate citizen who had a tiny Twitter following.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m also a very busy businessman and I don\u2019t have time to fact-check everything that I put out there, especially when I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going out there for wide consumption.\u201d Nov. 10, 12:49 a.m. Eastern Image Credit Several hours later, the first important step occurred. Mr. Tucker\u2019s tweet was posted to the main Reddit community for Mr. Trump under the heading: \u201cBREAKING: They found the buses! Dozens lined up just blocks away from the Austin protests.\u201d It quickly generated more than 300 comments, some of which blamed the protests on George Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist, who is a frequent target of the group. Nov. 10, around 9 a.m. Eastern The next morning, the frenzy began. A user on Free Republic, a conservative discussion forum, linked to the Reddit thread about Mr. Tucker\u2019s post, increasing the attention and spreading it further into the online world. Later, Facebook pages like Robertson Family Values, which is named for but not affiliated with the stars of \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d and Donald Trump Commander in Chief 2020, linked to the Free Republic discussion. Those posts were shared more than 5,000 times each, and more than 300,000 Facebook users have linked to the Free Republic thread. Image Credit Nov. 10, late morning through the afternoon Sean Hughes, the director of corporate affairs for the bus company Coach USA North America, said he learned about the rumor involving its vehicles after receiving a couple of curious emails and hearing from a friend in New Jersey who had seen the claim on Facebook and wanted to know if it was true. A reporter at the Fox television station in Austin contacted Mr. Hughes later that day, and he responded with a statement noting that \u201cat no point were Coach USA buses involved in the Austin protests.\u201d But that did little to stem the online furor. \u201cThat reporter said, \u2018You\u2019re probably going to get a lot more phone calls because it\u2019s all over the place,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hughes said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019re the second journalist to actually call me to see what was going on, no bloggers or anything, and we\u2019re easily accessible on our website,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. He added, \u201cI just kind of wish people looked into facts before they go ahead and do something like that, because it could be easily debunked based on a quick phone call or two, or a couple emails.\u201d During this time, Mr. Tucker was replying to queries on Twitter about whether he had proof to support his claim. He confirmed in a post that he \u201cdid not see loading or unloading\u201d but that the buses were \u201cquite near protests at right timing.\u201d That admitted lack of evidence, however, had little effect. By about noon, Mr. Tucker\u2019s initial post had been retweeted and liked more than 5,000 times. There was more to come. @stevendenoon I did not see loading or unloading. There were even more busses than in pics. Quite near protests at right timing. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an ever-shifting organization chart of friends and advisers, Mr. Kushner, 35, has been the lone constant. Raised by one family that prizes loyalty above all else, he married into another. And he is well acquainted with Mr. Trump\u2019s personality type, with his own father a volatile real estate magnate. Now, there is talk of his following Mr. Trump into the White House. What some may see as Mr. Kushner\u2019s greatest liabilities as an adviser \u2014 his lack of political experience, policy expertise or familiarity with the ways of Washington \u2014 the president-elect views as his greatest strength: a single-minded devotion without a competing agenda. Photo When another Trump adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, right, was under fire, accused of promoting white supremacist views and conspiracy theories, Mr. Kushner came to his defense. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cEveryone else has their own constituencies, but Jared is just there to protect the interests of the president,\u201d said Thomas Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who is heading up the inaugural committee. It is not clear exactly how Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, might be deployed. He is exploring the prospects of joining the administration as a formal, but unpaid, adviser. Anti-nepotism statutes prohibit close relatives of the president from playing an active role in the government, but at the same time, the Constitution gives the president broad authority to choose his own advisers. If the Trump administration presses ahead with a Kushner appointment, the matter could wind up in court. Whatever role Mr. Kushner may play in the administration, he has already had a hand in helping assemble it. Both of Mr. Trump\u2019s most senior advisers, Mr. Priebus, his new chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, seek Mr. Kushner\u2019s advice routinely, considering his buy-in almost a prerequisite for their proposals to Mr. Trump, two senior Trump officials said. (In deference to Mr. Kushner, the transition team delayed announcing the two men\u2019s appointment until after the Jewish sabbath last weekend.) \u201cJared has the trust, confidence and ear of the entire inner circle of the Trump administration, including the most important member of that group, the president-elect,\u201d said Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He described Mr. Kushner as \u201cone of the most important players right now beyond the president- and vice president-elect.\u201d Inside the Trump operation, he is known as the staunchest defender of Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment. When Mr. Bannon was recently accused of anti-Semitism and of promoting white supremacist views and conspiracy theories, Mr. Kushner reassured the Trump team. He called Mr. Bannon a man of character and said the widespread criticism was a smear, according to a senior Republican official, speaking about private discussions on the condition of anonymity. While Mr. Kushner kept himself out of the spotlight throughout the campaign, he has been more visible since the election, walking the White House grounds during Mr. Trump\u2019s recent meeting with President Obama and accompanying the president-elect at a meeting at Trump Tower on Thursday night with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Kushner declined to be interviewed for this article. Although he is a newspaper owner and publisher, he has not been quoted in the media since the start of the campaign. Before that, Mr. Kushner did not have much of a public political identity, but appeared to lean left. He was raised in a Democratic household, and several years ago, he and his wife hosted a fund-raiser in their Park Avenue penthouse for Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey and former Newark mayor, who has become a vocal critic of Mr. Trump. Photo Jared Kushner, right foreground, accompanied members of Mr. Trump\u2019s team on their visit to the White House. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times They also once hosted a fund-raising breakfast for another Democrat, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who sued Trump University for allegedly defrauding students. (The lawsuit was one of a series brought against the program that were settled on Friday for $25 million .) The couple moves in a predominantly liberal Manhattan circle. \u201cTheir social politics seem more what I would expect from New Yorkers of their generation,\u201d said Adam Silver, the National Basketball Association commissioner and a friend of Mr. Kushner\u2019s who has frequently contributed to Democrats. Some New York business leaders, who had recoiled at Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, say privately that they are hoping Mr. Kushner will be a moderating influence on the new president. But it remains to be seen how receptive he will be to their concerns. Trump officials say that Mr. Kushner underwent an ideological conversion over the course of the campaign, and that he was particularly affected by the experience of wading into the crowds at Trump rallies. Mr. Kushner projects a very different image from his father and father-in-law. He speaks in a near-whisper, punctuated by long pauses, conveying both intimacy and awkwardness. Unlike most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, Mr. Kushner is unfazed by Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent fits of anger, sitting silently rather than flinching or fighting back when he is being dressed down, several campaign officials have said. The relationship between the two men is relatively uncomplicated. Unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s two eldest sons, Mr. Kushner did not have to live through his father-in-law\u2019s public and messy divorces, and the businesses that he presides over are his own, not part of the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump has described him as a \u201cbrilliant young man.\u201d His quiet manner belies a driving confidence; his family\u2019s wealth has allowed him to plunge into new ventures, sometimes stumbling in the process. In his mid-20s, he took charge of his father\u2019s real estate empire and bought The New York Observer. Much as he once courted the media mogul Rupert Murdoch as a mentor, now that he is immersing himself in politics, he has been seeking the counsel of Henry Kissinger. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the start of the campaign, Mr. Kushner was mostly just along for the ride, keeping his father-in-law company at the occasional rally and making the odd phone call to a potential donor on his behalf. His purview was never entirely spelled out, which gave him latitude to exert influence without clear responsibility. He gradually built influence , and by the end of the race, he was seen internally as the de facto campaign manager. He oversaw the creation of the campaign\u2019s $90 million digital operation, including a database of millions of Trump supporters, which was developed by a Texas business that had previously worked on the Trump Organization website. He also brokered important meetings for Mr. Trump, including his sit-down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, which Mr. Kushner arranged with Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States. Photo Mr. Kushner at the offices of The New York Observer, which he owns, in 2007. He has not been quoted in the media since the campaign began. Credit Nicholas Roberts for The New York Times \u201cHe\u2019s a cool customer,\u201d Mr. Dermer said of Mr. Kushner. Mr. Kushner\u2019s political inexperience was at times evident during the campaign. He told one aide that he did not need to pay for traditional focus groups because he could measure voter reaction from the applause at Mr. Trump\u2019s events. Like his father-in-law, he ran hot and cold on senior campaign advisers, and played a role in ousting two of them, Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, after their conduct or affiliations made them liabilities. More recently, Mr. Kushner backed away from a member of the transition team he had previously supported, when the man\u2019s work as a lobbyist for foreign governments attracted headlines.

That's what Gen. Michael Flynn believes and that's what President Trump believes.\" Controversies have surrounded Trump's approach to a potential Muslim registry. Flynn, who Trump asked to serve as national security adviser, has denounced Islam as a \" political ideology \" that \"hides behind\" religion earlier this year. Flynn also told Al-Jazeera in May that he supported Trump's stated campaign proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States. Flynn said at the time that he urged Trump to use \"more precision in the use of the language.\" Trump ultimately rebranded the potentially unconstitutional proposal as \"extreme vetting\" of people from \"territories\" with a history of terrorism.

Higbie said Thursday on MSNBC that he was not referring to internment camps, but that registration was not inherently troublesome. \"We use register like it's a bad thing,\" Higbie said . \"You have to register your car. Most states, like Connecticut, my own, we have to register our guns. We have to register a ton of things... as long as it keeps America safe.\" When asked if Trump agrees with incoming National Security Adviser Flynn's past statement that \"fear of Muslims is rational,\" Priebus said that the president-elect did not think that religious judgments should be categorical. \"He believes that no faith in and of itself should be judged as a whole,\" Priebus said. \"But there are some people in countries abroad that need to be prevented... there are some people that need to be prevented from coming into this country. So I think that's where 99 percent of Americans are at.\" Christina Coleburn ",

The Dakota Territory was divided into two states, worth twice the political power. Credit David Francis Barry, via Library of Congress In 1920, for the first time, the Census Bureau counted more people living in urbanized America than in the countryside. This hasn\u2019t been a rural nation ever since. Yet the idea of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s agrarian America has receded slowly despite demographic change. We still romanticize the family farm, though few of them exist anymore. We view even suburbia in pastoral terms \u2014 the \u201ccrabgrass frontier,\u201d as the historian Kenneth T. Jackson put it. And, as the recent Electoral College results make clear, we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly pro-rural bias, by design. The Democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections. But in part because the system empowers rural states, for the second time in that span, the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president. Rural America, even as it laments its economic weakness, retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength. Rural voters were able to nudge Donald J. Trump to power despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s large margins in cities like New York. In a House of Representatives that structurally disadvantages Democrats because of their tight urban clustering, rural voters helped Republicans hold their cushion. In the Senate, the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before. And the growing unity of rural Americans as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent Republican advantage. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a political system that skews rural, that\u2019s not as important if there isn\u2019t a major cleavage between rural and urban voting behavior,\u201d said Frances Lee, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland. \u201cBut urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just in terms of policy outcomes,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis pervasively advantages Republicans in maintaining control of the U.S. national government.\u201d The U.S. Senate Has Become Even Less Representative The minimum share of the U.S. population able to elect a Senate majority. % 2015 Source: \u201c Sizing Up the Senate \" by Frances E. Lee and Bruce I. Oppenheimer The Electoral College is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past. Today, states containing just 17 percent of the American population, a historic low, can theoretically elect a Senate majority, Dr. Lee said. The bias also shapes the House of Representatives. It exists, as a result, in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets Homeland Security dollars. It exists in state capitols, where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected . Today, the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who should have power in America. Jefferson and James Madison argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil. \u201cThey had this vision of what they called the \u2018yeoman farmer\u2019: this independent, free-standing person who owed nothing to anybody, who didn\u2019t receive any payments from the government, who didn\u2019t live by a wage, but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed \u2014 and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of democracy,\u201d said Gerald Gamm, a political scientist at the University of Rochester, describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this year\u2019s election. One in Five People Live in Rural America Today The share of the U.S. population classified as living in rural and urban areas. % Source: U.S. Census Bureau When the framers of the Constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have today, 95 percent of America was rural, as the 1790 census classified the population. The Connecticut Compromise at the time created the Senate: one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the House, where more populous states spoke louder. And they made sure the compromise stuck. Today, equal state representation in the Senate is the only provision in the Constitution that cannot be amended . But even as a deliberately undemocratic body, the Senate has slipped further out of alignment with the American population over time. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Senate hasn\u2019t simply favored sparsely populated states; politicians in Washington created sparsely populated states to leverage the Senate\u2019s skewed power. \u201cWhen we talk about small-state bias, all of that was an intentional policy choice,\u201d said Jowei Chen, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. Republicans in Congress passed the 1862 Homestead Act, offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states \u2014 creating more Senate seats and Electoral College votes for a Republican Party eager to keep government control away from Southern Democrats. They even managed to divide the Dakota Territory into two states, worth twice the political power. As the Plains later depopulated and American cities, then suburbs, swelled, the Senate became even more unrepresentative. First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

Privacy Policy Jeffersonian suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state capitals: Albany and not New York; Jefferson City and not St. Louis; Springfield and not Chicago. Political scientists at the University of California, Davis, have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state \u2014 typically closer to the geographical center of the state, and not the place where the most people already lived, breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals. The state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as America urbanized. In 1961, when lawyers in Tennessee brought what would be a seminal case before the Supreme Court challenging the practice, the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in 60 years. Maryland was still using districts drawn in 1867. Even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them. Florida, Georgia and New Mexico gave small counties 100 times the voting power of the most populous ones. In California, Amador County (population 14,294) had the same representation in the state\u2019s Senate as Los Angeles County (population 6,038,771). \u201cThey justified it because that was a cultural norm; it was just the way things were,\u201d said Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard professor of government. Rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them. \u201cThey just let it keep getting worse. You\u2019re in power. Why change?\u201d Photo A crowded Coney Island beach in Brooklyn in 1923. Credit Robert Sennecke/Ullstein Bild, via Getty Images By the mid-20th century, no state approximated majority rule. America at the time, Dr. Ansolabehere and James M. Snyder Jr. wrote in their book \u201cThe End of Inequality,\u201d had some of the most unequal representation in the world. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with that Tennessee complaint upended this system and established the standard that equal representation means \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d Not one town, one vote. Or one county, one senator. Only the United States Senate, protected by the Constitution, remained unchanged. Still, the House retains a rural bias. Republican voters are more efficiently distributed across the country than Democrats, who are concentrated in cities. That means that even when Democrats win 50 percent of voters nationwide, they invariably hold fewer than 50 percent of House seats, regardless of partisan gerrymandering. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Electoral College then allocates votes according to a state\u2019s congressional delegation: Wyoming (with one House representative and two senators) gets three votes; California (53 representatives and two senators) gets 55. Those two senators effectively give Wyoming three times more power in the Electoral College than its population would suggest. Apply the same math to California and it would have 159 Electoral College votes. And the entire state of Wyoming already has fewer residents than the average California congressional district. In Washington, these imbalances directly influence who gets what, through small-state minimums (no state can receive below a certain share of education funding) and through formulas that privilege rural states (early road spending was doled out in part by land area and not road use). There are policy reasons that the country might want to disproportionately spend resources on places with few people. Repairing an interstate highway in rural Oklahoma keeps national commerce flowing. And when the private market won\u2019t build essential infrastructure, public investments like the New Deal\u2019s rural electrification help fight poverty. But even when you control for policy need, Dr. Lee\u2019s research has found that a significant rural bias in resources persists. You can see it in Homeland Security funding that gave Wyoming, for example, seven times as much money per capita as New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. You can see it in Alaska\u2019s proposed \u201cbridge to nowhere.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d Dr. Ansolabehere said, \u201cAlaska has so much disproportionate power in the negotiation over funds that in order for California to get some, Alaska gets a lot \u2014 to the point of not knowing what to spend the money on.\u201d These calculations also mean that populous states subsidize less populous ones, which receive more resources than the tax dollars they send to Washington. The challenge for rural voters now is that their electoral strength, and even these funding formulas, have not translated into policies that have fixed the deep economic problems they face, from high unemployment to declining wages. And it\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump will do that for them, either \u2014 even if his major infrastructure proposal comes to pass and helps rebuild their roads. If he can\u2019t, rural voters may stray from his party again. In that future, the rural bias in American politics would persist. But Democrats might yet have a chance to blunt its effects.

He said he will live in the White House, while wife Melania and son Barron will follow \"right after he finishes school.\" The New York Post first reported Sunday that Melania, 46, would not move into the White House immediately following her husband's inauguration in January.\u00a0 \"Melania is extremely close to Barron, and they have become closer during the campaign,\u201d a Trump source told the paper. \u201cThe campaign has been difficult for Barron, and she is really hoping to keep disruption to a minimum.\" Trump lives with his wife and son in the penthouse apartment at Trump Tower in New York City. Barron attends a private school in the city. Trump is not the first recent president to move to the White House with school age children. When President Barack Obama took office, daughters Sasha and Malia were 10 and 7. When Bill Clinton came to Washington, Chelsea Clinton was 12. All three White House kids moved during the school year and attended the Sidwell Friends, a private school in northwest Washington.

USA TODAY Sports NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Jimmie Johnson (48) celebrates winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup championship after the Ford Ecoboost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) HOMESTEAD, Fla.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Jimmie Johnson already was the greatest driver in NASCAR history before Sunday night, when he won his record-tying seventh Cup Series championship. Five titles in a row during NASCAR\u2019s most competitive era, plus another three years later, was enough to determine that. But now that Johnson has No. 7, tied with Richard Petty and the late Dale Earnhardt Sr., there\u2019s no disputing he\u2019ll be a permanent fixture on NASCAR\u2019s Mt. Rushmore no matter what drivers come along in future generations. Even though it may have taken a few minutes for the feat to sink in for Johnson. Jimmie Johnson wins record-tying seventh Sprint Cup championship \u201cThere is no way on Earth,\u201d Johnson said in disbelief. \u201cJust beyond words. Didn\u2019t think the race was unfolding for us like we needed to be the champs, but we just kept our heads in the game. Luck came our way and we were able to win the race and win the championship.\u201d Johnson, 41, might not be done yet. Paired with Chad Knaus \u2014 himself now just one shy of the championship record for crew chiefs with eight titles, a record held by Dale Inman \u2014 there could be more titles to come. How high can Johnson set the bar? Maybe he can stand alone at the top with No. 8. He\u2019ll certainly have a good shot again next season. \"You think about what it would mean to see Jimmie get eight \u2014 especially under several different formats,\" team owner Rick Hendrick said.\u00a0\"I\u2019m excited to see he and Chad try to break the record now, because we\u2019re tied. And you can\u2019t get to eight until you get to seven.\" But whether this is the last one or not, it certainly will be remembered for years. Critics tried to dismiss Johnson\u2019s five in a row from 2006-10 as one incredible hot streak, a product of a Chase format that valued late-season excellence over season-long consistency. Sunday, though, puts a huge dent in that argument. No one handed Johnson anything this year, as he fought through one of Hendrick Motorsports\u2019 worst seasons as a company just to make it to the finale. Then his car was found to have illegal modifications before the race, and NASCAR forced him to start in the back of the field. That might have been a blow for many teams in such a stressful situation, but Johnson and his crew just shook it off. He already was in the top five less than 50 laps into the race \u2014 though he couldn\u2019t maintain his spot. In fact, Johnson was an afterthought for most of the night. As rivals Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards and Joey Logano raced far ahead of him, Johnson was mired around 10th place. At one point, Knaus was just making changes to the car out of desperation, and it seemed this wouldn\u2019t be his year. But that\u2019s the danger about the No. 48 team: You can never count it out. There were so many times during his five straight titles where he overcame all kinds of adversity, and it happened again Sunday. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Press 9:07 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 x Share One of the songs in Hamilton says, \u201chistory has its eyes on you\u201d\u2014and when Vice President-elect Mike Pence saw the Broadway musical Friday night, the cast directed that message at him. Time Steven Van Zandt and wife Maureen attend the 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards held at Staples Center on February 12, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo: Larry Busacca) ASBURY PARK, N.J. \u2014 It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s when you say it. Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band, one who is not shy about making pointed political statements, feels the cast of Hamilton: An American Musical\u00a0bullied Vice President-elect Mike Pence when a cast member addressed Pence from the stage at Friday night's\u00a0performance. \u201cIt was the most respectful, benign form of bullying ever. But bullying nonetheless. And by the way, human rights must be won, not asked for,\u201d said Van Zandt in a series of tweets on Saturday. \u201cWhen artists perform the venue becomes your home. The audience are your guests. It\u2019s taking unfair advantage of someone who thought they were a protected guest in your home.\u201d Social media explodes over 'Hamilton'/Trump duel \u201cA guy comes to a Broadway show for a relaxing night out. Instead he gets a lecture from the stage! Not a level playing field. It\u2019s bullying. You don\u2019t single out an audience member and embarrass him from the stage. A terrible precedent to set.\u201d Cast member Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, delivered a speech following the performance as Pence was exiting the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway in New York City. Dixon called on Pence to stay and hear his message: \u201cVice-president elect Mike Pence, we welcome you and truly thank you for joining us at Hamilton American Musical,\u201d said Dixon in the statement, which was distributed on social media by the Hamilton\u00a0producers. \u201cWe sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\u201d Tonight, VP-Elect Mike Pence attended #HamiltonBway . After the show, @BrandonVDixon delivered the following statement on behalf of the show. pic.twitter.com/Jsg9Q1pMZs \u2014 Hamilton (@HamiltonMusical) November 19, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump didn\u2019t like it. \u201cOur wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!\u201d Trump tweeted on the morning of Nov. 19. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d Trump later tweeted\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0that Hamilton\u00a0was \"highly overrated.\" Pence, also on Sunday, said that he was not offended by the Hamilton\u00a0statement. Trump  slams 'SNL,' doubles down on 'Hamilton' \u201cI did hear what was said from the stage, and I can tell you I wasn\u2019t offended by what was said. I\u2019ll leave to others whether that was the appropriate venue to say it,\u201d said Pence to Fox News Sunday. For Van Zandt, it was about the civility of the moment. \u201cThe statement is beautiful. And completely inappropriate at that time. And I would defend the cast\u2019s right to be inappropriate forever,\u201d Van Zandt said. \u201cThat statement may prove to be correct for these men in their new positions, we\u2019ll see. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have to lose our civility.\u201d Van Zandt knows his way around the Richard Rodgers theater as that\u2019s where he and wife Maureen Van Zandt produced the hit \u201cThe Rascals: Once Upon a Dream.\u201d The Van Zandts are joining with music man Paul Shaffer and Joe Grano of \u201cJersey Boys\u201d fame to produce the upcoming \u201cPiece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story.\u201d As for political activism, Van Zandt is best known for leading the \u00a01985 \u201cSun City\u201d album, which featured Bono, Miles Davis, Bruce Springsteen, Run-DMC and more. The project called on artists to boycott Sun City in South Africa, which at the time was an apartheid state. It was the most respectful, benign form of bullying ever. But bullying nonetheless. And by the way, human rights must be won, not asked for. https://t.co/JfN4yjq8jM \u2014 Stevie Van Zandt (@StevieVanZandt) November 19, 2016 Van Zandt did not endorse Pence or Trump\u2019s politics in his tweets. \u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand,\u201d Van Zandt said. \u201cEveryone who is sane disagrees with his policies. This was not the time or place to do it is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d E Street Bandmate Nils Lofgren, on the other hand, \u00a0had no problem with the timing of Dixon\u2019s statement. ",
