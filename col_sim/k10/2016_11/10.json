Now with his victory \u2014 in a campaign marked by degrading language about women that sharply divided male and female voters \u2014 many women are expressing concern about what his administration might mean for their reproductive rights and health care options. As women flooded social media last night and today urging others to get birth control now, Planned Parenthood issued a statement on where it stands.\u00a0 \u201cThese doors stay open,\u201d the organization tweeted.\u00a0 But\u00a0 Cecile Richards , President of\u00a0 Planned Parenthood \u00a0Action Fund, sounded a worried tone. \u201cThere are almost no words to capture the threat that this election result poses to our democracy, to our economic security, to access to reproductive health care and most especially to the safety and dignity of people of color,\u201d she said in the statement. These doors stay open. pic.twitter.com/YqrMBnWflM \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) November 9, 2016 Richards raised alarms over Trump\u2019s campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 after he takes office. If it happens, insurance companies would no longer be required to cover birth control with no copay and young adults under the age of 26 will no longer be guaranteed coverage on parents\u2019 plans. Interview with president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund Cecile Richards Speaking to CBS News last month, Richards \u2014 who campaigned for Hillary Clinton \u2014 said 55 million women now have access to preventive care with no copay and no cost. In today\u2019s statement, Richards said: \u201cWe will fight alongside our partners to make sure that the progress of the past eight years, including emerging from the worst recession we\u2019ve had in close to a century, expanding health care coverage to more than 20 million Americans, breaking down barriers of discrimination and racism, and upholding marriage equality, is protected. We cannot allow the acceptance of institutionalized racism, sexism, and discrimination to become our new normal.\u201d Meanwhile, women on Twitter \u00a0encouraged others to get a prescription for an IUD \u2014a long-term birth control device \u2014 before it\u2019s too late. \u201cGet an IUD tomorrow,\u201d tweeted @MorningGloria in all capital letters. (She also suggested her followers get a Canadian boyfriend, like herself.) GET AN IUD TOMORROW \u2014 Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) November 9, 2016 IF YOU CAN GET PREGNANT: TRY TO GET AN IUD IN THE NEXT 70 DAYS WHILE YOU ARE STILL COVERED. \u2014 nurse lyons (@seelions) November 9, 2016 Get an IUD before Trump is sworn in, it will last through his women's health hating administration- \u2014 No. (@faith_schaffer) November 9, 2016 Republicans in Congress voted to bar Planned Parenthood from receiving about $500 million in federal funds, but Democrats held off the attempt last year. Now the fate of that funding is likely to be in the balance again. Trump\u2019s soon-to-be vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , is a conservative Republican and fierce critic of abortion who championed a restrictive law in his state that bans abortion due to a genetic abnormality of the fetus. In March, Trump drew heavy criticism when he said there should be \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who seek abortions, though he later revised that and only said their doctors should be penalized. Richards said the majority of Americans, including Trump\u2019s own voters, support access to health care at Planned Parenthood and want abortion to stay legal and safe. \u201cWe will fight to make sure those rights are protected and that people can still access the care they need. We will not give up, we will not back down, and we will not be silenced,\u201d she said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Who will be in Trump's Cabinet? A few possibilities David M Jackson , USA TODAY 6:17 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 4.7k Shares Share Several big names are in the running. Time After a stunning win that upended the American political landscape, President-elect Donald Trump and his top advisers now must\u00a0put together a White House staff and Cabinet \u2014 a group that may well include some of those same advisers. Here are a few possibilities for some of the most powerful\u00a0roles in a new Trump administration : Rudy Giuliani The ex-New York City mayor became one of Trump's highest-profile surrogates. The former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney general. Newt Gingrich The ex-House speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson\u00a0for Trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul's finalists for running mate. He is said to be interested in becoming secretary of State. Bob Corker The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also be a possibility to lead the State Department. Ben Carson A onetime Trump\u00a0rival, Carson emerged as one of Trump's most steadfast surrogates. The renowned physician would be an obvious candidate to be surgeon general. Mike Flynn The retired general emerged as Trump's\u00a0most visible military adviser. He could be in line for Defense secretary or some other national security position. Jeff Sessions During the primary campaign, Sessions\u00a0became the first sitting member of the U.S. Senate to endorse Trump's campaign. Now, the Alabama senator could be another possibility to lead the Pentagon. Reince Priebus The chairman of the Republican National Committee \u2014\u00a0which ran the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operation \u2014 could wind up as Trump's White House chief of staff. Steve Mnuchin\u00a0 Trump's finance chairman, formerly of Goldman Sachs,\u00a0is in line to possibly become Treasury secretary. Chris Christie Though shadowed by the recent Bridgegate trial, the New Jersey governor has been a fixture at Trump's side since endorsing him in February and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the Justice Department or in the White House. Steve Bannon The Breitbart News executive became Trump's campaign CEO in August. He could be in line for a spot as a White House adviser. Mike Pence While his job is already known\u00a0\u2014\u00a0vice president\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the Indiana governor and former congressman is expected to play a large role in the Trump administration as a partner to the \u00a0new president, who lacks any experience serving in government.

News 4:52 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 x Share Authorities said that investigators discovered a third body on the property of Todd Kohlhepp, who is now linked to seven deaths and the kidnapping of a woman who was recently found chained up in a storage container near the man's house. USA TODAY Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger identifies two bodies found on Todd Kohlhepp's property in Woodruff on Wednesday, November 9, 2016. (Photo: LAUREN PETRACCA/Staff) GREENVILLE, S.C. \u2014 A husband and wife from Spartanburg were identified as the two bodies unearthed on property owned by a man charged with murder and kidnapping, the Spartanburg County coroner said Wednesday afternoon. Meagan Coxie, 25 and her husband, Johnny Coxie, 29, were believed to have been killed late last year, Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger said. Meagan Coxie was shot in the head and Johnny Coxie was shot in the torso, Clevenger said. They were identified with the help of their extensive tattoos, he said. The couple were reported missing in December and\u00a0had recently been released from jail, said Lt. Kevin Bobo, spokesman for the Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The couple had a history of panhandling, Bobo said. Property owner Todd Kohlhepp, 45, is charged with four counts of murder and the kidnapping of an Anderson woman, who was rescued from a metal storage container Thursday by law enforcement officers who were searching the property. How did Todd Kohlhepp acquire guns? 'Good question' The Coxies\u2019 bodies were found in shallow graves on the 95-acre property belong the real estate agent and convicted sex offender after he led investigators to their locations. The murder charges are related to\u00a02003\u00a0homicides in Chesnee. Kohlhepp confessed to those shootings\u00a0Saturday, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. A third body found on Kohlhepp's land on Friday was identified as Charles Carver, an Anderson man who was reported missing in September after disappearing in late August along with his girlfriend, Kala Brown. Investigators found Brown \"chained like a dog\" inside the storage container on the property near Woodruff on Thursday. The container in was removed from the property Wednesday afternoon on a flatbed truck. Kohlhepp has not been charged in Carver's death. 87 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ffEXZw ",

    "text": "Election Victory Won't Shield Trump From Legal Woes By Brian Ross Nov 9, 2016, 9:58 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH After Election Victory, Trump Still Embroiled in Lawsuits 0 Shares Email Even as president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump will not be free from the legal and regulatory issues that have dogged him as a businessman and became sticking points in his contentious 2016 campaign. There's the civil fraud trial involving Trump University , which is set to begin at the end of this month. The mogul-turned-politician says his taxes, which he has not released publicly, remain under audit by the IRS. And the attorney general of New York has opened an inquiry into Trump's charity, the Trump Foundation. The lawsuit involving Trump University, for which Trump is expected to appear in court to answer questions, is one of dozens that he or his associated organizations face. From Russia With Trump: A Political Conflict Zone The Supreme Court has ruled that becoming president of the United States does not shield an individual from private litigation concerning matters that took place before he or she takes the oath of office \u2014 as then-President Bill Clinton discovered in 1997 in a case from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones concerning allegations of sexual advances . In that case, the nation's highest court said that any protections extended to the president in civil litigation are designed to safeguard official acts, not unofficial ones. \"It must follow that the federal courts have power to determine the legality of the president's unofficial conduct,\" the 1997 ruling said. There's also the matter of Trump's international businesses and moves he will have to make to avoid conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization has stakes in existing and prospective real estate projects around the globe. Presidents in the past have placed business interests in a blind trust to avoid the appearance of a conflict, but Trump has said he'll simply allow his children to make all the decisions. The family refers to that arrangement as a blind trust, but experts told ABC News it most likely would not fill the bill. \"I don't see how you have a blind trust when you know what's in the blind trust,\" said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as an ethics adviser to Republican President George W. Bush. \"The appearance is that a foreign government or other foreign organization has influence over the president of the United States through financial dealings with his family, and that would be unacceptable.\" An earlier ABC News investigation found Trump has numerous connections to Russian interests in the U.S. and abroad \u2014 involving hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Sergei Millian, a Russian businessman who says he once helped market Trump's U.S. condos in Russia and other former Soviet states. Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the dismay of fellow Republicans, said in July that the Trump team \"will be looking at\" lifting sanctions on Russia \u2014 a move that could benefit the Trump family. Trump Organization attorney Alan Garten has downplayed Trump's links to Russia and said that no one in the organization could recall Millian's name. Trump, Garten and Trump's campaign have pushed back on the legal actions against him as well. In the case of the probe into the Trump Foundation, a Trump adviser said in September it was all a \"left-wing hit job.\" Trump also denied the allegations against Trump University, saying at a campaign rally that he could have settled that suit long ago, but he \"[doesn't] want to settle cases when we are right.\" A spokesperson for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who brought one of the suits against Trump University, told ABC News that as of today, that litigation \"continues to move through the appellate process.\" The AG's office declined to comment on the Trump Foundation, as it's the subject of an \"ongoing investigation.\" ",

    "text": "AP Last Updated Nov 9, 2016 1:44 PM EST HAVANA -- Cubans worried on Wednesday that President Trump would throw the United States\u2019 2-year-old detente with Cuba into reverse, erasing their hopes for a more prosperous future of normal ties with Washington. President-elect Donald Trump calls for unity in victory speech The Cuban government, meanwhile, announced the launch of five days of nationwide military exercises to prepare troops to confront what it called \u201ca range of actions by the enemy,\u201d using terminology that almost always refers to the United States. The government did not link the exercises to Donald Trump \u2019s U.S. presidential victory, but the announcement of maneuvers and tactical exercises across the country came nearly simultaneously with Trump\u2019s surprise win. It was the seventh time Cuba has held what it calls the Bastion Strategic Exercise, often in response to points of high tension with the United States. View Gallery Cuban ceremonial troops stand at attention after being reviewed by President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro at the Palace of the Revolution March 21, 2016, in Havana, Cuba. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Trump has promised to reverse President Obama \u2019s opening unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedom on the island, a concession considered a virtual impossibility. Many Cubans said they feared they were on the verge of losing the few improvements they had seen in their lives thanks to a post-detente boom in tourism. Along with a surge in visitors, normalization has set off visits by hundreds of executives from the U.S. and dozens of other nations newly interested in doing business on the island. World reaction to Trump's election ranging from shock to joy \u201cThe little we\u2019ve advanced, if he reverses it, it hurts us,\u201d taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. \u201cYou know tourism will go down. If Donald Trump wins and turns everything back it\u2019s really bad for us.\u201d The first Bastion Strategic Exercise was launched in 1980 after the election of Ronald Reagan as U.S. president, according to an official history. The announcement by Cuba\u2019s Revolutionary Armed Forces in red ink across the top of the front page of the country\u2019s main newspaper Wednesday said the army, Interior Ministry and other forces would be conducting maneuvers and different types of tactical exercises from the 16th to the 20th of November. What could a Trump administration bring to office? It warned citizens that the exercises would include \u201cmovements of troops and war materiel, overflights and explosions in the cases where they\u2019re required.\u201d Speaking of Cuba\u2019s leaders, Communist Party member and noted economist and political scientist Esteban Morales told the Telesur network: \u201cThey must be worried because I think this represents a new chapter.\u201d Carlos Alzugaray, a political scientist and retired Cuban diplomat, said the Trump victory could please some hard-liners in the Cuban leadership who worried that Cuba was moving too close to the United States too quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of rejection of what\u2019s been done with Obama,\u201d Alzugaray said. \u201cMany Cubans think that a situation of confrontation is better for the revolution.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Eric Charbonneau, Eric Charbonneau/Invision/AP) 10 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Brad Pitt just got a major break in his contentious divorce with Angelina Jolie. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Department of Children and\u00a0Family Services decided\u00a0 that Pitt did not commit child abuse during a family dispute\u00a0on a private\u00a0plane as they traveled back from France to the U.S. in September,  a source familiar with\u00a0the report that was not authorized to speak publicly tells USA TODAY. That's a big win for the actor, who is currently fighting for joint custody of their six children, who range in age from 8 to 15.\u00a0Jolie, who filed for divorce on Sept. 22, is currently seeking sole custody.\u00a0 TMZ says the case was \"exhaustively\u00a0investigated.\" DCFS is barred by law from commenting on  investigations. Peter Walzer, a divorce attorney in Los Angeles who has represented celebrity clients, says the DCSF clearance is \"no surprise\" and it means the Jolie-Pitt divorce-and-custody matter will end up looking like similar disputes in Los Angeles County. \"It's an unwritten rule (the parties) get defacto joint physical custody, which is 50-50 time,\" Walzer says. \"It means shared time with the other parent. You have to work really hard not to get equal time in this county. And what that looks like is 2/2/5 \u2014\u00a0she gets them two days, he gets them two days and they alternative weekends Friday to Monday.\" But California law also gives the kids some say, especially if they're over 14. \"There is a statute that allows kids over 14 to tell the court what they want and the court must consider it,\" Walzer says. \"It doesn't mean they have to follow it but generally they do. When a kid says 'I don\u2019t want to be with dad or mom,' that\u2019s what's going to happen.The court has to consider what the kid wants to do.\" Brangelina custody 'agreement'? Not yet At the moment, under a temporary arrangement, the children are living with Jolie in a Malibu rented home, and Pitt has seen some of them during a handful of monitored visits. On Monday, Jolie's PR team released a statement saying she and Pitt had reached a  \"legal agreement\" continuing to give Jolie custody,\u00a0but sources familiar with the situation but\u00a0not authorized to speak publicly disputed that claim, telling USA TODAY permanent custody had not been determined. California divorce courts generally favor joint custody. Jolie and Pitt were together for 12 years and were married for\u00a0two years.\u00a0The pair recently began dividing up their assets, selling a home they purchased in New Orleans'\u00a0French Quarter\u00a0for $4.9 million. Pitt is expected to make an appearance for his new film Allied tonight in Los Angeles. USA TODAY  reached out to representatives for Pitt and Jolie for comment.

Chicago resident Audrey Lava, who is eight months pregnant, wiped away tears as she joined the protest outside the tower. \"I wanted to show my solidarity with people who are suffering.\" Lava said. \"And I wanted to show the rest of the world that not everyone in this country supports a fascist.\" Anti-Trump protestors at Chicago's Trump Tower Protestors at an anti-Trump rally chant \"not my president\" during a demonstration across the street from Trump Tower in Chicago. Nov. 9, 2016. (Nereida Moreno / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Protestors at an anti-Trump rally chant \"not my president\" during a demonstration across the street from Trump Tower in Chicago. Nov. 9, 2016. (Nereida Moreno / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 See more videos The protesters at one point filled all six lanes of North Michigan Avenue. Along the way they received both honks of support from motorists and angry responses from Trump supporters. \"Build the Wall!\" one Trump backer yelled at the crowd, referring to the former reality TV star's promise to build a wall on the Mexican border. Michael Burke, a resident of Edgewater, said he believes the president-elect will \"divide the country and stir up hatred.\" \"I think it's our constitutional duty to not to go quietly and accept that,\" he said. \"The Tower signifies everything that is ugly and boastful about this hateful man.\" Kathryn Schaffer brought her 3-year-old daughter, Clara, to protest at Trump Tower. \"She's a little too young to understand all of this but I don't know how I'm going to explain that the president of our country can say the things that he says,\" she said. Schaffer said she stayed up all night after hearing the news that Trump had won. She said the president-elect is not a good role model for her daughter. \"The president is supposed to be a role model for children and somebody that they look up to. I feel like if I stand by my values, I can't be quiet for the next four years. I have to be a role model if our president won't be,\" Schaffer said. Early on, about a half-dozen Trump supporters were allowed to stand in front of Trump Tower, while protesters were corralled across the street. Anthony Moreira of Berwyn waved an American flag and shouted at the anti-Trump to accept the results and go home. \"You're weak,\" he yelled. \"That's why you lost.\" He said the protestors grievances were baseless. \"Trump isn't a bigot,\" he said. \"If you look behind the back doors you'll see blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and all kinds of people working for him.\" The pro-trump crowd also included Birgitt Peterson, who gained brief notoriety during the campaign when a Tribune photographer captured her giving a Nazi-like salute as she exited an aborted Trump rally in Chicago. Waving a Trump sign and chanting U-S-A, Peterson said she wanted to celebrate her candidate's victory. \"We knew he was going to win,\" she said. \"They need to accept it.\" sstclair@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Mr. Trump has been consistent in some areas. Since the late 1980s, he has nurtured a set of preoccupations, chiefly that America\u2019s allies \u2013 Japan and Saudi Arabia among them \u2013 are ripping America off. He maintained that position even as Japan faded from the scene as a major world power and as Saudi Arabia emerged as one of America\u2019s most critical allies in a region of the world where Mr. Trump sees little reason for the United States to remain. In an interview in March, he had no compunction about threatening the kingdom\u2019s survivability. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a 100-minute conversation, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be around.\u201d The mystery is how much of that kind of talk arises from deeply held beliefs, and how much is an opening bid by the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cHe sees himself as a dealer, a negotiator who knows that you get nowhere unless you threaten,\u201d said Graham Allison, a longtime Harvard professor who has begun a new project in \u201capplied history,\u201d taking lessons from past moments to inform America\u2019s current strategic choices. Indeed, the world is about to discover whether the most outlandish promises Mr. Trump made in his campaign about rethinking the international order \u2013 thoughts that often seemed at best off the cuff \u2013 are about to become reality. Financial markets abroad panicked on Tuesday night, fearful that a Trump presidency would instantly send the country into uncertain economic territory that investors had discounted as wholly improbable just 24 hours ago. But there was a far more mild decline as Wall Street opened, suggesting that investors here saw other possibilities. Mr. Trump, who never argued with the notion that he is a protectionist , time and again vowed to punish companies that move jobs abroad, a task that would begin with the abolishment of Nafta, the trade agreement that once was envisioned, by President Bill Clinton, as the first step unifying the Western Hemisphere. To Mr. Trump, it is \u201ca disaster.\u201d The Trump vision, in fact, is an America unbound by a half-century of trade deals, free to pursue a nationalistic approach in which success is measured not by the quality of its alliances but the economic return on its transactions. \u201cWe will not be ripped off anymore,\u201d he said in the interview in March. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be friendly with everybody, but we\u2019re not going to be taken advantage of by anybody.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story He bristled at the suggestion that his wall-building, trade-deal-canceling views would take America back to an era of isolationism, arguing that he was simply freeing the United States from the binds of international rules that are not in the nation\u2019s interests. \u201cNot isolationist, but I am America first,\u201d he said when he was asked whether his own policies had echoes of the movement by the same name championed by Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s. \u201cI like the expression,\u201d he said of \u201cAmerica first.\u201d From that moment on, he began using it at his rallies, and it became the stuff of bumper stickers and chants. He is also unabashedly business first, and that extends to his tax proposals, which also leave the markets deeply uncertain. Starting with the day he descended the long escalator in Trump Tower in June 2015 to begin a quest almost no one thought would succeed, Mr. Trump laid out an agenda of tax cuts \u2013 modest for families, and sharp for businesses \u2013 that he argued would be the stimulus a sluggish economy needs. But he also paired those cuts with a major plan to rebuild America\u2019s dilapidated airports and collapsing bridges, with $137 billion in federal tax credits as an incentive for private industry to spend upward of a trillion more. While privatization is hardly a new idea, Mr. Trump has described an approach few have ever tried before \u2013 and it is far from clear how it would work. Presumably, users of that infrastructure would ultimately pay for it, in tolls and usage taxes, through a mechanism few understand. No one knows how much of this agenda, largely thrown together rather than the product of deep study and debate, is for real. His policy office in Washington, created to lay out the position-papers common to most campaigns, was gradually disbanded. He is famously volatile, capable of changing his mind in an instant if he sees new avenues for profit, all the while denying he had ever suggested another path. In Mr. Trump, Professor Allison sees a revolution in approach reminiscent of the 1828 election of Andrew Jackson, another populist who rode to power rebelling against what amounted to America\u2019s first Establishment. \u201cMy God,\u201d Professor Allison said on Tuesday night, as the results veered toward Mr. Trump. \u201cWe are in a strange new land.\u201d ",

USA TODAY NETWORK An attendee holds up a sign in support of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that reads \"Hispanics For Trump\" during the election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown on November 8, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) MIAMI\u00a0\u2014 The Hispanic vote was bigger and more influential in the 2016 presidential election, just as predicted, but it also provided one surprise: more\u00a0support for President-elect Donald Trump than expected. Hispanics favored Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton 65% to 29%, a 36-point difference that helped her secure winning margins in states like Nevada and Colorado and kept her competitive late into the night in other key battleground states. But that margin, based on exit polling conducted by Edison Research,\u00a0was smaller than the 71%-27% split that President Obama won in 2012. And it was smaller than the 72%-21% her husband, former president Bill Clinton, won in 1996. Hillary Clinton's final tally also ran counter to polls leading\u00a0up to Election Day that had Trump's support far lower, including a Latino Decisions poll conducted just before the election in eight swing states that estimated\u00a0Trump's support among Hispanics at just 18%. After a campaign that started with Trump referring to some Mexicans as rapists,\u00a0calling for mass\u00a0deportations and proposing a wall along the southwestern border, the final results left\u00a0Hispanics, immigration advocacy groups and polling experts scratching their heads. \"That's implausible,\" said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political science professor who studies public opinion and election voting behavior. Abramowitz and others figured Trump's support would be minimal. He said polling experts will spend the next few weeks crunching election data to see if there were flaws in the predictions or the exit polls. In 2004, for example, exit polls showed President George W. Bush winning 44% of the Hispanic vote, which was later revised down to 40% once more detailed voter information came out. \"We're going to see some debate about this question,\" Abramowitz said. President-elect Trump vows to bring nation 'together as never before' Despite the outcome, polling experts say a larger Hispanic margin for Clinton wouldn't have been able to swing the election. Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said Hispanics couldn't have offset\u00a0the massive gains Trump made with white voters from\u00a0Florida to North Carolina to Pennsylvania. \"You can't lay this on Hispanics,\" Smith said.\u00a0\"I don't think that's where the election was won or lost. It had to do with white, suburban voters, especially women, breaking much more for Trump than anyone expected.\" While pollsters begin sorting through the voting data, Hispanics who voted for Trump say they paid little attention to the polls and pundits anyway. Denise Galvez, a Cuban American who co-founded \"Latinas for Trump,\" said they all focused too heavily on Trump's bombastic rhetoric and ignored the quiet, growing share of the Hispanic electorate that was willing to understand his platform. Galvez said she never believed that he really wanted to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants or that he felt all Mexicans were rapists and drug dealers. \"I knew and acknowledged his faults,\" she said. \"But everybody took him out of context. How everybody extrapolates that he hates all Mexicans and he hates all Hispanics and he hates all immigrants is absolutely ridiculous.\" Instead, Galvez said, Trump pushed a reasonable immigration strategy that would target undocumented immigrants with criminal records, find a solution for those who are working hard in the U.S.\u00a0and finally gain control of the country's borders. For Josefina Rocabado, 50, who immigrated to Miami from the Dominican Republic in 1979, Trump's economic policies were more important. The insurance company manager said she felt insulted by the Clinton campaign's \"brainwashing\" of Hispanics by suggesting those who didn't support the Democrat\u00a0were betraying their roots rather than being\u00a0more motivated by other issues. \"Talk to me about what's happening in my house,\" Rocabado said. \"I have three kids, one with special needs. In the past eight years, we went from being in the middle class to the bottom of the middle class. We need to pay bills.\" Predictions that blacks, women and Millennials would not vote Trump proved largely untrue Antonio Salguero, 18, who was born in the U.S. to Guatemalan parents, said he had reservations about Trump\u00a0but thought too many Hispanics simply ignored Clinton's flaws. The first-time voter rattled off questions over the candidate's\u00a0handling of a private email server and her repeated \"lies\" throughout the election. \"If there was a better option, I would've voted for them,\" Salguero said. \"But (Trump) seemed better than Clinton.\" Tuesday's outcome may have upset many Hispanics in the U.S., but Abramowitz said there were signs of hope in the long term as the size of the Hispanic population continues to grow. The Hispanic share of the national vote\u00a0rose from 8% in 2004 to 10% in 2012 to 11% in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center and exit polling conducted by Edison Research. Abramowitz said that resulted in diminishing Republican leads in states like Arizona and Texas. He pointed to more Hispanics playing a factor in Southern states like Georgia. And he said the share of the white vote will only continue to fall. \"In the long term, that's a significant thing,\" he said. \"In this election, it wasn't nearly enough to swing those states. But that's a trend that is only going to continue.\" 3669 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 79 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ffKWO2 ",

(Photo: Wu-Tang Clan by Alex Henry/Shkreli by EPA) In late October, former pharmaceutical company CEO Martin Shkreli tweeted that he would release his unreleased music collection \u2014 which he claimed included unheard recordings by the Beatles and Nirvana \u2014 for free if Donald Trump won the presidential election. Tuesday night he began making good on his promise. If Trump wins, my entire unreleased music collection, including unheard Nirvana, Beatles, and of course, Wu-Tang, comes out, for free. \u2014 Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) October 27, 2016 Earlier this year, Shkreli also purchased the only available copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,\u00a0the latest album by hip-hop collective the Wu-Tang Clan, for $2 million.\u00a0Late Tuesday night, Shkreli livestreamed video of himself playing a portion of the\u00a0record. \"I've got to decide how to put out \u2014 there's about 30, 35 tracks,\" he said during the clip. \"I actually have a contract with the Wu-Tang Clan where I'm not allowed to do this. Obviously, I own the music and I bought it and paid a lot of money for it. In many ways, the contract shouldn't matter that much. But I am a man of my word; I had to play a little bit of it...but I've got to keep my word to them, too.\" Shkreli made headlines in 2015 when the company he founded, Turing Pharmaceuticals,\u00a0 acquired the drug Daraprim and raised the price \u00a0by 5,000 percent.

The key subject of the briefing is filling cabinet posts. Trump will be presented the top recommendations for cabinet secretaries. The team is also prepared to vet any additional names Trump may mention for consideration.\u00a0 The transition, sources said, will be carried out in New York, where senior staff will meet with Trump regularly, and in a large Washington, D.C.-based office established for transition work. Most of the president-elect\u2019s transition team will work out of the D.C. office. Top-level briefings will be conducted at Trump Tower. The transition team completed all transition binders on schedule last Thursday. They covered cabinet secretaries, domestic and foreign policy, White House operations, timelines for the transition and national security.\u00a0 At this stage, the two dominant Trump transition advisers are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, both of whom the president-elect mentioned in his early morning victory remarks. The leading candidate to become White House Chief of Staff, sources said, is RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.\u00a0 Trump called Priebus an \u201call-star\u201d in his victory remarks and allowed him to make a brief statement at the podium. Sources said Priebus is open to taking the post and many Republicans consider him the best conduit between Trump, a sure-fire outsider, and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Non-political, career intelligence agents are waiting to brief the campaign and president-elect as soon as his team requests it. They are not part of Trump\u2019s internal transition meetings today.\u00a0 President Obama has already authorized guidance on the type of intelligence he deems important for the president-elect to get briefings on. Up until January 20th, Mr. Obama will be able to weigh in and authorize what is disclosed.\u00a0 As soon as Trump selects his cabinet appointees, the intelligence community will expedite their security clearances. Once that happens, they will also receive briefings. Separately, the intelligence community has not concluded its probe into Russian influence on the election.

Trump Tower, the primary residence of President-elect Donald Trump, happens to sit on one of the busiest thoroughfares in Manhattan. The city, no stranger to traffic jams, could be in for even more headaches. While other presidents have had remote havens and carefully selected homes on quiet streets, Trump Tower is an apartment building with office and commercial space on a shared block with city buses, taxi cabs and private vehicles humming alongside it. Tourists flood the area and its surrounding high-end stores. It's hard to imagine the Secret Service roping off a full street as they did at Hillary Clinton's Chappaqua, New York residence, only allowing neighbors to drive near her home. On a rainy Wednesday just hours after Trump shocked the nation with an upset win, the New York Police Department began setting up more permanent security measures. NBC News observed a mobile command post being installed; cement barricades began to join the sand-filled trucks put in place for election night security. Metal fencing roped off parts of surrounding blocks, derailing wayward tourists and surprising neighborhood workers looking for lunch. Mere feet away, a woman tried to burn a flag \u2014 a task derailed by the rain and apparent non-flammable material \u2014 while pedestrians scolded her, insisting she should leave the country as cops stood nearby. (Burning a flag is not illegal; starting a fire on Fifth Avenue would be.) This woman is trying to burn a flag outside Trump Tower pic.twitter.com/OR7uOePWsH \u2014 Jane C. Timm (@janestreet) November 9, 2016 \"We are assisting the Secret Service with security measures for the president-elect,\" an NYPD spokesman told NBC News. While Trump's personal safety is guarded by the Secret Service, vehicle and pedestrian traffic in and around the building \u2014 which was mandated in its construction to provide public space areas \u2014 will likely be handled by the NYPD's uniformed officers. The NYPD will likely release more information in the near future on what restrictions may be put into place for pedestrian and vehicular traffic near the Trump Tower. Nearby, two young women jumped up and down for a gleeful photo in front of the Trump Tower sign. \"He promises a lot more things \u2014 creating jobs. We need a businessman here. You never get any jobs from a poor person,\" California resident Yoli Bachar, 37, told NBC News after posing for the photo. She rejected the idea that Latino voters like herself opposed Trump for his divisive remarks. \"He's going to, you know, support everyone.\" Protester outside Trump Tower earlier pic.twitter.com/9JKoJdH0MK \u2014 Jane C.

It's time to reinvent the party. Hillary Clinton with Bill Clinton and Tim Kaine in New York City on Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: Pool photo by Olivier Douliery) Hillary Clinton lost, but I failed. I failed millions of immigrants who\u2019ve been assured they\u2019ll be rounded up. I failed the Muslim Americans, African Americans and other minorities who have been reminded that they\u2019re all suspects in their own homes.\u00a0I failed the 20 million Americans, many of them previously uninsurable, who may now lose their health coverage , possibly forever. I failed above all to imagine that anyone would see Donald Trump as anything but a Macy\u2019s Day Parade float filled with insecurities, greed and gas. I couldn\u2019t imagine that America would replace the first African-American president with a birther\u00a0championed by the KKK and Chachi from Happy Days . \u00a0 I couldn\u2019t imagine that\u00a0 more than half of white women would chose a beauty pageant nabob accused of being a serial groper over the first woman major-party nominee in American history. And I couldn\u2019t imagine that the best polling, the best ground game, the best strategists ever assembled would get\u00a0beaten by a guy who\u2019d mastered little\u00a0in his life but\u00a0the art of firing people on TV. I was so freaked out by Trump and his ability to lie, insult and contradict himself with impunity that I made the same mistake the Clinton campaign seemed to make.\u00a0I thought outrage would be enough. GOP should hope it loses Congress: Jason Sattler Nope. Not compared to Trump \u2014 a walking nuclear reactor of white grievance . His own insufferable words deployed in ad after ad weren\u2019t enough to destroy him. They might even have helped him with his bigger than life \u201ctells it like it is\u201d shtick that made him feel like the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man sent to save his fans from the threat of female Ghostbusters. He promised his supporters that he was the antidote \u2014 or the poison \u2014 to the dynastic and incestuous world of Washington, D.C. politics personified by his opponent. And his traveling demolition derby of contempt and threats, with the press trapped in a little pen to be sneered at, proved his point on a daily basis. Clinton promised us that she would save us from this maniac while keeping President Obama\u2019s legacy intact. Trump promised his supporters a better life. He won, even if hundreds of thousands more Americans voted for Clinton. Now he has to deliver. And Democrats \u2014 for the first time in 24 years \u2014 must reimagine our party without the Clintons. This has to start with recognizing the tremendous advantages Republicans have tailored over the past 40 years. They have their own media and their own majority gerrymandered out of a minority of Americans. They have a massive infrastructure of well-paid academics, organizers and functionaries. Thus their candidates and their staffs enter office far more prepared to make their power and policies permanent. Will Donald Trump rise to his moment?: Paul Brandus Democrats need to replicate what the right as built as we prepare to resist any effort by Trump and the GOP to bash away at the few institutions that still protect the middle class, the climate and the most vulnerable. We can start by examining Information, Inequality, and Mass Polarization : Ideology in Advanced Democracies\u00a0by political scientists Torben Iversen and David Soskice, as Lee Drutman did last year. \u201cThose who are less well-off need unions and public education to get them the political information they need to self-place in line with their economic interests,\u201d Drutman found. \u201cThe rich do not.\u201d Trump voters sure felt as if they were voting in their own interests \u2014 and that main interest seemed to be revenge. But do they have any idea how Trump\u2019s actual policies will affect their lives? Did Trump voters know they were voting to give the rich trillions in tax breaks at a time when income inequality is near all-time highs? Did they know they were voting to roll back the Wall Street\u00a0reforms designed to prevent the sort\u00a0of crash we saw in 2008, which\u00a0killed far more jobs than any trade deal ever could? Did they have\u00a0any idea if Trump would sign House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to turn Medicare into a privatized system that resembles Obamacare? How could they? ",

For most of the last four months, the\u00a0 USC/L.A.\u00a0Times Daybreak tracking poll has been the great outlier of the 2016 campaign -- consistently showing a better result for Donald Trump than other surveys did. In light of Tuesday\u2019s election returns, the poll now looks like the only major survey to see... (David Lauter) The tracking poll was not perfect, of course; it projected Trump to win in the popular vote by slightly more than 3 percentage points, but in reality Hillary Clinton seems set to gain a slender popular vote majority, currently about 0.2%. Her margin could expand as late ballots are counted in heavily Democratic California. That result, however, was well within the poll\u2019s margin of error. The more crucial point was that the poll correctly detected Trump\u2019s appeal to a key bloc of voters: conservative whites who had sat out the 2012 election but intended to vote this year. That group strongly favored Trump , the poll found. The poll\u2019s ability to pick up those voters, Kapteyn said, stemmed from its approach, which differs notably from the one used by most major surveys. Instead of asking people to simply choose between the candidates, the Daybreak survey asked respondents to rate, on a scale from 0 to 100, their chance of voting for Trump, Clinton or some other candidate. The poll also asked people to use the same 0-100 scale to rate their likelihood of voting. That method, which Kapteyn had used four years ago to accurately forecast President Obama\u2019s reelection, \u201cis the most important part\u201d of what the poll demonstrated, he said. By asking people to give a probability, the poll avoided forcing voters into making a decision before they were truly ready. As a result, it may have more accurately captured the ambiguity many people felt about their choice. Moreover, by asking participants to rate their chance of voting, the poll could take advantage of information from everyone in its sample group, rather than cast aside those who do not meet a test for being a \u201clikely voter,\u201d as most traditional surveys do. \u201cOne of the ways in which other polls may have gone wrong is that they have a hard time defining who is going to vote,\u201d he said. Polling firms \u201cshould look at their likely voter model\u201d and think about whether they are excluding too many potential voters, he said. The polling profession plans to review why so many of this year\u2019s general election polls were inaccurate. The American Assn. for Public Opinion Research, the professional  group for pollsters, has set up a committee to study the polls and report back by May. Unlike many pollsters, Kapteyn, 70, is neither a political scientist nor a political activist. His work on predicting election results is an outgrowth of his main research interest on how people make decisions on their finances. The fact that he could approach the poll as a science project provided some mental insulation from the criticism the poll drew during the last few months. \u201cThere was some flak,\u201d he said. Among other researchers, however, the response all along had been more appreciative, he said. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018You may be wrong. We think you\u2019re wrong, but we understand what you\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIn science, you don\u2019t have to be right to do something useful,\u201d he said, noting that even if the test of a new method fails, researchers can learn from it. This time, however, as was the case in 2012, the test succeeded.\u00a0It was not, however, the outcome he wanted. \u201cI\u2019m very unhappy\u201d about Trump\u2019s victory, he said.\u00a0\u201cBut that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Nov 9, 2016 4:04 PM EST Stocks saw solid gains Wednesday, defying expectations of a slump in financial markets following Donald Trump \u2018s stunning victory in the the U.S. presidential race . Global markets, which had been jittery over the prospect of a Trump administration in recent weeks, plunged overnight after it became apparent that he was leading at the polls.\u00a0 What will President Obama and Donald Trump talk about at the White House? The Dow Jones industrial index flirted with record territory, shooting up 257 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 18,589. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 24 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite added 58 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,258. U.S. bond yields have surged in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, a sign that investors think the outlook for the U.S. economy remains positive. The yield, or interest rate, on the U.S.\u2019s ten-year bonds is up 0.08 percentage point at 1.948 percent. That has helped the dollar recover its poise following earlier losses when Trump\u2019s victory became increasingly likely. The euro, for example, is now basically flat on the day at $1.1025. European stocks also closed higher after markets recovered from early losses. Germany\u2019s DAX ended the day 1.6 percent higher at 10,646.01 while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 1 percent to 6,911.84. France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 1.5 percent to 4,543.48. All the indexes were lower earlier in the day. Trump supporters react One reason investors may be signaling their approval is that Trump\u2019s election could short-circuit possible plans by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as December, as many Wall Street analysts had expected.\u00a0 Trump also sounded a conciliatory tone in his victory speech, encouraging hope that he could moderate some of his more extreme positions once in the White House.\u00a0 \u201c[W]e doubt that Trump will follow through fully on his threats to impose large trade tariffs on Mexico or China, or to withdraw from existing deals (even though he does have a lot of leeway to do so without congressional approval),\u201d economists with Capital Economics said in a client note. Still, the outcome of the election proved a massive surprise for economic and market analysts, who overwhelmingly predicted a victory for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The result also delivered a historic electoral mandate for Republicans, who will have control of Congress beginning in January. The last time Republicans controlled the White House, Senate and House was in 1928, when California Republican Herbert Hoover beat New York Democrat Al Smith. Uncertainty in global financial markets after Trump's victory Investors scrambled Monday to digest the impact of the election on issues including global trade, taxes, monetary policy, health care, financial regulation and immigration. The gains Wednesday were led by drugmakers, which would have faced the likelihood of price controls under Clinton. Pfizer ( PFE ) jumped soared 8 percent, the biggest gain on the Dow. Hospital operators sank. Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act. HCA Holdings ( HCA ) plunged 14 percent. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory in the presidential election is likely to bring a set of policies that diverge sharply from those of the prior administration,\u201d said Robard Williams, senior vice president of Credit Strategy and Standards at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, in a note. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic For quite some time now, economists have been warning that the reliance of governments in the United States and elsewhere on central banks to energize economies via zero interest-rate policies and buying back securities was creating an uneven recovery by bolstering the housing markets in New York, London and San Francisco while real economies lagged. \u201cThe economic recovery under President Obama never reached deep enough \u2014 it did not bring working-class people up,\u201d said Justin Gest, a public policy expert who has just written a book analyzing how working-class men and women in the United States and Britain have become alienated. \u201cAnd the nature of the economy that Wall Street and corporate America has promoted reflects the gaping inequality in this country.\u201d Increased government spending on highways, bridges and roads may well provide a lift to the broader economy, and tax cuts and looser regulations will be cheered by the financial markets. But there are downsides to these approaches, including increased deficits and levels of debt. Moreover, market analysts wonder how Mr. Trump will balance these policies, which are mostly positive for financial markets, with his promises to increase trade barriers on exports from Mexico and China. Mr. Trump\u2019s strident anti-trade rhetoric has prompted fears that he would precipitate a trade war at a time when global trade is already suffering because of increased protectionist measures in countries around the world. \u201cThis is not \u2018Brexit,\u2019\u201d said Jeffrey Kleintop, an investment specialist at Schwab Investments, referring to the rally in stocks and bonds that soon followed Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. \u201cThat will be a long process of negotiated change. The worry is that Mr. Trump would follow through on his promise to raise tariffs on China and Mexico.\u201d Photo Traders on the floor of the New York Stock exchange on Wednesday. Taken as a whole, markets absorbed the looming Trump presidency as a signal that the knowns are now vastly outnumbered by the unknowns. Credit Spencer Platt/Getty Images By the close of trading on Wednesday, the benchmark S.&P. 500 index had risen 1.1 percent. For now, the market\u2019s willingness to cast a positive eye on a Trump win seems tied to the prospect of more government spending. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the weeks leading up to the election, a noticeable trend has been the slow but persistent increase in the interest rates of government bonds, many of which have been in negative territory for some time as investors sought safety in these securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury breached 2 percent on Monday, a strong rise since rates bottomed out at 1.37 percent in July. And similar bonds issued by Japan and Germany , which this year began offering negative yields, are creeping toward positive territory. Analysts have said that these moves reflect a growing willingness of politicians around the world to loosen their fiscal belts as a way to fight against long-term stagnation. Any move toward a meaningful pickup in infrastructure investing would require more government borrowing and thus put upward pressure on today\u2019s rock-bottom interest rates. Last week, the former United States Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers made the case, in a speech at the International Monetary Fund, that with rates at historically low levels and with the increasing chances of the economy entering a recession in the coming years, a move toward more government spending is desperately needed.

It also allows the state, county and city government to regulate and tax the growth and sale of marijuana. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Voters also passed a measure supported by Gov. Jerry Brown that would increase the number of nonviolent inmates eligible for parole and allow the inmates to earn credit for good behavior.

Buyers of gun ammunition will now have to undergo criminal background checks, and large-capacity magazines are illegal, after the passage of Proposition 63, a gun-control measure brought by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. The measure will also create new requirements for lost or stolen firearms and ammunition. Voters approved a $2 tax increase per pack of cigarettes, an initiative that prevailed despite more than $70 million spent by tobacco companies to defeat it. High-income earners \u2014 individuals earning more than $250,000 a year \u2014 will continue to pay more in taxes, as voters approved a measure that extends the tax increase passed in 2012 by an additional 12 years, till 2030.

He said we were the kinds of people who cling to guns and religion. Time and time again he stood on foreign soil and apologized for our nation. And to this day it remains unclear whether he believes the United States is the most exceptional nation on Earth. Hillary Clinton called us deplorable \u2013 irredeemable. \"To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables. Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.\" The only thing deplorable was Hillary Clinton's basket of grossly generalistic comments. \"And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up,\" she went on to say. \"He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million.

Continue Reading Below The Dow Jones Industrial Average came within 49 points of a new record closing level on Wednesday, hours after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States and hours after financial markets had a brief panic attack which sent stocks spiraling.\u00a0 It was a stunning conclusion to what had been an exhausting 2016 presidential election. In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Trump -- the Republican nominee -- had clinched the White House, but the dramatic Brexit-style carnage expected in global markets in the wake of his win failed to hold as Trump called for the country to unite in the days ahead.\u00a0As equities rallied back from steep overnight losses, bond yields reached their highest level in three years. What was a flight to safety in the very early hours of Wednesday quickly turned into a risk-on rally by the closing bell. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which moves inversely to its price, rose 0.208 percentage point to 2.07%, the highest level since 2013. The move in the Treasury note was a total reversal from yields that touched 1.7% in the overnight hours. With a measured selloff in Asian and European equity markets, U.S. stocks clawed back steep losses after dropping as much as 5% overnight. \u00a0 The VIX, an often cited gauge of Wall Street\u2019s expectation for market volatility over the next 30 days, dropped to 15.2 on Wednesday after spiking to 22 days before the election. An normal level for the so-called fear gauge is around 12. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, although declines eased, the Mexican peso continued to see sharp selling pressure, dropping 7.69% Wednesday morning against the U.S. dollar. The move was a rebounded of sorts from historic losses of nearly 12% in the immediate aftermath of the election outcome.\u00a0 Wall Street has used the currency as its favorite proxy for betting on the presidential race during the 2016 election cycle. As Trump\u2019s prospects of winning looked better, the peso intensified its selloff. Gold prices wiped out 5% gains to trade around $1,274 a troy ounce. For scope of the market reaction, back in June when United Kingdom citizens voted to leave the European Union,\u00a0 markets saw a similar, but sustained selloff of more than 5% \u00a0on the broader S&P 500 \u2013 the stock index often seen as a barometer for the U.S. economy. This time around, though, the markets were more flexible with an unexpected outcome that resulted in a President-Elect Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress. Ticker ",

    "text": "Trump's victory ensures a conservative majority on the Supreme Court US Supreme Court The U.S. Supreme Court. (AFP/Getty Images) David G. Savage Donald Trump \u2019s presidential victory preserves\u00a0the Supreme Court \u2019s narrow conservative majority by clearing the way for the new president to choose a jurist next year to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. And with Republicans maintaining control of the Senate , Trump will have a free\u00a0hand in selecting someone with strong\u00a0conservative credentials, confident his nominee will be confirmed. The election\u00a0dashes the hopes of liberals, who lost their best opportunity in more than 40 years to create a majority on the high court. Live U.S. election results \u00a0|\u00a0 Live California election results It also provided a validation of sorts for the obstruction strategy of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans, who refused for nearly nine months to consider President Obama \u2019s nominee to fill Scalia\u2019s seat, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The future of the Supreme Court\u2019s ideological balance proved to be a critical factor for many Republican voters. In exit polls, about 1 in 5 voters said the Supreme Court appointments were \u201cthe most important factor\u201d in their decision, and those voters favored Trump by a 57% to 40% margin, according to ABC News. Now, the court\u2019s ideological balance should remain largely as it has been for the past decade, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holding the deciding vote in the court\u2019s biggest cases. Kennedy generally leans to the right on issues such as campaign spending, criminal law, the death penalty, religion, business regulation and gun rights. But he has joined the court\u2019s four liberals to uphold gay rights and to protect blacks from housing discrimination. Court disputes over voting laws often divide justices along party lines \u00bb Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia\u00a0is not likely to trigger an immediate shift on abortion. In June, Kennedy joined with the liberals to strike down a Texas law that would have forced the closing of most of the state\u2019s abortion clinics, signaling the Roe vs. Wade decision and the right to abortion retains a majority, at least for now. But going forward, GOP control of the White House and the Senate means the court could shift strongly to the right in the next four years if Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, Kennedy, 80, or Stephen Breyer, 78, were to leave the court. \u201cFilling the Scalia seat is probably a wash. But the odds are very high that in four or eight years, President Trump will have other vacancies to fill, and that will be a different story,\u201d said John Malcolm, a legal analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Ginsburg may find herself in an uncomfortable spotlight. Some leading liberals had urged her to retire two years ago so Obama could have filled her seat with a younger liberal justice. Ginsburg said she saw no reason to retire\u00a0and suggested she was confident another Democrat would follow Obama in the White House. If President Trump were to replace Ginsburg or Breyer, it would give the court a dominant conservative bloc with six Republican appointees and no need to rely on Kennedy for some issues, notably abortion and gay rights. Trump said in one debate that he would appoint pro-life justices, and they would overturn Roe vs. Wade. Trump\u2019s nominees also are likely to be strong supporters of the 2nd Amendment and its right to bear arms. If so, the court could stand as a roadblock against city or state gun regulations, including measures that make it hard for gun owners to obtain concealed carry permits. Should it be legal to have a congressional district only one party can win? \u00bb And with a new appointee, the court could deal a blow to public-sector labor unions. Last year, the conservative justices were prepared to rule in a case involving California teachers concerning whether it is constitutional to require such employees to pay mandatory fees to support their unions. But Scalia died unexpectedly before the opinion could be issued, leaving the court split, 4-4. Now, conservative activists could bring the issue back to the court.\u00a0 And Trump\u2019s victory likely guarantees the end of Obama initiatives on immigration and climate change. Conservative judges and an evenly divided high court had put those measures on hold. The court now will soon have a conservative majority to kill those initiatives, assuming they are not repealed first by the Trump administration. Liberals are worried about what lies ahead. \u201cLonger term, there are real concerns about whether a Supreme Court with two or three Trump-nominated justices would cut back on protections for important fundamental rights and liberties, especially the right of women to meaningfully access abortion,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cWe could see a court more willing to look out for corporate interests at the expense of consumers and workers or to break with the guarantees of equality for LGBTQ Americans.\u201d During the campaign, Trump issued two lists of his potential Supreme Court nominees, including judges from state supreme courts and U.S. appeals courts across the nation. They include Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles Canady, who as a congressman sponsored the federal ban on \u201cpartial-birth abortions\u201d; Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, a former Scalia law clerk; 11th Circuit Court Judge William Pryor from Alabama; 7th Circuit Judge Diane Sykes from Wisconsin and Sen. Mike Lee from Utah. Notably absent from the list were prominent conservative judges in Washington.

While the campaign had expressed confidence in public, their own data showed only a narrow path to the 270 electorates needed to win the White House. The senior team felt pressure to live up to the moment and acknowledge the outcome of a potential defeat by Hillary Clinton after the GOP nominee's comments about a \"rigged\" system and whether he would accept the results was widely derided by Democrats and members of his own party. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump arrives for his election night rally at the New York Hilton Midtown on Nov. 9. ANDREW KELLY / Reuters The first draft of a victory speech was no longer just a placeholder but needed revisions to reflect the scope of the night, sources said. That draft was revised in real-time when a victory was within sight. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and writer and policy adviser Steve Miller, huddled with Trump to find the right tone and message after an upset that many inside Trump Tower in New York had once considered improbable. Through the early evening, much of the focus had been on Florida vote tallies and reviewing data county by county. The Trump war room grew excited as state after state fell in their favor. Related: Trump Wins In Major Upset As the electoral count grew for Trump and the night grew so late, advisers inside Trump Tower wanted their candidate to speak amid the wave of emotion and energy \u2014 but they hoped to hit 270 first. Rumblings of a Trump appearance were also an attempt to hasten a consensus on the election from the networks if that were possible, sources said. It was approaching 2:30 a.m. ET, when a phone call from Clinton's longtime aide, Huma Abedin, reached Team Trump. The call was unexpected. Once Abedin could link Clinton with Trump, that effectively signaled an end to the campaigning, sources said. Trump and the former secretary of state spoke. Clinton, the sources said, was described as \"gracious.\" Kelly O'Donnell ",

    "text": "How to break up with a friend By RACHEL RABKIN PEACHMAN Photo Credit Getty Images This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life\u2019s opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com . Friendships are important throughout life, but especially so in the stage between school and marriage, when our friends often stand in for family. What do you do when you need to end a friendship that\u2019s turned sour? First, give it some serious thought. Once you initiate a breakup, there may be no turning back. Depending on the type of friendship, a formal ending may not be necessary. \u201cThere are typically four types of friendships: friends you have because of shared history; friends you\u2019ve made due to forced togetherness; your surface social friends; and growth friends, meaning the people you want by your side as you go through life wherever you are,\u201d said Melissa S. Cohen, a psychotherapist and relationship coach in Westfield, N.J. \u201cUnless there has been a serious betrayal of trust, you can usually let all but your most important friendships fade away simply by spending less time with each other.\u201d If, however, your friend asks why you are not texting her or never available to get together, offer an explanation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThink about what you say and how you say it very carefully. It\u2019s likely that your once-friend will never forget those words,\u201d said Irene S. Levine, a psychologist and producer of TheFriendshipBlog.com . Then, talk to your friend in private. \u201cDon\u2019t involve mutual friends. Remember that although you have been giving a lot of thought to the breakup, it might hit your friend without warning,\u201d Dr. Levine said. If you no longer have much in common or simply don\u2019t enjoy your time together anymore, take responsibility for ending the friendship rather than blaming the other person. (Related: How to have more engaging conversations in everyday life ) \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to say, \u2018I truly care about you and the relationship we\u2019ve had, but I don\u2019t have the bandwidth or time to devote to our friendship anymore,\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t be the friend that you want me to be right now,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cEven if you feel it\u2019s your friend who is sucking you dry, or stuck in college partying mode, or not being considerate, you can compassionately and authentically say, \u2018We don\u2019t seem to share the same goals and perspectives.\u2019\u201d That allows you both to be cordial if you see each other again, and leaves the door open to a reconciliation if circumstances change. \u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s always important to be careful with other people\u2019s feelings. That just makes you a good person,\u201d Ms. Cohen added. When a friend betrays you by, say, blabbing your secrets or being consistently cruel, you can and should stand up for yourself. And if this is not one of your closest friends, a breakup is most likely in order. The goal in these instances is to be honest and plainly explain why you can\u2019t be friends with someone you don\u2019t trust. And have the conversation live \u2014 either in person or over the phone \u2014 because anything you write online could be shared or used against you in a way you may regret. But when you have a major conflict with a best friend, these scenarios don\u2019t apply. It\u2019s ideal to have an open discussion about your feelings. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cFor those friends, it\u2019s worth it to try harder and give the person the benefit of the doubt because those relationships are rare,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cBe really honest about what\u2019s going on.\u201d If after that, the relationship still feels unsustainable to you, let your friend go as gently as you can. \u201cThese relationships need to be mutually satisfying to both people,\u201d Dr. Levine said. Be clear that you wish your friend well but resist the urge to explain every detail of your thought process. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessarily kind and won\u2019t necessarily provide the other person with closure. Your friend will still need to achieve that on her own,\u201d Dr. Levine added. And remember that friendship breakups can hurt just as much as romantic breakups, especially if you\u2019ve been close with a friend for a long time. And sadly, noted Dr. Levine, \u201cwhen you break up with a boyfriend, you can turn to your best friends for support. When you break up with a best friend, you\u2019ve lost the person who might be able to help you get over the loss.\u201d Want to read more? You might also be interested in: ",

Conrad Williams Jr. / TNS President-elect Donald Trump speaks to supporters at the Election Night Party at the Hilton Midtown Hotel in New York City on Nov. 9, 2016. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to supporters at the Election Night Party at the Hilton Midtown Hotel in New York City on Nov. 9, 2016. (J. Conrad Williams Jr. / TNS) Matt ZapotoskyThe Washington Post Donald Trump said at a debate last month that he would appoint a special prosecutor to examine Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state and remarked that she would \"be in jail\" if he were president. In about two months, he'll have the power to potentially make that a reality. He wouldn't, of course, be able to snap his fingers and throw his political rival behind bars. He would have to order his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor, then count on that special prosecutor to agree with his assessment that Clinton's email practices violated criminal laws about mishandling classified information. And even if he did all that and Clinton was charged, she would still be afforded a trial, and Trump's special prosecutor would have to contend with evidence that led the original team of federal investigators to conclude there was not sufficient basis to believe a crime occurred. Getting that process started, though, would not seem that difficult. Trump gets to pick and appoint the attorney general. FBI Director James B. Comey recommended in July that neither Clinton nor her aides be charged with any crimes in connection with her use of a private email server during her term at the State Department, saying \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring such a case. He said in recent weeks that his conclusion was unchanged, even after investigators examined a new, potentially relevant batch of emails discovered on a computer belonging to disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner , the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin . (Tribune news services) Trump rallies have sometimes been marked with chants of \"lock her up,\" and his supporters repeated those cries as the Republican moved toward an upset victory Tuesday night. Even prominent conservatives in the legal field have said that for Trump to act to jail Clinton would be inadvisable, and it would politicize the Justice Department in an alarming way. Former attorney general Michael Mukasey, one of Clinton's most vocal critics on the email issue, told The Washington Post last month, \"It would be like a banana republic.\" Those remarks came after Trump broached the idea of a special prosecutor at a debate. \"I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,\" Trump said. \"There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.\" Later, when Clinton said, \"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\" Trump replied, \"Because you'd be in jail.\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway later said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that Trump's remark about jailing Clinton was a \"quip.\" She added, \"As for the special prosecutor, I think that's Donald Trump channeling the frustration he hears from thousands of voters out on the stump every day.\" Caption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.

President Barack Obama could short-circuit the affair entirely, pardoning Clinton before he leaves office in January. Legal analysts have said that could happen even though Clinton is not charged with any crimes, and the FBI and Justice Department have said no charges are appropriate.

Hillary Clinton's stunning loss to Donald Trump created a power vacuum at the top of the party and a crisis of confidence among its remaining standard bearers. Clinton was nowhere to be seen at her election night party early, held in a convention center in Manhattan whose glass ceiling was supposed to represent the metaphorical one she seemed so close to shattering just hours earlier. But the ceiling went unbroken and she conceded privately to Trump. Instead, the unenviable task of addressing Clinton's crestfallen supporters fell to John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, who is better known as a behind-the-scenes operator than a public leader.

Clinton aides and supporters in the campaign's final months believed they were fighting a noble battle to defend the ramparts of the republic from the existential threat posed by Trump. They were confident that they would not just defeat the GOP nominee, but also repudiate him and everything he stands for with an overwhelming margin. \"Bernie supporters warned the party \u2014 and they would not listen.\" And yet despite having virtually every possible advantage at her disposal, from more money to better staffers to better data, it was Clinton and her party that was repudiated in the biggest presidential shock in recent memory. Her staff went dark as the night wore on and their prospects dimmed. Her surrogates disappeared from sight. What precisely went wrong may take weeks or months to sort out. Most likely, it wasn't any one thing \u2014 it was everything. Defeat, in this case, has a thousand mothers.

Whether it rips the party apart or causes it to come together as a united opposition to Trump will depend on how key actors react to the news none of them anticipated. Eyes will turn to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, leaders of a progressive wing of the Democrats that may feel emboldened by Trump's win. And they will turn to President Barack Obama, the main uniting figure in the party, whose entire legacy is now on the line. There will be plenty of blame to go around, starting with Hillary Clinton herself. Clinton and her centrist brand, already tainted even before the email scandal broke in March 2015, the month before she launched her bid, was an imperfect fit for a party that had become dramatically more liberal and less white than it was when her husband was president.

Whether it was her gender, her 30 years at the center of the political establishment, the instinct for secrecy that led to her using a private email server, or some combination of the above, too many Americans simply did not like her. And for all its sophistication, Clinton's widely hailed data-driven campaign, modeled on the successful Obama 2008 and 2012 turnout efforts, missed the mark. Then there are key components of the Democratic coalition: Millennials, who stayed home or voted for third-party candidates, and black voters, who turned out in lower numbers than they did for Obama. Hillary Clinton supporters watch election results come in at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York on Tuesday night. ANDREW GOMBERT / EPA There is blame for the independent candidates Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, both of whom made it clear that Trump was unacceptable, but soldiered on. Their margins could easily have carried Clinton over the top in key states. Clinton allies will justifiably point to a sequence of an unprecedented external interference. From one-sided Russian hacking and disclosure of their findings on WikiLeaks to FBI Director James Comey's last-minute intervention on emails. They will blame the media, which gave Trump so much coverage throughout the campaign and chased Clinton's email scandal with what Democrats saw as clear double standard. And they will blame Republican voter suppression efforts in North Carolina \u2014 proven to be coordinated by state party officials \u2014 a state that could have tipped the race had its narrow margin been reversed. Fingers were being pointed before the race had even been called. \"Bernie supporters warned the party \u2014 and they would not listen.

By Anne Gearan and Abby Phillip November 9 at 9:12 PM Follow @agearan Follow @abbydphillip NEW YORK \u2014 Hillary Clinton saw a rancorous campaign through to its bitter end on Wednesday, conceding the presidency to a man she had called unfit for the office and a threat to the fabric of the country. In defeat, Clinton turned one of her central attacks on Donald Trump into a charge for the presidency she was denied, urging the next president and her disheartened supporters to respect the peaceful transfer of power. \u201cWe have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought,\u201d Clinton said hours after losing a presidential election she had been widely seen as sure to win. \u201cBut I still believe in America, and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future.\u201d Speaking to a hastily assembled group of campaign staff, volunteers and supporters, Clinton went on: \u201cDonald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\u201d She grew misty-eyed but maintained her composure \u2014 even as her supporters could not \u2014 throughout a speech she never imagined giving. She spoke in a hotel ballroom farther in feel than in distance from the exquisitely planned celebration she did not have on Tuesday night. Anti-Trump protests took place near some college campuses on election night. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Hours earlier, Clinton had also planned to speak of the promise of \u201can America that\u2019s hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.\u201d She had planned to call for unity and healing, with her own history-making election as the first female president a galvanizing example. That dream started to unravel about 8:30\u00a0p.m. Tuesday, when roughly half the states had voted and results showed a Trump lead that Clinton\u2019s confident, data-driven campaign had not foreseen. Clinton\u2019s second unsuccessful run for the White House relied heavily on a complex computer algorithm that the campaign was prepared to publicly unveil after the election. As election results rolled in Tuesday, Clinton watched from a suite in the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan as her would-be electoral advantage disappeared. The gulf opened and never closed as Trump performed more strongly than expected in several upper-Midwestern states that had voted for Democrats for a generation. Earlier in the night, top Clinton aides bounced around the room doing media interviews and chatting with reporters, projecting optimism that Clinton\u2019s voters would come through with record turnout. But by 9\u00a0p.m., the early warning signs had become dire. Virginia, a state that they thought would be an easy win, was looking like a squeaker. Florida had begun to appear out of reach. And Trump\u2019s victories in Iowa and Ohio, which were expected, became the leading edge of a Trump wave that swamped Clinton. Not only did Trump capture big margins in battleground states, outperforming expectations for a divisive and damaged candidate, but he outperformed 2012 nominee Mitt Romney in some categories. Meanwhile, Clinton underperformed with the groups she needed most \u2014 minorities and younger voters \u2014 showing that she could neither recreate the much-admired \u201cObama coalition\u201d nor assemble what her aides had begun to call her own \u201cHillary coalition.\u201d The 2016 presidential election, in graphics View Graphic The 2016 presidential election, in graphics One by one, Clinton aides began disappearing from the main hall and not answering their phones. They retreated to a nearby war room, which was cordoned off and guarded, and never returned. The mood outside the room turned from confusion to disbelief, anger and dejection. Back at the Peninsula, campaign aides who were not part of Clinton\u2019s small core of intimate friends and advisers gradually peeled away and came to the Javits Center in ones and twos. Eventually it was only Clinton, her family and the closest advisers, including Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, making the decision first to put off a concession speech and then to concede by phone. Mills smiled softly and shook her head when asked Wednesday what those hours were like. \u201cIt\u2019s too raw,\u201d she said as she talked with Clinton supporters outside the New Yorker Hotel, where Clinton, flanked by Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), her running mate, and her husband and daughter, had said goodbye. Clinton did not dwell Wednesday on what other friends said was an agonizing reckoning in that hotel room, but the mood was akin to the funeral for a sudden death \u2014 shocking, mystifying and starkly real. It was clear that no one \u2014 not Clinton, not her husband, not her supporters, not the core team of her campaign \u2014 had seen it coming. \u201cI know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is painful, and it will be for a long time.\u201d Time and time again, Clinton and the team seemed to miss the magnitude of the forces that would overtake her in the Democratic primary and later against Trump. It wasn\u2019t until Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont showed surprising strength in Iowa that the Clinton campaign put real stock in the strength of his populist economic message. The same forces helped Trump\u2019s win on Tuesday. Clinton would need voters to choose her over her opponents because of how she would \u201chandle the economy and relate to the middle class,\u201d her campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in an email to close advisers in March 2014. But more often, the effort to disqualify Trump based on his temperament took precedence over an economic focus. Clinton\u2019s aides knew that there were soft spots in the Obama voting coalition that could pose problems for Clinton\u2019s bid. Her support among young voters was fragile, and in early voting, African American turnout and enthusiasm lagged. In the end, Clinton\u2019s inability to bring out Democratic voters in the election was a dramatic failure that left her more than 5\u00a0million votes shy of Obama\u2019s total in 2012, according to preliminary results. Trump was ultimately able to claim victory having earned fewer votes than Romney did in 2012. Latino voters did turn out in 2016, but many more than expected were willing to give Trump a shot at the White House. Among nonwhite voters, Clinton led Trump by 54\u00a0points \u2014 a whopping advantage but less than Obama\u2019s 61-point lead four years ago. These miscalculations probably cost Clinton key states that Obama won four years ago: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania. Clinton walked away having won the popular vote but having lost badly to Trump in the electoral college. While her reliance on analytics became well known, the particulars were kept hush-hush, including the existence of a powerful computer algorithm nicknamed \u201cAda\u201d after a 19th-century female mathematician. According to aides, the algorithm operated on a separate server than the rest of the Clinton operation as a security precaution, and only a few senior aides had access. According to aides, a raft of polling numbers, public and private, were fed into the algorithm, as well as ground-level voter data collected by the campaign. Once early voting began, those numbers were factored in, too. With that, aides said, Ada ran 400,000 simulations a day of what the race against Trump might look like. It spat out a report giving campaign manager Robby Mook and others a detailed picture of which battleground states were most likely to tip the race in one direction or another \u2014 and guiding decisions about where to spend time and deploy resources. But was it the right guidance? It appears that the importance of some states Clinton would lose \u2014 including Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 never became fully apparent or that it was too late once it did. Clinton made several visits to Michigan during the general election, but it wasn\u2019t until the final days that she, Obama and her husband made a concerted effort. As for Wisconsin, Clinton didn\u2019t make any general-election appearances there at all. Said Mook, in a wee-hours thank-you note to campaign workers: \u201cCampaigns are incredibly hard, and sometimes the results don\u2019t reflect the merit, work and commitment that goes into them. This is one of those times.\u201d Early afternoon on Wednesday, campaign staff trickled into the Brooklyn headquarters for food, ice cream and a staff meeting following Clinton\u2019s concession speech. They huddled over cellphones, listening to Clinton, who spoke to them\u00a0and hundreds of others scattered across the country, thanking them for their \u201cwork and tireless dedication,\u201d according to a campaign aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the meeting. Later, Mook, who has commanded nearly universal loyalty among staffers, led the pep talk, acknowledging the disappointing results. \u201cYou were fighting on the right side,\u201d Mook told them, according to the aide. \u201cHillary was our champion.\u201d Podesta\u00a0added praise for Mook, whose data-driven method of managing the campaign will probably come under intense scrutiny after the campaign failed to anticipate Tuesday\u2019s upset. \u201cWe have the number one campaign manager,\u201d Podesta told them. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since 1968, and I\u2019ve never seen a culture and a spirit like we created in this campaign.\u201d John Wagner in Washington contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Block. Mute. Unfriend. Tensions rise on Facebook after election results Facebook election results Matt LindnerChicago Tribune Election night and the morning after had some taking to Facebook to do housecleaning of their friends list. \"I unfriended at least 10 people today because I didn't want to see their celebratory Trump posts,\" says Lauren Lee, a Hillary Clinton voter who lives in Memphis, Tenn. \"I unfriended two more people for making pro-Trump comments on my sad Hillary post, including my husband's aunt who is Facebook obsessed. So, Thanksgiving might be awkward.\" \"I unfriended my brother and sister-in-law today, not because they were being particularly obnoxious, and I already knew they were Trump supporters, but because seeing their posts and \"likes\" just serves as a sad reminder to me of how little we have in common,\" added Laura Fitch, a Chicago resident who also voted for Clinton. \"I guess I could have muted them rather than unfriending them, but I just needed that click-release today, I guess.\"\u00a0 As the results rolled in and Donald Trump's election as the 45th president of the United States became official, supporters of both candidates took to Facebook to express their joy and dismay at the outcome. For some, the reaction from supporters of both candidates felt like a bit much. \"There was far too much overreaction, on both sides,\" says Adam Kmiec, a Chicago resident who declined to specify whom he voted for in this election. \"I wouldn't characterize it as hostile because I don't think there was a lot negative intent.\" \"I'm seeing a lot of despair and a lot of joy,\" added Ashvin Lad, a Chicago resident who also declined to say whom he voted for. \"A lot of uncertainty. A lot of shock.\" Experts say some of the reasons people turned to Facebook after the election results came in were to bask in the reflected glory of having voted for the winning candidate and to try to take back some of the power they felt they'd lost when they found out the candidate they voted for didn't win. \"When we feel powerless, it is human nature to want to do or say something that will help us feel like we can regain our power,\" says Peg Duros, a licensed clinical social worker and the clinic director at the Center for Contextual Exchange. \"For some, especially when emotions are high, it's a way of trying to discharge some of the emotional activation that they are experiencing. Of course, there are people that simply think that what they have to say is important and believe that others will be interested.\" With social media becoming more and more ubiquitous, Facebook also is simply where we go to interact with other human beings. \"Facebook has become our town square because we don't have communities the way we used to,\" says Crystal Clair, a Chicago-based licensed clinical professional counselor. \"To feel heard, understood, appreciated, we share our thoughts. I think, for the most part, people share for camaraderie, not realizing that other people are logging in to fight. Respecting others despite their viewpoints is a lesson we all need to keep at the forefront.\" Kmiec says he cut ties to a handful of people throughout the election cycle \u2014 which turned nasty at times, with candidates and supporters trading barbs that felt deeply personal \u2014 but not because he disagreed with their political beliefs. \"I unfriended them for their constant stream of political updates and an inability to be civil,\" he says. Jeffery Beckham is a Chicago-based small-business owner who voted for Clinton who found himself in a particularly heated back and forth with a Trump supporter following the election. It was an acquaintance he met a long time ago at a professional networking event. He says he thinks people are quick to take swipes at others on social media regardless of how close they are to that person simply because it's easy. \"Facebook attracts that kind of vitriol because you're behind a computer, and it's so easy to type a harsh response versus saying it in person,\" says Beckham. \"When you read something, you read it in the tone of how you're feeling. Many people were hurt, saddened and angry at the direction our country took last night, so any defense of a Trump vote causes an instant reaction. People were very reactionary last night and still today.\" Seeing tensions rise on his feed Wednesday morning, Kmiec felt the need to point out that, hey, we voted for different candidates, but at the same time we're all human beings. \"Remember folks, you were friends with one another for a good reason. Don't let politics and the outcome of this election drive a rift between you and people who have/had a different pov and political leaning,\" he wrote. \"I personally like all of you and value you, more than either candidate. Friends can last for life. Election winners, have term limits.\" A Facebook spokesman wrote in an email that the U.S. election was responsible for 10 billion likes, posts, comments and shares on the social medium from March 23, 2015, through Nov. 1, 2016. \"On Election Day alone, 115.3 million people on Facebook worldwide generated 716.3 million likes, posts, comments and shares related to the election,\" according to Facebook. Facebook doesn't have any data on how many unfriendings there were during the 2016 presidential election or on Election Day. It was a bitterly contested race that featured candidates expressing hostility toward each other and accusing each other of lying. Monmouth University in New Jersey conducted a study of 802 registered voters in late September and found that \"7 percent of voters report having lost or ended a friendship because of this year's presidential race.\" But all the social media engagement and activity throughout the election cycle hasn't necessarily resulted in people cutting ties with others. Erin Smith is an independent voter who lives in Illinois and voted for Donald Trump. The night of and the morning after the election, she posted multiple times on Facebook about the results. Smith says she refused to unfriend anyone on the site because, while she may not agree with a person, everyone should have a voice. \"I think it's ridiculous to (unfriend) because you don't agree with their opinions, candidate or political background,\" she says. \"I believe in the First Amendment and the freedom to speak your mind without fear.\" Likewise, Beckham says, he chose not to unfriend anyone during this election cycle, no matter how nasty the comments may have gotten, because at the end of the day, everyone is playing for the same team regardless of whom they're voting for. \"I feel it's a responsibility to be open and transparent and provide a perspective that may not be seen or heard by some on the other side of the aisle,\" he says. \"I always remind my friends ... we are all still in the same auditorium, America.\" \"People, whether I agree with them or not, add value to my day with their posts and comments,\" Lad added. (It's) always good to understand all sides in a candid way.\" So where do people draw the line between unfriending someone altogether and simply muting them so that those people's posts don't show up in their feed? Lee says she unfriended as many people as she did because she simply didn't wish to interact with them any longer. \"I didn't mute them because that doesn't stop them from commenting on my posts,\" she says. \"I don't need those people in my life, and especially not on Facebook.\" But rather than unfriend or mute, some took a different tack altogether in deleting the Facebook app from their phone and avoiding social media altogether. Duros and Clair agree that from a coping perspective, people should never forget that they have a choice when it comes to logging on to social media. \"You can either engage in the conversation or disengage,\" Clair says. \"The beauty of Facebook is that you can block, delete or hide people and their views if they are bothering you.\" \"We sometimes talk about the notion of hitting the pause button, especially when emotions are intense and the risk that one may say or do something that they may later regret is higher,\" Duros adds. \"Pausing, reminding oneself that they are in a state of shock, a lot of information is coming their way, which they cannot possibly process immediately and will need to take their time to process might help with one's capacity to compartmentalize.\" Matt Lindner is a freelancer.

Matt York/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt York/AP Former police Sgt. Paul Penzone, a Democrat, will be the new sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., after beating longtime incumbent Joe Arpaio. Matt York/AP Democrat Paul Penzone has ended controversial Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio's 24-year tenure as the sheriff of Maricopa County. Arpaio has faced multiple legal challenges to his stance on immigration; the loss comes despite raising more than $12 million from donors. The defeat ends a run in office that began the same year Bill Clinton first won the presidency. It comes two weeks after Arpaio, 84, was charged with criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge's order in a racial profiling case. Penzone, a former sergeant in the Phoenix Police Department, defeated Arpaio by nearly 10 percentage points after building a substantial lead in the polls. The challenger's backers included liberal billionaire George Soros, who donated more than $2 million to his campaign. \"Arizona stands for something greater, no matter where we come from or what we look like, we are all entitled to respect,\" Penzone said, according to member station KJZZ . At Penzone's victory party, KJZZ says, supporters took up a chant: \"New sheriff in town.\" Arpaio's exit comes after he rose to fame for his reputation as the toughest sheriff in America. His hard-line views on immigration helped him form an alliance with President-elect Donald Trump and boost fundraising. Article continues after sponsorship But among many of his constituents, Arpaio's legal troubles were seen as an expensive distraction. In September, Maricopa County agreed to pay $4.5 million in legal fees to the plaintiffs in the case, which dates from 2007. That payment was added to some $10.4 million that had already been paid, as AZ Central reported . ",

    "text": "Photo Credit Andrew Rae Take a deep breath, expanding your belly. Pause. Exhale slowly to the count of five. Repeat four times. Congratulations. You\u2019ve just calmed your nervous system. Controlled breathing, like what you just practiced, has been shown to reduce stress, increase alertness and boost your immune system. For centuries yogis have used breath control, or pranayama, to promote concentration and improve vitality. Buddha advocated breath-meditation as a way to reach enlightenment. Science is just beginning to provide evidence that the benefits of this ancient practice are real. Studies have found, for example, that breathing practices can help reduce symptoms associated with anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and attention deficit disorder. \u201cBreathing is massively practical,\u201d says Belisa Vranich, a psychologist and author of the book \u201cBreathe,\u201d to be published in December. \u201cIt\u2019s meditation for people who can\u2019t meditate.\u201d How controlled breathing may promote healing remains a source of scientific study. One theory is that controlled breathing can change the response of the body\u2019s autonomic nervous system, which controls unconscious processes such as heart rate and digestion as well as the body\u2019s stress response, says Dr. Richard Brown, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and co-author of \u201cThe Healing Power of the Breath.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Consciously changing the way you breathe appears to send a signal to the brain to adjust the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system, which can slow heart rate and digestion and promote feelings of calm as well as the sympathetic system, which controls the release of stress hormones like cortisol. Many maladies, such as anxiety and depression, are aggravated or triggered by stress. \u201cI have seen patients transformed by adopting regular breathing practices,\u201d says Dr. Brown, who has a private practice in Manhattan and teaches breathing workshops around the world. When you take slow, steady breaths, your brain gets the message that all is well and activates the parasympathetic response, said Dr. Brown. When you take shallow rapid breaths or hold your breath, the sympathetic response is activated. \u201cIf you breathe correctly, your mind will calm down,\u201d says Dr. Patricia Gerbarg, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and Dr. Brown\u2019s co-author Dr. Chris Streeter, an associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Boston University, recently completed a small study in which she measured the effect of daily yoga and breathing on people with diagnoses of major depressive disorder. After 12 weeks of daily yoga and coherent breathing, the subjects\u2019 depressive symptoms significantly decreased and their levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a brain chemical that has calming and anti-anxiety effects, had increased. The research was presented in May at the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health in Las Vegas. While the study was small and lacked a control group, Dr. Streeter and her colleagues are planning a randomized controlled trial to further test the intervention. \u201cThe findings were exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cThey show that a behavioral intervention can have effects of similar magnitude as an antidepressant.\u201d Breathing may also affect the immune system. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects\u2019 saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing group\u2019s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress. The findings were published in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine in August. Here are three basic breathing exercises to try on your own. Coherent Breathing If you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six. Photo 1. Sitting upright or lying down, place your hands on your belly. 2. Slowly breathe in, expanding your belly, to the count of five. Advertisement 3. Pause. 4. Slowly breathe out to the count of six. 5. Work your way up to practicing this pattern for 10 to 20 minutes a day. Stress Relief When your mind is racing or you feel keyed up, try Rock and Roll breathing, which has the added benefit of strengthening your core. Photo 1. Sit up straight on the floor or the edge of a chair. 2. Place your hands on your belly. 3. As you inhale, lean forward and expand your belly. 4. As you exhale, squeeze the breath out and curl forward while leaning backward; exhale until you\u2019re completely empty of breath. 5. Repeat 20 times. Energizing HA Breath When the midafternoon slump hits, stand up and do some quick breathwork to wake up your mind and body. Photo 1. Stand up tall, elbows bent, palms facing up. 2. As you inhale, draw your elbows back behind you, palms continuing to face up. 3. Then exhale quickly and thrust your palms forward and turning them downward, while saying \u201cHa\u201d out loud. 4. Repeat quickly 10 to 15 times. ",

(Nov. 9) AP Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) America, notoriously divided by politics, was on Wednesday a nation united in shock. Not since Truman beat Dewey more than six decades ago had there been anything like it. The shock extended from true believers who were there when real estate mogul\u00a0came down the Trump Tower escalator 17 months ago to diehard Never Trumpers. It stretched from Wall Street to Embassy Row to Hollywood. But why was the outcome of the 2016 presidential election so shocking?. Trump had long ago established himself a political savant. Without ever having run for, or served on, so much as a school board, he emerged from a deep, experienced field to capture the Republican nomination. And pre-election polls showed Clinton with only a narrow lead, the sort of edge that the Brexit vote earlier this year had showed to be so tenuous. President-elect Trump vows to bring nation 'together as never before' Consider, in contrast, the hole in which President Harry Truman stood in 1948 against New York Gov. Thomas Dewey. Not only did Truman lag in every public opinion poll, but his Democratic Party was ideologically split; its left and right wings each ran candidates in the general election. If Truman could win, anyone can. But Americans were shocked when Trump did. The epicenter of awe was the Javits Center in New York, where Clinton held an election night party that became a wake. It extended to her alma mater, Wellesley College, where thousands of women from around the world came to celebrate America's first female president. And from there to foreign trading desks, where U.S. stock futures plummeted. \"I'm shocked,\u2019\u2019 Duke University freshman Divya Juneja told the campus paper. \u201cI honestly thought this election would be a landslide.\u2019\u2019 How do you use the media to win? Just ask Donald Trump Clinton partisans weren\u2019t the only ones surprised. Consider Barry Fixler, a jeweler who opened a Trump headquarters last year on his own dime in his town, Bardonia, N.Y. On Tuesday, with the polls still open, he declared the election lost \u2014 rigged for Clinton, he said The next day he was ecstatically agog. \u201cNever saw this coming,\u2019\u2019 he said Why did so many people feel the same way? Partly it was the polls, which in aggregate created the impression Clinton was inevitable. She wasn\u2019t far ahead, but she\u2019d been ahead for so many months that some people had trouble imagining any other result. \u201cAfter the conventions I had a sense Trump had a serious chance, but I got lulled by the polls,\u2019\u2019 said no less an expert than Boston College political scientist Marc Landy, author of Presidential Greatness. \u201cThe pollsters have a lot to answer for.\u2019\u2019 How 8 key counties voted in the presidential race Partly it was the decisiveness of Trump\u2019s victory \u2014 how he won so many battleground states so narrowly, including ones like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that had seemed like Democratic bastions. Partly it was because many Clinton supporters could go for weeks without talking to a Trump supporter. The signs were there \u2014 literally, on countless front yards, most of them in places other than the bigger cities and more affluent suburbs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pick up on that, or on the size of the crowds at his rallies,\u2019\u2019 said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Poll. Partly it was because many Trump supporters (like Fixler) believed their candidate\u2019s claim that the election was rigged against him \u2014 a lost cause. Partly it was because Trump\u2019s policies and plans remain vague (like getting Mexico to pay for a Southern border wall) or frightening (mass deportations of undocumented immigrants). \u201cHe was a candidate with no detailed program,\u2019\u2019 Landy said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken many stands and has many policies. Which does he care about? Sometimes I wonder if he knows.\u2019\u2019 And partly it was the simple realization \u2014 which came to some only when they actually saw Trump claim victory around 3 a.m. ET\u00a0on the stage of the New York Hilton \u2014 that \u201cthe American people have elected Donald Trump president,\u2019\u2019 said the novelist Thomas Mallon, enunciating the words as if they were painful. After that, he said, \u201cI left the Republican Party.\u2019\u2019 Until that moment, said Madonna, \u201ca lot of people just couldn\u2019t believe Trump could win after the kind of campaign he ran. Who\u2019s ever heard of a candidate in this country threatening to throw the other candidate in jail? There was a lot of suspended disbelief.\u2019\u2019 Posted!

Stennis during joint military exercise between the United States, Japan and India, June 15, 2016. 0 Shares Email Two Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets collided over the waters off San Diego today, military officials said. One pilot was able to eject from his aircraft and was rescued at sea by the Navy, and the pilot of the other aircraft was able to land his aircraft at a nearby Navy base, officials said. \"Two 3rd Marine aircraft wing single-seat F/A-18 Hornets, based out of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, experienced a midair collision during a training mission over the water in the vicinity of San Diego, California, at approximately 11:43 a.m. (PST), November 9, 2016,\" the 3rd Marine aircraft wing said in a statement. Air Force F-16 Thunderbird Crashes Near Colorado Springs, Pilot Ejects Safely The pilot who ejected from his aircraft was recovered from the ocean by a nearby search and rescue helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, officials said. The helicopter was sent to look for the pilot after a distress call was received at approximately 12:11 p.m. Pacific time, officials said. The pilot was recovered a half-hour later. The pilot of the other jet landed safely at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego Bay, officials said. Both pilots are in stable condition and were taken to medical facilities for observation. The cause of the crash is under investigation, officials said. The accident comes on the same day that the Gen. Robert Neller, the commandant of the Marine Corps, ordered a one-day stand-down for the Marine Corps to pursue professional development. He ordered that active-duty Marine units undertake the stand-down by Dec. 1 in the wake of fatal training accidents and other incidents that have resulted in Marine deaths, according to The Associated Press. More than 140 Marines have died this year, with only one of those deaths coming from combat, according to the AP. 0 Shares ",

According to People, the Shreveport, Louisiana, native was shot multiple times in her car near a McDonald's parking lot. Srgt. Rod Johnson told\u00a0 People \u00a0Wells was killed by Robert Paul Gaddy who killed himself after shooting Wells. They were both taken to a nearby hospital but died. \"We know they had a relationship of some type, but I can\u2019t tell you if they were friends having a dispute or formerly intimate. We simply don\u2019t know at this moment,\" Johnson said. \"We have some guesses, but we\u2019d like to back that up with hard facts.\" \"Bayou Billionaires\" ran for two season on CMT in 2012. A rep for CMT told us they had no information on the case. An executive producer for the show told People Wells knew Gaddy from high school and they \"recently started dating.\" Wells' parents took to Facebook Tuesday to share the news of their daughter's death, local station\u00a0 KTBS reported . \"This is really hard on us and her children,\u201d they wrote. \"It is out of order. No parents should have to go through this.\" \"Bayou Billionaires\" focused on the Dowden's rags-to-riches story after they family discovered a large deposit of natural gas on their property.

    "text": "Donald Trump to Receive Same Intelligence Briefing as President Obama By Arlette Saenz Nov 9, 2016, 5:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Becomes President-Elect of the US 0 Shares Email Donald Trump will now be privy to in-depth daily intelligence briefings as president-elect. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today that Presidential Daily Brief (PDB), which President Obama receives each morning along with other intelligence material has now been made available to Trump, Vice President-elect Pence and a few designated members of his team. \"This is an important part in ensuring the kind of smooth transition that President Obama has prioritized,\" Earnest said. Earnest noted that this was a courtesy President George W. Bush extended to President Obama. A senior U.S. official said Trump has not received a PDB today, but can request it any day at his discretion. The official notes that the sitting president determines what the president-elect will receive. Obama has decided to grant access to the PDB, which means Trump will receive the exact same thing Obama receives each morning -- as has been customary with recent transitions. The official said the intelligence community is ready to provide the PDB whenever the president-elect wants. Similar to the briefings given to the major party nominees, career analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will present the information, not political appointees. 0 Shares ",

The measure was approved on Tuesday. Astrid Galvan/AP hide caption toggle caption Astrid Galvan/AP Workers with the Living United for Change in Arizona organization canvas a south Phoenix neighborhood in October to advocate for the passage of Proposition 206, which would increase the state's minimum wage. The measure was approved on Tuesday. Astrid Galvan/AP Updated at 10:45 ET Wednesday While votes are still being counted, some high-profile ballot initiatives already have returned clear results \u2014 including a slew of states opting in favor of medical or recreational marijuana, and several more raising the minimum wage. You can see our full list of key ballot measures here , or check out a sample of the highlights: Legalizing marijuana, either medicinally or recreationally: You can read more about these ballot initiatives \u2014 part of a nationwide trend toward the legalization of pot \u2014 here . In short, Florida, Arkansas, Montana and North Dakota legalized (or greatly expanded legal access to) medical marijuana, while Massachusetts, Nevada and California legalized recreational marijuana. Arizona, however, voted against the legalization of recreational marijuana \u2014 and Maine's own measure on recreational marijuana still does not have a projected winner from The Associated Press as of 10:45 a.m. ET Wednesday. In Ballot Measures, Pot Legalization Makes Strides Raising the minimum wage: Maine, Arizona, Colorado and Washington all voted to increase the minimum wage to at least $12 an hour by 2020. Washington approved a raise to $13.50 an hour by 2020; Colorado calls for $12 by 2020, but with the wage pegged to the cost of living after that. In South Dakota, a ballot initiative called for lowering the minimum wage for non-tipped employees under 18, but it was roundly rejected by voters, with more than 70 percent opposing it. Death penalty: Oklahoma and Nebraska both voted in favor of the death penalty. In Oklahoma, a referendum declared that the death penalty is not considered cruel and unusual punishment in the state; in Nebraska, voters opted to overturn a bill that eliminated the death penalty. We're still waiting for results on California's two competing death penalty initiatives ; one would end the death penalty and the other speed up the process. Article continues after sponsorship Gun Control Groups Aim Their Money At States \u2014 And The Ballot Strengthening gun control measures: In Washington, voters approved a firearms access measure. As we've previously reported , it would \"allow people to get a court order that would temporarily ban people who show signs of mental illness or violence or another behavior that might indicate that they could harm themselves or others from possessing firearms.\" A similar law was already on the books in California \u2014 which has some of the nation's strictest restrictions on guns. Voters just approved one more gun control measure. KQED's Marisa Lagos described the initiative last month: \"Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to go even further and bring bullets into the equation. Depending on whom you ask, it's a question of either common sense or constitutional rights: Should ammunition be treated like guns are, with background checks for buyers and limits on who can sell? \"It's not the only question posed by Proposition 63 , but it's the one that's received the most attention. Authored by Newsom, the initiative would also require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement; set up a process for convicted felons to give up their guns; and fully ban magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of bullets.\" It passed with strong support, according to AP projections. Results are still pending for background check proposals in Maine and Nevada. Too Many Ballot Measures? Just Explain Them In Song Legalizing assisted suicide in Colorado: CO-106 made assisted death legal \"among patients with a terminal illness who receive a prognosis of death within six months.\" Colorado is only the sixth state to approve some form of physician-assisted death. Its bill was modeled after Oregon's law , Colorado Public Radio reports. The law requires patients to self-administer a doctor-prescribed drug. \"In recent years, Democrats in the state Legislature had attempted to pass legislation allowing for assisted suicide, but were rejected by Republicans in the split Legislature,\" the Los Angeles Times reports . \"Opposition to the measure came mostly from religious groups.\" ",

Got it Hillary Clinton spoke to supporters, Nov. 9, offering a message of thanks, apology and hope. Here are the key moments from that fervent address. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) By Anne Gearan , Juliet Eilperin and Matea Gold November 9 at 6:06 PM Follow @agearan Follow @eilperin Follow @mateagold Both Hillary Clinton and President Obama urged their backers Wednesday to accept President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory and support his transition into power, as Democrats prepare to hand over control of the White House for the first time in eight years. The calls for a national political reconciliation underscored the seismic political realignment now underway in Washington after Clinton\u2019s crushing loss to the New York businessman. Both the president and his former Secretary of State told their supporters not to despair as Republicans rejoiced at the idea that they will control both the legislative and executive branch in two and-a-half months. Clinton said her loss exposed the nation\u2019s deep and difficult divisions, but she urged her backers to give him \u201ca chance to lead.\u201d In her first public statements since the stunning election results, Clinton also called on other women to take up where she left off and continue the push for the White House, suggesting she may not make another run in four years. \u201cWe need you to keep up these fights,\u201d Clinton said in New York, making special mention of the many women who hoped she was on her way to become the first female president. View Graphic \u201cI know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too,\u201d said Clinton, less than 24 hours after calling the president-elect to concede after his history-shaping run that defied pollsters and galvanized legions of aggrieved voters in a loud repudiation of the status quo. \u201cThis is painful, and it will be for a long time.\u201d Clinton, who was misty-eyed at times but composed throughout her remarks, said the long and bitter campaign against Trump showed that \u201cour nation is more deeply divided that we thought.\u201d But she told her backers: \u201cWe owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\u201d Clinton and her allies are now left to sort out how Trump upended her once-clear path to become America\u2019s first female president. Clinton called Trump to concede as the results were clear. Minutes after Clinton finished speaking, President Obama addressed reporters in the Rose Garden with Vice President Biden by his side, as more than a hundred White House staffers stood off to the side. Several of the aides were visibly emotional, with at least one crying before he began speaking. \u201cNow, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we\u2019re actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage,\u201d Obama said, vowing to work to ensure a smooth transition for the president-elect. The president, who has invited Trump to the White House Thursday, added he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the tone of his victory speech and their private phone call, which took place around 3:30 am Wednesday. 1 of 57 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes to an end View Photos Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before\u201d. [ Live updates on the election fallout ] His Twitter bio now reads, \u201cPresident-elect of the United States\u201d \u2014 capping a once-unimaginable rise that was carried by voters fed up with the political system and mistrustful of Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state. But protests flared as dismay among Clinton supporters turned to anger. In Los Angeles, about 500 people chanted, \u201cNot my president.\u201d In Oregon, anti-Trump demonstrators blocked traffic and rail lines. After running a divisive campaign, Trump sounded a magnanimous note of reconciliation as he claimed victory shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday. [A year in Trump\u2019s America: Frustration, fury and fervor ] \u201cHillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country,\u201d Trump said, minutes after Clinton called him to concede. \u201cI mean that very sincerely. Now it\u2019s time for America to bind the wounds of division. We have to get together. To all Republicans, Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d [ How Donald Trump pulled off an upset of cataclysmic, historic proportions ] Speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Wednesday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump and Clinton \u201chad a very gracious exchange\u201d when she conceded the race. Asked whether Trump would consider appointing a special prosecutor to probe Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state and her ties to the Clinton Foundation, Conway said: \u201cWe have not discussed that at all, and he certainly did not discuss that with Secretary Clinton on that call.\u201d With Trump\u2019s ascension to the White House, the nationalist wave that has swept capitals around the world \u2014 including in Britain, which voted to break from the European Union this year \u2014 came crashing onto U.S. shores. The prospect of an impulsive authoritarian in the Oval Office initially rattled investors around the world. But a panicked global sell-off Tuesday night transformed into a near-record high for Wall Street by the end of trading on Wednesday. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average surged ahead about 250 points, or 1.4 percent, close to an all-time high \u2014 despite futures markets overnight signaling a decline of as much as 800 points. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both gained about 1 percent. Even the Mexican peso \u2014 which had fallen as the Republican nominee rose in the polls during his campaign \u2014 regained some ground after dropping to the lowest level since the 1990s. [ U.S. stock markets surge after global turmoil overnight ] World leaders congratulated Trump even as they grappled with the repercussions of his win. Britain, Germany and other U.S. allies stressed their close bonds with Washington. Russia, meanwhile, was quick to make overtures for better ties \u2014 something Trump encouraged as he campaigned. The general election, which riveted the nation and produced a record television audience for a presidential debate, turned on the question of national identity. While Clinton assembled a diverse coalition that she said reflected the nation\u2019s future, it was no match for the powerful and impassioned movement built by fanning resentments over gender, race and religion. Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d inspired millions of Americans alienated by the forces of globalization and multiculturalism and deeply frustrated with the inability of Washington to address their needs. Voters anxious about the economy, convinced that the system was stacked against them, fearful of terrorism and angry about the rising gap between rich and poor, gravitated toward Trump. In him, they saw a fearless champion who would re-create what they recalled as an America unchallenged in the world, unthreatened at home and unfettered by the elitist forces of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d Online, the distress of some of some of Clinton\u2019s top advisers was palpable. David Plouffe, who had served as Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager and helped guide Clinton\u2019s campaign, had predicted in late September that the Democratic nominee had a 100 percent chance of winning the election. \u201cI\u2019m sorry everyone,\u201d he tweeted around 1 a.m. Wednesday. \u201cHad to talk to my kids. Wrong and remarkably so. But the idea of our country has always been stronger than an election.\u201d Control of Congress was on the line as well, with Republicans maintaining their majority in the House and a string of hotly competitive Senate contests going their way as well. One exception was in New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte conceded Wednesday afternoon to Democratic rival Maggie Hassan. Trump\u2019s feuds with Republican leaders created deep fissures in his party, and his victory has set the GOP on a new path. But congressional leaders \u2014 including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who declined to campaign with Trump after a videotape surfaced of the real estate magnate talking in lewd terms about sexually accosting women \u2014 said they looked forward to collaborating on a conservative agenda together. \u201cThis is the kind of unified Republican government that we set out to deliver,\u201d he told reporters in his home town of Janesville, Wis., adding Trump \u201cearned a mandate\u201d with his victory. \u201cI think we are going to hit the ground running.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also called the election a rejection of Obama\u2019s policies and said that \u201cthe American people have chosen a new direction for our nation.\u201d Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told fellow Democrats they have a \u201cresponsibility to find common ground\u201d with the president-elect and that she was prepared to work with him on an infrastructure bill, indicating that Democratic leaders do not plan to pursue a strategy of reflexive opposition to Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting a campaign against the Republicans right now,\u201d Pelosi said on a Wednesday afternoon conference call with members, according to a Democratic aide on the call. \u201cWe want to work together. But I do hope that that political dynamic will give us some leverage with them to say, \u2018You know, the more we work together, the better for you or us, but more importantly, for the American people.\u2019\u201d Obama campaigned vigorously for his former secretary of state \u2014 going so far as to label her opponent temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief \u2014 but his resurgent popularity did not rub off. Trump had pledged to dismantle Obama\u2019s achievements, starting with his signature law, the Affordable Care Act, which became known as Obamacare. He also will be in position to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that Obama would not lobby Trump to keep in place his policies, but he would explain the administration\u2019s thinking and make the case for some continuity. As an example, Earnest pointed to the deal to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, which has the backing of the international community, including Russia, and a U.N. Security Council resolution. \u201cIt\u2019s much more complicated than just saying you\u2019re going to tear the agreement up,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that he won\u2019t do it.\u201d Anne Gearan reported from New York.

By Chico Harlan and Jerry Markon November 9 at 12:35 PM Follow @chicoharlan Follow @JerryMarkon Counterprotester Demietrich Baker jumps over a Trump wall erected by the Washington State University College Republicans on campus on Oct. 19 in Pullman, Wash. (Geoff Crimmins/Moscow-Pullman Daily News via AP) If Donald Trump sticks to the immigration pledges that helped drive his presidential election victory, he will begin a clampdown on illegal immigration that would be unprecedented in American history and would require an exorbitantly expensive \u2014 and logistically difficult \u2014 operation to remove millions from the country while fortifying the border. As a candidate, Trump made immigration one of his highest-profile issues, saying he\u2019d create a \u201cspecial deportation task force\u201d and build a \u201cbeautiful\u201d wall along a major part of the southern border with Mexico. But immigration experts say those promises, though popular among his base, pose major complications as Trump prepares for office. Mexico's Finance Minister Jose Meade and central bank head Agustin Carstens have looked to calm markets after Republican Donald Trump's surprise victory sparked a massive selloff tanking the peso up to 13 percent in after-hours trading. (Reuters) Mass-scale deportations would upend parts of the economy, particularly in the agricultural sector, while dividing families and costing the government billions of dollars at a time of constrained finances. The wall would\u00a0make a political statement but would do little to stop a major portion of new arrivals \u2014 those seeking asylum and overstaying their visas. It would also face enormous obstacles in being built, experts say, including environment and engineering problems and the huge topographical challenges of the border itself. [ Markets staggered by Trump\u2019s shock victory but stage partial recovery ] Yet even with the potential difficulties, Trump will have the administrative tools to massively scale back the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to shield millions of immigrants from deportation, former federal officials say. With the stroke of a pen, for example, Trump could reverse a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of people brought to the United States illegally as children \u2014 something he has vowed to do. The new president could also change the priorities of the Department of Homeland Security, exposing even more of the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants to sudden deportation, including longtime residents with families. At a town hall meeting in Sandown, N.H., Oct. 6, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to build a wall on the border with Mexico and stop drug trafficking. (The Washington Post) \u201cI would expect a sea change in the enforcement landscape,\u2019\u2019 said John Sandweg, a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a part of DHS that would oversee heightened deportations. \u201cThe reforms made in immigration enforcement over the last eight years have all been administrative, not statutory. Trump has tremendous flexibility to reverse course on all those policies.\u201d Though Trump\u2019s immigration policies proved popular with his base of working-class white voters, critics say they are at odds with a moment in which the United States'\u00a0illegal immigration population is already tapering off. The number of people trying to cross the country's\u00a0southwest border has declined significantly over the past decade, and more Mexicans are returning home than entering. Trump has also said virtually nothing about two other major immigration issues: the surge of Central Americans fleeing violence and seeking asylum in the United States, and the resulting backlog in the country's\u00a0overworked immigration court system. There, many new arrivals wait for years to have their cases heard. Trump also hasn\u2019t taken a clear position on\u00a0the detention of asylum-seekers, including families, a practice that expanded drastically under President Obama. The estimated 11 million people living in the United States\u00a0without documentation are here either because they entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas. Trump, in an August speech, said that those people\u2019s lives would change rapidly\u00a0during a Trump presidency. While the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had proposed a path to citizenship for some of those people, Trump has said they have only one way to gain legal status: leave and return with a visa, something that could require years of waiting. [ The odd thing that happens when you actually ask Trump\u2019s supporters about mass deportation ] Trump initially indicated that any undocumented immigrant was vulnerable to deportation and then said that he would first target those with criminal records. At first glance, prioritizing the deportation of criminals parallels Obama\u2019s policy. But Trump would dramatically expand the pace. Trump said that 2 million unauthorized immigrants have criminal records.

Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cDay One, my first hour in office, those people are gone,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\u201d The president has wide latitude to issue directives to ICE, as Obama did in 2014, when he asked the agency to focus its efforts on those who posed threats or had been convicted of crimes and de-emphasize targeting of families living peacefully. Since then, the overall number of deportations has declined. But a greater proportion of those removed are criminals. \u201cThe president can do a lot simply by changing the imperatives of the bureaucracy,\u201d said William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cWhat will be interesting is \u2014 right now, most of the 11 million [undocumented] immigrants have been here for well more than 5 years. The law says they are entitled to a hearing to find out if they are entitled to some form of relief. The question will be, how far will the agencies be encouraged to shortcut due process?\u201d [ World gasps in collective disbelief following Trump's election ] Trump has said his deportations will be carried out in a \u201cvery humane\u201d way, but he has also spoken admiringly of the United States' 1954 operation, authorized by Dwight Eisenhower, in which hundreds of thousands were rounded up and taken back to Mexico in overcrowded and sometimes-deadly trips. Trump said in a CBS \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Scott Pelley that the operation was \u201cvery successfully done.\u201d \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t sound nice, but not everything is nice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound practical,\u201d Pelley said, who added that \u201cthere is something called civil rights.\u201d \u201cThere is also called, \u2018We have a country,\u2019 \u201d Trump said. Trump has said he wants to triple the number of ICE agents. Even so, rounding up millions of people, criminals or not, would require monumental expense and potentially expose Americans to all kinds of disruptions. Agents can\u2019t simply break down the doors of homes, looking for illegal immigrants. And so there would have to be a surge in raids at farms and factories. New checkpoints might be established along roads. For those who are apprehended and awaiting deportation, the United States\u00a0would also need to build new detention facilities \u2014 or pay private companies to do so. Trump has also pledged to clamp down on so-called sanctuary cities, places in which local authorities decide not to proactively ask immigrants for paperwork, even if they believe they\u2019re undocumented. Trump could pressure these cities by cutting off or reducing federal funding, a step for which he\u2019d need support from Congress. Tripling ICE\u2019s immigration-agent core, which currently numbers about 7,000, would be \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d and unlikely to be approved by a Senate run by Republicans but with a large Democratic minority, Sandweg said. \u201cThink about all the downstream consequences of that,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cYou need more officers around the country. You need office space, you need all those guns, uniforms, slots at the academy for training. We\u2019re talking about possibly close to $1 billion a year in increased costs.\u2019\u2019 At immediate risk, former officials and immigrant advocates say, is Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The 2012 initiative has given temporary protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of people who arrived in the United States as children. Those immigrants say the program has helped them emerge from the shadows, making possible a work permit and a Social Security number. But DACA is not a law; it was not even created by an executive order. It was established by a policy memo sent out by former homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano. Trump, if he follows through on his promise, could simply rescind it. Which would mean that anybody who gave the government their information and location to participate in the program could be much more easily found by federal deportation agents. \u201cThe elimination of DACA is a serious threat and a serious concern,\u2019\u2019 said Sandweg, who helped design the program as a senior homeland security official in the Obama administration. \u201cIt could be done administratively, and you could absolutely use the information provided for targeting purposes.\u2019\u2019 Then there is the wall. The United States\u00a0has already spent billions in recent years fencing off about one-third of its southern border. But Trump\u2019s signature proposal calls for finishing the job, trucking in steel and concrete while also entering into likely courtroom battles with ranchers who don\u2019t want to give up their land. The longtime developer said in an interview last year with The Washington Post that building the structure would be \u201ceasy \u2026 It\u2019s not even a difficult project if you know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u2019 business ",

When the justices took the bench this morning Ginsburg appeared to be wearing her \"dissent\" jabot.

But there were no court decisions slated to go out on Wednesday. The Supreme Court did not return a request from NBC News for comment.

She added that Trump was \"faker\" who \"really has an ego\" and she would move to New Zealand if he gets elected. When asked by Associated Press reporter Mark Sherman about a Trump victory, Ginsburg said, \"I don't want to think about that possibility.\" Trump hit back at her calling her \"inappropriate,\" \"a disgrace to the court,\" and calling for her to resign. \"Her mind is shot\" he tweeted.

The makeup of the Supreme Court hung in the balance during the high stakes election. Trump will now nominate someone to fill Justice Antonin Scalia's position on the bench. Trump said that any potential Supreme Court Justice should \"interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted,\" he said at a campaign rally in Michigan. \"We will save our Second Amendment, which is under siege.\" Safia Samee Ali ",

One group began at Union Square Wednesday night, while another converged at Columbus Circle. The demonstrators then took to the streets blocking traffic as police mobilized to contain them under a light rain.\u00a0 People protest against Republican president-elect Donald Trump in the neighborhood of Manhattan in New York, U.S., November 9, 2016.\u00a0 Close REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz The protesters chanted \u201cNot my president\u201d and \u201chey, hey, ho, ho Donald Trump has got to go.\u201d They held signs that read \u201cTrump Makes America Hate\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Lose Hope.\u201d Some of the protesters cursed out key battleground states that Trump had won to secure victory. Outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in midtown police installed barricades to keep the demonstrators at bay. Police say the protests have been mostly peaceful. The NYPD tweeted at 8:30 p.m. that they are looking for two men who may have Molotov cocktails at the protest.\u00a0 NYPD looking for two males with possible backpacks full of Molotov cocktails at the anti-Trump protest in Manhattan. \u2014 New York City Alerts (@NYCityAlerts) November 10, 2016 The signs of his victory were evident in New York, where security barricades were placed in front of Trump Tower.\u00a0 Police officers walk in front of Trump Tower, the home of President-elect Donald Trump, in New York, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016.\u00a0 Close AP Photo/Seth Wenig In Portland, Dozens of mostly young protesters rallied against President-elect Donald Trump, disrupting traffic and shutting down streets and freeways.\u00a0 During the Wednesday gathering people shouted \u201cnot my president\u201d and many carried signs saying things like \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d The Portland Police said a portion of Interstate 5 through the city was briefly closed in both directions because of protest activity. Earlier the protest in downtown drew several Trump supporters, who taunted the demonstrators with signs. At one point, a lone Trump supporter was chased across Pioneer Courthouse Square and hit in the back with a skateboard before others intervened.\u00a0 In Chicago, hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Chicago\u2019s Trump Tower to express their disapproval of the election results. Authorities say police have been stationed outside the hotel and condominium tower since early Wednesday, when it was apparent the Republican Trump had defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in their presidential contest. Stunned reactions to Trump's victory across the world The protest was organized by the groups Freedom First International and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, among others. The organizers contend the protest is designed to show solidarity with Muslims, women, LGBTQ people, poor and working people and Black Lives Matter. CBS Chicago reports event was billed as an \u201cemergency protest,\u201d and thousands had signed up via Facebook. The demonstration started at 5 p.m. and was expected to last until 9 p.m. A different event had been planned by another Facebook group \u2014 to \u201cPoint and Laugh at Trump Tower\u201d the day after the election. The organizer made some last-minute changes, given Trump\u2019s unexpected victory. In Boston, protesters chanting \u201cwe will not be silenced\u201d and carrying signs reading \u201cHe Will Never Be My President\u201d gathered on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse following Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory.\u00a0 Many of those chanting and singing hailed from Boston-area colleges and said they were shocked and disillusioned by Democrat Clinton\u2019s loss. Meaghan Schaefer, a 19-year-old political communication student at Emerson College, said she was angry. \u201cWe were so close to seeing the first woman become president and she lost to a man who has no political experience, who doesn\u2019t represent the majority in this country,\u201d she said. Matthew Bittner said he was in utter disbelief with Trump\u2019s win. He said he knows Clinton isn\u2019t perfect, but said he felt like people didn\u2019t want her in office because she\u2019s a woman. \u201cThere\u2019s so much bigotry in this country that we thought was resolved but it was just covered with a blanket,\u201d said the 21-year-old theater student from Suffolk University. \u201cHe wants to bring back a sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic society and we will not stand for it.\u201d The two were among hundreds who flocked to the Statehouse holding signs that read \u201cMake Bigots Afraid Again,\u201d chanting \u201cI\u2019m still with her\u201d and singing The Beatles\u2019 \u201cAll You Need is Love.\u201d Massachusetts, a reliably Democratic state in presidential elections, handed its 11 electoral votes to Clinton on Tuesday. The last Republican presidential candidate to win Massachusetts was Ronald Reagan in 1984. What does Trump's victory mean? Nineteen-year-old Robert Duncan, who is black and a musical theater student at the Boston Conservatory, said he is gay and sees Trump as an oppressor. \u201cHe\u2019s said awful things to people of all different kinds,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI\u2019m here because I just want to get all my emotions out honestly. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019ve been crying all day.\u201d Many of those protesting said despite Trump\u2019s victory, they have their eyes on the future. \u201cFor the next four years, we just have to do what we can,\u201d Schaefer added. \u201cWe can\u2019t throw away our shot. We\u2019re young. We\u2019re educated. We can make a difference the next time around.\u201d At Berkeley, thousands of students walked out of several East Bay high schools Wednesday , protesting Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory, CBS San Francisco reports .\u00a0 Students at Berkeley High, Bishop O\u2019Dowd, Albany High and Oakland Tech all staged walkouts. Meanwhile, several hundred students staged a noontime rally at San Jose\u2019s Lincoln High School and El Ceritto policesent out an alert at 1 p.m. asking drivers to be careful because walkouts were underway at several Contra Costa County schools. Students at a few Phoenix high schools walked out of class Wednesday in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s win, CBS affiliate KPHO reports .\u00a0 About 200 students at Carl Hayden High School chanted \u201cOut Donald Trump\u201d as they left school around noon. The high school is located at 35th Avenue and Roosevelt Street. Students at Metro Tech, North and Central high schools also staged walkouts. Students were seen holding signs and the Mexican flag as they marched to the Arizona State Capitol where they gathered outside the building and then walked a circuit around the plaza. Many of the signs expressed anti-Trump and anti-Sheriff Joe Arpaio sentiments. Arpaio was defeated by Democrat Paul Penzone after 24 years in office. Phoenix police officers were in the area to keep the students on the sidewalks and unharmed. The protest has remained peaceful. A small group of students gathered in front of City Hall in downtown Phoenix. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

With the sudden prospect of a historic governing majority in front of them, a number of Trump critics took a new look at the candidate they had criticized as unqualified or offensive. \"This needs to be a time of redemption, not a time of recrimination,\" Speaker Paul Ryan, who had clashed with Trump repeatedly over the campaign but ultimately campaigned for him, said in a press conference. Old foes wished him well: Jeb Bush, who called Trump the \"chaos candidate\" in the primaries and refused to vote for him, offered congratulations and prayers. The National Review's editors, who devoted an issue to opposing his candidacy under any circumstances, congratulated him too and urged Congress to \"do what they can to reinforce Trump's better instincts.\" Related: Trump's Win Stuns Latinos, Immigrants Worry About Their Future This difference was especially pronounced on foreign policy where dozens of conservative experts and former aides had denounced Trump in the primaries and general election. Now some urged their colleagues to join Trump, who has little experience and a small inner circle, in the hopes they could nudge him away from potentially ruinous terrain. \"I would urge all national security professionals to serve if asked,\" Max Boot, a former Rubio adviser who had assailed Trump throughout the race, said in an email. \"Trump knows little about foreign policy and needs all the guidance he can get. This is the area where the president has the greatest discretion.\" Avik Roy, a policy adviser to a number of presidential candidates focused on health care, had derided Trump's philosophy as \"white nationalism\" during the campaign. But he too was concerned that Trump needed proper guidance and the government needed to function, guidance that only seasoned hands could provide. \"I'm of the view that good people should serve in a Trump administration,\" he said. \"The federal government has so many important responsibilities that affect hundreds of millions of Americans, and the government needs good people to administer those responsibilities.\" Play ",

The city is one of three in California, and four in the U.S., that passed taxes on sodas and other sugary drinks in Tuesday's election. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Bottles of Fanta are displayed in a food truck's cooler in San Francisco, Calif. The city is one of three in California, and four in the U.S., that passed taxes on sodas and other sugary drinks in Tuesday's election. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Voters in three cities in California passed ballot measures to place a one cent-per-ounce tax on sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages, a move aimed at tackling obesity. In San Francisco, 62 percent of voters cast their ballots in favor of the tax on sugary drinks. Similar measures passed in Oakland and Albany, Calif. In addition, the city of Boulder, Colo., passed a 2 cents-per-ounce tax. \"The growing worldwide movement to tax sugary beverages can no longer be stopped,\" wrote Harold Goldstein, executive director of Public Health Advocates in a release today. Goldstein pointed to the World Health Organization's recent report calling on nations around the globe to tax sugary drinks. Tax Soda To Fight Obesity, WHO Urges Nations Around The Globe As we've reported, after Berkeley, Calif., passed a tax on sugary drinks, one study found that consumption of sugary drinks dropped by about 20 percent. And, after Mexico imposed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in 2014, researchers documented a decline in sales. The CEO of the American Heart Association touted the passage of the soda tax measures as a big win for public health. \"We applaud voters for rejecting the big spending and false arguments of outsiders and standing up for what they knew was right for their community,\" wrote Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, in a statement today. \"From sports drinks to sodas to fruit-flavored drinks, today's children are drinking their age in these sugary drinks each week. Reducing consumption will improve rates of diabetes, heart disease and tooth decay,\" Brown concluded. The American Beverage Association, which represents all the big soda brands, led the effort to oppose the soda tax measures. The group spent upwards of $9.5 million on a ad campaign, dubbed \" Don't Tax Our Groceries .\" Article continues after sponsorship \"Voters in the Bay Area have made a decision, and we respect their decision,\" Susan Neely , CEO of the American Beverage Association, told us by phone. But she says taxes are not the best way to pursue the public health objective of tackling obesity. \"Consumers don't want these taxes ... and we think there's a more effective way to go about it,\" Neely says. Trick Or Treat? Critics Blast Big Soda's Efforts To Fend Off Taxes \"We are deeply and publicly committed to reducing calories and sugar from our beverages,\" Neely explains, pointing to a pledge to a 20 percent reduction by 2025. Neely explains that the industry has partnered with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to work in communities with high rates of obesity to try to change the behaviors of people who may be getting too many calories from sugar-sweetened beverages. Currently, the group has efforts underway in Alabama and Mississippi, as well as communities in the Bronx and Brooklyn, N.Y. Enlarge this image A billboard at a New York subway stop in Brooklyn nudges consumers to think about the calories they consume. It's part of a soda industry-funded campaign to target obesity. Allison Aubrey/NPR hide caption toggle caption Allison Aubrey/NPR A billboard at a New York subway stop in Brooklyn nudges consumers to think about the calories they consume. It's part of a soda industry-funded campaign to target obesity. Allison Aubrey/NPR \"We're doing a double-down to try to change behavior to reduce [consumption of] calories and sugar from our beverages,\" Neely told us. Some of the efforts include offering taste tests and coupons for lower-calorie and zero calories options. Other strategies include a billboard campaign, Balance What You Eat, Drink & Do ,\" aimed at nudging people to think about the calories they're consuming. The industry is also working with retailers to place lower-calorie options at eye-level, so that consumers may be more likely to notice them. Neely says she doesn't agree with public health advocates who argue that there's growing momentum for soda taxes. \"I just don't see middle-class tax increases spreading across the country. I don't think there's support by people, and I don't see this as a movement.\" ",

The pre-scheduled exercises will take place next week during Cuba's Strategic Exercise \"Basti\u00f3n 2016\" from Nov. 16-18 and on National Defense Days, Nov. 19 and 20. \"... Maneuvers and tactical exercises will take place with the participation of Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) units, the Ministry of the Interior, and other components of the defense system, including the movement of troops, materiel, aviation, and explosives in the cases where this may be required,\" the state-run newspaper said. Deciding the Future of Guantanamo and Its Prisoners This will be the seventh time Cuba will conduct what it calls the Strategic Exercise \"Basti\u00f3n.\" While today's announcement did not directly mention yesterday\u2019s U.S. election of President-elect Donald J. Trump, these exercises almost always occur at a point of increased tension between Cuba and the United States. In July, President Barack Obama restored diplomatic relations with Cuba and eased some sanctions to allow trade and tourism to the nation. Although a five-decades-old trade embargo remains in place, the move was seen as a big step forward in normalizing decades of hostility between the two countries. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro applaud during a Major League baseball exhibition game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team at the Latinoamericano stadium in Havana, March 22, 2016. While campaigning as the GOP presidential nominee, Trump threatened to reverse those relations in an interview last October, telling the local CBS affiliate in Miami that the U.S. had entered into \"a very weak agreement.\" When asked if Trump would break off diplomatic relations on his first day in office, Trump responded that he would do \"whatever you have to do to get a strong agreement.\" \"And people want an agreement, I like the idea of an agreement, but it has to be a real agreement. So if you call that for negotiation purposes, whatever you have to do to make a great deal for the people of Cuba. So important,\" Trump said. He added that he would wait to appoint an ambassador to Cuba until a \"very powerful agreement\" was put in place. According to The Associated Press, Cuba first launched this military exercise after Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 in the midst of the Cold War . 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Nov 9 2016, 3:06 pm ET Silicon Valley Had This Response to a Trump Presidency by Alyssa Newcomb advertisement A pall hung over Silicon Valley today as the realization sunk in that Donald Trump \u2014 who has a contentious relationship with the tech community \u2014 will be the next President of the United States. Just how much was Trump reviled? For every $1 the tech community donated to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton received $60 . Two women look at their cell phones in front of a portrait of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in Moscow. Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP Related: Why the Next President Could Benefit From Some Tech Chops \"The tech community is a bit on edge,\" Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy told NBC News. Privacy, hacking, visas for highly skilled foreign workers, net neutrality, and the growing gig economy are some of the most pressing tech-related issues that have been addressed this election cycle. There are a limited number of H-1B visas offered each year, allowing highly skilled workers \u2014 many of whom work in technical fields \u2014 to enter the United States. \"I think Trump and tech are aligned on the need for increased innovation as it's an economic driver, but aren't currently aligned at all on H1-B visas, which are core to the U.S. tech agenda,\" Moorhead said. During the Republican debate in March, Trump said the visas are \"something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\" \"It's very bad for business in terms of \u2014 and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it,\" he clarified. The sometimes tense and complicated relationship between Silicon Valley and the government was thrust into the spotlight in February when Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, refused to help authorities find a way to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernadino shooters. Cook said in a letter that what the FBI was essentially demanding was for Apple to build a new operating system that could be installed on an iPhone. No such thing exists, but Cook said if it did, there would be no way to guarantee it would only be used for investigations, potentially jeopardizing the privacy of millions of Americans. Related: Silicon Valley Donated 60 Times More to Clinton Than to Trump At the time, Trump called for a boycott of Apple until the iPhone maker cooperated with authorities. (Apple didn't and the FBI said they found a way with outside help.) Trump has also called for Apple \"and all of these great companies\" to make their products in the United States. \"Trump would like to force them to do it, and I don't believe you can do this by force. You should try to economically incentivize it,\" Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners, told NBC News. At the realization of four years of a Trump presidency, Silicon Valley leaders expressed their sorrow but said they're ready to get back to work. Sam Altman, president of start-up incubator Y Combinator, defended Trump's most high-profile surrogate in Silicon Valley, billionaire Peter Thiel, after some called for YC to sever ties with him over his Trump support. On Tuesday night, Altman couldn't hide his disappointment at the result. \"Tonight we cry, we despair, and we fear. Tomorrow we get back to work trying to build the world we want,\" he wrote. Tonight we cry, we despair, and we fear. Tomorrow we get back to work trying to build the world we want. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 9, 2016 Alyssa Newcomb ",

The victims were identified as 25-year-old Meagan Leigh McCraw Coxie and 29-year-old Johnny Joe Coxie, Coroner Rusty Clevenger said at a news conference today. They were both killed by gunshot wounds, McCraw Coxie to the head and Coxie to the torso, Clevenger said. Their deaths were ruled homicides, Clevenger said. The husband and wife were the second and third bodies found on Kohlhepp's property. The first body was found on the property Saturday, days after missing woman Kala Brown was discovered chained up and locked in a metal container there. That body was identified as Brown's boyfriend Charles Carver, officials said. The second body, which was found Sunday, and the third body, found Monday, were both removed from the site on Monday, according to officials. Body Found on South Carolina Property Identified as Charles Carver Kohlhepp was taken into custody Thursday morning after a tip had led investigators to his large plot of land in Woodruff. There they found Brown, who had been missing for two months, with a chain around her neck inside a metal storage container measuring about 30 feet by 15 feet. Brown, 30, was being held against her will inside, \"chained up like a dog,\" Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. Brown has since been released from the hosital, where she was taken after she was found, he said. When Kohlhepp was taken back to his property by authorities Saturday, he mentioned both Coxie and McCraw Coxie by name, Lt. Kevin Bobo of the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office said today. Clevenger said today that the married couple's graves were not far from the container where Brown was kept. Clevenger said today that McCraw Coxie's mother reported her missing on Dec. 22, 2015. The couple, who lived in Spartanburg, had recently gotten out of jail then and had a history of panhandling, Clevenger said. Clevenger said the couple had a child who has been accounted for. Authorities said today they believe they have found all of the bodies on Kohlhepp's property. After Kohlhepp was charged with Brown's kidnapping, he allegedly confessed to killing four people 13 years ago in a South Carolina town. Kohlhepp was charged with four counts of murder in the 2003 killings as well. On Sunday, he was denied bond in a South Carolina court. It's possible that the number of charges against Kohlhepp will increase as police continue to investigate, prosecutors said. It's not clear whether Kohlhepp has entered a plea to any of the charges against him. ABC News has not been able to determine whether he has a lawyer. ABC News' Jason Volack and Anne Emerson contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Giuliani, the former mayor of New York; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; and Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House. Mr. Trump also spent Wednesday morning receiving phone calls from world leaders, said the campaign advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the transition planning. The advisers declined to identify the leaders, though one said it would be unusual if the president-elect had not heard from allies like Britain and Germany. Asked if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had spoken with Mr. Trump, who surprised many Americans by saying that Mr. Putin had been a stronger leader than President Obama, the aide said the two men had not been in touch. Anxiety was particularly deep among Hispanics, African-Americans, Muslims, immigrants, women and others who had felt disparaged or demonized by Mr. Trump, who at times used harsh and racially charged language in ways that upended mainstream politics. The very idea that Mr. Trump had been endorsed by a Ku Klux Klan newspaper \u2014 even if he rejected it \u2014 symbolized the sense of shock that he would now lead a vibrantly diverse democracy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Asked how they would feel about a Trump presidency, more than a third of Americans said they would be frightened, exit polls found. Among those who voted for Hillary Clinton, the feeling was almost unanimous and reflected a deep divide: 92 percent said Mr. Trump scared them. Politicians also joined business leaders \u2014 as well as the many Americans with retirement and savings accounts \u2014 in keeping a nervous eye on the world financial markets in fear of the sort of backlash that wounded Britain after its vote in June to leave the European Union. While some business leaders worried about the nation\u2019s sliding into recession, others were more hopeful that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and relaxing of regulations would be welcomed by the financial markets, which stabilized after sharp declines overnight. Photo Speaker Paul Ryan said Donald J. Trump had won a \u201cmandate\u201d for his vision of government, during a news conference in Janesville, Wis., on Wednesday. Credit Scott Olson/Getty Images Political activity and reactions in both parties were in a surreal state of suspended animation as Republicans and Democrats began anticipating Mr. Trump\u2019s moves. Paul D. Ryan , the speaker of the House, said at a news conference Wednesday morning that Mr. Trump had a \u201cmandate\u201d for his vision of government, including trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after his stunning upset victory over Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Ryan described a United States under Mr. Trump as a different place than it has been, saying that the president-elect would be a champion of the many Americans who do not like the direction of the country and \u201cdon\u2019t feel heard and don\u2019t feel represented by the people in office.\u201d Mr. Ryan, who chose in October to stop campaigning for Mr. Trump after revelations about his past offensive language about women, said that he had \u201cspoken with Donald twice in the last 18 hours\u201d and that the president-elect \u201cwill lead a unified Republican government.\u201d \u201cWe talked about the work ahead of us, and the importance of bringing the nation together,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a news conference in his hometown, Janesville, Wis. \u201cThis needs to be a time of redemption, not a time of recrimination.\u201d Mr. Ryan could have been hinting at his own fate. There are a more than a few restless conservatives in Mr. Ryan\u2019s conference in the House who had been agitating for the speaker\u2019s ouster before the election because of his failure to fully embrace Mr. Trump. And whether that discontent will now die down is far from clear. Other Republicans who made their reservations about Mr. Trump proudly known before the election tried to be gracious, though some sounded more skeptical than optimistic.

Patrick Jones (@Patrick_E_Jones) explains how that legal trouble could follow him to Washington. Buzz60 Donald Trump claimed a stunning victory after a long and contentious 2016 campaign. Here's a look back at his career and path to the presidency. (Photo: John Locher, AP) As voters across the country were voting Tuesday to elect billionaire Donald J. Trump the next President of the United States, lawyers and a judge dealt with new motions in a California court in what may be one of the most important of 75 or so still-open lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses. In fact, the last seven days saw a flurry of motions, responses and rulings in one of the class-action lawsuits brought by former Trump University students, who say the Republican president-elect\u2019s company ripped them off for tens of thousands of dollars in tuition for a sham real-estate course. The Trump University cases \u2013 there are three of them still open \u2013 are among the most serious remaining lawsuits involving Trump and his companies as the businessman transitions from candidate to the White House because they involve allegations of fraud and racketeering. Among the other cases are a $4 million lawsuit brought by a Republican political consultant who said Trump defamed her; a class-action claiming his presidential campaign broke consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages to people\u2019s cellphones; and a suit by a golf club employee who says she was fired after complaining to her bosses about sexual harassment. But the most problematic for President-elect Trump will likely be the\u00a0real-estate course racketeering and fraud cases \u2013 because of the seriousness of the allegations made. In any one of the cases, an official ruling by a court that Trump or his company were financially liable for fraud could provide Congress with grounds to consider impeachment proceedings. There\u2019s a hearing Thursday in the California case to hash out motions that will set the tone for the trial, which is set for Nov. 28. Exclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee \u201cIf the fraud and racketeering allegations against President-elect Trump are true, he is legally impeachable for high crimes or misdemeanors,\u201d said Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah who\u2019s researched the Trump University cases, who acknowledged that while that\u2019s technically the case, a Republican controlled Congress makes that very unlikely. \u201cWhether he is politically impeachable is another matter.\u201d Nevertheless, Peterson said on Wednesday that a long, drawn-out public exposure of a sitting President of the United States to witness testimony, embarrassing documents or what would be a high-profile trial could be time consuming and distracting, and come with lingering political cost. Trump\u2019s attorneys often settle lawsuits, according to USA TODAY\u2019s analysis of more than 4,000 court cases involving Trump and his companies over the decades, and Peterson said that may prove the wisest course in the remaining Trump University actions. Will Trump's presidency impact his IRS audit? \u201cIf I were advising President-elect Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cI would encourage him to move heaven and earth to settle his pending Trump University lawsuits in order to spare the country the trauma and spectacle of his upcoming trial.\u201d Attorneys for Trump in two cases and plaintiffs in the Trump University case did not return messages for comment on Wednesday as to whether they renewed any settlement discussions.\u00a0Trump has said he would hand his sprawling business empire over to his children in an arrangement he described as a \u201cblind trust.\u201d \u201cI will sever connections and I\u2019ll have my children and my executives run the company, and I won\u2019t discuss it with them,\u201d Trump said on Fox News in September in response to questions about broader potential conflicts raised by his businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s just so unimportant compared to what we\u2019re doing about Making America Great Again.\u201d His daughter, Ivanka, has said the company will avoid deals that could pose potential conflicts for her father. Dive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits Trump can\u2019t completely sever the connections because nothing in the law protects a sitting president from having to testify or being forced to release private business and financial records. That could take up his time or the\u00a0time of his aides and attorneys. This summer, while the nation was dealing with the mass shooting at the Pulse night club in Orlando, Trump was giving a deposition in one of the lawsuits involving the chefs and his Washington hotel. On the campaign trail, in recent months, Trump threatened additional lawsuits against journalists and several women who publicly accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances. Trump eased up on those threats in the waning days of the campaign. Some of the open lawsuits create potential conflict of interest for the President-Elect, according to legal experts, presidential historians and others interviewed by USA TODAY during a months-long investigation that tracked more than 4,000 lawsuits involving Trump and his companies. For example, could his appointments to the federal judiciary be influenced by his own court cases, current and past? In the Trump University case in California, Trump publicly lashed out at District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, saying he was biased against Trump because he is of Mexican descent and Trump has proposed building a \u201cgreat wall\u201d along the Mexican border. Also, could judges, attorneys or parties in litigation involving Trump and companies alter decisions or outcomes of cases as a way of gaining favor with the President of the United States, even if those companies have been handed over to Trump\u2019s children to run? As the \u201cboss\u201d of tens of thousands of government employees and the chooser of key leadership positions in dozens of federal agencies, Trump would also face potential questions about how he\u2019d untangle his business interests and government interest in some cases. For instance, he\u2019s involved in two lawsuits with chefs who walked away from deals to open restaurants in the Trump Organization\u2019s new hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington. Trump\u2019s landlord: the federal government. Trump\u2019s attorneys have argued that only a couple dozen of the active cases are significant and they\u2019ll deal with those as any large company with massive holdings deals with them. Trump and the Law \u201cThe results shouldn\u2019t be different in the eyes of the law,\u201d said Alan Garten, general counsel for Trump and his business interests, in the final weeks before Election Day. Some of the cases against Trump are of the frivolous nature filed all the time by conspiracy theorists, prisoners and others against government officials and celebrities. His attorneys have continued to work in the months leading up the election to both close active cases involving Trump and the companies, and to fight against efforts by the news media \u2013 and other groups \u2013 to unseal records in other cases, such as his divorce from Ivana Trump and the Trump University suits. Shifting from candidate to president only boosts Trump\u2019s profile and potential requests to unlock records in other Trump cases, both as part of legitimate fact-seeking by news media organizations and politically-motivated pursuits by interest groups. 122 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ffJTxD ",

    "text": "CBS News Nov 9, 2016 12:24 PM EST Most polls heading into the Nov. 8 presidential election predicted Hillary Clinton would win the presidency. Two weeks before people lined up to vote, famed poll aggregator Nate Silver at the FiveThirtyEight website put her odds of winning at up to 85 percent. When he later gave Trump a 35 percent chance of winning a few days before the election, the adjustment was criticized by liberal pundits.\u00a0 Yet most polls clearly got it wrong, leaving a triumphant Donald Trump seemingly clairvoyant in his repeated pre-election, mid-scandal claims the odds were actually in his favor. Even with a steady downward trend from a mid-October double-digit national lead caused in part by the email scandal, Clinton still appeared to have an edge in the race at the end. The day before the election, a CBS News poll suggested Clinton had a four-point lead nationally, 45 percent to Trump\u2019s 41 percent. But polling is still more art than science, relying on educated guesses about demographic groups, voter turnout, and positions on issues, and margins of error are overlooked by just reading the headlines of polls.\u00a0 Another problem is that national polls don\u2019t reflect the Electoral College . Ask Al Gore about this: he earned about 500,000 more votes nationally than George W. Bush in 2000 but lost anyway because he didn\u2019t win in the right states. When all the votes are counted , Clinton may end up suffering Gore\u2019s fate -- she currently has a slim popular vote lead of a couple hundred thousand electoral votes. Clinton could walk away from this election with the support of a plurality of voting Americans, but a resounding Electoral College defeat. In one of CBS News\u2019 final polls before this election , this result appeared possible. Projections showed Ohio and Florida as tied after Clinton had enjoyed leads in those states, which have long had tremendous sway over the outcomes of presidential elections with their large number of electors. Other polls focusing on individual states just before the election showed Trump making huge headway in states Obama won in 2012 -- such as North Carolina -- as well as deep inroads in Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin, which haven\u2019t been won by a Republican in decades. So if people had looked at individual battleground states and their polls rather than the national polls, the picture for Clinton would have appeared far from rosy just before Nov. 8. And none of that takes into account the educated guessing that goes into election polling. As the Economist points out: \u201cEvery survey result is made up of a combination of two variables: the demographic composition of the electorate, and how each group is expected to vote. Because some groups\u2014say, young Hispanic men\u2014are far less likely to respond than others (old white women, for example), pollsters typically weight the answers they receive to match their projections of what the electorate will look like.\u00a0 \u201cPolling errors can stem either from getting an unrepresentative sample of respondents within each group, or from incorrectly predicting how many of each type of voter will show up.\u201d This problem leads to uneven election forecasting and the possibility that poll headline writers in tight races can easily get it wrong. John Heilemann, Bloomberg Politics editor, told CBSN that means that \u201cpolling is broken, in a profound, deep way.\u201d In the case of Trump, we now know one of the key reasons\u00a0 why he won: non-college educated white voters , which represents a massive demographic in most of America, and especially in most key battleground states.\u00a0 Their enthusiasm for the Republican candidate appears to have driven them to the voting booth in a way most pollsters simply failed to predict -- the unprecedented crowds at rallies, the people who drove long distances and waited for hours and hours to see him speak, the theory went, would not necessarily translate into votes at the ballot box. In hindsight, it seems obvious that this was flawed reasoning. Those Americans came out in record numbers to vote for Trump. In addition to non-college educated white voters, white voters with a college degree also went for the Republican candidate in greater numbers than polls predicted. Heilemann said this is probably due to many of them being \u201cembarrassed\u201d to admit publicly they supported Trump .\u00a0 So while it appeared that Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric during the campaign was turning away large segments of Americans in droves, it was at the same time firing up the passions of a sizable demographic in the right states to produce one of the most stunning political upsets in history. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

You have to wonder how stock market analysts got this so wrong. After all the predictions that the stock market would tank on a Donald Trump presidential victory, the market did none of that Wednesday. Instead the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed almost 300 points. Perhaps the pre-election... (Gail MarksJarvis) \"The worst thing you can do is to pretend that it's not there or to be afraid to talk about it,\" said Claire Lew, founder of Know Your Company, a Chicago-based software tool for employee feedback. Lew believes part of the reason behind much of the surprise at the election result stems from a culture that discourages political discourse in polite conversation. She urged employers to encourage kindness and empathy and remind their workers of what they have in common as a company. \"The only way we make progress is if we have a civil and respectful place\" to discuss politics, she said, and apart from family and social communities, the workplace is often it. Some employers whose workers have diverse political views reported a more constructive coming together after a brutal campaign season marked by vicious rhetoric. \"Pretty much stunned silence in the office, even the Trump supporters couldn't believe he won,\" Ravin Gandhi, CEO and co-founder of Chicago-based GMM Nonstick Coatings, said of his office climate Wednesday. \"Best news was that everyone on (the) left and right really seems to take unifying now seriously, and the mood is quite optimistic because everyone is sick and tired of arguing and contention.\" Others were not so positive. Philippe Weiss, managing director of Seyfarth Shaw at Work, the law firm's Chicago-based workplace consulting arm, said some Clinton supporters were calling company employee assistance programs and \"reporting depressing thoughts or even sinking feelings of doom\" after nights spent in a \"Facebook-fueled sadness spiral.\" One marketing firm, he said, reported that employees were experiencing stress reactions such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath and sweaty palms. On the victorious side, some Trump supporters were celebrating, Weiss said. He described a cargo hauler based south of Chicago that reported \"high-fives and cheers as well as some over-the-top gloating,\" including terms like \"losers.\" The employees at PricewaterhouseCoopers had a lot on their minds when they got to work Wednesday morning, and U.S. Chairman and senior partner Tim Ryan knew it. He sent out an email to staff members encouraging them to discuss the election but to be mindful. This was a long and emotional campaign, after all. \"There's angst in certain pockets without a doubt,\" he said. \"What we're doing is helping people focus on what our purpose is.\" The firm sent out a similar email earlier this year, too, saying it was OK to talk about the racial tensions rearing up around the country. It helps staff members figure out what these events mean to them and to PwC's clients, Ryan said. Dorri McWhorter, CEO of the YWCA of Metropolitan Chicago, sent out an organization-wide email at 6 a.m. Wednesday expressing appreciation for everyone's work and recognizing that the day might be difficult for employees, some of whom have been dealing with divisiveness within their families. But the outcome is \"definitely calling us to rally around the work that we do and making sure our clients are supported,\" McWhorter said. Leaders need to make sure to address the emotions that hang so heavy in the wake of the election, said Laura MacLeod, CEO and founder of New York-based employee relations consulting firm From the Inside Out Project. \"There's an elephant in the room,\" MacLeod said. \"Any time there's an elephant in the room, you can't get past it; you need to deal with it.\" ",

Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in their White House battle after he waged a campaign that included promises to crack down on illegal immigration, deport people illegally here and to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it. \"I feel sick to my stomach that this is the reality that we would have to live in,\" said Martinez, advocacy director at United We Dream. \"My conversation tomorrow with her will be a different one and not one I feel prepared to have, but don't think I ever will be.

He had started his campaign with comments that angered many in the Latino community, insisting Mexico sends rapists and people who commit crimes and drugs to the U.S. In a Facebook post, immigrant advocate Gaby Pacheco, said she was getting calls and texts from people who were scared. Pacheco was a leader in the immigration activism movement that pushed for DACA deportation relief.

By Karen DeYoung November 9 at 6:39 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 There have been times in America\u2019s past when an untested new president faced immediate calamity and potentially world-shattering disaster, from the Civil War to the Cuban missile crisis. But the broad array of international challenges now facing Donald Trump is among the most daunting and dangerous in modern U.S. history. After a campaign of bombastic sound bites and often contradictory policy prescriptions, Trump\u2019s plans remain opaque for dealing with issues including terrorism, Russian aggression, and multiple shooting wars in the Middle East. He has called for increased military strength and more forceful American leadership, while also speaking of stepping back from U.S. responsibilities as the free world\u2019s primary protector. He has invited China to invade North Korea and \u201csolve that problem,\u201d but also said he would host North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the White House. He said he would renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal, and then called for strict enforcement of the existing agreement. His plan to combat the Islamic State, Trump said during the campaign, is a secret. [ Who will Trump be as commander in chief? ] In Mexico, China, Russia and Israel we ask people what they think of the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) With little clarity on much of what he intends to do, the best initial indicator of Trump\u2019s approach may be those he chooses for his national security team. Many of the names floated so far strike fear in the hearts of mainstream Republicans as well as Democrats, while others instill a sense of reassurance. Perhaps more than any other area of policy, the universe of potential picks for national security Cabinet positions, agency heads, deputies and those below is limited by the large number of Republican establishment figures in the field who said early and often during the campaign that they would never support a Trump candidacy or work in a Trump administration. Determining who is even on a list of possibilities is hampered by the fact that those who have been organizing the transition apparently have had little contact with Trump or the tightknit circle of family and top campaign officials around him. There has been \u201ca firewall between people who had access to the man himself and people doing stuff that was serious about a transition,\u201d said one prominent Washington conservative who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cThe Trump transition to most of us is just a black box.\u201d Even if some of the senior Republicans who denounced Trump decide to offer their services, he has given no indication he is prepared to forgive and forget. Blackballing job contenders, of course, is not unique to Republicans. Liberal advocacy groups, reportedly with guidance from Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), had assembled names unacceptable for positions in a Clinton administration. On the Republican side, \u201cTrump is like Nixon,\u201d the conservative said. \u201cThey keep lists.\u201d In a post-election message to State Department employees Wednesday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry reminded them of the need \u201cto continue moving ahead with all the activities and projects on which you are currently engaged. The pace of events across the globe does not allow for timeouts.\u201d Mexico's Finance Minister Jose Meade and central bank head Agustin Carstens have looked to calm markets after Republican Donald Trump's surprise victory sparked a massive selloff tanking the peso up to 13 percent in after-hours trading. (Reuters) The \u201csecond imperative,\u201d Kerry said, is \u201cto welcome our incoming colleagues warmly and professionally and to provide them with all the assistance they need to ensure a seamless transition from one administration to the next.\u201d Trump\u2019s personnel choices could ease or deepen concern in Cabinet departments and agencies such as the CIA, where Trump has said he would reinstate the use of torture and detention for terrorism suspects. Former agency officials said that any attempt to reintroduce harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding would meet fierce internal resistance. [ Intelligence community is already feeling a sense of dread about Trump ] Among the rumored candidates for secretary of state, former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton \u2014 both outspoken Trump supporters \u2014 are viewed as anathema by many current diplomats and as loose cannons even by many of their fellow Republicans. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is seen as the more mainstream candidate. Corker said that he had spoken to Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Wednesday to offer his congratulations but that he\u2019d had no conversations with them about a position in the new administration. Although he has expressed interest in the State Department job in the past, \u201cit\u2019s way too soon for that kind of thing. . . . These are decisions that others are making,\u201d Corker told the Tennessean newspaper Wednesday. At the Pentagon, Trump has criticized the counterterrorism policies of current senior officers, saying he would replace them, but also has said he would defer to them on new policies. Among other things, current and former defense officials have expressed unease over threats to withdraw from NATO, use nuclear weapons, and engage in military partnerships with Russia while responding more aggressively to Chinese expansionism. The possibility that retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and an active Trump adviser and surrogate who is highly critical of current policy, would be named as defense secretary or national security adviser does not sit well within the Pentagon or the intelligence community, career officials in both have said. Flynn\u2019s appointment to a Cabinet position would also require a congressional waiver of a law restricting activities of former senior military officers. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) , another senior Trump adviser, is said to be interested in the top Defense Department job. Though a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he is much better known for his interest in immigration than the military. Amid the many swirling rumors \u2014 and a dearth of actual information \u2014 former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus is said to be in the mix for a top national security job, as are House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), former congressman Mike Rogers of Michigan and George W. Bush national security adviser Stephen Hadley. Trump\u2019s lack of foreign policy experience could also shift more focus back to Congress, where Republicans who have sharply criticized the level of unilateral control President Obama\u2019s White House has exercised over national security \u2014 and some of whom have denigrated Trump as uninformed on the issues \u2014 are chafing for a bigger voice. At the same time, Trump\u2019s lack of a deep bench to populate the National Security Council staff could result in a reduction from an Obama White House team seen as bloated . But Trump \u201cwasn\u2019t elected on the strength of his foreign policy,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. A non-politician with no record to judge, Trump \u201csaid enough to get people to elect him,\u201d Pletka said. But he has also \u201cmade a lot of statements that are totally contradictory,\u201d she said. \u201c. . . I have absolutely no idea how he\u2019s going to govern.\u201d As Trump makes his choices and begins to work through the various policies he has described in bullet points, some issues will require immediate attention. They include the fight against the Islamic State, Syria\u2019s simultaneous civil war and broad Middle East instability; a newly aggressive Russia that U.S. intelligence says has directly intervened in the American electoral process; and the likelihood that North Korea will have a missile-mounted nuclear weapon capable of reaching U.S. shores during the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency. Others, including China, Iran and global terrorism, are on a larger plate of pressing strategic issues. In Asian capitals such as Tokyo and Seoul, officials voiced trepidation over Trump\u2019s campaign promises to make them pay more for a U.S. security shield. In Damascus and Jerusalem, there was optimism that pressure to make concessions to their opponents would lessen. At NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, one ambassador sent an email to another summing up the high state of anxiety given the president-elect\u2019s threat to withdraw from the alliance if other members failed to meet their obligations. The email read, \u201cOh my god.\u201d Adam Entous contributed to this report. Read more: ",

    "text": "Margin over next best candidate Margin behind leader NBC News exit polls One explanation is that immigration symbolizes different things to different people. In interviews, a number of Trump\u2019s supporters stressed that they believe in or even encourage legal immigration. Others described legal\u00a0immigrants \u2014 not just undocumented workers \u2014 as competition for jobs and wages. Some looked at the issue through the lens of national security, imagining scary scenarios of ISIS infiltration. \u201cI want to control immigration,\u201d said Marge Stafford, a 51-year old nurse in Media, Pennsylvania. \u201cI\u2019m all about legal immigration, which is fine.\u201d Illegal aliens get free health care and we pay for the interpreter The more hostile talking points came from voters who viewed migrants as a sponge on resources. \u201cThey come here, they have babies, then they have the right to stay illegally,\u201d Sandy Murray, a 50-year-old Trump voter from Dubuque, Iowa, complained. \u201cWe need the money from their handouts for education and veterans.\u201d \u201cIllegal aliens get free health care and we pay for the interpreter,\u201d Lynette Phillips, a 48-year old real estate agent from Elkhorn, Wisconsin, said. \u201cOur voters don\u2019t get free health care.\u201d Social Security and Medicare, the largest and most popular entitlement programs for senior citizens, are the primary drivers of the long-term budget deficit. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for both, along with almost all other federal benefits. Still, for many Trump supporters, it feels like the government\u2019s attention is going to every group except the ones they believe need it most. This belief isn\u2019t inherently linked to race or immigration status, but at times it can resemble an ethnic competition. \u201cThey\u2019ve had their candidate for eight years,\u201d as one tattooed trucker put it outside a Cincinnati-area Trump event. Asked what he meant by \u201ctheir candidate,\u201d he clarified that he meant black voters. There are other stray data points that point toward the resentment factor. In Illinois, a state Trump won by a large margin, voters were required to select individual delegates on their ballot with the names of the candidate they supported next to them. Two delegates submitted by the Trump campaign, Nabi Fakroddin and Raja Sadiq, received several thousand fewer votes \u00a0than the other Trump delegates in their districts for no apparent reason other than their names. Online, a dedicated fan base \u2013 one that Trump sometimes encourages with retweets \u2013 engages in more overt expressions of racism and anti-semitism, often bombarding his critics with slurs and offensive images. It\u2019s hard to tell how much Trump\u2019s internet following is representative of the average Trump voter, however. Donald Trump signs copies of his TIME magazine cover. For the magazine\u2019s photoshoot, Trump posed in his office with an eagle one arm while giving a thumbs-up with the other. In interviews, supporters frequently bristled at accusations of racism, and Trump himself has made a show of highlighting black, Latino and Asian supporters at his events. A February NBC News|SurveyMonkey \u00a0poll of Trump voters found that only 21 percent believed \u201cracial prejudice\u201d drove support for their candidate either \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201ca lot,\u201d while 79 percent said they believed \u201canti-immigrant sentiment\u201d was a motivating factor. Still, a tension hangs over Trump events. Edgar Green, an African-American Trump supporter who works as a dishwasher and convenience store clerk in Maryland, offered an illustration of the complicated relationship between Trump voters and race. While waiting in line for a Trump rally in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Green, who voted for Obama previously, insisted that \u201cTrump is not racist, he\u2019s America first.\u201d He complained that Trump\u2019s critics had distorted the candidate\u2019s message. His plans to ban Muslims and build a wall were rooted in national security, not bigotry, Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s high time we stop having business outsource to other countries,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe got a high unemployment in this country and we need to do something about it. \u2026 All these people in line feel Donald Trump is the answer.\u201d Just then, a car drove by waving a large Confederate flag, which prompted a round of whoops and hollers from the long procession of Trump supporters waiting to get into the rally. Green was among those cheering. \u201cHey, rocking the Confederate Flag, all right!\u201d he said. The Trump surge Trump\u2019s support has challenged so many conventions about the Republican Party and politics more broadly that right up until the last minute, observers were unsure whether it was real. The Trump campaign\u2019s weak ground game fueled hopes among his opponents that his supporters wouldn\u2019t bother to show up and vote. They were wrong. In key states throughout the race, turnout soared. By the time Trump became the presumptive nominee, about 7 million more votes had been cast \u00a0than in the entire 2012 Republican primary, even before big states like California and New Jersey had a chance to weigh in. In Florida, a state that had been a critical battleground for Mitt Romney in the 2012 GOP race, close to 700,000 more voters swamped the polls and helped power Trump past the state\u2019s native son, Marco Rubio. Research by Politico \u00a0suggested the national surge of voters came primarily from general election voters who normally skipped primaries rather than habitual non-voters, but their presence nonetheless reshaped the primaries. To Trump\u2019s opponents, these voters were falling for an act. Rubio famously labeled Trump a \u201ccon artist.\u201d Other rivals complained that he was ignorant of foreign policy, that his trade wars would cause a recession, and that he frequently made false statements. Voters heard plenty of criticism of Trump, mostly late in the race. But they had their pick among a wide range of Republican hopefuls from every corner of the party. Whatever alternative message these candidates had to offer didn\u2019t resonate. \u201cI\u2019m tired of people promising the moon and not giving us anything,\u201d Jeff Marshaus, 53, of Shreve, Ohio, said. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Republican and I got tired of the same old, same old.\u201d Republican voters had their pick of more than a dozen candidates, but no one resonated more clearly than Trump.

Eric Risberg/AP hide caption toggle caption The interior of the lethal injection facility at California's San Quentin State Prison in 2010. Eric Risberg/AP California voters rejected a ballot measure that would have abolished the death penalty, and narrowly approved a competing measure designed to streamline the execution process. Proposition 62, which was opposed by about 56 percent of voters, would have repealed the death penalty for murder and replaced it with life in prison without parole. On the other hand, supporters of Proposition 66 campaigned under the slogan \"mend it, don't end it,\" as member station KPCC reported . The measure passed with 51 percent of the vote. It \"limits death penalty appeals and sets strict timelines for state court rulings in capital cases,\" as NPR's Richard Gonzales told our Newscast unit. Proposition 66 is also \"intended to speed up executions by designating trial courts to hear petitions challenging death row convictions, limiting successive petitions and expanding the pool of lawyers who could take on death penalty appeals,\" as The Los Angeles Times wrote . California Faces Opposing Ballot Initiatives On Death Penalty Critics of the measure say making appeals faster \"increases the chance of executing an innocent person,\" as KQED's Scott Shafer reported on Weekend Edition Sunday . He spoke with Santa Clara University law professor Ellen Kreitzberg, who said \"the danger with 66 is it does limit and narrow the ability to present newly discovered evidence, which is how most of these innocence claims are presented in court.\" Proponents of abolishing California's death penalty argued that the system is broken beyond repair. As KPCC reported, the current status quo can be summed up like this: \"[D]eath sentences are occasionally handed down but no condemned inmates are executed.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"No one has been executed in the past ten years due to court disputes over procedures for lethal injections,\" Richard reported, though 750 prisoners are currently on death row. In a statement following the vote, the Yes on 62 campaign said that \"the high costs will continue to add up, the backlog of cases will continue to mount and the stories of injustice will continue to be heard.\" In 2012, California voters rejected another measure to abolish the death penalty by four percentage points, as Richard reported. Two other states also voted to support capital punishment. According to The Associated Press, Nebraska voters \"rejected a death penalty ban,\" while Oklahoma voters \"by about a two-to-one margin approved a state question guaranteeing the use of the death penalty and allowing lawmakers to designate any method of execution that is not banned by the U.S. Constitution.\" ",

    "text": "Donald Trump Victory Casts Shadow Over US Pledge to International Climate Change Goals By Catherine Thorbecke Nov 9, 2016, 1:59 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Energy Policy and the Environment: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Donald Trump 's ascendance as president-elect of the United States has caused many environmentalists and world leaders to raise concerns over the future president's stance on climate change -- a global issue he has called a \"hoax.\" Trump vowed in a speech at a petroleum conference in North Dakota last May to cut off funding to United Nations climate change programs. He added that he would nix the U.S.'s involvement in the Paris climate agreement, an accord that entered into force last week. Trump said the international agreement to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \"gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much our energy and how much we use right here in America.\" Donald Trump Vows to Cut US Funding for UN Climate Change Programs If Elected Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, an international non-governmental environmental organization, told ABC News today that Trump's beliefs don't change the facts about climate change. \"The U.S. elections matter, but they don't change science. This is going to be a problem that millions of people are dealing with and fighting against no matter who is president,\" Nichols added. \"Climate change is not a hoax, climate change is real -- 97 percent of climate scientists say that it is real.\" \"One way or another, Donald Trump will have to deal with the reality of climate change,\" Nichols said. \"He will have to deal with the weather, the rise in sea levels, and the worldwide extremism that climate change produces because of resource scarcity.\" Nicholas added that it is \"unclear what he means when he says he is going to 'cancel' the Paris climate agreement.\" \"Obviously, he cannot cancel a multilateral treaty signed by 190 nations,\" Nichols said, noting that it would be possible, however, for Trump to take action to inhibit the U.S. from meeting the pledges it agreed to. However, \"he can't, on his own, cancel the Paris climate agreement,\" Nicholas said. \"Our leaders in the military recognize this as one of the most urgent threats facing the United States,\" Nichols said of climate change. \"So, I think that President Trump would be forced to listen to the experts in science, and the Department of Defense on what he can do to tackle climate change so it doesn't make our problems worse.\" Trump's projected win of the Electoral College comes as the U.N.'s climate talks are currently taking place in Marrakesh, Morocco. Erik Solheim, the head of the U.N. Environmental Program, told ABC News today that they congratulate Donald Trump on his victory and look forward to working with his administration in the future, adding simply that \"science is not decided by elections, science is very clear,\" in response to Trump's comments calling climate change a \"hoax.\" Solheim added that they \"will all wait and see, and judge American politicians on their actions, not on the different statements they made during the campaigns,\" in response to Trump's threats to pull funding from U.N. environmental programs. As for the American president-elect's vow to withdraw from the Paris agreement , Solheim said the U.S. \"can only withdraw in the long term,\" and the earliest that this would be possible is in 2021. \"So, we of course expect Donald Trump to honor agreements made by previous governments,\" Solheim said. Solheim added that investments in renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gasses are \"an enormous opportunity for business,\" saying that ultimately the American people would suffer most if the U.S. were to withdraw from the Paris agreement. \"The developing world is now in the lead for many climate actions,\" Solheim said, describing how some of the most recent advancements in sustainable energy have been led by businesses and developing nations. \"We call upon the United States to be part of that leadership.\" SLIDESHOW: Aerial Photos of Antarctic Ice Sheets Reveal Evolving Landscape Hilda Heine, the president of the Marshall Islands , an archipelago nation that is already beginning to feel the effects of rising sea levels, called on Trump to step up and combat climate change when he becomes president. \"Now that the election campaign has passed and the realities of leadership settle in, I expect he will realize that climate change is a threat to his people and to whole countries which share seas with the U.S., including my own,\" Heine said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "If Clinton wins popular vote, expect calls to kill Electoral College Nick Penzenstadler , USA TODAY 5:01 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 3.6k Shares x Share Donald Trump may have won the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the presidency, but Hillary Clinton could still win the popular vote. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains. Buzz60 Hillary Clinton holds a slim margin in the popular vote over Donald Trump with several left-leaning counties yet to be counted. That likely will mean a scenario like in 2000 where Al Gore won the popular vote\u00a0but lost the election to George W. Bush because of the winner-take-all Electoral College system. Expect to hear chatter in coming days about alternatives to the system, said Robert Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the outcry to do away with the Electoral College, but I don\u2019t see it having legs unless this would happen to a Republican candidate, because then both parties will have been affected,\u201d Shapiro said. Clinton has 59,786,125 votes as of Wednesday afternoon, or about 47.6% of the vote. Trump has 59,578,670 or 47.5% of the vote \u2014 a razor-thin margin. A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote In 2000, Gore took 48.4% of the popular vote to Bush\u2019s 47.9%. In the wake of that election, some floated a constitutional amendment to change the system. A more likely scenario, Shapiro said, could be changes at the state level. \u201cStates decide how their electoral votes are decided, so there was a movement to pass state laws that allocate votes to the candidate that gets the popular vote in the nation,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThat would avoid this situation of a split popular and electoral vote.\u201d Vote totals from Tuesday also indicate Trump could surpass the 2012 GOP vote for Romney \u2014 which could signal a resurgence of Republican voters. It could give Trump another line similar to his stump phrase about capturing more GOP primary votes than anyone on record. In terms of total votes cast, about 124.5 million votes have been counted. That would fall well short of the 128.5 million cast in 2012 or 131 million in 2008. Predictions that blacks, women and Millennials would not vote Trump proved largely untrue Still, Trump claims to have targeted first-time voters and campaigned in disillusioned rural areas that otherwise may not have participated. That effect may reverberate this year because of the GOP will be in control of the White House, Congress and most likely will have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. \u201cThe vote totals are significant in this era of close elections, polarized parties and the stakes getting higher,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cYou could have unified Republican government and eliminate the filibuster in the Senate if they really wanted to do that.\u201d Exit polls indicate about a tenth of the electorate were first-time voters. Of those, more sided with Clinton, 56% to 46%. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the popular vote was \u201can indication that Secretary Clinton's historic campaign succeeded in mobilizing tens of millions of Americans behind her vision and her candidacy.\u201d But he said no one at the White House would be using the popular vote to make excuses or question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. \u201cWinning the popular vote is not what gets you the keys to the Oval Office. You've got to win the electoral vote. I know that everybody knew the rules going into the contest,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is our system of democracy. And it's not perfect but it's a system that has served us very well.\u201d Contributing: Gregory Korte\u00a0 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fCNtk4 Most Popular ",

    "text": "Nov 9 2016, 12:03 pm ET Obamacare As We Know it May be Done For by Bertha Coombs, CNBC advertisement Donald Trump promised that one of the first things he will do as president is to repeal Obamacare. Now, analysts and health-care industry officials are taking stock of how the reality of abolishing the Affordable Care Act could play out in Washington under a Republican White House and Congress. Doctors groups and patients breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday, June 25 when the Supreme Court upheld one of the most important provisions of Obamacare: the federal subsidies. Mark Wilson / Getty Images It wouldn't take much for Congress and a Trump administration to overturn the ACA, said Leerink analyst Ana Gupte. \"Through budget reconciliation, it is possible for them to repeal and replace the bill entirely\" by cutting funding to key parts of the health-reform law like premium subsidies, Gupte said. \"They could choke off the blood supply to Obamacare.\" In a note to clients, RBC analyst Frank Morgan said: \"The impact of a Trump win would likely inject an unhealthy dose of uncertainty\" for the health-care industry. That's an understatement. Until Tuesday, most analysts and health-industry leaders put very low odds on the possibility of the health-reform law being upended. \"Through budget reconciliation, it is possible for them to repeal and replace the bill entirely.\" Now, the big question is how a repeal would be executed, particularly when it comes to the 12 million-person Obamacare exchange market. \"From an industry perspective, what is the definition of repeal?\" asked Ben Isgur, health leader at PwC's Health Research Institute . \"Trying to go through and find the thousands and thousands of pages of laws, regulations, laws rules and taking out every single one? Most people don't think that is a realistic path forward.\" For insurers, the ramp up to Obamacare took time, and a switch to its replacement will be a major adjustment, Isgur said. \"Many of these companies are like large ships \u2014 you can't turn them on a dime.\" On Wednesday, insurer Aetna was trading 3.6 percent higher, while Humana gained 5 percent, likely on a hunch that a Trump administration would look on the companies' merger plans more favorably. But shares of insurance rivals such as Cigna and UnitedHealth Group were trading lower, and Obamacare Medicaid players such as Centene and Molina Healthcare getting hit the hardest. Hospital stocks like Tenet Healthcare and HCA Holdings tumbled in heavy volume Wednesday, with Tenet recently down 24 percent and HCA shedding 14 percent. Hospitals in general have benefited from the greater numbers of patients being covered by some form of insurance that has occurred since the ACA went into effect. In the first quarter of 2016, about 8.6 percent of Americans \u2014 or about 27.3 million people \u2014 were uninsured. That was first time the nation's uninsured rate fell below 9 percent. A survey conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested there are now 21.3 million fewer uninsured person than in 2010. Not all of the newly insured have received their coverage through Obamacare exchanges. Some have benefited other ACA provisions, such as expanded access to Medicaid in 31 states and the ability of children to remain on their parents' insurance plans until they are 26 years old. A spokesman for the health insurance lobby, America's Health Insurance Plans said the industry is prepared to work with the new president. \"Every American deserves access to affordable health coverage,\" AHIP spokesman David Merritt said in a statement. \"A competitive private market can deliver more choice, higher quality, and lower costs. We will work across the aisle \u2014 with every policymaker and the new administration \u2014 to find solutions that deliver affordable coverage and high-quality care for everyone.\" One of the ways Trump has proposed to create more competition in the individual market is to allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines \u2014 an idea long embraced by Republican analysts. Yet, that could prove as controversial and as complicated as Obamacare itself, says Dr. David Friend, director of consulting firm BDO's Center for Health Excellence and Innovation. \"I wonder constitutionally can they do it?\" Friend asked. \"Health care is a state regulatory issue. As a doctor I have to get a state license to practice medicine in each state. I think there would be a big fight.\" When it comes to the pharmaceutical industry, Trump has spoken favorably about the idea of allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The health insurance program for seniors is now prohibited from doing so by law. \"I would want to cut the best deal I could, and get out of there fast.\" Friend said Trump's unpredictability could give him leverage to get the drug industry leaders to roll back prices voluntarily rather than face new regulation. \"If you don't know what he's going to do,\" Friend said, \"I would want to cut the best deal I could, and get out of there fast.\" Pharmaceutical and biotech stocks broadly rallied Wednesday. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) skyrocketed, trading 7.5 percent higher. The gains were being supported by stocks such as Dow components Pfizer and Merck \u2014 which gained 6.8 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively \u2014 as well Allergan and Amgen , and many others. Among them, Mylan , which has recently been at the center of the debate over drug prices, gained 5 percent. The company has been criticized for steep price hikes of more than 500 percent in recent years for its anti-allergy EpiPen devices. Bertha Coombs, CNBC ",

    "text": "TRUMP'S AGENDA: WHAT HIS ELECTION MEANS FOR AMERICA Amid spiking premium costs, Ryan also told The Washington Post Wednesday that the law is \"collapsing under its own weight.\"\u00a0 Beyond Republicans' blunt opposition to ObamaCare, there are few specifics on how the dismantling and rebuilding of a national health care system would look. But supporters like Families USA, a liberal consumer-health lobby, organized a midafternoon call with hundreds of ObamaCare advocates in about 40 states to start mapping a grassroots campaign to fend off challenges from a Trump administration.\u00a0 White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama will have the chance to discuss these policies with Trump but said the president's top priority is not his legacy but the millions of Americans who got health insurance under the law. \u00a0 RBC Royal Bank analyst Frank Morgan said the impact of a Trump win \u201cwould likely inject an unhealthy dose of uncertainty\u201d for the health care industry. During the first quarter of this year, the rate of the country\u2019s uninsured fell below 9 percent for the first time to 8.6 percent. Still, premium spikes for 2017 are being felt by millions, and helped fuel Trump's presidential bid in the final weeks.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s victory on Wednesday also has major consequences for the makeup of the Supreme Court. Obama\u2019s outgoing pick, Judge Merrick Garland, appeared certain not to make the bench; Trump\u2019s victory will likely pave the way for the nine-member court to be restored to full capacity, with the court once again leaning right.\u00a0 \u201cTrump's decisive, map-realigning victory, was in large part won by his focus on the Supreme Court issue,\u201d Ken Blackwell, former Ohio secretary of state who is on the board of numerous conservative organizations, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe American people showed their rejection and disdain for adding more liberals to the Court by voting to re-elect a Republican Senate.\u201d Blackwell believes Trump\u2019s position on the Supreme Court \"seriously and publicly demonstrated his approach to governing when he announced repeatedly that he asked America's pre-eminent legal experts associated with The Federalist Society to provide him a list of the most qualified and experienced judges with solid records of jurisprudence.\u201d Another Obama legacy item on the line is the Trans Pacific Partnership. The 12-member free-trade agreement pushed by the Obama administration as a way to deepen economic ties has been knocked multiple times by Trump. He has vowed to ditch the deal when sworn in.\u00a0 \u201cTPP is now in the history dustbin for sure,\u201d Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told POLITICO Pro. Other trade initiatives including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trade in Services Agreement are also likely to fall by the wayside. Whether Trump will follow through on some of his more controversial comments on immigration \u2013 building a wall and making Mexico pay for it \u2013 as well as his call for \"extreme vetting\" for immigrants from terror-prone countries has yet to be seen. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed concerns over a mass deportation during an appearance on MSNBC and said, \u201cI think everyone learns as they go through this process.\u201d He added, \u201c(Trump\u2019s) not calling for mass deportation. He said, no, only people who have committed crimes and only until all of that has been taken care of do we look at what we do next.\"\u00a0 Advertisement ",

David McKay Wilson, The Journal News 5:18 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 189 Shares Donald Trump takes the stage for his victory speech on Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. \u00a0(Photo: Shawn Thew, European Pressphoto Agency) President-elect Donald Trump defied political custom by refusing to release his income tax returns during the bruising 2016 presidential campaign because he said his returns were under IRS audit. Now he'll have to decide whether he'll defy the presidential custom of releasing his tax returns each of the four years when he serves as president. He'll also have to decide whether to exert influence regarding his personal tax issues at the IRS, which is part of the U.S. Department of Treasury he will oversee. Every U.S. president since Richard M. Nixon has released his tax returns, with the exception of President Gerald R. Ford, who came to power following Nixon's resignation, said tax historian Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project. Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0said\u00a0Internal Revenue rules\u00a0 require the annual audit of \u00a0the president and vice president's tax returns. He'll be under audit. As\u00a0were his predecessors, dating back to Nixon. However, while the IRS must\u00a0conduct the audit, there is no\u00a0rule to mandate that the nation's top elected officials release to the public. \"That's custom,\" said Gleckman. \"And that's where Trump will have some explaining to do. He won't be able to use the audit excuse in the same way he has been using it.\" The IRS has declined to say whether Trump's returns are under audit. And on Wednesday, the agency declined to comment on whether his election would have any impact on the audit Trump has said is underway. Other issues could arise once Trump takes control of the U.S. government's executive branch. Trump could use his executive powers to influence actions by the IRS, said\u00a0David Herzig, professor of law at Valparaiso University Law School in Valparaiso, Indiana. \"First, Trump will\u00a0now be in charge of the IRS\u00a0that's investigating himself, and that creates an inherent conflict,\" said Herzig. \"Even if he doesn't exert authority over the IRS, he'd be in charge of the executive agency making the determination whether he or the IRS is right. There's a potential for problems as it plays itself out.\" Herzig said Trump could order\u00a0the IRS not to enforce its internal regulations regarding the annual audit of the president and vice-president. He also appoints the IRS commissioner, whose term expires\u00a0in November 2017. \"What if Trump tells the IRS not to enforce the rule on annual audits?\" Herzig said. Then there are questions of what would transpire if the IRS makes a finding against President Trump for back taxes, which he decides to challenge. Herzig said one venue for such a challenge would be the United States Tax Court, which a 2015 decision found to be part of the executive branch. The president also\u00a0appoints judges to that court.

    "text": "Email For months throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump laid out the major issues he would seek to address in his first 100 days as president. Now, in the aftermath of his surprise electoral victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton , his plans could become reality \u2014 concrete designs for a new Republican White House. Trump has made promises on key issues that stand in stark contrast to Barack Obama\u2019s policies on health care, trade and foreign policy. Should Trump take action on his pledges, he stands to be extremely active during his first three months in the Oval Office. Obama \u2018Rooting\u2019 for Trump\u2019s Success in Uniting Country Many of Trump\u2019s pledges revolve around the goal of reforming or replacing laws established over the past eight years, bolstering national security and improving the country\u2019s reputation internationally. The Republican nominee argued that Clinton represented another four-year term for the Obama administration, and Trump has vowed to radically change the direction of the country from his first day on the job. SLIDESHOW: 2016 Election Night Winners and Losers - Best Moments in Photos First Day in Office During the campaign, Trump frequently pointed to the tasks he wishes to accomplish on his first day in the Oval Office. Laying out the aims of his administration, Trump said he will \u201crepeal and replace \u2018Obamacare,\u2019\u201d \u201cimmediately suspend the admission of Syrian refugees ,\u201d \u201corder a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years,\u201d \u201cbegin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses,\u201d \u201cterminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama,\u201d \u201crestore the rule of law to our land,\u201d \u201cbegin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border\u201d and \u201cget rid of\u201d international gangs of thugs and drug cartels \u2014 all on his first day. \u2018Drain the Swamp\u2019 In the subsequent 99 days, Trump has promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d \u2014 the campaign\u2019s term for rooting out corruption in Washington. A major pledge of his is a \u201cconstitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\u201d Representatives and senators may currently serve an unlimited number of two- and six-year terms, respectively. Additionally, Trump has proposed a law barring government officials from lobbying the government within five years of their service and prohibiting lobbying by those officials on behalf of foreign governments. He also said he will institute a hiring freeze in order to reduce the size of the federal government. Campaign finance reform would take the form of forbidding foreign lobbyists to raise money on behalf of campaigns in the U.S. Trade and Foreign Policy \u201cWe don\u2019t win on trade\u201d was a frequent refrain heard at Trump rallies, and in response, the real estate mogul has said he will renegotiate NAFTA and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said he will direct his secretary of the treasury to pursue action against Chinese currency manipulation. Trump has said he will renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal, call a NATO summit to update the organization\u2019s mission and rebalance members\u2019 \u201cfinancial commitments,\u201d cancel payments to the United Nations\u2019 climate-change programs and divert that money to domestic infrastructure improvement. The Republican has vowed to increase investment in the nation\u2019s military and be \u201cunpredictable\u201d when it comes to fighting ISIS in the Middle East. On the campaign trail, he frequently criticized Obama for announcing military actions before their commencement. Taxes and Domestic Issues On taxes, Trump pledged \u201cthe biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan .\u201d The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and Tax Reform Act of 1986, passed during Reagan\u2019s presidency, simplified the tax code and lowered marginal tax rates by more than 20 percent for most citizens. Trump indicated that he will seek to reduce tax brackets from seven to three and called for business tax rates to be reduced to 15 percent. In line with the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d label he assigned himself, Trump said he will increase police training programs and create a task force on violent crime. Other Trump proposals in the first 100 days include the elimination of Common Core in public schools nationwide and the nomination of a Supreme Court justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia .

Watch her entire speech here. USA TODAY NETWORK Michele Bulgatz, left, puts her arms up in celebration as she joins a group of women for a Pantsuit Nation group photo on the steps of the Wayne Lyman Morse United States Courthouse in Eugene, Ore., on Tuesday. (Photo: Chris Pietsch, The Register-Guard via Associated Press) SAN FRANCISCO \u2014\u00a0For the 3.1 million members of the\u00a0Pantsuit Nation, who watched in disbelief as Donald J. Trump defeated the only woman ever to come this close to the Oval Office,\u00a0it was time to regroup. On the morning after the election, even as they\u00a0struggled to process the pain and shock, \"a rallying cry for the ages\" coursed\u00a0throughout the private Facebook group, inspired by the shout-out from\u00a0Hillary Clinton in her\u00a0concession speech,\u00a0who urged them to make their voices heard \"going forward.\" \"If Hillary can get up this morning, put on her pantsuit and face the nation, we can too,\" wrote one member of the Pantsuit Nation, a group for Clinton\u00a0supporters whose name is a nod to her\u00a0customary outfit on the campaign trail. \"The work never stops, my friends. Fight on.\" With that sense of renewed purpose, the women and men of the Pantsuit Nation came together again on Wednesday. They pledged\u00a0to continue building a viral movement, not yet a month old, that can advocate beyond the\u00a02016 election for the rights of women, immigrants and minorities. The invitation-only group's administrators began work on a Pantsuit Nation platform, distributed a Google doc to collect ideas and convened\u00a0a group-wide virtual meeting to brainstorm next steps. \"My dear, beautiful, heartbroken friends.This is not the end. And while we must take time to grieve, we must also look ahead,\" a message to the group read. It continued: \"If you're a person of color, if you're gay or lesbian or queer or trans, if you're an immigrant or disabled or a veteran or a victim of sexual abuse, or if you're feeling marginalized or afraid, please know WE HAVE YOUR BACK. This group can be a powerful force of good in our country if we all pitch in. I'm not giving up. #pantsuitnation #pantsuitsforever.\" For millions of women, this Election Day turned cold The outpouring of determination temporarily overwhelmed the Facebook group. For a time, Pantsuit Nation had to suspend adding posts\u00a0because of technical glitches and to let exhausted administrators of the group take a much needed break.\u00a0\"We are literally breaking Facebook,\" one of them wrote. Libby Chamberlain, a 33-year-old mother of two from rural Maine, created Pantsuit Nation\u00a0as a safe place for people to share support for Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state who would have been the first woman to serve as president. People are covering Susan B. Anthony's grave stone with 'I Voted' stickers Pantsuit Nation quickly became the go-to forum to discuss the issues raised by Trump's candidacy, gaining momentum after the release of an\u00a0Access Hollywood\u00a0tape in which Trump\u00a0could be heard discussing how he grabbed women's genitalia . Dozens of moderators desperately tried\u00a0to keep up with the flood of posts. Elsewhere online, Pantsuit Nation became a popular hashtag and a Twitter handle. On Tuesday, members of the Facebook group\u00a0wore white in honor of the suffragists or pantsuits in honor of the Democratic nominee. They wrote of taking their young daughters with them into voting booths and shared photographs of their daughters wearing \"Future President\" T-shirts or grandmothers who never lived to see the day a major political party nominated a woman. \u2014 #StillWithHer (@emmybreese) November 8, 2016 By Wednesday morning, the exuberance of what was to be a historic election day had deflated. \"I have nothing nice to say. Nothing uplifting,\" one member wrote. \"This is not the America I want for myself and my children. I only feel safe here, in this space. I wish I could crawl into it.\" But many in the Pantsuit Nation Facebook group, which members say has grown so quickly because of its positive, uplifting posts, began shaking off grief. Members pledged\u00a0to\u00a0stay active. Some pulled\u00a0on their pantsuits for a second day\u00a0and posted\u00a0selfies. \"Two words: organize and unite. Let's do what Hillary said, make our voices heard. Put writings into action,\" commented one member. Dr. Susana Gallardo, a sociology lecturer in women's studies at San Jose State University, said she's not sure \"there's much depth to Pantsuit Nation.\" \"But certainly the awareness that a white Republican male leader can openly discuss assaulting women and depriving people of color of their constitutional rights, and still be elected, is not something that will go away soon,\" Gallardo said. \"The continued activism of women's rights advocates, activists of color, educators, community organizations, will hopefully benefit from those who learned some powerful, if disheartening, lessons during this election cycle.\" 3 latinas doing our part to elect @HillaryClinton We believe in an America where we are respected #ElectionDay #whyivoted @pantsuitnation pic.twitter.com/DjxgaGq0Cn \u2014 Melinda Amato (@melinda_amato) November 8, 2016 Lee Ann Moyer, a 37-year-old speech-language pathologist and marketer from Portland, Ore., proudly captured election night with\u00a0a three-generation pantsuit photo at a family party on Tuesday night before the electoral map turned red. She says she's not ready to retire the pantsuit and remains as determined as ever to shatter\u00a0the nation's highest glass ceiling. \"I'm somewhere in the stages of grief and I am trying to race through them,\" said Moyer, who joined Pantsuit Nation when it had fewer than 30,000 members. \"If this can be a jumping off point,\" she said of Pantsuit Nation, \"well, to jump off into a social movement with 3 million people at the ready, amazing things can happen.\" Angela Gyetvan, a 50-year-old digital strategy consultant from Los Angeles who stumped in swing states and worked on the Clinton campaign, says she got solace from Pantsuit Nation and from\u00a0speaking\u00a0with her 20-year-old daughter, a first-time voter, on Wednesday morning. \"We talked about how we must all step up to the plate and fight for what we believe in. She is advocating that we think positively,\" Gyetvan said. \"Back into the arena.\" Ela Heyn McAdams, a 50-year-old accounting analyst from Highland Lakes, N.J., seized on\u00a0a quotation from former U.S. Rep.\u00a0Pat Schroeder, D-Colorado, passed\u00a0along by a friend: \"You can't wring your hands and roll up your sleeves at the same time.\" \"I am disappointed, of course, but I think a lot of us are trying to find a way to make it a positive thing,\" McAdams said. \"We have a lot of momentum behind us.\" Feminist t-shirt?

But in her speech Wednesday, she asked Americans to give Trump a chance as president. \"I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans,\" she said. \"We must accept this result and look to the future. We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\" After conceding overnight, Clinton quietly exited the Manhattan convention center where her lavish Election Night party was taking place. Singers Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Cher had been in attendance, ready to perform if Clinton clinched a win. Those in the room Wednesday as she spoke included longtime Clinton friends and former diplomats, as well as her top aide Huma Abedin and other senior staff. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was also there. The audience gave her a standing ovation. Some had tears in their eyes. Her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, introduced her by saying how proud of her he was: \"She has been and is a great history-maker.\" Tim Kaine introduces Hillary Clinton on Nov. 9. NBC News \"We know she would have made history as a president,\" he added. In a jab to their opponent, who repeatedly called the election \"rigged\" during his campaign, Kaine also said: \"Nobody had to wonder about Hillary Clinton, whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy.\" By nearly every indication, Clinton looked poised for a win. Even after an 11th-hour bombshell from FBI Director James Comey on the email controversy that has dogged her campaign, polls in the days leading up to the election showed the former secretary of state ahead by 4 points . \"I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will.\" On Election Day, her emotional supporters had filled social media with photos of themselves bringing their daughters to their polls to vote for the first female presidential candidate. Many wore pantsuits to vote, emulating Clinton's signature style. Clinton thanked voters Wednesday and told them that they, too, will experience setbacks, but they shouldn't be discouraged. Hillary Clinton addresses her staff and supporters about the results of the U.S. election as former U.S. President Bill Clinton (L) and her running mate Tim Kaine applaud at a hotel in the Manhattan borough of New York, U.S., November 9, 2016. CARLOS BARRIA / Reuters \"This loss hurts, but never stop believing that fighting for what right is worth it,\" she said. \"To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.\" \"And to all the little girls that are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams,\" she said. \"I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will.\" Related: Hillary Clinton's Loss Triggers Leadership Crisis for Democrats President Barack Obama called Trump early Wednesday to congratulate him and invited him to a meeting at the White House on Thursday. He also called Clinton. In his first remarks since votes were counted, Obama said Wednesday that Clinton has \"lived an extraordinary life of public service.\" \"I'm proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her,\" the president said. \"Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message.\" Elizabeth Chuck ",

All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. ",

House Speaker Paul Ryan claims victory over Democratic challenger Ryan Solen during Ryan's election night celebration party in Janesville, Wis., on Nov, 8, 2016. (Tannen Maury / EPA) Max EhrenfreundThe Washington Post In a brief victory speech early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump devoted only a few words to his specific priorities for policymaking in the next administration. At the top of the agenda was a new investment in infrastructure. \"We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\" the president-elect said after making a few introductory remarks. \"We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\" Infrastructure is a major Democratic priority, but many Republicans remain skeptical that the government needs to spend more in this area. Trump's comments augur a coming conflict with the new Congress, especially Rep. Paul Ryan , the speaker of the House. The Republican from Wisconsin -- a state that Trump carried Tuesday -- had already addressed the country's needs with respect to infrastructure. In a speech at the Economic Club of New York in September, Ryan pointed out that President Barack Obama and Republicans enacted major legislation on highways last year. That bipartisan agreement allocated $305 billion for highways, mass transit and other projects over five years -- an increase in funding, but far less than what Obama and the Democrats had sought. Republicans said the funding in the legislation was adequate. \"We passed the biggest highway bill, the long-term highway bill, for the first time since the 1990s just a few months ago,\" Ryan said in September. \"That's already in place at 10 percent above baseline spending on mass transit and highways.\" Trump has a complicated plan for new infrastructure spending that involves offering tax credits to private firms. These firms would then borrow money from Wall Street and recoup their investment through tolls and other fees.

Nov. 8, 2016. (AP) Donald Trump supporters cheered and celebrated at his headquarters in New York as the Republican presidential candidate won more states in the US election. Nov. 8, 2016. (AP) Trump's economic advisers argue that the plan would come at no cost to the federal government, because drivers would pay for the new construction through tolls, and the improved infrastructure would stimulate economic activity increasing tax revenues and making up for the initial cost of the tax credits. Economists and experts on infrastructure, however, are skeptical that Trump's plan would deliver the promised economic benefits, leaving the federal government in the red. It remains to be seen whether Ryan and his colleagues would accept a plan that was likely to increase the deficit and the national debt, or whether they will adhere to their fiscally conservative principles with a new president in office.

By Missy Ryan November 9 at 3:58 PM Follow @missy_ryan In Mexico, China, Russia and Israel we ask people what they think of the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) This fall, after Iranian naval vessels veered dangerously close to American ships in the Middle East, then-candidate Donald Trump promised\u00a0a swift response. \u201cWith Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats, and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,\u201d\u00a0 the Republican presidential nominee\u00a0 told supporters in September. Trump\u2019s vow to escalate a standoff with a significant military power stood in contrast to the Obama administration\u2019s calibrated response to the naval confrontations with Iran, which included using loudspeakers to wave off approaching ships\u00a0and firing warning shots into the water. It also raises questions about what the nation can expect from a commander in chief who, as a candidate, vowed to upend many of the fundamentals of U.S. defense policy and transform the use of the world\u2019s most powerful military. \u201cHe\u2019s got a fundamental decision now about whether he\u2019s going to continue in the same vein as president,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIf you literally implement his [campaign\u2019s] security policy, you\u2019re probably risking war in multiple theaters simultaneously.\u201d Surrounded by retired U.S. service members, then-presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Sept. 16, 2016. EPA/SHAWN THEW During\u00a0a speech on security policy in September, Trump promised his dealings with the world would be based on\u00a0\u201cdiplomacy, not destruction.\u201d But many of his sometimes contradictory statements on foreign policy have suggested the opposite, leaving defense experts scrambling after his surprise election victory over Hillary Clinton to evaluate how Trump would shape the United States\u2019\u00a0military posture. Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, said that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence had expressed a range of positions \u201cbut never offered a full blueprint\u201d on security issues. \u201cAmerica is in uncharted territory on defense policy,\u201d he said. [ Like \u2018the day Osama was killed\u2019: How the military is reacting to Trump\u2019s victory ] Some of the statements that have created the most consternation among current and former officials included suggestions that the United States could\u00a0withdraw from NATO, statements of support for allowing\u00a0new nuclear nations, and a proposal to \u201c take out \u201d families of suspected terrorists. He also said that he would resume imprisonment of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay , which President Obama has struggled for eight years to close, and renew the use of torture during prisoner interrogations. As a candidate, Trump has suggested in some cases a more muscular response to events overseas, possibly including to China\u2019s land reclamation activities in the South China Sea. The candidate also promised a harder line on the Islamic State but has provided little detail about how he would do so. Trump could take office with two major U.S.-backed offensives underway in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, providing allied forces an opportunity to deliver a major blow against Islamic State militants and offering the next president a chance to claim a tactical victory. In other areas, Trump has suggested a more conciliatory approach to U.S. adversaries. Those include\u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin , despite his annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, and\u00a0Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite the country\u2019s spiraling civilian death toll. Trump also signaled less appetite for foreign interventions than his competitor might have favored. Trump supporters have suggested the president-elect won\u2019t deliver on his most inflammatory statements and say that they expect continuity on many central defense issues: commitments to defend NATO members, alliances with South Korea and Japan, even something close to the uneasy status quo with Russia. Some of Trump\u2019s proposals may encounter resistance from military leaders, including a suggestion that he would broaden military cooperation with Russia in Syria. A similar Obama administration proposal earlier this year generated intense Pentagon opposition , as military officials worried about giving Russia valuable insight into\u00a0their operations. Other proposals from Trump will sit well with the military leadership. He has promised to eliminate congressionally mandated spending caps, for example, and restore cuts to personnel and equipment that he said have left the military dangerously unprepared. If he can succeed in getting\u00a0NATO nations to contribute more to shared defense without rupturing the alliance, it would also be\u00a0a popular move. O\u2019Hanlon said Trump \u201ccould find a way to find a kinder, gentler way to pressure the allies to burden share, and he need not withdraw commitments or he need not do it immediately.\u201d No matter what, Trump may find it harder to execute his defense plans once in office than expected. \u201cI think he will discover what Mitt Romney would have discovered in 2012, which is that the money has to come from somewhere\u201d to pay for defense priorities, said Christopher Preble, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. While Trump\u00a0has promised to pay for military spending increases with government savings, a major boost could run afoul of Congress if it required new borrowing or a tax increase. [ Sen. Jeff Sessions is known for fighting immigration. Now he could lead Trump\u2019s Pentagon. ] The defense bureaucracy could prove difficult to tame in other ways if, as has taken place in the past, Pentagon\u00a0leaders push back against the White House during the policymaking process or publicize information that can sway public opinion about pressing defense issues. Uniformed leaders, in keeping with the law and military tradition, are certain to fall in line with presidential mandates. The exception would be if those orders break the law, as his proposals to permit torture or intentionally\u00a0 attack civilians \u00a0would probably do. The\u00a0sheer volume of defense issues facing the next president means that a President Trump will need to delegate to his staff. While little is known about the campaign\u2019s personnel plans, retired Maj. Gen. Joseph \u201cKeith\u201d Kellogg Jr., who commanded the storied 82nd Airborne Division in the late 1990s, is one senior adviser expected to steer the military transition. While Trump has distanced himself from the traditional Republican foreign policy establishment, some veterans of the George W. Bush administration are expected to flock to government again. Several Republican leaders, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), have been named as a potential defense secretary pick. Julie Tate and Adam Entous contributed to this report. world ",

Bush's team as they transitioned out of power, starting with meeting with Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. \"We are now all rooting for success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy,\" he added.

He also said he told his team \"keep their heads up\" for the work they've done over the past eight years. The president became one of Clinton's most active surrogates in the final weeks of the campaign, making numerous stops at college campuses in battleground states warning about the dangers of apathy. \"Don't boo, vote,\" Obama repeated during the closing weeks of the campaign. But the base of voters that propelled Obama to two national victories did not turn out for Clinton in the way they did for him. Exit polls show Clinton's support from African-Americans, Latinos, and young voters down from what it was for the president four years ago. Play ",

The value of Mexico\u2019s currency plunged sharply after the election of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement that has led to billions of dollars in trade between the two nations. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) 0 Shares Email Hours after the United States elected Donald Trump to be its next president, Mexico began carefully laying the groundwork for a relationship with a new leader who campaigned against its citizens and threatened to wreak havoc with its economy. President Enrique Pena Nieto sent a series of messages from his official Twitter account Wednesday morning, congratulating not Trump himself but the American electorate, and said he was ready to work with Trump to advance the countries' relationship. \"Mexico and the United States are friends, partners and allies that must continue collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America,\" Pena Nieto wrote. The messages came shortly after Mexico's Treasury Secretary Jose Antonio Meade tried to strike a reassuring tone in a news conference by saying that Mexico's financial position is strong in the face of a falling peso. He says no immediate actions are planned. But the threat is real. The United States is Mexico's largest trading partner and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has said he wants to re-negotiate, is the backbone of that commerce. \"The relationship of Mexico and the U.S. is uncertain,\" said Isidro Morales, of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. \"Donald Trump is not a person of institutions. Surely it will be a unilateral policy worse than (George W.) Bush and we don't know what to expect.\" Mexico's currency appeared to track Trump's rising and falling fortunes throughout the campaign and it fell sharply Tuesday night. According to Banco Base, the peso dropped 9.56 percent, its biggest daily loss since 1995. In the streets, Mexicans fretted about just how many of Trump's promises to deport millions of immigrants, revamp trade relations and make Mexico pay for a border wall would come to fruition. Reyes Isidro, a barista in a small neighborhood coffee shop, said that one way or another he was sure the poor would bear the brunt of Trump's policies, even in Mexico. \"In the end, the most affected are always those of us who have the least,\" Isidro said. \"We're the ones that have to take the hits.\" He said the weaker peso would make it more difficult to buy things. And if Trump follows through on his promise of increased deportations, \"what are those people going to do? They will have to find a way to survive on this side. The possibilities begin to narrow for you,\" he said. Jose Maria Ramos, a professor at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana, said Mexicans will have to wait and see what Trump really does. \"A lot of proposals had a marketing effect,\" he said. \"It's one thing to be a politician and make statements; he managed the media very effectively.\" But things like building a wall and making Mexico pay for it could turn out to be too complicated to carry out. \"Being a candidate is not the same as being president.\" 0 Shares ",

David Zalubowski/AP hide caption toggle caption David Zalubowski/AP Colorado state Rep. Lois Court consoles Carol Stork after her 2015 testimony about the death of her terminally ill husband, during a legislative hearing on a proposal to offer life-ending medication to such patients. David Zalubowski/AP Colorado became the sixth state to pass a measure allowing terminally ill patients to obtain life-ending medications. The ballot measure allows adults with six months or less to live the option to obtain prescription medication from a doctor and administer it themselves. The measure passed with about 65 percent of the vote, according to The Denver Post . Colorado Wrestles With Ethics Of Aid In Dying As Vote Looms The measure requires that people \"make two oral requests, separated by at least fifteen days, and a valid written request to his or her attending physician.\" It also requires that people be capable of taking the medication unassisted, and stipulates that patients can rescind a request for life-ending medication at any time during the process. The law protects doctors and pharmacists from prosecution for prescribing or dispensing such medications. The Denver Post reported two similar measures had previously failed to make it through the state legislature. \"We congratulate Colorado for becoming the sixth state where more people have peace of mind at the end of life and fewer suffer unnecessarily,\" Barbara Coombs Lee, the head of the national assisted-dying advocacy group Compassion & Choices, wrote in a statement . The other five states with so-called aid-in-dying laws are Washington, Vermont, Montana, California and Oregon. Montana's law has effectively legalized the practice of helping terminally-ill patients end their own lives by protecting physicians from prosecution, as we have reported . Article continues after sponsorship This Doctor Wants To Help California Figure Out Aid-In-Dying California's law is the most recent \u2014 it was signed by the governor in 2015 and took effect in June this year. Like the Colorado measure, it gives the right to life-ending prescriptions to patients with six months or less to live. Oregon's aid-in-dying law has been on the books the longest \u2014 it took effect in 1997, according to the Oregon Health Authority . John Daley of Colorado Public Radio has reported that Colorado's proposal is modeled after Oregon's law. \"In both, two doctors must determine a patient is mentally capable of making the choice and isn't under undue influence or coercion,\" he said. Stringent anonymous data collection requirements in Oregon's law mean there is detailed information available about how the law has been used by patients and doctors in the nearly two decades since it took effect. For example, between 1997 and 2015, more than one-third of people who obtained prescriptions didn't take the medications, according to data compiled by the state . Oregon data also showed an increase in the number of people requesting life-ending medication in the last three years. ",

    "text": "MoneyWatch Nov 9, 2016 6:27 PM EST Wall Street roared back from the abyss on Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s surprise electoral victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Overnight, equity futures had dropped several percent, echoing the Brexit chaos from June: An angry electorate out to punish the establishment was making markets recoil once again. Yet the fear soon subsided. Trump\u2019s victory speech was conciliatory , Clinton conceded. And, most important for reversing the panic that set in on first blush, traders realized that if Trump\u2019s economic plans are enacted, they would amount to a huge fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, with a strong dose of deregulation for the financial industry and others. Equities soared , with the Dow Jones industrials index gaining 1.4 percent after testing new highs, thanks to big gains in bank stocks and other areas set to benefit from a Trump administration. The dollar surged. But a big sell-off in Treasury bonds, evidence of technical weakness, and a jump in long-term interest rates suggest challenges -- and ongoing market volatility -- lie ahead. Uncertainty in global financial markets after Trump's victory Treasury bonds were slammed on a spike in inflation expectations and chatter of official selling of U.S. bonds by the Chinese. Also, the December Federal Reserve interest rate hike seems to be on track as well. But that boosted financial stocks in a big way, up 4.1 percent as a group, on hopes that higher rates will lift loan profitability. \u00a0 Some health-care stocks were also strong on visions of a lighter regulatory burden on drugmakers and biotechs. The group gained 3.4 percent, with Pfizer ( PFE ) closing up 7.1 percent after trading even higher earlier in the session. U.S. Steel ( X ) gained 17.2 percent, thanks to an analyst upgrade by Jefferies on post-election benefits from possible trade protectionism and increased infrastructure spending. Corrections Corp. of America ( CXW ) gained a whopping 43.1 percent as analysts noted possible higher demand if Trump tightens immigration enforcement. Clinton\u2019s defeat also removed the threat of her anti-private-prison stance. And Lockheed Martin ( LMT ) gained 6 percent on a general boost for defense stocks, thanks to Trump\u2019s clamoring for an upgrade to military hardware. On the downside, emerging markets stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other yield-sensitive issues, and clean energy stocks underperformed. Looking ahead, a lot remains in flux.\u00a0 Will the surge in long-term interest rates continue to be a net positive despite the dampening effect it will have on already tepid economic growth? Will Fed Chair Janet Yellen come under political pressure to resign? Will recent job gains continue?\u00a0 And will the surge in the dollar further pinch U.S. corporate profit margins and weigh on crude oil at a time of vulnerability for both? Trump's victory marks seismic shift in America Also, let\u2019s not forget that the first major policy challenge Trump will face is the need to raise the U.S. debt ceiling in March -- something that will focus attention on the deficit-raising consequences of his fiscal plans and put many Congressional Republican budget hawks in an awkward position. Wednesday\u2019s flashy rebound in the stock market also masks underlying weakness because the rally was tainted by narrow participation. Incredibly, there were only 310 net advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange. That\u2019s down nearly 30 percent from Tuesday\u2019s modest rise on Wall Street. And it\u2019s well below the nearly 2,000 net advancing issues seen on Monday as markets surged in response to news the FBI had wrapped up its investigation into possible new emails related to Clinton\u2019s private server. Complicating matters for investors amid all the uncertainty about Trump\u2019s policies is the fact that stocks are entering a time of seasonal strength (\u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d and all that).\u00a0 So until clarity on Trump\u2019s policy priorities emerges, the sell-off in T-bonds stabilizes, and the market fully digests the Fed\u2019s next rate hike, investors would do well to remain cautious. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..
