Clary/AFP/Getty Images Donald Trump leaves after a meeting at the New York Times, Nov. 22, 2016, in New York. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump said today that he condemned the alt-right group who was seen yelling \u201cHail Trump\u201d and engaging in anti-Semitic behavior during a conference over the weekend \u2013 saying the movement is not something he wants to \u201cenergize.\u201d In a video taken by The Atlantic, attendees of the white nationalist National Policy Institute (NPI) conference this weekend were seen yelling \u201cHail Trump\u201d and giving Nazi salutes. Trump denounced the group in an hour-long sit-down interview with The New York Times at the newspaper\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. He also told The Times that the alt-right movement is \u201cnot a group I want to energize. And if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.\u201d \u201cI condemn them. I disavow, and I condemn,\u201d he told The Times. The alt right, or alternative right, is made up of a number of groups with far-right ideologies \u2013 but is united in their beliefs that \"\u2019white identity\u2019 is under attack by multicultural forces,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC describes NPI as a white nationalist hate group. The Anti-Defamation League has denounced its members as white supremacists. During the conference, NPI president Richard Spencer had spoken positively about the president-elect and credited his campaign as \u201cthe first step toward identity politics in the United States.\u201d The conference was attended by several hundred people and was met by a large contingent of protesters. Trump has repeatedly denied courting the support of white supremacists during the campaign. His campaign released a statement yesterday saying that Trump \u201ccontinued to denounce racism of any kind and he was elected because he will be a leader for every American. To think otherwise is a complete misrepresentation of the movement that united Americans from all backgrounds.\u201d 0 Shares ",

(Nov. 22) AP Chattanooga Fire Department personnel work the scene of a fatal elementary school bus crash on Monday, Nov. 21, 2016. (Photo: Bruce Garner / Chattanooga Fire Department via Chattanooga Times Free Press via AP) The private company \u00a0that owned the bus involved in Monday's fatal wreck in Chattanooga that killed five elementary school students has had 142 crashes with injuries and three fatalities in the last 24 months, according to federal records. Durham School Services , based in Warrenville, Ill., has more than 13,000 vehicles and 13,000 drivers,\u00a0 according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration . They're a large company, and they have an overall satisfactory safety rating from the administration, but they still have more problems when it comes to driver fitness than their peers, the records show. The administration's records on Durham state \"93%\u00a0of motor carriers in the same safety event group have better on-road performance than this motor carrier.\" Tears turn to anger in Chattanooga as school bus crash probe continues A safety event group includes other similar bus and truck companies.\u00a0In the last 24 months, Durham has been involved in 346 crashes, 201 of which were\u00a0towaway wrecks. That data was last updated in late October. The driver in the Chattanooga case, 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide. In 2014, he had his license suspended following a crash, according to the Tennessee Department of Safety. There have been eight driver violations against Durham since December 2014, according to the administration. Although none of those drivers were in Tennessee, seven of the incidents involved drivers who didn't have the appropriate license needed to operate the vehicles they were driving. In Hamilton County, there were no bus crash\u00a0fatalities\u00a0from the 2011-2012 school year through the 2014-2015 school year, according to state records. Statewide, there were between zero and two fatalities each year. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Trump says president 'can't have a conflict of interest,' suggests he could continue to run company Donald Trump Donald Trump speaks in Hershey, Pa. Donald Trump speaks in Hershey, Pa. (Evan Vucci / AP) Elise ViebeckThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump shrugged off rising concerns Tuesday about the potential conflicts-of-interest between his ongoing participation in the Trump Organization and his future as president, saying the president \"can't have a conflict of interest\" and that the law is \"totally\" on his side. Trump, in an interview with the New York Times, suggested he could continue to run his company from the White House \"in theory\" because \"there's never been a case like this\" - though he added he would like to \"do something\" to address the ethical questions involved. At the same time, he said that while he could continue to sign checks at the company, he is \"phasing that out now,\" and handing those responsibilities over to his children. While Trump has said he would turn over the operations of his company to his children as he took on the presidency, experts have said that was not enough separation between him and the company and that at least a blind trust, in which neither he nor his children would have direct control, would have to be set up. Trump, in the interview, said he had not realized there was no legal requirement for such a trust. \"I'd assumed that you'd have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you don't,\" Trump said, according to a tweet from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who shared details of the interview as it happened. Trump downplayed several other concerns about the entanglements between his transition work and his business, acknowledging that his hotel in downtown Washington, has likely gone up in value since his election and saying he \"might have\" brought up the issue of offshore wind farms he believes will spoil the view from one of his Scottish golf courses during a meeting with British politician Nigel Farage. The wide-ranging interview, Trump's first on-the-record sit down with a print media publication since the election, saw him affirm the idea he will not seek criminal investigations into Hillary Clinton 's private email server or the Clinton Foundation.

Donald Trump 's company has partnered with Indian developers to create more business ventures than in any other foreign nation or territory, a Washington Post analysis of financial filings shows. In doing so, the Trump Organization has forged deals with leading moguls here, and with a billionaire... (Annie Gowen) Trump also seemed to reverse himself on the issue of climate change, saying he believes there is \"some connectivity\" between human activity and rising global temperatures. Asked if he plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords, he said he is keeping \"an open mind to it.\" Trump's answers were posted on Twitter by Haberman and another New York Times reporter, Mike Grynbaum. On the policy front, Trump released a video late Monday in which he said his transition to power, which has at times been chaotic, \"is working very smoothly, efficiently and effectively.'' He outlined a series of executive actions in the video that he said he intends to take on his first day in office: issuing notification of intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement; canceling restrictions on energy production; putting in place a rule that two regulations must be eliminated for every new one enacted; ordering a plan to protect U.S. infrastructure from cyberattacks and other forms of attack; directing the Labor Department to investigate \"abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker\"; and imposing a five-year ban on executive officials becoming lobbyists.

    "text": "9 things you need to know about the alt-right movement Eliza Collins , USA TODAY 5:38 p.m. EST November 22, 2016 896 Shares x Share Alt-right and white nationalist sympathizers seem to have found a home under Donald Trump. Video provided by Newsy Newslook The \"alt-right\" movement has been around for years but has never been more noticed \u2014 or criticized \u2014 than it is now. Particularly after last weekend, when Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist within the movement, addressed a conference in Washington, D.C., and video showed some in the crowd raising their hands in Nazi salute after he hailed President-elect Donald Trump. So what exactly is the alt-right, and what's it's relationship to Trump? Here we breakdown all the questions you've been dying to ask: What is the alt-right? The alt-right \u2014 short for \u201calternative right\u201d \u2014 is a movement that bucks mainstream conservatism. It is a loose movement, mostly online, that includes\u00a0people who are dedicated to \"white identity,\" but because there is no formal structure, there are a lot of different types of people and ideas within the group. The Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-hate organization, says the\u00a0group\u2019s main focus is \u201cwhite identity\u201d and to preserve \u201cwestern civilization,\u201d but how they go about calling for that is broad. Who is it made up of? The alt-right has only a few publicly named and identifiable leaders \u2014 Spencer\u00a0being one of them \u2014 but the majority of\u00a0supporters are people who act online via social media. George Hawley, a University of Alabama professor who has studied the movement, told the Washington Post that typical\u00a0followers are white millennial men, either in college or with a college degree who are secular, perhaps atheist, and are \"not interested in the conservative movement at all.\" Is the alt-right different from white-nationalist movements? The two groups have similar focuses and goals and white-nationalists can be part of the alt-right movement. But Hawley said the difference is\u00a0the alt-right movement has no real formal organization and mostly exists online. \u201cI think part of it is more a difference of style and marketing than a difference in substance,\u00a0though I would note that it seems like most of the leading figures of the alt-right do disavow things like genocide, which some of the more outrageous earlier white nationalists didn\u2019t necessarily do,\"\u00a0Hawley told the Post. When did it start? Spencer came up with the term in 2008, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. A few years later, he co-founded the Alternative Right blog, which bills itself as the founding site of the alt right. Per the SPLC: Spencer describes Alt-Right adherents as younger people, often recent college graduates, who recognize the \u201cuselessness of mainstream conservatism\u201d in what he describes as a \u201chyper-racialized\u201d world. So it\u2019s no surprise that the movement in 2015 and 2016 concentrated on opposing immigration and the resettlement of Syrian refugees in America. Although such stances align with older forms of white racism, Spencer insists that the Alt-Right is \u201ca liberation from a left-right dialectic.\u201d Is the alt-right represented in the White House? Last week, Trump announced that Stephen\u00a0Bannon would be his chief strategist in the White House. Bannon was previously the head of Breitbart News, which he had dubbed \u00a0\u201cthe platform for the alt-right.\u201d Critics immediately railed on Trump' s choice, accusing Bannon of being complicit in the spread of sexist and racist views on the site. Members of Trump\u2019s team said the criticism of Bannon was misguided. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who is Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, said , \"That's not the Steve Bannon that I know and I've spent a lot of time with him.\u201d Bannon himself, told the Wall Street Journal that he is a nationalist, but not a white nationalist. \"I'm an economic nationalist. I am an America first guy,\" Bannon said.\"And I have admired nationalist movements throughout the world, have said repeatedly strong nations make great neighbors. I've also said repeatedly that the ethno-nationalist movement, prominent in Europe, will change over time. I've never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.\" Did the alt-right come up during the campaign? Yes, it did. In August Clinton gave a speech \u00a0in which she tried\u00a0to tie Trump to the movement and accused him of basing his campaign on racism and paranoia. \u201cHe\u2019s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.\u00a0His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous,\" Clinton said at the time. In early September, Clinton told supporters at a fundraiser that \"half\" of Trump's supporters were \"deplorable.\" She walked back the number\u00a0but said that she stood by the characterization. After Clinton\u2019s speech, Trump was asked if he was embracing the alt-right movement in a CNN interview.\u00a0\u201cI don't even know \u2014 nobody even knows what it is. And she didn't know what it was. This is a term that was just given that \u2014 frankly, there's no alt-right or alt-left. All I'm embracing is common sense,\u201d Trump said. After Anderson Cooper pointed out that Bannon said Breitbart was the voice for the alt-right, Trump responded:\u00a0\u201cI can only speak for myself.\u201d What exactly happened at that Washington conference? The gathering was put on by the National Policy Institute, which Spencer leads.\u00a0The group's web site says it is an \"independent\u00a0organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.\" Spencer\u00a0said in a speech at the conference,\u00a0\"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\" and the room broke out in applause.\u00a0Video published by The Atlantic showed some in the audience raising\u00a0their\u00a0hands in a Nazi salute. Spencer proffered a\u00a0philosophy of \"conquer or die\" among attendees, and said\u00a0\"to be white is to be a striver, a crusader, an explorer and a conqueror.\"\u00a0Needless\u00a0to say, criticism has been widespread and loud. What does Trump have to say about the conference? The president-elect condemned the conference on Tuesday during a meeting with The New York Times. Trump on alt-right supporters: \"It's not a group I want to energize. And if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why.\" \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) November 22, 2016 Asked point-blank about Nazi conference in DC over wknd: @realDonaldTrump tells @nytimes \"of course\" \"I disavow and condemn them\" \u2014 Julie Davis (@juliehdavis) November 22, 2016 Will\u00a0Breitbart (and the alt-right) turn on Trump? On Tuesday, the Breitbart News website \u2014 which normally unbashedly praises Trump \u2014 had an unusually negative article about Trump: \"Broken Promise: Trump \u2018Doesn\u2019t Wish to Pursue\u2019 Clinton Email Charges.\" The article came after Trump's adviser and former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump would not prosecute Clinton over her email server.

Looking for a risk-free way to boost your investment returns? The Dow has set records since Donald Trump won the presidency two weeks ago, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes\u00a0 also reaching\u00a0highs . In addition, small-company stocks, tracked by the Russell 2000 index, have hit record levels, as traders bet that Presdident-elect Trump\u2019s U.S.-centric approach would benefit smaller companies more than large U.S. multinationals.\u00a0 The Dow gained 67 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 19,024. The S&P 500 rose 5 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,203, while the Nasdaq composite index added 17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,387. Food producers Campbell Soup and Hormel Foods were trading higher after each reported strong quarterly results, and discount store chains Dollar Tree and Burlington Stores were climbing after raising their forecasts. Campbell\u2019s profit in its fiscal first quarter was better than expected thanks to lower expenses and improved sales for food brands like Pepperidge Farm. Hormel, the maker of Spam, reported better results from its refrigerated foods business and its Jennie-O turkey unit. Hormel also gave solid guidance for the current fiscal year.\u00a0 While the S&P 500 is at record highs, only one of its 11 industry sectors is doing the same. That\u2019s the industrial sector, which includes companies that make aircraft and engines, run railroads, and make other equipment. That index is up 5.6 percent since the election, about twice as much as the broader market, and has risen 15 percent this year. Aerospace and defense companies including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman(NOC)  were trading around record highs before the election and have continued to rise since then. Oil\u2019s price recovery is a big help for the market. Investors are wagering that OPEC members will soon cut a deal that would reduce oil production, a boon to prices.

(Paul Skrbina/Chicago Tribune) Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly on appealing the NCAA's penalty for academic misconduct. (Paul Skrbina/Chicago Tribune) Paul Skrbina Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2014 In the midst of Brian Kelly 's worst season as head coach at Notre Dame , the school learned Tuesday that his best season could be erased from the record books because of academic misconduct. The NCAA announced Tuesday its recommendation from the Division I Committee on Infractions that the Irish vacate all 21 of their victories from 2012 \u2014 when they went 12-1 and reached the BCS national championship game \u2014 and 2013 because an unnamed former student athletic trainer completed substantial academic work for two players and helped six others impermissibly. The school also was placed on probation for a year and fined $5,000. The school said it will appeal the decision. Kelly blasted the ruling and said he is confident he will return next season as head coach of the Irish, even though his team is 4-7 heading into its final game Saturday at USC. He noted a bowl ban and reduction in scholarships weren't part of the proposed punishment. \"It's never happened before in the history of the NCAA; a penalty has never been issued in this fashion before,\" Kelly said. \"This was a discretionary action by the committee. That's No. 1. \"No. 2, it was student-on-student cheating. There was nobody implicated. The NCAA agreed across the board with that finding. (The punishment) was clearly excessive.\" Notre Dame was expected to contend for a playoff spot. Instead the Irish are 4-7, coach Brian Kelly had his ethics questioned after declining to suspend four of five players involved in a preseason marijuana-and-handgun... Is it possible to have a worse football season than the Bears? The answer: Yes. Notre Dame was expected to contend for a playoff spot. Instead the Irish are 4-7, coach Brian Kelly had his ethics questioned after declining to suspend four of five players involved in a preseason marijuana-and-handgun... (Teddy Greenstein) Neither the NCAA nor Notre Dame named the players involved in the school's investigation that began in 2014. Receiver DaVaris Daniels, linebacker Kendall Moore, cornerback KeiVarae Russell and defensive lineman Ishaq Williams were suspended for that season. Safety Eilar Hardy also was suspended but returned midseason. Only Russell returned to play for the Irish the following year. Quarterback Everett Golson, who led the Irish to the title game in 2012, said he was expelled in 2013 for cheating on a test but later returned to the school before transferring to Florida State upon graduating in 2015. The NCAA said in a statement that the former student trainer \"partially or wholly completed numerous academic assignments for football student-athletes in numerous courses.\" Grades for players involved were lowered retroactively. Kelly, who before the Fiesta Bowl in January called himself the \"CEO\" of the program, said he feels no culpability for the indiscretions. \"Zero. None,\" he said. \"Absolutely none. \"When you hear about vacating wins, you think of lack of institutional control. You hear of clearly the abuse within the university relative to extra benefits, things of that nature. These don't even come close to that.\" Kelly said the school goes to extreme measures to ensure its student-athletes receive proper guidance and \"resources necessary to succeed.\" \"But let's not kid ourselves,\" he said. \"Eighty percent of colleges go through cheating. That doesn't condone it, but we know what the culture is.\" Notre Dame's president, Rev. John I. Jenkins, said the school acted \"honorably\" throughout its own investigation and added that the NCAA agreed on the violations. \"We believe the penalty they have imposed is not justified,\" Jenkins said in a statement. \"Should this precedent stand, it could create a perverse incentive that will discourage institutions from investigating so aggressively and imposing the penalties for academic dishonesty that their honesty committees might judge appropriate.\" This year has been trying for Kelly and the Irish. Six players were arrested in separate incidents before the season. One was kicked off the team and another has been suspended since. On Sept. 25, a day after the Irish's upset loss to Duke, defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder was fired. On the field, all seven of the Irish's losses have been by eight points or fewer. Kelly called the season a \"nightmare\" after Saturday's loss to Virginia Tech . But he was steadfast Tuesday that Notre Dame acted appropriately, no matter what the NCAA decides. \"If doing the right thing means you have to put an asterisk next to these games, that's fine with me,\" Kelly said. \"We still beat Oklahoma. We still beat Wake Forest. We still beat all those teams. So you can put an asterisk next to it. If that makes you feel better, that's fine with me.\" ",

Perez . (Andrew Harnik / Associated Press) A Texas judge blocked President Obama's bid to expand overtime pay protections to millions of Americans on Tuesday, thwarting a key presidential priority just days before it was set to take effect. The Labor Department rule would have doubled the\u00a0salary level at which hourly workers must be paid extra for overtime pay, from\u00a0$23,660 to\u00a0$47,476.\u00a0Siding with business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Texas District\u00a0Judge Amos L. Mazzant III halted it. The rule, finalized in May, represented the first such change in more than a decade\u00a0and was hailed at the time as the most consequential action the Obama administration could take for middle-class workers without congressional involvement. Plaintiffs had argued the Labor Department acted beyond its authority under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\u00a0 The administration said more than 4 million salaried workers stood to benefit from the change when it took effect Dec. 1. The rule was already in jeopardy after the election of Donald Trump. Just as the Obama administration made the change through its rule-making prerogatives, a Republican administration could undo it. Neither the White House nor the Labor Department had an immediate comment. Republican lawmakers and their allies in the business community, which were behind the legal challenge, celebrated the decision. \"The decision brings us a step closer to curbing regulations that have resulted in $80 billion in compliance costs and more than 25 million hours of paperwork,\" said Linda Kelly, senior vice president for the National Assn. of Manufacturers. \"The fights are not yet over \u2014 and our work is just beginning.\" Latest updates ",

    "text": "Iraqi Forces Move to Retake Another Mosul Neighborhood By qassim abdul-zahra, associated press IRBIL, Iraq \u0097 Nov 22, 2016, 11:28 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Iraqi Forces Assault Mosul District 0 Shares Email Iraqi troops gained a foothold Tuesday in another neighborhood in the northern city of Mosul after fierce battles against Islamic State militants dug in behind heavy fortifications, according to a top Iraqi commander. A new analysis, meanwhile, has found that there is a high risk that IS will deploy chemical weapons against Mosul civilians or Iraqi troops fighting to retake the city. According to IHS Markit, the extremist group has used chemical weapons at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014, including 19 times in the Mosul area alone. Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil, of the Iraqi special forces, told The Associated Press that IS fighters were firing rockets and mortars as his forces \"cautiously\" advanced in the densely populated Zohour neighborhood. \"There are too many civilians still living there,\" he said. Iraqi troops began their siege of Zohour on Sunday as they fortified their positions in neighborhoods already retaken in eastern Mosul. Suicide bombings, sniper fire and concerns over the safety of civilians \u2014 there are 1 million still in Mosul \u2014 have combined to slow down progress in the campaign to liberate the city, which began Oct. 17. Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city and the largest to have fallen to the militants. Most gains in the campaign so far have been made by the special forces operating east of the Tigris River. Other forces, including the Kurdish peshmerga and volunteer Sunni militiamen, are advancing on the city from different directions, and the U.S.-led coalition is providing airstrikes and other support. A coalition airstrike on Monday destroyed a major bridge over the Tigris in the southern part of Mosul, cutting IS supply lines to the east bank , where most of the fighting is taking place. The coalition has destroyed three bridges in Mosul, and Iraqi officers said the two remaining bridges in the city are also likely to be hit. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. The Iraqi troops are expected to use U.S.-made pontoon bridges when they need to cross the Tigris later in the campaign. IS captured Mosul in a matter of days in the summer of 2014, when it swept across northern and central Iraq. IHS Markit, a London-based intelligence analysis firm, says the extremists later used the city as a center for the production of chemical weapons. The experts believe IS moved the materials and its chemical weapons specialists out of Mosul ahead of the Iraqi offensive, but may still use crude chemical weapons like chlorine and mustard agents as the troops press deeper into the city. Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari meanwhile told reporters during a visit to Budapest that 1,700 militants have been killed and 120 captured since the battle for Mosul began. A third of Ninevah province, where Mosul is the capital, has been liberated so far, he said, adding that progress in the city has been slowed by the militants' use of human shields. He said that because of Iraq's \"extraordinary situation,\" it would need to increase its crude oil output, which provides 90 percent of state revenues, and be exempt from OPEC quotas. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Lori Hinnant in Paris and Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary, contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show that the Islamic State group is believed to have used chemical weapons 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014, not 71 times. 0 Shares ",

Donald Trump \u2019s Twitter wars with media sites and cultural institutions have been panned by opponents\u00a0as overreactions by a thin-skinned president-elect who prefers rhetorical skirmishing to soberly building his administration. But Trump is extending what helped him win the presidency \u2014 a battle... (Cathleen Decker) As the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer, Sessions could implement those policies. He would oversee the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which reimburses local jails for holding federal prisoners under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. In Senate speeches, Sessions has repeatedly called for cutting those funds to push local authorities to identify migrants in the country illegally and hand them over to federal agents. Trump\u2019s transition policy team has drawn up plans to pressure so-called sanctuary cities \u2014 including Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 to help immigration agents identify those here illegally. \u201cThe issue of sanctuary cities is substantially in the hands of the attorney general,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington that advocates for lower immigration levels. Under Sessions, Justice Department lawyers could try to get federal court orders for local officials to cooperate with federal immigration agents. \u201cFirst thing you do is you file suit, then you get a judge to issue an injunction\u201d to force cities to stop their policies, said Krikorian, who has submitted policy proposals to Trump\u2019s advisors. \u201cThe nuclear option is you criminally prosecute city council members and supervisors for illegally harboring illegal aliens, which they are,\u201d Krikorian said. Under Sessions, the Justice Department is likely to support states that give local police authority to enforce immigration laws. In 2012, after the Obama administration objected, the Supreme Court struck down Arizona\u2019s so-called \u201cpapers, please\u201d law on the grounds that the state was trying to enforce federal immigration laws. Sessions also can instruct federal prosecutors to be more aggressive in filing criminal charges against migrants for illegal entry and reentry after deportation, convictions that can speed up deportation orders. In recent years, the Obama administration eased such prosecutions and focused instead chiefly on deporting individuals believed to be involved in human smuggling, gang activities and other crimes. Prosecutions of immigration violations dropped by 6% this year, according to an analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP November 22, 2016, 4:37 PM Most expensive destroyer in Navy history breaks down The guided-missile destroyer USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) transits Naval Station Mayport Harbor on its way into port in Jacksonville, Florida on October 25, 2016. PO2 TIMOTHY SCHUMAKER/AFP/Getty Images Email PORTLAND, Maine -- The most expensive destroyer ever built for the Navy suffered an engineering problem in the Panama Canal and had to be towed to port. U.S. Third Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Ryan Perry said a vice admiral directed the USS Zumwalt to remain at ex-Naval Station Rodman in Panama to address the issues, which arose on Monday. The ship was built at Bath Iron Works in Maine and is on its way to San Diego. \u201cThe schedule for the ship will remain flexible to enable testing and evaluation in order to ensure the ship\u2019s safe transit to her new home port in San Diego,\u201d Perry said in a statement. USNI News , a publication of the U.S. Naval Institute, reported on its website that the ship was in the canal when it lost propulsion. Crew also saw water intrusion in bearings that connect electrical motors to drive shafts, the website reported. USNI News also reported that the Zumwalt suffered minor cosmetic damage. The ship had been scheduled to arrive in San Diego by the end of the year to start the activation of its weapon system, the website reported. CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin rode the 610-foot-long USS Zumwalt from Norfolk, Virginia to Baltimore in October.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s never been a Navy destroyer like this -- never one that looked like this, and never one that cost so much,\u201d Martin said of the ship, which is the most technologically sophisticated destroyer ever built for the Navy. He said it was designed to be stealthy, and that its sharp angle are meant to deflect radar beams sent out by anyone trying to find it. One of the destroyer\u2019s signature features is a new gun system that fires rocket-powered shells more than 60 nautical miles. Ron O\u2019Rourke of the Congressional Research Service told CBS News the ship was designed to strike targets in a country like North Korea. \u201cWith their guns they could reach in from either side of the peninsula, pretty far in, to cover a large portion of the territory of the peninsula,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.

Democracy depends on it. Alia E. Dastagir , USA TODAY 8:05 p.m. EST November 22, 2016 x Share Trump and Clinton supporters are getting uninvited from Thanksgiving dinners because of their political views. USA TODAY The artwork titled \"Make America Stronger Together\" by artist David Datuna circles around Trump Tower on Oct. 31, 2016, in New York. Datuna says the work combines the themes Make America (Trump) with Stronger Together (Clinton) representing a divided nation. Datuna said he hoped to bring the divided nation closer. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Americans don't have the luxury of avoiding politics this Thanksgiving. Our country has cleaved into two Americas that are\u00a0bitterly divided by visions of the future. The brutal severing has left us glaring at one another across a cultural divide that threatens\u00a0to swallow the democracy whole. There are swastikas on the playground. Racial slurs on school walls. Emboldened white supremacists, once relegated to\u00a0dark\u00a0corners of the Internet, are now on video chanting \"Hail Trump.\" \"I don't think we've had a challenge as great as we have now since the Civil War,\" said Robert Sternberg, a professor of human development at Cornell University and an expert on the psychology of hate. America has healed before \u2014 or have we? This year\u2019s presidential election perverted our national identity in ways that are still coming into focus, and it has forced the country to reckon with a future that feels perilous for many Americans. With Thanksgiving just 16 days after an election defined by incivility, many people aren't thinking about the bread they will break, but about the salt that will pour into raw wounds. We can look at it as a punishment, or as a chance for redemption. Hey. You. And you. ALL OF YOU. Maybe you should talk politics with the relatives you disagree with even MORE this Thanksgiving. \u2014 Sam Sanders (@samsanders) November 16, 2016 A new Gallup poll finds that 77% of Americans, a new high, believe the nation is divided on important values. Experts on American political behavior say now more than ever, it\u2019s imperative to have conversations with people who voted differently from you. Americans can\u2019t work for a common good if they are resigned to the fact that they don't, and never will again, have anything in common. This attitude doesn\u2019t suggest naive optimism. It isn\u2019t a dismissal of the devastating ways in which racism and sexism elevated Donald Trump to victory. It doesn\u2019t disregard how difficult it is to combat the fake news that poisoned the campaign and is still drowning out responsible journalism. Rather, it is a sober recognition that the contempt many Americans feel for one another may be more dangerous than any political decision\u00a0Trump might make. The election is getting people uninvited to Thanksgiving \"People have been consuming information that has not captured the nuances of human behavior and human thinking, and that is desperately what is needed right now,\" said D. Sunshine Hillygus, a professor of political science at Duke University who studies voter behavior. Had my first of three thanksgiving meals tonight. And yes, we talked about politics \uf601\uf62b\uf631\uf635 https://t.co/VNUAJavzJ2 \u2014 D.L. Mayfield (@d_l_mayfield) November 13, 2016 Since the election, there has been a fragmented postmortem on Trump supporters:\u00a0They rode a wave of populist anger. They rejected the political elite. They harbor a deep mistrust of major political parties. They subscribe to hardened gender roles. They reflect the growing rural-urban divide. They are a fierce repudiation of our first black president. They represent the last gasp of White America. 9 things you need to know about the alt-right movement These pronouncements are true, but they are also somewhat deficient. This, Hillygus said, is in large part because the media spent so much of the campaign focused on the horse race \u2014\u00a0on trying to figure out who was ahead and who was behind, on polling to try and predict the outcome \u2014\u00a0that it failed to capture the nuances of public opinion. \"Now we're trying to construct a narrative of why Trump won, and it's really not with the right data,\" Hillygus said.\u00a0Exit polls will never tell the whole story. As we sit down with friends and family this holiday, we do so with wearying suspicion. Rather than suffering silently or shrewdly deflecting, perhaps we can use the opportunity to make better sense of the narrative. How did we get here? A child holds a sign during an anti-hate rally at a Brooklyn park named in memory of Beastie Boys band member Adam Yauch. It was defaced with swastikas on Nov. 20, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) It's comfortable to talk to people we agree with, but it's not very democratic.\u00a0Clarissa Hayward, a contemporary political theorist at Washington University in St. Louis who has written extensively on race, said that political polarization isn't just at the level of legislators. It's at the level of citizens. If we want to survive the next four years, we need dialogue. \"In political theory, when people talk about democracy, one of the big ideas is \u2018deliberative democracy,\u2019 which doesn't just involve voting, it's talking to people and listening to people about political ideas,\" she said. \"Your duty isn't just to show up and cast a ballot, it's to engage in conversation.\" The problem for many Americans is they can no longer agree on basic facts. The proliferation of fake news is a terrifying reality that news organizations and Facebook in particular are grappling with. It means, absurdly, that facts are no longer the starting point for a conversation about politics. \"What this election has brought out is how absolutely pernicious the Internet can be,\" Sternberg said. \"We used to listen to\u00a0Walter Cronkite and you knew what he was saying was to the best of his knowledge. Now people are reading fake news, or they are only looking at news that is slanted to what they believe. We have separated into two worlds that don't really have much in common, and neither understands the other.\" This feels demoralizing \u2014 and it is.\u00a0It suggests that for a Hillary Clinton supporter and a Trump supporter to have a shot at a civil conversation, they have to accept that they don't agree on things that have been proved true or exposed as false. \"It's not useful for people to debate the facts, because they will disagree,\"\u00a0Hillygus\u00a0said. \"It's about trying to understand how people make up their minds, on what basis, and what their hopes are moving forward. This is where people may find some reassurance, because the caricatures about liberals and conservatives are really just that.\" Me: don't bring up politics on Thanksgiving Inner me: ask Aunt Carol who she voted for Me: but- \u2014 FutureFemaleLeaders (@FFL_of_America) November 21, 2016 The Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-hate group, has documented more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment in the week following Trump's election. Pairing politics with turkey will not shift the extreme views informed by racial hatred.\u00a0But it is not the case that every person at your table who voted for Trump falls into that category. \"The people who voted for Trump did so for a wide variety of reasons. Just because these incidents are happening doesn't mean the person sitting across from you endorses that behavior, it doesn't necessarily reflect their values or hopes for the country,\"\u00a0Hillygus\u00a0said. Trump supporters owe it to Clinton supporters to try and understand why this election feels apocalyptic. Why it signals a step backward for civil rights, for women's rights, for progress. And liberals owe it to Trump supporters to understand why their discontent was so great that they viewed Trump as a savior. Why in standing up for themselves, they were willing to stand against African-Americans, Muslims, immigrants and women. There are people who will never budge. There are walls that will not break, and sometimes we won't know it until we bruise pushing against them. It would be easy to throw our hands up and despair. But democracy is messy, and if we don't talk to one another, see one another, hear one another, what hope does the nation have? Hate is part of our history, a cancer we will likely never cure. But we can put it in remission. And that means difficult conversations, sometimes over pie. It doesn't matter if the children are listening. In fact, if we do it right, we should hope they are. \"We're in a situation that is so dangerous in this country and everyone knows it,\" Sternberg says. \"As bad as things are we have to find common ground\u00a0because the country is falling apart. It really is. This is not who we want to be.\" Alia Dastagir writes about media and culture for USA TODAY.

    "text": "By David A. Fahrenthold November 22 at 8:57 PM Follow @Fahrenthold President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation has admitted to the Internal Revenue Service that it violated a legal prohibition against \u201cself-dealing,\u201d which bars nonprofit leaders from using their charity\u2019s money to help themselves, their businesses or their families. The admission was contained in the Donald J. Trump Foundation\u2019s IRS tax filings for 2015, which were recently posted online at the nonprofit-tracking site GuideStar. A GuideStar spokesman said the forms were uploaded by the Trump Foundation\u2019s law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. The Washington Post could not immediately confirm if the same forms had actually been sent to the IRS. In one section of the form , the IRS asked whether the Trump Foundation had transferred \u201cincome or assets to a disqualified person.\u201d A disqualified person , in this context, might be Trump \u2014 the foundation\u2019s president \u2014 or a member of his family or a Trump-owned business. The foundation checked yes. For 2015, the Trump Foundation checked \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether it had transferred \u201cincome or assets to a disqualified person\u201d \u2014 which in this context might be Trump, a member of his family or a Trump-owned business \u2014 and checked \u201cyes\u201d again when asked if it had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. For 2014, The foundation answered \u201cno\u201d to these questions. Another line on the form asked whether the Trump Foundation had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. The Trump Foundation checked yes again. Such violations can carry penalties including excise taxes, and the charity leaders can be required to repay money that the charity spent on their behalf. During the presidential campaign, The Post reported on several instances in which Trump appeared to use the Trump Foundation\u2019s money to buy items for himself or to help one of his for-profit businesses. But the new Trump Foundation tax filings provided little detail, so it was unclear if these admissions were connected to the instances reported in The Post. [ Trump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words. ] The Trump Foundation tax forms did not, for instance, describe any specific acts of self-dealing. They also did not say whether Trump had paid any penalties already. That kind of detail would be submitted on a separate IRS form, which was not included in the information posted online by GuideStar. Trump\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Washington Post reporter David A. Fahrenthold has been searching for evidence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s charitable giving for months. (Peter Stevenson,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) The New York attorney general\u2019s office is investigating Trump\u2019s charity, following up on reports in The Post that described apparent instances of self-dealing going back to 2007. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment, other than to say \u201cour investigation is ongoing.\u201d The IRS also did not immediately respond. That agency has not said if it is investigating the president-elect\u2019s charity. The Trump Foundation has existed since 1987. This appeared to be the first time that it had admitted committing such a violation. Philip Hackney, who formerly worked in the IRS chief counsel\u2019s office and now teaches at Louisiana State University, said he wanted to know why the Trump Foundation was now admitting to self-dealing in prior years \u2014 when, in all prior years, it had told the IRS it had done nothing of the kind. \u201cWhat transactions led to the self-dealing that they\u2019re admitting to? Why weren\u2019t they able to recognize them in prior years,\u201d Hackney said. He said that, since the prior years\u2019 returns were signed by Trump, that opened the president-elect to questions about what he had missed and how. Trump Foundation 2015 tax filing During the presidential campaign, The Post revealed several instances \u2014 worth about $300,000 \u2014 where Trump seemed to have used the Trump Foundation to help himself. From 2009 until this year, the charity was funded exclusively with other people\u2019s money , an arrangement that experts say is almost unheard of for a family foundation. In two cases, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation appeared to pay legal settlements to end lawsuits that involved his for-profit businesses. In one case , Trump settled a dispute with the town of Palm Beach, Fla., over a large flagpole he erected at his Mar-a-Lago Club. The town agreed to waive $120,000 in unpaid fines if Trump\u2019s club donated $100,000 to Fisher House, a charity helping wounded veterans and military personnel. The Trump Foundation paid that donation instead \u2014 effectively saving his business $100,000. In another , Trump\u2019s golf course in New York\u2019s Westchester County was sued by a man who had won a $1\u00a0million hole-in-one prize during a tournament at the course. The man was later denied the money because Trump\u2019s course had allegedly made the hole too short for the prize to be valid. The lawsuit was settled, and details on that final settlement have not been made public. But on the day that the parties told the court that their lawsuit had been settled, the Trump Foundation donated $158,000 to the unhappy golfer\u2019s charity. Trump\u2019s golf course donated nothing. In three other cases, Trump\u2019s foundation paid for items that Trump or his wife purchased at charity auctions. In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 for a football helmet signed by then-Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. In another case from 2007, Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, bid $20,000 on a six-foot-tall portrait of Trump painted by \u201cspeed painter\u201d Michael Israel during a gala at Mar-a-Lago. And in 2014, Trump bid $10,000 to buy a four-foot painting of himself by artist Havi Schanz at another charity gala. [ How a Univision anchor found the missing $10,000 portrait that Trump bought with his charity\u2019s money ] In all three cases, the Trump Foundation paid the bill. Tax experts said that, by law, the items had to be put to charitable use. Trump\u2019s representatives have not said what became of the helmet or the $20,000 portrait. The $10,000 portrait was, however, located by Post readers , following coverage of the Trump Foundation. It was hanging on the wall of the sports bar at Trump\u2019s Doral golf resort, outside Miami. In September, a Trump campaign spokesman rejected the idea that Trump had done anything wrong, by using his charity\u2019s money to buy art for his bar. Instead, spokesman Boris Epshteyn said, the sports bar was doing the charity a favor by \u201cstoring\u201d its art free of charge. Tax experts said that this argument was unlikely to hold water. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,\u201d Brett Kappel, a lawyer who advises nonprofit groups at the Akerman firm, told The Post then. \u201cBut this would do it.\u201d In the new 2015 tax filing, the Trump Foundation acknowledged for the first time that it owned these items. But it listed market values far below what the foundation had paid: The helmet was valued at $475, the portrait purchased for $20,000 was valued at $700, and the portrait purchased for $10,000 was valued at $500. The tax filing did not give any details about where these items are or what charitable use Trump has in mind for them. The Trump Foundation\u2019s tax filing also shows that \u2014 for the first time in six years \u2014 the foundation received a donation from an entity controlled by Trump himself. It lists a donation of $566,370 from the Trump Corporation, an entity 100\u00a0percent owned by Trump himself. It also lists a $50,000 gift from Trump Productions, a Trump-owned business that produced \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Previously, the last donation to the foundation from Trump or one of his businesses had come in 2008. Trump\u2019s spokesmen did not respond to a question about the reason for these new gifts. In addition, the Trump Foundation reported a $150,000 gift from the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a powerful Ukrainian steel magnate. That was the first such gift from him. Pinchuk, who supports closer ties between Ukraine and Western nations, had also pledged large donations to the foundation of Trump\u2019s presidential opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Those donations, pledged to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state, raised questions about whether she had conflicts of interest when she met with her family foundation\u2019s donors. A spokesman for Pinchuk\u2019s foundation said that the gift was made as part of an agreement for Trump to speak \u2014 via video link \u2014 to a conference Pinchuk organized in September 2015. The conference, called the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting, was held in Kiev. At the time of his 20-minute speech , titled \u201cHow New Ukraine\u2019s Fate Affects Europe and the World,\u201d Trump was already a presidential candidate. Trump\u2019s spokesmen did not respond to a question about Pinchuk\u2019s gift. [ How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people\u2019s money ] Marc S. Owens, the former head of the IRS nonprofit division, noted that this was a rare contribution to the Trump Foundation from overseas. The only other foreign gifts were small ones from New Zealand and Canada in 2006 and 2008. And it was certainly the first from a foreigner who could seek to influence the foreign policy agenda of a President Trump. \u201cThe contribution points out a potential way for foreign donors to align themselves with [Trump],\u201d Owens said. So far, Trump has said nothing about how he will run his foundation when he takes office \u2014 or what he will do to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving Trump Foundation donors. In contrast, when she was preparing to take office as secretary of state in 2009, Clinton was closely questioned about the operations of the global charity founded by her husband. As a result, the president of the Clinton Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration that placed certain restrictions on its activities, notably limiting some donations from foreign governments. The agreement was criticized by Republicans during the campaign for loopholes, and the Clinton Foundation has also acknowledged at least one failure to fully uphold its terms. But the document showed an understanding that some additional transparency and regulations were needed while Clinton held public office. \u201cI will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised,\u201d Clinton said during her 2009 confirmation hearing. \u201cBut I think that the way that this has been hammered out is as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it, and we\u2019ve tried to do the very best we could.\u201d The Post was first alerted to the 2015 tax filing by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. In a written statement, CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz said many questions remained to be answered. \u201cWhy were the Trumps unable to provide locations of the Foundation\u2019s assets like paintings and football helmets . . . when they clearly remain in the possession of the Foundation? What assets do [they] admit to transferring to a \u2018disqualified person?\u2019 \u201d Libowitz wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear at this point that the IRS needs to investigate.\u201d In all, the 2015 tax filing shows that the Trump Foundation took in $781,000 and gave away $896,000 in grants during 2015. That left it with $1.1\u00a0million at year\u2019s end, slightly down from the year before. An early look at its outgoing grants showed a familiar pattern: Trump gave to a smattering of New York and Florida charities, plus a few connected to friends and business partners. Also, as he entered the presidential race, he gave to several nonprofit organizations connected with conservative causes. One of them was Project Veritas, the group run by conservative provocateur James O\u2019Keefe, which has used hidden-camera stings to target liberal groups. Stephen Gordon, of Project Veritas, said that its point of contact had been Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s one-time campaign manager. He said they had a brief meeting with Trump in 2015 at Trump Tower. Trump gave $10,000 from his foundation to the group, which is an IRS-certified nonprofit organization. \u201cWe showed him a couple of videos. He thought that was really cool. And we walked out with a check. It was a typical donor meeting,\u201d Gordon recalled. Rosalind S.

A federal judge Tuesday blocked implementation of the new rule set to go into effect Dec. 1 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP In March 2014, President Barack Obama directed Labor Secretary Tom Perez to modernize overtime protections. A federal judge Tuesday blocked implementation of the new rule set to go into effect Dec. 1 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP With just over a week before it was scheduled to take effect, a federal judge Tuesday blocked an Obama Administration rule that would have extended overtime eligibility to some four million Americans. The Labor Department's sweeping overhaul to the overtime rule required employers to pay time-and-a-half to their employees who worked more than 40 hours in a given week and earned less than $47,476 a year. That salary threshold is about twice what currently allows workers to be exempted from overtime. As NPR's White House Correspondent Scott Horsley told our Newscast Unit, supporters of the rule called it \"long overdue\" as inflation took its toll on overtime protection. \"The rule was one of the Administration's most far-reaching efforts to boost pay for workers at the lower end of the income ladder. It's one of many Administrative actions that was already facing the threat of reversal from the incoming Trump Administration.\" The measure, set to take effect Dec. 1, was intended to send a jolt to slow-growing U.S. incomes. U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant III sided with plaintiffs in the case who complained that the new overtime rules would have caused an uptick in government costs in their states and made it mandatory for businesses to pay millions in additional salaries. Business groups said the new rule changes would have eventually led to layoffs. Article continues after sponsorship The timing of the block brings an early answer for workers were wondering the rule's fate after the election. As NPR's Business Correspondent Yuki Noguchi reported earlier this month: \"In any presidential transition, previous policies are subject to review. Trump has pledged to undo President Obama's executive orders, dismantle the Affordable Care Act, reverse policies on clean air, immigration and on Dodd-Frank financial reform. This [month], the Congressional Budget Office said canceling the overtime rule would reduce employers' compliance costs and boost profits, a point advocates refute. This leaves businesses wondering how they should proceed on rules that might be unwound.\" With Republicans controlling both houses in Congress and the Trump Administration set to take office in less than two months, the new overtime rule's long-term future remains in limbo. The Department of Labor issued the following statement regarding federal court's preliminary injunction. \"We strongly disagree with the decision by the court, which has the effect of delaying a fair day's pay for a long day's work for millions of hardworking Americans. The department's overtime rule is the result of a comprehensive, inclusive rulemaking process, and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the rule. We are currently considering all of our legal options.\" Here is the full court document: ",

On whether recent incidents mark a turning point I hope it's not a turning point. I would probably refer to it more as a wake-up call. The Anti-Defamation League has always said we need to fight hate in a comprehensive way, and now that it's been exposed so graphically and in the public's face, I think what we need is for people to really heed that wake-up call and stand up to the hate. On what people who oppose the alt-right can do It's imperative that good people speak out. So if they do witness someone who is being harassed or bullied \u2014 because they have a hijab on, for example \u2014 they need to be an ally, they need to step forward and say this is not acceptable. For people who see incidents in their community \u2014 whether it's a swastika or other bigoted incident \u2014 come together as a community and stand up and say our neighborhood will not tolerate this. What You Need To Know About The Alt-Right Movement There are things individuals can do, communities can do, but it's essential that we not be passive about it. And I think people who are doing this have a sense of pride that they are being part of something bigger and that they're helping this country return to normalcy of civility. ",

Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence outside the clubhouse at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., last week. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times President-elect Donald J. Trump repeatedly called Hillary Clinton \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d and many of his fans chanted over and over again at his campaign rallies: \u201cLock her up!\u201d But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump essentially said never mind, signaling that he has no intention of directing investigations into his former rival\u2019s use of a private email server or the financial operations at the Clinton family\u2019s global foundation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said during a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times. \u201cShe went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious.\u201d It was the latest evidence that the president-elect is willing to retreat from strong positions expressed in the most strident tones during his campaign for the White House, and a particularly striking turnabout on an issue that dogged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, which she blames for her loss to Mr. Trump. Graphic: How Hard (or Easy) It Will Be for Trump to Fulfill His 100-Day Plan Instead, Mr. Trump said he wanted to \u201cmove forward\u201d after the divisive campaign. While he said that \u201cwe\u2019ll have people that do things,\u201d perhaps a reference to the F.B.I. or others who might call for an investigation, the president-elect made clear he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority when he assumes office. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I feel very strongly about,\u201d Mr. Trump said, unlike health care or immigration. \u201cThis has been a very painful period of time.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The decision may help Mr. Trump focus on his agenda once he moves into the Oval Office in January, without the potential distraction of an unprecedented legal inquiry by a president against his rival. But it could deeply disappoint many of the voters whose anger against Mrs. Clinton he helped stoke throughout a bitter campaign. During their second debate, Mr. Trump turned to Mrs. Clinton and vowed, \u201cIf I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception.\u201d A White House directive to close an F.B.I. criminal investigation would be highly unusual. The bureau and the Justice Department are supposed to conduct investigations free from political influence. There are instances when the White House does have a say in investigations, but they generally involve national security matters such as the arrest and capture of terrorism suspects overseas or the indictment of Chinese hackers. Those are decisions that could have global ramifications. Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

By Karen Tumulty November 22 at 7:05 PM Follow @ktumulty President-elect Donald Trump abruptly abandoned some of his most tendentious campaign promises Tuesday, saying he does not plan to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email system or the dealings of her family foundation, has an \u201copen mind\u201d about a climate-change accord from which he vowed to withdraw the United States and is no longer certain that torturing terrorism suspects is a good idea. The billionaire real estate developer also dismissed any need to disentangle himself from his financial holdings, despite rising questions about how his global business dealings might affect his decision-making as the nation\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe law\u2019s totally on my side. The president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d Trump told editors and reporters of the New York Times during an expansive, hour-long question-and-answer session. \u201cIn theory, I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There\u2019s never been a case like this.\u201d Trump further sought to distance himself from a small, far-right movement known for its embrace of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric that has celebrated Trump\u2019s election. \u201cI don\u2019t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,\u201d Trump said of the alt-right. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The president-elect has a record of making statements that are inconsistent with his previous ones, which means it is uncertain whether any of the positions he espoused on Tuesday will hold in the days going forward, much less after he is inaugurated. [ Trump Foundation admits to violating ban on \u2018self-dealing,\u2019 new filing to IRS shows ] Some of Trump\u2019s shifts also have the potential to spark a backlash from his most ardent supporters. In his meeting with the Times, Trump assumed a more cordial, magnanimous posture than he has in recent days. Over the weekend, he used his Twitter account to attack the comedy of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and the cast of the hit Broadway show \u201cHamilton.\u201d On Monday, he upbraided broadcast news executives and on-air journalists in an off-the-record session that quickly leaked to other media. His stance on Clinton, the former secretary of state, was a jarring pivot from the presidential campaign, during which he called her \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and threatened during one of their debates to put his Democratic opponent in jail. At his rallies and during the Republican convention in Cleveland, Trump\u2019s supporters would regularly chant, \u201cLock her up!\u201d But on Tuesday, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don\u2019t. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.\u201d Asked whether that meant he had ruled out appointing a special prosecutor, as he had said he would, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that I feel very strongly about.\u201d Attendees of an alt-right conference on Nov. 19 shouted \"hail Trump!\" The Washington Post's David Weigel explains the connection between the president-elect and the white nationalist group. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) [ Welcome to Washington\u2019s new normal: One Trump drama after another ] If Trump were to push or try to block a criminal investigation from the Oval Office, it would mark an extraordinary break with political and legal protocol, which holds that the attorney general and FBI make decisions on whether to conduct probes and file charges, free of pressure from the president. The president-elect\u2019s new position may also have no effect on the plans of other members of his party on Capitol Hill. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah,) who is finishing his first term leading the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has vowed to continue to investigate Clinton\u2019s email server. An attorney for Clinton, David Kendall, declined to comment. Trump also shifted position on climate change, saying he believes there is \u201csome connectivity\u201d between human activity and rising global temperatures. In 2012, he had brushed off that idea as a Chinese hoax, tweeting: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d Asked whether he plans to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord, he said he is keeping \u201can open mind to it.\u201d The deal negotiated by nearly 200 countries last year commits them to a global push to reduce greenhouse gases. Trump, however, has repeatedly said the agreement is bad for U.S. businesses. In a speech in May, he declared that during his first 100 days in office, \u201cwe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\u201d Trump signaled another shift on the question of how to treat terrorism suspects. During his presidential campaign, he had said that he would reinstate the use of waterboarding and similar interrogation techniques in the questioning of suspected terrorists. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 torture works,\u201d Trump said in February at a retirement community in South Carolina. \u201cOkay, folks? Torture \u2014 you know, half these guys [say]: \u2018Torture doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 Believe me, it works. Okay?\u201d But Tuesday he suggested he might have changed his mind after interviewing a leading candidate for secretary of defense, retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis, who headed the U.S. Central Command. Mattis argued that he had never found harsh interrogation techniques \u201cto be useful,\u201d Trump said, adding that the retired general preferred building trust with \u201ca pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers.\u201d \u201cI was very impressed by that answer,\u2019\u2019 Trump said. Trump spoke extensively about the implications of an unprecedented situation in which a businessman with global holdings will sit in the Oval Office. That prospect has prompted criticism that there will be inevitable conflicts of interest. His election, Trump acknowledged, has been good for his business, making the name that he emblazons on his properties and markets through his licensing agreements \u201ca hotter brand than it was before.\u201d As he plans his presidential transition, Trump remains involved in several of his private enterprises. He held a meeting at Trump Tower with three business partners building a Trump property south of Mumbai. His new hotel in Washington, just blocks from the White House, last week invited about 100 foreign diplomats to hear a sales pitch. It also raised eyebrows when Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, a vice president at the Trump Organization, attended his meeting last week with the Japanese prime minister. While no statute specifically requires divestment by the president, all of them in modern history have put their assets under independent management, generally through a blind trust. The concern is to avoid running afoul \u2014 in actuality or appearance \u2014 of laws against bribery and other forms of corruption in dealings with corporations, foreign entities and powerful interests. Trump noted that he has turned the management of his businesses over to his children, giving him a requisite distance from the operation, but he protested: \u201cIf it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again.\u201d But his comments fueled more criticism. \u201cDonald Trump campaigned against a culture of self-enrichment in Washington and pledged to \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 but made clear today that he doesn\u2019t think the rules apply to him,\u201d Democratic National Committee communications director Adam Hodge said in a statement. \u201cHe fully intends to use the Oval Office to expand his family\u2019s wealth.\u201d [ Inside the alt-right world of Richard Spencer ] In disavowing the alt-right movement, Trump also came to the defense of his campaign\u2019s chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, whom he intends to bring into the White House as his chief strategist. Bannon is on a leave of absence as chairman of the website Breitbart News, a leading voice of the alt-right movement. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bannon conceded that the alt-right has \u201csome racial and anti-Semitic overtones,\u201d but he insisted he does not hold those views. The president-elect defended Bannon. \u201cIf I thought he was a racist or alt-right or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn\u2019t even think about hiring him,\u201d Trump said, adding that such accusations are \u201cvery hard on\u201d Bannon, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not him.\u201d Trump also suggested that he might make his son-in-law Jared Kushner, an observant Jew, a special envoy to work on brokering peace in the Middle East. Kushner, a publishing and real estate executive with no background in international diplomacy, \u201cwould be very good at it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians.\u201d Trump also used the session to air his grievances with the campaign coverage of the newspaper, which he frequently refers to as \u201cthe failing New York Times.\u201d Shortly before the session, he had announced via Twitter that he was canceling the meeting, but he then reversed himself. He tempered his criticism with praise, however, and at one point called the Times \u201ca great great American jewel,\u201d according to a tweet by Julie Davis, who covers the White House for the newspaper. During the session, he also softened his frequent threat to reopen libel laws and use them more aggressively against news outlets that write critical things about him. His reconsideration, he said, came after he discussed the issue with an associate who told him, \u201cYou know, you might be sued a lot more.\u2019 I said, \u2018You know, I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u2019 \u201d Shortly after the interview, Trump departed for Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to take a break from transition planning and spend Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago estate. However, Trump tweeted that he is closing in on another Cabinet selection: His onetime presidential rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, as secretary of housing and urban development. Carson told Fox News: \u201cIt certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine and I\u2019ll be thinking and praying about it seriously over the holiday.\u201d Jerry Markon and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Alba Vigaray / European Pressphoto Agency) Some liberals who really, really, really don't want Donald Trump to be president are pinning their hopes on a long-shot\u00a0effort to prevent him from officially winning the election. Understanding how their plan would work requires some background on the electoral college, which was established in the Constitution at a time when the founding fathers were wary of direct democracy.\u00a0 As widely known, presidents are not chosen based on the national popular vote \u2014 if they were, Hillary Clinton would be the next commander in chief, given she is ahead by roughly 1.7 million votes. Each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes based on population. Those votes\u00a0are awarded to candidates based on the state's popular vote. Trump won the presidential race with 290 electoral votes. (That total will reach 306 if Michigan is called for him, as expected.) The process doesn't end on election day. Each electoral vote is represented by an elector, an actual person who has to cast an official ballot for the president on Dec. 19. The electors are chosen through different processes state by state, and usually are selected by state political parties. With unrest over the result, there are efforts to persuade electors to be \"faithless,\" meaning they wouldn't back Trump even if he won their states.\u00a0A Change.org petition calling the president-elect a \"danger to the Republic\" has almost 4.6 million supporters. What are the chances of this actually happening? Very slim, says George C. Edwards III, a Texas A&M political science professor who has written a book about the electoral college.\u00a0 \"From time to time, there are faithless electors,\" he said.\u00a0\"They\u2019re few and far between.\" There were some electors who refused to vote for winning candidates in the 1800s, such as six who declined to support James Madison, but never enough to sway the outcome of the race. In the last century there have only been a handful of cases.\u00a0 There were some attempts to persuade electors to back Al Gore over George W. Bush during the disputed 2000 election, but they were unsuccessful . Latest updates ",

On the jammed streets down below, eight real dogs will be hard at work keeping the crowds safe by using their ultra-sensitive noses to sniff out the merest whiff of explosives. They're called \"vapor wake\" dogs and they're a key part of the NYPD's sweeping plan to make sure the worst thing that happens on Thanksgiving is an overcooked turkey.

For the first time, every cross street along the parade route will be blocked off, extra insurance that a vehicle cannot be used to attack the crowds as in the deadly July assault in Nice, France. Eighty-three sanitation trucks filled with sand will serve as barriers, police said. Members of the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit stand guard at last year's parade. There will be even more security this year. ANDREW KELLY / Reuters This is also the first year that the NYPD's fully trained Critical Response Command will be working the parade, its elite officers armed with long guns and a year of intense drilling. There are more than 500 officers in the command, a fraction of the 3,000 cops who are assigned to the parade detail. \"This year we're going to see a bit more of a robust counterterrorism presence,\" Waters told NBC News. \"There's been a lot of rhetoric and propaganda from ISIL and from al Qaeda recently...and we don't take any chances here in New York City.\" Officials have stressed there is no specific, credible threat against the parade. However, earlier this month ISIS urged its supporters in the West to use rented trucks in Nice-style attacks and wrote in its English-language magazine that the parade would be \"an excellent target.\" Stephanie Gosk ",

Carson adviser Armstrong Williams told ABC News just one week ago that Carson would not be accepting a cabinet position because he didn't feel prepared to run an entire agency due to lack of government experience. But today, Williams said that Carson, who has had a close relationship with Trump after dropping out of the race for president , will think about the president-elect's requests. \"Dr. Carson has tremendous respect for the president-elect and will always consider whatever request the president-elect makes of him,\" Williams told ABC News after Carson's meeting with Trump. When pressed for details about today's meeting, Williams said Trump's tweet speaks for itself. I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 A week ago, Williams said that the only way Carson would accept a cabinet position was if Trump could not find anyone else. Carson echoed that sentiment in an interview with the Washington Post last week. \"I\u2019ve said that if it came to a point where he absolutely needs me, I\u2019d reconsider. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the situation with these positions,\" Carson told the Washington Post. \"Having me as a federal bureaucrat would be like a fish out of water, quite frankly.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Caption Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 22, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with New York Times Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr.,\u00a0right, editors and reporters at the Times\u2019s office in New York. Hiroko Masuike/New York Times via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cAll publicity is good publicity,\u201d Trump\u2019s mentor, the New York lawyer Roy Cohn, instructed the young real estate developer. Trump took that advice to heart, providing news reporters with a steady stream of stories about his playboy social life, renegade business style and provocative positions on controversial issues. In 1990, at the height of the tabloid frenzy over the dissolution of Trump\u2019s first marriage, he said, \u201cThe show is Trump, and it is sold-out performances everywhere.\u201d During the campaign, Trump often seemed not so much annoyed as perplexed when news reports pointed out that he had contradicted himself or shifted positions on issues such as abortion or the Iraq war. \u201cWho cares what I said 10 years ago?\u201d he asked in a June interview with The Washington Post. \u201cNobody cares except you.\u201d Trump explained that when he was speaking to large crowds at his rallies, he often looked not at the people down front but at the bank of TV cameras, checking to see if the red lights on the cameras were ablaze, indicating that his words were going out live on cable. \u201cI would say something new to keep the red light on,\u201d Trump said \u2014 and if that happened to diverge from what he had said years or even weeks before, that was secondary to keeping the red light on. [ Trump: Never wrong, never sorry, never responsible ] Aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane, meanwhile, the candidate and her aides would catch up on news and become agog by what they read about Trump\u2019s performances. Matt Paul, a former senior Clinton adviser, recalled in an interview shortly before the election, \u201cPeople would just stop and say, \u2018What?!\u2019 And [Clinton] would say, \u2018What?!\u2019 \u201d Being provocative \u2014 being the bad boy who would, as one of his final campaign TV ads put it, \u201cturn Washington upside down\u201d \u2014 is central to Trump\u2019s conception of himself and his presidency. A president who flips positions in pre-dawn tweets is a new phenomenon, but nonetheless one to which the world\u2019s leaders and diplomats could adapt, said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to six countries in the Middle East and Near East. \u201cForeign leaders and diplomats are generally less concerned than many Americans are about the direction of the Trump presidency,\u201d said Crocker, who teaches at Texas A&M University and was a signatory to a letter that 75 retired senior diplomats sent in September opposing Trump. \u201cThey say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re a nation of laws, a system of institutions.\u201d Of Trump\u2019s position flips and overnight tweeting, Crocker said: \u201cClearly, this is a style none of us are used to. Can you name another president who would come anywhere near how he operates? But personality is policy, and it\u2019s good that he is reaching out to foreign leaders, even if he\u2019s not following the protocol manual. He has a real opportunity to start building some international relations, and people overseas will adapt.\u201d [ Trump and Pence vs. the cast of \u2018Hamilton\u2019: A collision of two Americas ] Every phase of Trump\u2019s career has featured a roller-coaster ride of relations with the news media, from overheated praise and near-wonderment at his successes to searing and embarrassing reporting on his personal flaws and professional failures. And each chapter of his life has led to basic questions about who he really is underneath the bluster and showmanship. Trump himself often says that he is perplexed by such questions: He is, he says, simply a businessman, in it to win. And the path to winning, he consistently says, involves crushing his opponents, calling out the \u201closers\u201d who criticize him, and saying what it takes to get where he\u2019s going. In one of his best-selling books, Trump called that methodology \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d \u2014 his term for statements that sometimes reach beyond the facts or contradict his previous positions. If some people thought he would tamp down that tendency to become, as he puts it, \u201cabsolutely presidential,\u201d his activities in the two weeks since the election indicate otherwise. How will President Trump govern? Throughout his career, he had kept only his own bottom line in mind: \u201cI was representing Donald Trump,\u201d he said. If others lost money, that was not his concern. Now, Trump says, he will work not for himself, but for the country. He has never done that before, he said in the June interview, but will simply make the necessary pivot. \u201cI\u2019ll just do it, \u201d he vowed. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

By Jim Tankersley November 22 at 9:28 AM Follow @jimtankersley In the modern era of presidential politics,\u00a0no candidate has ever won the popular vote by more than Hillary Clinton did this year, yet still managed to lose the electoral college. In that sense, 2016 was a historic split: Donald Trump won the presidency by as much as 74 electoral votes (depending on how Michigan ends up) while losing the nationwide vote to Clinton by 1.7 million votes and counting . But there's another divide exposed by the election, which researchers at the Brookings Institution recently discovered as they sifted the election returns. It has no bearing on the election outcome, but it tells us something important about the state of the country and its politics moving forward. The divide is economic, and it is massive. According to the Brookings analysis, the less-than-500 counties that Clinton won nationwide combined to generate 64 percent of America's economic activity in 2015. The more-than-2,600 counties that Trump won combined to generate 36 percent of the country's economic activity last year. Clinton, in other words, carried nearly two-thirds of the American economy. Here's how the researchers, at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, visualized that. You can see immediately what's going on: With the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas, and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized economic county in the country. (Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program) This appears to be unprecedented, in the era of modern economic statistics, for a losing presidential candidate.\u00a0The last candidate to win the popular vote but lose the electoral college, Democrat Al Gore in 2000, won counties that generated about 54 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the Brookings researchers calculated. That's true even though Gore won more than 100 more counties in 2000 than Clinton did in 2016. In between those elections, U.S. economic activity has grown increasingly concentrated in large, \u201csuperstar\u201d metro areas, such as Silicon Valley and New York. But it's not the case that the counties Clinton won have grown richer at the expense of the rest of the country \u2014 they represent about the same share of the economy today as\u00a0they did in 2000. Instead, it appears that, compared to Gore, Clinton was much more successful in winning over the most successful counties in a geographically unbalanced economy. The Brookings analysis found that counties with higher GDP per capita were more likely to vote for Clinton over Trump, as were counties with higher population density. Counties with a higher share of manufacturing employment were more likely to vote for Trump. \u201cThis is a picture of a very polarized and increasingly concentrated economy,\u201d said Mark Muro, the policy director at the Brookings metro program, \u201cwith the Democratic base aligning more to that more concentrated modern economy, but a lot of votes and anger to be had in the rest of the country.\u201d As Muro notes, many state legislatures are divided on similar grounds, between higher-output metro areas and lower-output rural ones. Often, that divide pushes governors of those states, even the ones who hail from cities, to push hard for economic development in lower-output areas. Such a dynamic could be an upside under a president who won votes representing only a third of the country's economy \u2014 to respond to his voters, Trump could push policies to help\u00a0those areas adapt more rapidly to the changing economy. There's a downside, though, for a candidate such as Trump, whose economic appeal was rooted in a promise to restore coal, manufacturing and other jobs lost in the shifts of the past several decades. That task\u00a0will be difficult , Muro has written, in part because manufacturers have grown substantially more productive in recent years, meaning they probably won't be adding millions more workers even if Trump pursues major changes in trade policy that result in more goods being made in the United States. \u201cThe prescription isn't that helpful,\u201d Mark said. \u201cWe're going to have a lot of questions about how to translate the political geography into actually helpful policy.\u201d Read more:\u00a0 ",

Public Schools, appeared on Tuesday to take herself out of the running to become President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary. Rhee\u2019s name had been circulated as a potential candidate for education secretary, speculation that only intensified after she and her husband \u2014 former NBA star and current Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson \u2014 met with Trump over the weekend. Trump pronounced them both \u201cgreatly talented\u201d and, according to his transition team, they spoke about \u201cthe possibility for increasing competition through charter and choice schools.\u201d [ Jay Mathews: Rhee was an outsider trying to tear up the school bosses, just like Trump ] Rhee put the education secretary rumors to bed on Tuesday afternoon, tweeting that she was not pursuing the position. But she pushed back against criticism\u00a0by some in the education reform community that she should not have met with Trump, given his statements about women, immigrants, Muslims and people with disabilities. [ Advocacy group warns fellow Democrats: Don\u2019t become Trump\u2019s education secretary ] \u201cI have appreciated the opportunity to share my thoughts on education with the PEOTUS,\u201d Rhee\u2019s message said, using an acronym for President-elect of the United States. \u201cInterestingly many colleagues warned me against doing so. They are wrong. Mr. Trump won the election. Our job as Americans is to want him to succeed. Wishing for his failure would be wanting the failure of our millions of American children who desperately need a better education.\u201d \u201cI am hopeful about the opportunity to find common ground on this important issue of education and will do whatever I can to be supportive,\u201d she wrote in a separate tweet. In light of the speculation about the Secretary of Education role, I wanted to clarify my position and what's best for America's students. pic.twitter.com/DXRZxdAZNX \u2014 Michelle Rhee (@MichelleRhee) November 22, 2016 As an Asian American woman, Rhee would have brought diversity to a prospective Cabinet that is otherwise shaping up to be largely white and male. She also would have brought a diversity of ideas: Rhee is a longtime Democrat who has been a strong supporter of the Common Core State Standards, which Trump and his base abhor. She says that young undocumented people who have grown up in the United States should have a route to citizenship, putting her squarely at odds with the president-elect, who put mass deportation at the center of his campaign. But Rhee\u2019s blunt pronouncements about broken public schools \u2014 and the way she seemed to relish public battles with the teachers union as she instituted sweeping changes in D.C. schools \u2014 have made her one of the most widely known figures calling\u00a0for change in the education system. She has been a foremost voice pushing for the expansion of charter schools and a rare Democrat who embraces vouchers for private schools \u2014 on expanding such taxpayer-funded alternatives to traditional public schools, she and Trump see eye to eye. And not incidentally, Rhee\u2019s brash style is a lot like Trump\u2019s: The two share the distinction of having fired employees on national television, Trump on his show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and Rhee during a public television documentary. local ",

    "text": "advertisement President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday had a closed-door meeting with journalists at the New York Times, which ranged the gamut of issues embroiling his transition to the White House \u2014 and was live tweeted by the paper's reporters. Like much of Trump's rapid ascent to becoming the leader of the free world, the meeting was an unprecedented break from political norms. And it comes after the incoming president spent the entire campaign season complaining about his coverage in the \"mainstream media\" and even initially canceling Tuesday's interview. President-elect Donald Trump waves to the crowd as he leaves the New York Times building following a meeting, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, in New York. Mark Lennihan / AP Here are the highlights of what he eventually had to share. Trump rejects claims that Steve Bannon is \"racist\" or part of the \"alt-right\" Trump defended appointing Steve Bannon, the former president of Breitbart News, to serve as his chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has been under fire for leading a news site with a long history of espousing anti-Semitic, racist and misogynist stories that have been embraced by white nationalist groups. But Trump told the Times that he did not believe Bannon harbored those negative opinions himself. \"If I thought he was a racist or alt-right or any of the things, the terms we could use, I couldn't even think about hiring him,\" Trump said, according to tweet from a Times reporter who was in the room . Trump elaborated that he felt Bannon was having difficulty dealing with the criticism lobbed against him. \"Breitbart is just a publication,\" Trump said, per Haberman. He disavows white nationalist sympathizers Trump gave his first full-throated response to reports that white nationalists convened together in Washington, D.C., over the weekend, quoting Nazi propaganda and cheering \"hail victory!\" in the president-elect's name. Asked point-blank about Nazi conference in DC over wknd: @realDonaldTrump tells @nytimes \"of course\" \"I disavow and condemn them\" \u2014 Julie Davis (@juliehdavis) November 22, 2016 Acknowledges meeting with British politician Nigel Farage and bringing up his business Trump is now under intense scrutiny over whether his business dealings will be a major conflict of interest once he assumes office. The latest example comes amid reports that the president-elect met with British politician Nigel Farage, head of the UK Independence Party, and brought up his business concerns. The Times reported on Monday that Trump brought up the issue of his two Scottish golf courses and his concerns that plans to build offshore wind farms would damage the resort's views of the skyline. On Tuesday, Trump did not deny that conversation took place. \"I might have brought it up,\" Trump says of Farage meeting and wind farms. \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) November 22, 2016 Trump brushes off other potential conflicts of interest Trump opened a brand new luxury hotel in Washington, D.C., just days before the general election. He leveraged what effectively amounted to free advertising for the property by inviting the campaign press core to come cover the grand opening. And now Trump admits the hotel is \"probably a more valuable asset than it was before,\" according to a Times reporter's tweet . The Trump brand is now \"hotter,\" he added. Trump is downplaying his daily involvement in his business empire, stressing that his children are likely to take over management and operations. He admitted that it would likely be difficult to dissolve his business since it is centralized in real estate holdings. But he suggested that his company and duty to the country would not run into problems with the law. \"In theory, I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly,\" Trump said, according to Times reporters. \"There's never been a case like this.\" He also indicated that he thinks people pushing for him to divest from his businesses are trying to break up his family. \"If it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again,\" the Times quoted him as saying. Conflicts of interest? Trump says: \u201cIf it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again.\" \u2014 Mike Grynbaum (@grynbaum) November 22, 2016 Says he can mend Israel/Palestine relations Trump suggested that his son-in-law Jared Kushner could \"make peace\" between the Israelis and Palestinians. Kushner, who is Jewish, has no experience in politics or international diplomacy. He is the publisher of the New York Observer and works in real estate development. Still Trump has sought after the deeply unorthodox move of appointing a close family member to serve alongside him in the White House. It remains unclear what role Kushner will fill once Trump enters the Oval Office. Asserts that he and Republican leadership are now tight Tensions and infighting among Republican leaders were not uncommon during the campaign season, particularly as party elites scrambled to assemble an \"anti-Trump\" movement shortly before the conventions. Trump now says those concerns are water under the bridge as he prepares to assume a White House and Congress that is united under a single party. \"Paul Ryan, right now, loves me. Mitch McConnell loves me,\" Trump said. Claims he has been unfairly treated in Times coverage Trump's visit to the New York Times building in Manhattan was part of a broad series of gatherings between the president elect and the media organizations that cover him. Just a day earlier Trump met with the executives and top anchors of major broadcast networks, NBC News included. But premise behind Trump's meeting with the Times was tremendously fraught. Trump initially rescinded his offer to meet with the paper of record, letting those involved to find out the news via Twitter. \"I have great respect for the New York Times. I have tremendous respect,\" Trump said, according to a Times media reporter. \"I think I've been treated very rough.\" Throughout the campaign season Trump continually needled the Times and its coverage. He mocked and imitated a disabled reporter. He repeatedly condemned articles that reflected poorly on him, calling the paper of record \"dishonest\" and \"failing.\" Still, Trump admitted he was a fan of his hometown broadsheet \u2014 to an extent. \"I do read it,\" he said of the Times. \"Unfortunately, I'd live about 20 years longer if I didn't.\" Amanda Sakuma ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Karoun Demirjian November 22 at 5:55 PM Follow @karoun Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) plans to file a \u201csense of the Congress\u201d resolution demanding that President-elect Donald Trump place his assets in a blind trust. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) Senate Democrats plan to file legislation next week insisting that President-elect Donald Trump sell off his business stakes and place his assets in a blind trust \u2014 or they will treat all his business dealings as potential violations of the Constitution. The resolution, which the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), plans to introduce next week, comes as Trump is facing\u00a0fire for adding\u00a0meetings with business partners to his presidential transition schedule, including his children \u2014 who are supposed to be running Trump\u2019s business after his\u00a0inauguration \u2014 in meetings with foreign heads of state and allegedly encouraging foreign diplomats to stay at his new Washington hotel. [ A running list of how Donald Trump\u2019s new position may be helping his business interests ] It is effectively a warning shot from Democrats, who could use claims of constitutional impropriety to build a case against Trump, potentially even to the point of attempting impeachment proceedings. But\u00a0Democrats will need the cooperation of Republicans to put such a measure on the floor \u2014 and it is unlikely that the GOP will be inclined to schedule such a\u00a0vote during the few weeks remaining in the jam-packed \u201clame duck\u201d session. Even if Cardin\u00a0gains support for his legislation, the \u201csense of the Congress\u201d resolution would not bind Trump to divest his business interests. Although past presidents have taken such measures to avoid the appearance of impropriety, there is only one explicit constitutional prohibition that could cause problems for Trump: the Emoluments Clause, which says that no one holding office can accept foreign gifts \u201cof any kind whatever\u201d without the consent of Congress. Though the Trump transition team maintains that it can avoid any problems, Democrats warn\u00a0that the Trump Organization\u2019s foreign holdings and dealings will put the president-elect precariously close to that constitutional line. Democrats are hoping that with this resolution they can compel Trump to sell his business stakes and put the money in a blind trust, or take equivalent steps to remove any potential for a conflict of interest. \u201cUnless he takes appropriate action, Mr. Trump\u2019s many international financial interests pose a great risk of violating the Constitution once he assumes the Presidency of the United States,\u201d Cardin said in a statement announcing his resolution. \u201cHe should provide the American people with clarity and certainty that he will in no way, shape or form use the office of the President to advance his substantial personal fortune.\u201d But Republicans have not yet expressed any support for the measure. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that it would be impossible, at this point, to determine whether there would be unanimous consent to consider the resolution. In general, however, Republican leaders have been noticeably quiet about the mounting concerns involving Trump\u2019s foreign holdings \u2014 though a Republican member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Justin Amash (Mich.), said\u00a0 Monday night in a tweet directed at\u00a0Trump ,\u00a0\u201cYou rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation. If you have contracts w/foreign govts, it\u2019s certain a big deal, too.\u201d Over in the House, Democrats\u00a0have not filed a resolution but are echoing demands that Trump dispose of his business interests and place his assets in a blind trust \u2014 and are pushing him to disclose his records as he separates his finances from the Trump Organization. \u201cThe President-elect must demonstrate to the American people that he is not using the power of his presidency to enhance his business interests. This is a big deal,\u201d the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cLeaders in Congress should demand that these conditions be met before we consider any part of the Trump agenda. Otherwise we will have no idea who stands to benefit from his proposed policies.\u201d powerpost ",

Visiting royalty, heads of state and even well-known gangsters have stayed at the Drake. Phil Vettel Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Cape Cod Room, the signature seafood restaurant of the Drake Hotel (140 E. Walton Place, 312-787-2200), will say goodbye to Chicago on New Year's Eve. It's the final sailing for the Cape Cod Room, which opened in 1933 during Chicago's Century of Progress International Exhibition. It was the city's fine-dining seafood destination decades before Shaw's Crab House was even on the drawing board. As part of a major renovation of The Drake that will stretch into 2019, the entire Arcade level of the hotel will be transformed, and that will mark the end for the Cape Cod Room. The restaurant's final night of service will be New Year's Eve. Might as well mix those tears with a little Champagne. It's not all sad news. Keenly aware of the restaurant's historic value, the Drake is making sure to preserve some of its most treasured elements, including the wood bar onto which newlyweds Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio signed their initials in 1954. Some of the restaurant's iconic dishes will be preserved as well \u2014 not in trophy cases, but on the menu at the hotel's Coq d'Or restaurant, where the Cape Cod seafood boil, Bookbinder soup, oysters Rockefeller, crabcakes and baked Alaska will move. (Actually, an Executive martini and some oysters sound pretty good right now.) And fans and first-timers alike still have more than a month to visit the restaurant before another chapter of Chicago history closes. Phil Vettel is a Tribune critic. pvettel@chicagotribune.com Twitter @philvettel Here are the restaurants\u00a0that Ina Pinkney, who owned iconic West Loop breakfast spot Ina's for more than 30 years, has\u00a0loved the most this year\u00a0for coffee and a morning meal.

The incident took place at a residence in the Center City neighborhood of the city. The 62-year-old victim's roommate said the injured man often received packages of inhalers delivered by mail, according to authorities. The device was described by police as something that is not normally seen and has been taken to ATF headquarters for analysis, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross said during a briefing later in the day. A motive has not been determined, but the exploding device targeted a specific individual it was addressed to, Ross said. \u201cThis package was sent to this individual, it was addressed to him,\" Ross said of the victim, noting that the device was concealed in a large padded envelope, which detonated when it was opened. 1 Worker Hurt in Explosion at Kansas Chemical Plant The 62-year-old victim opened the envelope around 4 a.m. and was injured from the shrapnel it contained, the ATF said. It is possible that the package was processed through the mail, but it is more likely that it was placed at the apartment building where it was found, Ross said. The FBI described the explosion as a \"single incident\" with no nexus to terrorism and said all possible motives are being considered. Authorities declined to confirm the victim's identity, but The Philadelphia Inquirer identified him as a local caterer known in the city's gay community. Philadelphia police said there is \"no reason to believe that is the motivation,\" but said it is open to all possibilities. The victim suffered injuries to both hands and his chest, police said, also noting that there was no significant structural damage to the man's residence. 0 Shares ",

Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters told reporters today his team will request that a second trial be held in a different Ohio county, pointing to Cleveland or Columbus as potential locations. He said he came to the decision to retry Tensing, who is white, after reviewing the trial transcript, speaking with some of the jurors and consulting with his staff. \"My decision is based on the likelihood of success in trial, and that's it,\" Deters said. \"If I thought we couldn't win this case, we would not retry this case.\" The parties are scheduled to appear before Judge Megan Shanahan on Nov. 28 in the Hamilton County courthouse. Graphic Coroner Photos Shown to Jury in Murder Trial of Former Cop Ray Tensing Earlier this month, Shanahan declared a mistrial in the case against Tensing after a jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter. The murder charge carried the possibility of life in prison, and the voluntary manslaughter charge carried a possible prison term of three to 11 years. The fatal shooting happened in July 2015 after Tensing, then an officer for the University of Cincinnati, pulled over DuBose in his car near campus. Tensing, 26, lost his job after DuBose's shooting death and was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors in the case told the jury \u2014 consisting of two black and 10 white people \u2014 that the shooting was \"completely intentional\" and \"truly unjustified.\" Tensing's attorneys said he feared for his life and his actions were justified. They said he was close to being run over by DuBose's car. Although DuBose didn't have a gun, the defense argued that he turned his car into a weapon. Tensing instinctively drew his weapon and fired \"to stop the threat\" and save his own life, the defense claimed. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Nov 22, 2016 2:57 PM EST In a meeting with the New York Times, Donald Trump appeared to back away from some of the most prominent promises he made during his presidential campaign, notably, whether he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, and whether or not torture should be used in the war on terror. Asked whether he had ruled out prosecuting Hillary Clinton, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just not something I feel strongly about,\u201d Mr. Trump told the room, according to Times media reporter Michael Grynbaum, who live-tweeted the meeting. Prosecution, he said \u201cwould be very, very divisive for the country,\u201d Mr. Trump told the room, according to Times political reporter Maggie Haberman. \u201cMy inclination for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let\u2019s go forward. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum.\u201d In addition to the FBI\u2019s investigation, the House Select Committee on Benghazi has looked into Clinton\u2019s emails, as did several media organizations and watchdog groups like Judicial Watch. Mr. Trump also said that Clinton had \u201csuffered greatly\u201d and he does not \u201cwant to hurt the Clintons.\u201d\u00a0 This was a far cry from the cries of \u201cLock her up\u201d he encouraged at rally after rally during his campaign. And during the second presidential debate ,  Mr. Trump told Clinton he would appoint a special prosecutor. \u201cIf I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a  special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never  been so many lies, so much deception,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump also appears to have had a change of heart on the use of torture. Gen. James Mattis (ret), he said has told him \u201c\u2019I\u2019ve never found it to be useful.\u2019\u201d Mattis, who is under consideration for secretary of state, told Mr. Trump that building trust with terror suspects and rewarding cooperation elicited better results. \u201c\u2018Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I\u2019ll do better,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said, quoting Mattis. \u201cI was very impressed by that answer.\u2019\u2019\u00a0 10 Photos Trump's team Torture, Mr. Trump told the Times, is \u201cnot going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking.\u201d This is also a stark departure from his campaign rhetoric, when Mr. Trump expressed support for waterboarding and worse. In dealing with the threat posed by ISIS , Mr. Trump said in February, \u201cTorture works, okay folks? ...Believe me, it works.\u201d Waterboarding, Trump has said is \u201cyour minor form,\u201d and said \u201csome people say it\u2019s not actually torture.\u201d And he said, \u201cwe should go much stronger than waterboarding.\u201d\u00a0 On climate change, too, which he has more than once called a \u201choax,\u201d in the meeting with the Times, when he was asked whether he thought it was related to human activity, he said, \u201cI think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much.\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Trump did not say with certainty he would withdraw from climate change accords, indicating it was a matter under consideration. \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely,\u201d he said. \u201cI have an open mind to it.\u201d This again, differs from his past insistence that he would walk away. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,\u201d he said in May. He did say, however, that he\u2019s taking into account the impact on U.S. businesses, \u201chow much it will cost our companies\u201d and the impact on American competitiveness, he told the Times.\u00a0 Trump Foundation admits to breaking IRS rules There was even a change of tone on First Amendment rights. Mr. Trump, who told the Times he thought its reporters had been \u201cvery rough\u201d on him during the campaign, has threatened to sue the Times over its stories on him. He also threatened to change the libel laws during his campaign. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m going to do, is I\u2019m going to open up the libel laws,\u201d he told a rally in Radford, Va., in February. \u201c...[W]hen people write incorrectly about you and you can prove that they wrote incorrectly, we\u2019re going to get them through the court system to change and we\u2019re going to get them to pay damages.\u201d A reporter in the room asked him about whether he still intends to \u201copen up the libel laws.\u201d It seems he\u2019s rethought this idea, telling the Times that someone pointed out to him, \u201c\u2019You know, you might be sued a lot more.\u2019 I said, \u2018You know, I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u2019\u201d During the hour-long conversation with the Times, Mr. Trump was also asked about other issues, as well. Has he energized the alt right? \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Dean,\u201d the president-elect replied to Executive Editor Dean Baquet. \u201cI don\u2019t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 The president-elect did not appear to address the concerns of minority groups about the right-wing news site Breitbart under Steve Bannon, who will be his chief White House strategist, and he defended the site by saying it covered stories like the Times does.\u00a0 Alt-right movement makes momentum with Trump presidency \u201cBreitbart is just a publication. They cover stories like you cover stories,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Times, according to Grynbaum. \u201cThey are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. It\u2019s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It\u2019s a pretty big thing.\u201d According to Haberman, Mr. Trump said of Bannon, \u201cIf I thought he was a racist or alt-right or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn\u2019t even think about hiring him.\u201d And apparently in reference to the allegations about sympathies toward the alt right, Mr. Trump added that \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard on him. I think he\u2019s having a hard time with it. Because it\u2019s not him.\u201d President-elect Trump outlines first 100 days in office The Times also pressed Mr. Trump on the potential for\u00a0 conflicts of interest -- \u201cThe law\u2019s totally on my side. The president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest, Mr. Trump said, according to Haberman. It was not immediately clear what he meant by that.\u00a0 \u201cIn theory, I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There\u2019s never been a case like this,\u201d the president-elect also said. And he said that while he could continue signing checks at his company, he\u2019s \u201cphasing that out now\u201d and giving control to his children, according to Haberman.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again.\u201d Ivanka Trump participated in the president-elect\u2019s meeting with the Japanese prime minister last week, and reportedly spoke on the phone with the president of Argentina while he was speaking with Mr. Trump. The president-elect has said that his children will run his businesses while he\u2019s president , and he told \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d earlier this month that his children will not be consulting him on their business decisions. Also, a recent meeting between Mr. Trump and three of his Indian business partners has also raised questions about the separation of his business from the government\u2019s interests. Times reporter Maggie Haberman said she asked Mr. Trump what role he imagined in his administration for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. He indicated that a formal role was unlikely, but he thought that Kushner could be involved in Mideast peace.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also talked about his domestic agenda, which includes a very expensive infrastructure plan. Asked what House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republicans thought of the plan, Trump said, \u201cRight now, they\u2019re in love with me.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption toggle caption President-elect Donald Trump arrives at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., on Sunday. Carolyn Kaster/AP The Donald J. Trump Foundation has acknowledged in a tax filing that it violated the ban against \"self-dealing,\" or using its assets to help its leader's business or personal interests, The Washington Post reported. The Post quoted copies of the foundation's 2015 IRS tax returns , which had been uploaded, apparently by the foundation's attorneys, to a nonprofit tracking site called GuideStar. The newspaper said it hadn't yet confirmed whether the forms had actually been sent to the IRS. The returns asked whether the foundation has transferred \"income or assets to a disqualified person\" or had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in past years. In both cases, the foundation checked the box for \"Yes.\" There was no indication what the returns were referring to, or what kind of self-dealing might have taken place. Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Under IRS regulations, an admission of self-dealing by the leader of a nonprofit foundation can lead to a fine. The Trump foundation has been accused of using its assets to pay debts incurred by Trump and his businesses over the past decade. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation. Article continues after sponsorship In one case, the Post said Trump settled a dispute with Florida's Palm Beach County over the size of a flagpole at his Mar-a-Lago club by agreeing to make a donation to a veterans' charity. Trump made the donation using funds from the foundation, the newspaper reported. In another case, Trump is said to have used funds from the foundation to settle a dispute with a man who made a hole-in-one at Trump's golf course in Westchester County, N.Y. Trump also reportedly used foundation funds to pay for items that he and his wife, Melania, bought at charity auctions, including a 6-foot-tall painting of Trump himself. ",

    "text": "But Mr. Christie\u2019s unceremonious dismissal was more a pileup of grievances in the weeks before the election, according to interviews with people close to the governor and the campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story No one has publicly ruled out a role for Mr. Christie in the Trump administration; on Sunday, the governor was among those the president-elect met with at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. But the meeting was much shorter than others that day, only about 20 minutes. The two men emerged before cameras just before Mr. Christie departed, for a 10-second handshake that looked almost like a tug of war. The governor smiled forcibly, and Mr. Trump gave no indication that he was under consideration for any jobs \u2014 unlike with other potential job candidates he met. The jobs Mr. Christie wanted \u2014 friends say he would have liked to have been White House chief of staff or attorney general \u2014 have been assigned to others. Mr. Christie\u2019s fall in the Trump circle was weeks in the making. There was already grumbling, particularly from former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, and from Mr. Trump\u2019s children. Mr. Christie, they believed, had gone off-message after an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was released in which Mr. Trump made vulgar comments about women; the governor first canceled Sunday show appearances, then emerged on the radio the next week to call Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cindefensible.\u201d Spending on the Trump transition effort, which Mr. Christie was leading, was already higher than what the transition team of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had spent, even though polls showed her winning. And some around Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Christie was using his post to promote his own people, including his former chief of staff and his former law partner, who were running the team day to day, and one of his longtime supporters, Bob Grady, who had been recommended for several positions. The friendship between Mr. Christie and Mr. Trump, while never deep, has always been pragmatic. And several people interviewed said they had begun to patch up any break with a conversation on the Saturday after the president-elect removed the governor as leader of his transition team. That continued with the meeting on Sunday at the golf club, not far from Mr. Christie\u2019s home. Jon Bramnick, the leader of the Republican minority in the New Jersey Assembly and one of the governor\u2019s most steadfast supporters, said, \u201cBoth Trump and Christie are the type that they\u2019re loyal to their friends, and I suspect that long term it will work out, whether it\u2019s a position now or later.\u201d But the Trump roller coaster has been particularly jolting for Mr. Christie. The two men met, according to Mr. Christie, through Mr. Trump\u2019s sister, a federal judge, shortly after Mr. Christie became United States attorney for New Jersey in 2002. Mr. Christie liked to be around celebrity; Mr. Trump, who owned several casinos in Atlantic City, liked to know people in charge. Subscribe to the Times As the testimony in the lane-closing trial showed, Mr. Christie began planning a run for president in 2016 shortly after taking office in 2010. Mr. Trump\u2019s run started out looking like more of a flirtation with the office. But in a crowded field of Republicans, he soon occupied the position Mr. Christie expected to take, as the tell-it-like-it-is candidate not afraid to challenge the way things had always been done. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Christie had struggled to bounce back from the scandal since January 2014, when a legislative subpoena revealed that his deputy chief of staff had sent an email calling for \u201csome traffic problems\u201d in the town that was gridlocked by the closings, to punish a mayor who had declined to endorse the governor. After the governor failed in his attempt to make a good showing in the New Hampshire primary contest in February, he endorsed Mr. Trump . He became the first major establishment Republican to do so. He also alienated many friends and financial backers and saw his poll numbers drop to a new low. Mr. Christie was, again, pragmatic, saying it was clear to him that Mr. Trump would be the nominee. \u201cIf he had not been in the race, it would have been me,\u201d the governor said at a news conference at the time. On the campaign trail, he endured public ridicule, when he stood obedient and silent next to Mr. Trump on Super Tuesday on March 1. Mr. Trump himself mocked the governor for eating too many Oreos and for abandoning his state to run for president. Mr. Christie publicly said he hoped to be Mr. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential nominee. And he was said to be bitterly disappointed when Mr. Trump\u2019s children and campaign manager prevailed on the candidate to instead choose Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana. Mr. Trump made Mr. Christie chief of the transition. But the governor was still struggling with the scandal, after revelations on the stand that he had known about the lane closings even as they were happening and did nothing to reverse them. On Election Day, Mr. Christie voted in the dark of early morning, a contrast to earlier years when he invited cameras and reporters along by indicating on his public schedule what time he would go to the polls. Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise upset seemed to offer another chance at resurrection. Mr. Christie appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show, demurring on the question of whether he wanted to be chief of staff or attorney general, saying his most important job was the transition. \u201cIf there\u2019s some role for me that I want to do, and that the president-elect wants me to do,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve known each other for 14 years \u2014 we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next day, Mr. Trump announced that Mr. Christie would no longer lead the transition. The governor has now given signals that he is planning to serve out his term in New Jersey. On Monday, he held his first cabinet meeting in a long time. Late on Wednesday afternoon, he had bumped his lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, as the keynote speaker at an annual statewide convention of mayors in Atlantic City, which he has skipped since 2011. Appearing the next day \u2014 Lieutenant Governor Guadagno\u2019s name was still on the programs \u2014 Mr. Christie said, \u201cI have no reason to believe that I will do anything other than serve out my full term as governor and turn the keys of the office over to whoever you select in November of 2017 to replace me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had a pretty good run,\u201d he added.

In this May 15, 2014 file photo, protesters hold a rally at the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) in Washington, DC to support \"net neutrality.\" The top US telecom regulator FCC announced February 4, 2015 he would propose to regulate the Internet as a public utility, as part of a renewed effort to enforce \"net neutrality\" rules. Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled the plan which aims to prevent Internet providers from playing favorites or blocking some services or allowing others to pay for \"fast lanes.\" The new proposal comes a year after a federal court struck down the FCC neutrality rules, saying it lacked the authority because Internet providers were not \"common carriers\" under US telecom law. The plan, which is expected to unleash a fresh legal and political battle, aims to resolve the impasse by reclassifying Internet service providers as regulated entities under the 1934 Telecommunications Act.  AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER / FILESKAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images ORG XMIT: US plan w ORIG FILE ID: 537437406 (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) The days could be numbered for Net neutrality under the Trump Administration. Net neutrality rules, passed in February 2015 by the Federal Communications Commission and supported by Netflix,\u00a0Google and other big websites, prevent\u00a0Internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking and slowing the transmission of content. The contentious issue triggered\u00a0lawsuits from the ISPs\u00a0and drew an unprecedented outpouring of public comments. While Net neutrality\u00a0wasn't a constant topic for President-Elect Donald Trump as a candidate, he has been an opponent of the regulations, calling the FCC's adoption \"a power grab\" by President Obama in a 2014 tweet. And the President-Elect's latest appointments suggest he'll try to bolster that view, supported by telecommunication companies like Verizon and others, by reversing\u00a0the rules.\u00a0Jeffrey Eisenach, who joined\u00a0Trump's transition team in October, and Mark Jamison, a former lobbyist for Sprint, were named Monday as a member of the \"Agency Landing\" team focusing on the FCC. Both advisers opposed Net neutrality in the past. Net neutrality \"is not about protecting consumers from rapacious Internet Service Providers ... Net neutrality is crony capitalism pure and simple \u2013 an effort by one group of private interests to enrich itself at the expense of another group by using the power of the state,\" wrote Eisenach in a 2014 article on the web site of the American Enterprise Institute , a free enterprise think tank where Eisenach was a visiting scholar from 2012 to 2016. Obama\u2019s attack  on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014 A recent New York Times article noted that some of Eisenach's work at the think-tank on FCC issues were supported by Verizon and the GSMA , a wireless trade group of which AT&T and Verizon are members. Eisenach, who is currently the managing director and co-chair of the communications, media, and Internet practice\u00a0at NERA Economic Consulting, declined comment on the administration's plans. Jamison has also taken swings at the Obama Adminstration's\u00a0net neutrality stance. The FCC has pursued \"unilateral approach\" on Net neutrality and other rulemaking procedures that \"forces industry and consumers to incur unnecessary litigation costs and to operate in an uncertain environment,\"\u00a0Jamison said\u00a0a co-written editorial last year. Now the\u00a0director of the Public Utility Research Center at University of Florida, Jamison also declined comment. Netflix vs AT&T The issue of Net neutrality has divided telecom and tech companies for years, with Netflix, Google, Twitter and other household tech names backing the agency's need for such authority to prevent ISPs from promoting their own content over that of other outlets. Telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Verizon have countered, saying the agency used outdated authority given to public utilties that is more heavy-handed than needed to oversee the Internet. Their fight has gone to the courts, with Verizon successfully having\u00a0the FCC's 2010 rules tossed out with its court challenge in 2014; AT&T and others are appealing a federal court's decision upholding the current rules. Supporters of a less hands-on FCC see good signs. \"l do think the appointment of Eisenach and Jamison is an indication that President-elect Trump is serious about achieving communications policy reform, including curtailing the reach of the agency's net neutrality and privacy orders and the set-top box proposal were it to be adopted,\" said\u00a0Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation , a free market think-tank. In a Washington Times editorial Monday, May said that \"it\u2019s undeniable that the Obama administration\u2019s FCC has been on a regulatory binge, adopting a number of major overly burdensome and unduly costly new rules, despite the lack of evidence of market failure or consumer harm.\" FCC approves new net neutrality rules How could Net neutrality be overturned? \"The new FCC could try to walk away from the rules. \u00a0It could refuse to enforce them, try to wipe them off the books, or stop defending them on appeal,\" said Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, an awareness group that supported the rules. The strongest action would be Congressional action, May says, \"because it is more durable and can't be easily reversed.\" New legislation could remove\u00a0the FCC's oversight of the Internet service providers as \"common carriers\" and the Net itself as a public utility. The FCC based its new rules on authority from Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. \"Republicans in both Congress and the FCC have expressed their antipathy towards Title II regulation,\" said research firm\u00a0 MoffettNathanson \u00a0in a note to investors after the election. \"A Congressional roll-back of Title\u00a0II was never a serious option in a Democratic Administration: President Obama made clear that he stood ready with a veto. With the risk of a veto now gone, a legislative remedy now not only looks possible, but likely.\" Beyond that, analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson said last week in a subsequent note, \"It is likely\u00a0... that virtually every major FCC rule making of the past four years will be undone.\" Record comments However, Net neutrality rules are very popular and drew a record number of comments at the FCC \u2014 more than 4 million, notes Chris Lewis, vice president at Public Knowledge, a consumer tech advocacy group. Perhaps the Trump Administration will offer a counterproposal, he says, because many Congressional Republicans were in favor of an open Internet but against the FCC\u2019s Net neutrality proposal. \"We think we have very good rules and we want to defend them,\" Lewis said, \"and if folks want to eliminate these very important consumer protections that are wildly popular across ideological lines, the question is how are they going to protect an open Internet if they eliminate these rules?\" Follow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider 350 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 36 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fOU5x8 ",

(Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) The top four of this week's College Football Playoff rankings look\u00a0a lot like last week's rankings. Like the previous three weeks, Alabama is again No. 1. Ohio State remains second followed by Michigan and Clemson. Washington rounds out the top five after moving up one spot. The biggest loser in this week's ranking is Louisville. The Cardinals dropped six spots to No. 11 after their loss to Houston which likely ended their playoff hopes. Ohio State and Michigan give the Big Ten two teams in the top four. That will change next week with the Buckeyes and Wolverines set to face off in Columbus. That could open the door for Washington or maybe No. 6 Wisconsin to move into the projected field. The Badgers are the top-ranked team with two losses. A win against Minnesota would put them in the Big Ten championship game against either Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State. The Nittany Lions, ranked seventh, would win the East division with a defeat of Michigan State and a loss by the Wolverines against the Buckeyes. Oklahoma only moved up one spot to No. 8 after beating then-No. 14 West Virginia on the road by 28 points. Colorado and Oklahoma State complete the top 10. The Sooners and Cowboys will meet in\u00a0a de facto Big 12 title game on Dec. 2. But with both behind four Big Ten teams, it looks unlikely for either to make the field without some major upsets in the final two weeks. 10 scenarios for College Football Playoff, from likely to 'You're dreaming' In the race for the Group of Five bowl, Boise State is two spots ahead of Western Michigan. However, the Broncos must be a conference champion to be selected. They need Wyoming to lose at New Mexico to play in the Mountain West championship game. The top four teams in final ranking of the committee on Dec. 3 will play in the College Football Playoff. The semifinals will take place on Dec. 31 at the Peach Bowl and Fiesta Bowl. The championship game will be held on Jan. 9 in Tampa, Fla. This week's Top 25: ",

Johnthony Walker, 24, was driving a bus for Durham School Services \u2014 the same as in the fatal crash \u2014 when he sideswiped an oncoming Kia Soul in September after crossing into oncoming traffic while attempting to negotiate a \"blind curve,\" according to the crash report. There were no injuries, according to the crash report, and children were seated in the rear rows. No charges were filed in that incident, but a citation for failure to yield was issued. It was unclear if Durham took any action against Walker after that collision. \"Our entire team at Durham School Services is devastated by the accident yesterday that tragically claimed the lives of Chattanooga students,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are working with Chattanooga Police Department and Hamilton County School District to investigate. We also have additional team members arriving in Chattanooga today to provide support. We have offered to provide counseling to students and families of Hamilton County, as well as our employees. We will provide all further updates in coordination with the Chattanooga Police Department and the district.\" In a press conference Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board said Walker received his license to drive a school bus in April. In the fatal crash, the bus was traveling at a \"high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 mph,\" police said this morning, based on witness statements and physical evidence. Of the five deaths, interim Superintendent Kirk Kelly of the Hamilton County Department of Education told reporters this morning, three of the children were in fourth grade, one was in first grade, and the other was a kindergartner. Four of the five were girls. Six students remain in intensive care, but details have not been released. Dr. Darwin Koller of Erlanger Hospital said that some of the children were so young that they did not know their parents' names, replying \"Mama\" when asked. The bus was carrying 37 children, from kindergartners to fifth-graders, from Woodmore Elementary School in Chattanooga when it crashed into a tree around 3:30 in the afternoon Monday, officials said. According to an arrest affidavit, the bus was traveling on a \"narrow winding road\" when Walker lost control. The bus left the road, \"striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn,\" then ran into a telephone pole and a tree, according to the document. Hamilton County Sheriffs Office Johnthony Walker, 24, was being held on $20,000 bail after crashing the bus he was driving, killing five schoolchildren in Chattanooga Tennessee. Police said that Walker was arrested and that a warrant has been issued to remove the black box from the bus and review evidence on the bus's video cameras. Kelly said this morning the school would cooperate with the investigation. Walker has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. He is being held on a $20,000 bond. A preliminary court date has been set for Nov. 29. It was unclear whether he has a lawyer or if he had entered a plea. Kelly called Monday \"one of the worst days we have had\" in the school community. Carina Noble, a spokeswoman for the bus operator, said in a statement, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the students and families who are affected.\" \"Because this is an active investigation, we are unable to answer any questions at this time as we work with authorities,\" she added.

Bruce Garner/AP Updated Tuesday morning at 7:20 a.m. ET At least five children died after a school bus carrying them home from elementary school crashed Monday afternoon in Chattanooga, Tenn. About two dozen other children were injured, several critically. Six children remain in intensive care, the school announced at a press conference Tuesday morning. The driver, identified by police as 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, was arrested and charged with vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. Reporter Emily Siner of member station WPLN tells our Newscast unit: It's a terrible sight. The school bus was going around a curve on a winding, hilly road and ended up crashing into a tree and flipping on its side. Late into the evening, there was still debris everywhere as investigators examined the crash site. About 35 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, were on the bus. Reporter Edward Miller of member station WUTC reports for Newscast: [Walker] was driving children home from Woodmore Elementary. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate.Woodmore Elementary will remain open Tuesday and provide grief counselors. Article continues after sponsorship Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher said, \"The type of accident we're responding to today, a bus accident with multiple injuries to children, is every public safety professional's worst nightmare.\" Reuters, citing Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher, said speed appeared to have been a factor in the crash. The Associated Press reports that no other vehicles were involved in the accident. It took emergency responders nearly 2 hours to remove all the children from the vehicle, the wire service says. Here's more from the AP: \"Television stations reported that people lined up to donate blood and some donors were asked to make appointments for Tuesday. \"Kirk Kelly, interim superintendent for Hamilton County schools, said classes would be held Tuesday with counselors available for students and staff. \"Fletcher said the families of the children who died had been notified but police would not release their names because they were juveniles. \" 'Our hearts go out, as well as the hearts of all these people behind me, to the families, the neighborhood, the school ... for all the people involved in this, we assure you we are doing everything we can,' Fletcher said.\" ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist November 22 at 3:45 PM Follow @sulliview On Monday, some of the biggest names in TV news trooped into Trump Tower for an off-the-record meeting with the president-elect. It was an all-star cast. Not just on-air stars like Lester Holt, Wolf Blitzer and George Stephanopoulos, but their bosses were also summoned before the Potentate of Fifth Avenue. The meeting was a huge success \u2014 for Donald Trump. Soon after it broke up, a leak to the New York Post brought on a story about how thoroughly the president-elect had taken the attendees to task. With attribution to anonymous tipsters, the Post wrote: \u201cThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing-down. . . . Trump kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re in a room of liars, the deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong.\u2019 \u201d In light of President-elect Trump's meetings with media executives on Nov. 21 and the New York Times on Nov. 22, Washington Post media columnists Erik Wemple and Margaret Sullivan talk about the merit of off-the-record meetings and the role of the media in Trump's administration with Facebook Live host Libby Casey. (The Washington Post) Call it Woodshed Theater, with all the applause lines for the president-elect. Brandon Friedman, a Virginia-based public relations executive, offered his theory on Twitter: \u201cThey walked into an ambush, agreed not to talk about it, then Trump went straight to the Post with his version.\u201d Then it was just a hop, skip and jump to a big headline on the Drudge Report, with its huge worldwide traffic: \u201cTrump Slams Media Elite, Face to Face.\u201d As Business Insider politics editor Oliver Darcy aptly put it, that is \u201chow a lot of America will see this.\u201d The result for the president-elect: He once again was able to use the media as his favorite foil. Having a whipping boy is more important than ever now that the election is over and there is no Democratic opponent to malign at every turn. Yes, there\u2019s no proof that the Trump camp tipped the New York Post, but don\u2019t forget, this is someone who used to pose as his own spokesman to spread word of his romantic conquests. And the newspeople were largely unable to provide their own version of events because they had agreed to its being off the record. That\u2019s supposed to mean that nobody talks about it \u2014 a rule that was immediately broken (which also doesn\u2019t speak particularly well for them). Through anonymous leaks, participants agreed with some aspects of the \u201ctotal disaster\u201d and disagreed with others, but Trump benefited in the end. He got a lot of attention, he got to continue bashing the establishment elite, and he evidently put the TV people on notice that if they want access to him as president, they\u2019ll need to bow and scrape. Notably, Trump hasn\u2019t held a news conference since July. On Tuesday, shockingly, a new melodrama arose: Trump\u2019s planned meeting at the New York Times was canceled, then restored. The Times played it right. Despite a tweet attack from the president-elect, editors refused to go the off-the-record route with Trump, which was his preference, for obvious reasons \u2014 because he wanted again to control the story. With the exception of a brief off-the-record conversation between Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger and the president-elect, the meeting was fair game for news stories \u2014 as it should be. Off-the-record was a mistake for the TV people, and it would have been a mistake for the Times. The paper successfully called Trump\u2019s bluff. As much as he professes to despise the Times, he remains in some ways the Queens boy who lusted after Manhattan success and acceptance. In many ways, Trump can bypass the traditional press \u2014 using YouTube or Twitter to take his message to the world without pesky journalistic fact-checking or filtering. He has masterfully manipulated the media for the past 18 months \u2014 bullying reporters, garnering billions in free publicity and portraying journalists as part of the corporate structure that must be brought down so that the people can triumph. That\u2019s a deeply misleading and dangerous picture. In fact, U.S. citizens need an independent press more than ever. Journalists, and their corporate bosses, shouldn\u2019t allow themselves to be used as props in Trump\u2019s never-ending theater. For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan lifestyle ",

    "text": "Carson says Trump has offered him HUD secretary, other Cabinet posts Published               November 22, 2016 \u00a0 It appears the doctor is in. Former Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson told Fox News Tuesday that he had received \"offers\" to serve in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. Earlier Tuesday, Trump announced on Twitter that Carson is a leading contender to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Minutes after Carson left a meeting with Trump, the billionaire mogul tweeted: \u201cI am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I\u2019ve gotten to know him well\u2014he\u2019s a greatly talented person who loves people!\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 On Tuesday, Carson told Fox News' \"Your World with Neil Cavuto\" that the HUD position was \"one of the offers that is on the table.\" Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 \"Our inner cities are in terrible shape,\" Carson said. \"And they definitely need some real attention. There have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been done, so it certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine.\" On Sunday, Carson told \u201cFox Report Weekend\u201d he was open to accepting a spot on Trump\u2019s White House team. \u201cBasically, I\u2019ve said my preference is to be outside and to act as an adviser, but if after going through the process they all conclude it would be much better to have me in the Cabinet, I would have to give that very serious consideration,\u201d Carson said. The walk-back followed Carson friend and business manager Armstrong Williams\u2019 comments to The Hill on Nov. 15, during which he said Carson \u201cfeels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency. The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d Later that day, Carson tried in a Facebook post to tamp down the embarrassing statement, noting his decision not to seek a Cabinet post \u201chas nothing to do with the complexity of the job as is being reported by some news outlets.\u201d It\u2019s previously been reported that Carson could be considered for a variety of department secretary jobs, including Education, Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs. The HUD position is at first blush a surprising fit for Carson. However, Carson has previously shown an interest in the department. In June 2015, Carson criticized HUD for \u201coverreach\u201d for forcing the city of Dubuque, Iowa to weigh housing voucher applications from Chicago the same as it did applications from Dubuque residents. \u201cThis is just an example of what happens when we allow the government to infiltrate every part of our lives,\u201d said Carson , then a Republican presidential primary contender and an adversary of Trump. \u201cThis is what you see in communist countries, where they have so many regulations encircling every aspect of your life that if you don\u2019t agree with them, all they have to do is pull the noose.\u201d Carson also wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Times in July 2015 on HUD\u2019s policies to \u201cdesegregate\u201d housing. \u201cThere are reasonable ways to use housing policy to enhance the opportunities available to lower-income citizens,\u201d Carson wrote, \u201cbut based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 22, 2016 2:30 PM EST SOUTH BEND, Ind. --\u00a0The NCAA has ordered Notre Dame to vacate wins from the 2012-13 and 2013-14 football seasons in an academic misconduct case. In a news release on Tuesday, the NCAA said a Division I Committee on Infractions panel found that a former University of Notre Dame student athletic trainer violated the association\u2019s ethical conduct rules during two academic years.\u00a0 She, as well as two football student-athletes, \u201cengaged in academic misconduct\u201d when she completed coursework for the student-athletes, the NCAA said.\u00a0 \u201cThese student-athletes, in addition to a third football student-athlete, also committed academic misconduct individually,\u201d the association said. Notre Dame determined that the three student-athletes violated the university\u2019s policies on academic integrity, which resulted in them playing football while ineligible, the NCAA said. The association said the student athletic trainer also provided six other football student-athletes \u201cwith impermissible academic assistance\u201d in 18 classes.\u00a0 The NCAA \u00a0announced penalties prescribed by the panel. They include a vacation of all records that student-athletes participated in while ineligible during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 football seasons, as well as a $5,000 fine. Other penalties are: - Public reprimand and censure for Notre Dame. - A year of probation, starting from Tuesday through Nov. 21 next year. - A two-year show-cause order for the former student trainer, starting on Tuesday and running through November 21, 2018.\u00a0 - A disassociation of the former student trainer from Notre Dame\u2019s athletics program for two years, starting on Tuesday.\u00a0 Notre Dame announced in\u00a0 a statement that it will appeal the decision. \u201cThe NCAA has never before vacated the records of an institution that had no involvement in the underlying academic misconduct, and the membership has since voted to change the rule that brought this case within NCAA jurisdiction,\u201d the statement said. University President Rev. John Jenkins said that in past academic misconduct cases, the Committee on Infractions imposed a vacation of records penalty \u201conly when it has found serious institutional misconduct, such as actions with the direct involvement or knowledge of a coach or academic personnel, a failure to monitor or a lack of institutional control.\u201d \u201cThe NCAA enforcement staff and the hearing panel agreed with Notre Dame that no such institutional misconduct occurred in this case,\u201d he said in Notre Dame\u2019s online statement. Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly said he knew the vacated wins were a possibility since he and other Notre Dame officials met with the NCAA several months ago. He said he doesn\u2019t believe he has any culpability in the case and has no reason to believe he won\u2019t be back as Notre Dame\u2019s coach next season - at least not because of the academic misconduct penalty. \u201cI think you guys are confusing this statement with the win-loss record,\u201d said Kelly, who is in the midst of his worst season at Notre Dame with a 4-7 record ahead of Saturday\u2019s game at No. 12 USC. \u201cA win-loss record is always under scrutiny at Notre Dame, and it should be. That\u2019s part of it.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s NCAA report doesn\u2019t name the players involved, but it stems from an investigation that began in August two years ago, when the university suspended defensive lineman Ishaq Williams, receiver DaVaris Daniels, linebacker Kendall Moore and cornerback KeiVarae Russell, who weren\u2019t allowed to play that season. The school later benched safety Eilar Hardy, who was allowed to return in midseason. Russell returned and played for the Irish last season. Notre Dame finished its 2012 football season 12-1, and its 2013 season 9-4. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

American-English translation: Dude, we already have an ambassador. It's a breach of protocol at best (and unprecedented at worst) for an American president or president-elect to publicly call for a foreign nation to appoint a new ambassador. Kim Darroch assumed the role as ambassador in Washington just this year. Trump tweeted Monday night, \"Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!\" Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 Farage and Trump developed a relationship this summer, spurred by Trump's support for Britain to vote to leave the European Union \u2014 a controversial campaign for which Farage was a leading figure. On Nov. 12, Farage was the first British politician to meet with Trump after he won the election. It was a great honour to spend time with @realDonaldTrump . He was relaxed and full of good ideas. I'm confident he will be a good President. pic.twitter.com/kx8cGRHYPQ \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 12, 2016 The New York Times reported today that during their meeting, Trump asked Farage to oppose the offshore wind farms that could obstruct the pristine views from one of his two Scottish golf courses, raising questions, as the Times put it, about Trump's \"willingness to use the power of the presidency to advance his business interests.\" The Times also reported that in a meeting with its editors today, Trump, when asked about the Farage meeting and wind farms admitted , \"I might have brought it up.\" ",

It was a star-studded affair filled with luminaries from a broad range of fields spanning the arts, sports, philanthropy, education, science and mathematics. It was also an event filled with laughter. The president, who stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall, craned to place a medal around the neck of basketball legend, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is more than a foot taller than Obama. The president warned the gathering never to travel with award winning actor, Tom Hanks. \"You've got pirates, plane crashes, marooned in airport purgatory, volcanoes...something always happens with Tom Hanks,\" the president said. \"And yet somehow we can't resist going where he wants to take us.\" The medal, which has existed in some form since the Truman administration, has been given at Obama's discretion more than any other president, and according to the Washington Post , he has honored women and people of color at a rate higher than any of his predecessors. For example, this year's awardees includes Motown soul singer Diana Ross, TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, veteran actress Cicely Tyson, artist and designer Maya Lin.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda were awarded for their philanthropic foundation. Awarding former basketball champions Michael Jordan and Abdul-Jabbar seemed to speak to the president's affinity for the sport. \"We've got \u2026 renowned character actors, like the guy from 'Space Jam',\" Obama joked in a reference to Jordan's appearance in a film alongside Loony Tunes cartoon characters.

De Niro, an Oscar winner, once floated the idea that he would like to \"punch\" the real estate mogul.

President Obama reaches up to NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as he present shim with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, during a ceremony honoring 21 recipients, in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 22. SAUL LOEB / AFP - Getty Images Abdul-Jabbar, a HIllary Clinton supporter who made no bones about calling the election of Trump the result of race-fueled animosity , took a more demure tone with his statement on receiving the honor: \"Receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom would be an honor under any circumstances, but receiving it from President Obama, who has fought so tirelessly to bring about social justice for everyone, makes it that much sweeter,\" he wrote in a statement on his website . \"I'm especially proud to be sharing this award with some of the people who have influenced my life. This acknowledgment invigorates me to continue the battle until everyone shares the great bounty of opportunity that this country has to offer. I'm hoping it will inspire others to do the same.\" Obama's Medal of Freedom selections in the past reflect his progressive legacy.

The president said Tuesday that the honorees had all impacted him in a \"a very powerful, personal way\". \"These are folks who have helped make me who I am,\" Obama said gesturing at the gathering. \"This is what makes us the greatest nation on earth, not because of our differences but because in our differences we find something common to share.\" Adam Howard ",

The Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department set out to hire scores of deputies last year to lessen the burden on its staff and cut millions in overtime. It advertised for prospects, and included U.S. citizenship as a requirement. By this past spring, it had hired 200 deputies. The Justice Department did not congratulate the agency \u2013 instead, it slapped Colorado\u2019s largest sheriff\u2019s department with a $10,000 fine and a host of steps it must take to address what was described as discriminatory hiring. In a summary of the settlement on its website, the Justice Department said that in insisting on citizenship, the Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department violated an anti-discrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that forbids employers from hiring only U.S. citizens except in cases where it is mandated \u201cby law, regulation, executive order or government contract.\u201d The Justice Department said that the opportunity to work for the department should be open to anyone with the necessary skills who is authorized to be employed in the United States. That could be a legal permanent resident who has not naturalized, for example, or someone on a temporary visa who has a work permit. In a statement, the Denver agency said it would abide by the ruling. \u201cThe Denver Sheriff Department maintains its commitment to treat all people with dignity and respect, and is proud to have one of the most diverse workplaces in Colorado,\u201d said Denver Sheriff's Department spokesman Simon Crittle. \u201cWhile we didn\u2019t commit this violation intentionally, we accept responsibility and are taking steps to clarify policy and amend language in hiring documents,\u201d he added. Many police departments around the country with positions they say are difficult to fill have sought to cast a wider net for job prospects by considering legal immigrants as well as others who have work permits. Chicago and Hawaii police departments accept job applicants who have a work permit, according to USA Today. The fine against the Denver agency was the target of criticism on social media, including on the Facebook page of the group \u201cBlue Lives Matter.\u201d Critics said that law enforcement agencies at local, state and federal levels routinely make citizenship a requirement of those they employ, and that the nature of the job should always make it a condition. Many government jobs are open to non-citizens who are in the country legally, such as legal permanent residents, commonly known as green card holders. Some law enforcement agencies hire non-U.S. citizens, and require them to obtain citizenship within a specific time frame. Denver would have been within its rights to require citizenship if a local or state public agency allowed it. On its website, the Justice Department commended the Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department for being cooperative and agreeing to take steps to address the hiring controversy. \u201cWe commend the Denver Sheriff Department for its cooperation and commitment to removing unnecessary and unlawful employment barriers,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. \u201cEliminating this unlawful citizenship requirement will help ensure that the Denver Sheriff Department hires the best and most qualified individuals to protect and serve. The entire community will benefit from these reforms.\u201d Beyond the fine, the sheriff\u2019s department must review applicants who were disqualified because they lacked citizenship and consider them for future openings if they meet other criteria. Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told FoxNews.com that hiring people who are not permanent residents and have temporary visas does not seem feasible. \u201cThey\u2019re making a long term investment, paying for training, for someone who might be ineligible to work in a few years,\u201d Mehlman said of the police departments. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told USA Today last year that while he supports the idea of opening up hiring at police departments to non-citizens who are in the U.S. legally, he worried about security risks of police officers who have only work permits. \"We're handing over a gun and a badge to somebody whose background we don't really know a lot about,\" Krikorian said. \u00a0 Elizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a city council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday Nov. 16, 2016. Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a city council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday Nov. 16, 2016. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel is racing the clock in President Barack Obama 's final days in office to secure $1.1 billion in federal grants to revamp the CTA 's Red and Purple lines, an effort that involves creating a special taxing district that straddles the \"L\" tracks between North and Devon avenues. The new tax increment financing district would raise about $850 million for the project between next year and 2033, city and CTA officials said Tuesday during a City Council Finance Committee meeting. The committee is scheduled to vote on the plan next week. If approved, the plan goes to the full council next Wednesday. And if the council gives its OK, the city would have just enough time to send notice to Washington, D.C., and meet deadlines for approval of the grants before President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inaugural, city officials said. Ald. Patrick O'Connor, 40th, said Emanuel was in Washington \"about 10 days ago \u2026 discussing this matter and working towards trying to help move the financing mechanism along.\" All but about $28 million of the $850 million in TIF money would be used to pay off the principal and interest on a $622 million low-interest federal loan that the CTA hopes to secure. That loan, plus $428 million that the CTA plans to borrow through a bond issue, would be used to match the $1.1 billion in federal grants. The entire package would provide more than $2.1 billion in funding for the extensive project, which involves reconstructing century-old tracks and bridges between Lawrence and Bryn Mawr avenues and creating a controversial \"flyover\" \u2014 a bypass that would run Brown Line tracks above the Red and Purple line tracks where they intersect north of the Belmont Avenue station. CTA is under a tight deadline to get the City Council to approve a new tax increment financing district to help pay for a Red-Purple Line renovation project before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. The CTA and city officials say they are not concerned about Trump's political philosophy,... The CTA is under a tight deadline to get the City Council to approve a new tax increment financing district to help pay for a Red-Purple Line renovation project before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. The CTA and city officials say they are not concerned about Trump's political philosophy,... (Mary Wisniewski) TIF districts have been around for decades and now pepper the city. They're intended to spur economic development in blighted areas or other locations where it has been determined that without TIF funding, development would not take place. Critics say the city has not always hewed to those guidelines and has instead used the districts as slush funds for pet projects. In a traditional TIF district, the property values used to determine real estate tax collections by Chicago Public Schools, city, county and other taxing agencies are frozen for up to 23 years. As property values rise, the difference between those frozen levels and the actual values \u2014 the increment \u2014 generates tax revenue that's put into a fund to pay for projects and programs designed to spur development and job creation. But the type of TIF that would be created for the CTA work is new to Illinois, after being authorized by the state last summer, and is structured differently. CPS continues to collect taxes based on actual property values in the TIF. The property values for the other taxing agencies are frozen, but those agencies get 20 percent of the additional taxes resulting from higher actual property values. And, instead of lasting for 23 years, the so-called transit TIFs last for 35. The Red-Purple Line modernization project would refurbish stations, bridges and track along a century-old corridor between Lawrence and Bryn Mawr avenues on the Red Line.\u00a0Complaints about a proposed flyover north of the Belmont station\u00a0are not expected to stop it. The TIF boundaries would extend a half-mile on either side of the \"L\" tracks but would exclude areas already in existing TIF districts. Other transit TIFs could be proposed in the future, as the state legislation allows for such districts along 46 miles of \"L\" tracks and within a half-mile of the center Union Station. ",

    "text": "Americans Who Live Near Border Say Trump's Wall Is Unwelcome By frank bajak, associated press LOS EBANOS, Texas \u0097 Nov 22, 2016, 11:13 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, photo, a bird rests on a section of 18-foot high border fence in Brownsville, Texas. The idea of a concrete wall spanning the entire 1,954-mile southwest frontier collides head-on with multiple realities, like a looping Rio Grande, fierce local resistance, and cost. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) 0 Shares Email Forget Donald Trump's Great Wall. The people who live in the bustling, fertile Rio Grande Valley, where the U.S. border meets the Gulf of Mexico , think a \"virtual wall\" of surveillance technology makes a lot more sense. It's already in wide use and expanding. Erecting a 40-foot concrete barrier across the entire 1,954-mile frontier with Mexico, as Trump promised during the presidential campaign, collides head-on with multiple realities: geology, fierce local resistance and the question of who pays the bill. People cackled at Trump's idea that Mexico would willingly deliver the billions required. Mexican officials say they won't. So few locals were surprised when the president-elect seemed to soften his position five days after the election, saying the wall could include some fencing. \"The wall is not going to stop anyone,\" Jorge Garcia said. Garcia expected to lose access to most of his 30-acre riverside ranch after the U.S. Border Fence Act was enacted a decade ago under President George W. Bush. Garcia is still waiting to see if the Border Patrol will put a fence or wall on the sliver of land it surveyed and promised to pay $8,300 for. Under the law, 652 miles of border barrier were built, mostly in Arizona. The 110 miles of fences and fortified levees that went up in Texas are broken lines, some as much as a mile and a half from the river. The Garcias believe they and the rest of Los Ebanos' villagers were spared because the erosion-prone clay soil is simply too unstable. Geology conspires against wall-building up and down the Rio Grande Valley. Its accomplices are a boundary water treaty with Mexico and endangered-species laws. Catwalks and tunnels had to be built into border barriers to accommodate ocelots and jaguarundi, two species of wild cat. The plentiful breaks in the border barrier, meanwhile, include an entire flank of the River Bend golf club and resort in Brownsville \u2014 \"gaps of privilege\" for the well-connected, according to one critic. Other landowners fought the Border Patrol in court. \"The wall might make mid-America feel safer, but for those of us that live on the border, it's not making us feel any safer when we know that people can go over it, around it, under it and through it,\" said Monica Weisberg-Stewart, security expert for the Texas Border Coalition, a consortium of regional leaders. A poll conducted in Southwest border cities in May found 72 percent of residents opposed to a wall. The Cronkite News-Univision-Dallas Morning News poll had margin of error of 2.6 percentage points. Local politicians have found inventive ways to make wall-building palatable. A 20-mile stretch in Hidalgo County consisted of a fortified levee topped with a fence. In 2010, that levee held back flooding. The cost was about $10 million a mile, though. In the Nov. 8 election, only three Texas border counties \u2014 all sparsely populated \u2014 went for Trump. The rest are solidly Democratic and back President Obama's more lenient immigration policies. The U.S. side of the border is quite safe, Weisberg-Stewart said. \"We are not in a war zone.\" In fact, cross-border trade has been booming. In 2014, more than $246 billion worth of goods and 3.7 million trucks crossed the Texas-Mexico border, according to the coalition. While much of the border's Mexican side has been afflicted by drug cartel-related violence, crime in the Rio Grande Valley, home to 1.3 million people, has been consistently lower than other Texas cities. The Border Patrol's buildup after 9/11 is one reason, argues a former chief, David Aguilar. Since 2004, the year he was named to the job, the number of agents on the southwest border has climbed from 9,500 to more than 17,500. Meanwhile, the number of border apprehensions is down from a peak of 1.6 million in 2000 to 409,000 in the year ending in September. Nearly half were caught in the Rio Grande Valley. The Great Recession that began in 2008 made the U.S. less attractive to Mexican migrants, and Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands now account for more than half the arrivals. Many migrants In the Rio Grande Valley turn themselves in at border bridges. After processing, released migrants are given court dates in destination cities where relatives typically await. Others are sent to detention centers for further interviews about their asylum claims. The Border Patrol nevertheless credits surveillance technology for curbing illegal entries, including tower-mounted surveillance cameras, motion sensors and laser pointers. Since 2013, the agency has also had five blimp-like aerostats that float from 1,000 to 5,000 feet above the valley on tethers and are equipped with remote-controlled cameras. High-flying Predator drones are additional eyes in the sky, patrolling vast areas of southwest borderlands since 2011. At a community center in McAllen, Texas, a 21-year-old Guatemalan who is eight months' pregnant was bound for Kansas after turning herself in. Ingrid Guerra said she was fleeing an abusive relationship. The father of her other child, a 2-year-old who stayed behind with Guerra's mother, was killed in a drunken brawl, she said. \"Back there,\" Guerra said of Guatemala , \"they kill at the drop of a hat.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Frank Bajak on Twitter: https://twitter.com/fbajak . 0 Shares ",

Wayne Wilansky said during a press conference outside a Minneapolis hospital that his 21-year-old daughter Sophia was wounded in a concussion grenade blast that \u201cblew the bone out of her arm.\u201d Police have denied using concussion grenades amid the protests. Concussion grenades are non-lethal\u00a0devices that produce a blinding flash of light and loud sound. Sophia Wilansky is facing dozens of surgeries over several months, but there\u2019s little guarantee her arm can be saved, her father said. \u201cI told her that I did a little bit of an interview with a few reporters, and she said please go and tell them it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about the indigenous peoples,\u201d Wayne Wilansky said. \u201cEven though she\u2019s lying there with her arm just about blown off, she\u2019s not doing this for herself.\u201d Wayne Wilansky said his daughter traveled to North Dakota from New York City, where she lives, three weeks ago, and had planned to stay through the winter. The clash occurred late Sunday as protesters trying to push past a long-blocked bridge on a state highway were turned back by authorities using tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses. The Standing Rock Sioux and others oppose the 1,200-mile, four-state pipeline being built to carry oil from western North Dakota to a shipping point in Illinois because they say it threatens drinking water on their nearby reservation and cultural sites. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners has said no sites have been disturbed and that the $3.8 billion pipeline will be safe.\u00a0 At a separate press conference in North Dakota on Tuesday, Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said officers did not use any devices capable of damaging an arm that bad. Kirchmeier said officers reported that there was an explosion in the area, but said they only used pepper spray and water hoses. A spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s department suggested to the Los Angeles Times that Sophia Wilansky may have been injured by protesters \u201crigging up their own explosives,\u201d though no one was arrested or charged with making or deploying explosives. Wayne Wilansky criticized the allegation that protesters used explosives during the press conference Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, the doctors removed shrapnel from her arm,\u201d Wayne Wilansky said. \u201cThere is evidence that our own government is throwing explosives at the protesters.\u201d Wayne Wilansky did not indicate whether his daughter would pursue specific legal action against North Dakota officials, but did say the \u201cshrapnel\u201d had been saved as evidence. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Nov 22 2016, 2:51 pm ET North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory Files for Recount as Challenger's Lead Grows by Emma Margolin advertisement North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has formally requested a statewide recount of votes in his close race with Democratic challenger Roy Cooper, as pressure mounts on the incumbent Republican to concede two weeks after the election. McCrory finished fewer than 10,000 votes behind Cooper, the state's attorney general, allowing McCrory the opportunity to ask for a recount under North Carolina law. Yet Cooper's lead has only grown since Election Day, jumping from fewer than 5,000 votes to 6,222 as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the State Board of Elections website. (Cooper's campaign says their lead is actually larger, coming in at 8,569 votes as of Tuesday afternoon.) In response to Governor Pat McCrory\u2019s request for a recount, Cooper for NC campaign manager Trey Nix released the following statement: pic.twitter.com/l0cnZDqYRK \u2014 Roy Cooper (@RoyCooperNC) November 22, 2016 McCrory has repeatedly raised concerns of voter fraud, filing complaints in about half of the state's 100 counties. Yet no evidence of widespread fraud has surfaced so far. Furthermore, many of McCrory's own Republican appointees serving on local county election boards have rejected his complaints. In a statement Tuesday, McCrory's campaign manager doubled down on their concerns about the legitimacy of the state's elections results. \"With many outstanding votes yet to be counted for the first time, legal challenges, ballot protests and voter fraud allegations, we must keep open the ability to allow the established recount process to ensure every legal vote is counted properly,\" said Russell Peck, McCrory's campaign manager. The press release added that the formal recount will not occur until county boards of election finish tallying the results \u2014 a process that has been slowed due to factors including Republican-led challenges. Critics see McCrory's effort as a stall tactic, one intended to undermine the results of the election and potentially cause the state's Republican-controlled General Assembly to step in and settle the race in McCrory's favor.

Christine Gregoire won by 129 votes. With such a wide lead for Cooper, Jensen said, the legislature would likely be reluctant to hand over the election to McCrory \u2014 especially when its Republican supermajority could simply override any veto from a Democratic governor. \"There's no way that throwing out the results of a gubernatorial election are going to be popular in a court of public opinion,\" Jensen said. \"They don't need a Republican governor, so why risk the backlash?\" Furthermore, election experts say a victory for McCrory via the state's General Assembly would almost certainly be challenged in federal court, presenting yet another uphill climb for the Republican incumbent. Related: North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory Calls LGBT Criticism 'Political Theater' In a blog post , election law expert and University of California-Irvine professor Richard Hasen wrote that the North Carolina legislature could be looking at both a Due Process and Equal Protection Clause violation if they overturned the election results without any substantial evidence of voter fraud. \"There are cases where federal courts have gotten involved in these kinds of ugly election disputes (think Roe v. Alabama, Bush v. Gore),\" said Hasen. \"But a brazen power grab without a plausible basis for overturning the results of a democratically conducted election? I expect the federal courts would take a very close look at such a thing.\" Still, McCrory and his supporters refuse to give up. On Monday, the head of the conservative group Civitas Institute filed a lawsuit arguing North Carolina officials can't finish tallying the votes in the governor's race until they verify the residency of thousands of voters who used same-day registration \u2014 which is legal in the state after a federal appeals court struck down parts of a restrictive voting law earlier this year. Critics, meanwhile, are intensifying their calls for McCrory to walk away. On Monday, the Raleigh News and Observer editorial board published a piece entitled, \"For McCrory, failed vote challenges show it's time to concede.\" And on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that about two dozen protesters stood outside the entrance of a building hosting the State Board of Elections' hearing on contested ballots. \"I say, not as a Democrat but as a political scientist, that it's entirely appropriate to condemn McCrory's actions,\" Steve Greene, political science professor at NC State University, told NBC News. \"This is not how we do things here.\" Emma Margolin ",

The school's statement offers more details on the cheating that led to the censure: \"The penalty was based on misconduct by a former student who participated in the University's student trainer program. She wrote papers for student-athletes, which was obviously unauthorized academic assistance. The University discovered the academic misconduct in 2014, and then addressed that misconduct through its honor code process. ... \"The University immediately suspended the involved student-athletes from all athletic activities. At the conclusion of its honor code process, the University dismissed four student-athletes and imposed retroactive grade changes in the affected courses.\" Article continues after sponsorship The NCAA says the former student trainer \"completed coursework for [two] student-athletes\" and that she \"provided impermissible academic assistance to six additional football student-athletes in a total of 18 classes.\" While the Fighting Irish argued that they had demonstrated \"exemplary cooperation\" by quickly intervening, the NCAA was not impressed. Academic Foul: Some Colleges Accused Of Helping Athletes Cheat \"While the panel commends the institution for acting swiftly and decisively ... removing student-athletes from competition is required conduct for member institutions,\" the decision-making panel wrote . While Notre Dame might have met its requirements, the panel decided, the university didn't go above the call of duty in a way that would justify waiving the penalty. In the 2012-13 season, Notre Dame went on a 12-0 run but ended \"with a blowout loss to the Crimson Tide in the national championship game,\" the AP notes. The team went 9-4 in the 2013-14 season. ",

Despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the \u201cfailing New York Times,\u201d Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution, which he called \u201ca great, great American jewel, world jewel.\u201d He did, however, say he believed The Times had been too tough on him during the campaign. Pressed to respond to criticism in other areas, he was defiant. He declared that \u201cthe law\u2019s totally on my side\u201d when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws. \u201cThe president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d he said. He said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings. He said that he would \u201clike to do something\u201d and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government. He noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children, which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. He insisted that he could still invite business partners into the White House for grip-and-grin photographs. He said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do, including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses. \u201cIf it were up to some people,\u201d he said, \u201cI would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again.\u201d Mr. Trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with Nigel Farage, the U.K. Independence Party leader, to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms . Mr. Trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. \u201cI might have brought it up,\u201d Mr. Trump said, then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest. Mr. Trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in a White House job. But he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make Mr. Kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the Middle East.

Nancy Armour , USA TODAY Sports 3:46 p.m. EST November 22, 2016 x Share NCAA ruled a student-trainer committed academic misconduct for two football players and provided six other players with impermissible academic extra benefits. USA TODAY Sports Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly's years just got worse after NCAA violations were announced Tuesday. (Photo: Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports) The\u00a0poor results on the field \u2014\u00a0the seven-loss debacle of a season \u2014\u00a0are nothing compared with the embarrassment and shame Brian Kelly just brought on Notre Dame. Kelly refused to accept any responsibility Tuesday for NCAA violations that resulted in the Irish being stripped of 21 victories from the 2012 and 2013 seasons. The 12-1 record in 2012 that included a trip to the BCS title game, easily the high point of Kelly\u2019s contentious tenure, is now vanished. And right along with it Notre Dame\u2019s moral high ground. Notre Dame must vacate football wins after academic violations by trainer Notre Dame has always prided itself on being different, a cut above the college athletics world that, let\u2019s be frank, sometimes looks more like a cesspool. It only recruited players of the highest quality, their character as sterling as their talent. Its coaches were the role models for doing things the right way, refusing to compromise their ethics for a couple of extra wins. Turns out, Notre Dame\u2019s principles are every bit as malleable as the Miamis, the Auburns and all those other schools it\u2019s looked down upon over the years. It\u2019s true that Kelly did not have any direct involvement in the violations. The NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions found that a student-trainer had violated NCAA rules by committing academic misconduct for two football players and providing six others with impermissible extra academic benefits. \u201cIt was student-on-student cheating,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis matter has nothing to do with me and my status here.\u201d Wrong. As head coach, it is Kelly's job to know everything that\u2019s going on with his team, the good and the bad. Maybe Kelly wouldn\u2019t have first-hand knowledge. But when a team is this high profile, on a campus as insulated as Notre Dame\u2019s, it\u2019s implausible to think people didn\u2019t know about the shadiness. If he or his assistants didn\u2019t hear the whispers and the rumors, it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t want to. Misery Index Week 10: Exasperated in East Lansing If you want to take credit when the going is good, then you\u2019d better be prepared to accept the blame when things go wrong, too. And that, even more than his team\u2019s woeful record, will be Kelly\u2019s undoing. He\u2019s had no problem throwing others under the bus when things have gone wrong \u2013 you could make a YouTube video of his sideline tantrums alone \u2013 and had the audacity to preach about the need for accountability when he disciplined six players who were arrested before the season. \u201cYou want them to enjoy their time here, but they've got to make good decisions,\u201d Kelly said in a radio interview after the August arrests. \u201cAnd then if they don't, hold them accountable for it, and we certainly have done that.\" Yet Kelly has shown time and again that his standards don\u2019t apply to him. When a video tower collapsed in October 2010, killing a Notre Dame student who was taping practice, Kelly defended his decision to practice outdoors that day by saying conditions \u201cwere not unlike many days that I had practiced.\u201d I lived in South Bend for 3\u00bd years and I can say with total certitude that winds gusting up to 53 mph\u00a0are not typical. When Lizzy Seeberg committed suicide in September 2010 after accusing linebacker Prince Shembo of sexual assault, Kelly was one of several university administrators who tried to sweep it under the rug. Compared to those two incidents, the NCAA violations are minor. But it fits the pattern: Nothing is ever Brian Kelly\u2019s fault. The role of a college coach is twofold: Win games and try to set a good example for the young men he\u2019s molding. In both cases, Brian Kelly is failing miserably.

    "text": "Amid Holiday Fears and Increased Security, NY Man in Terror Arrest By Brian Ross Nov 22, 2016, 7:22 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Yemeni Man Arrested in New York, Charged with Attempting ISIS Support 0 Shares Email With preparations underway for heavy security around this year\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, a man residing in Brooklyn, New York was arrested on Monday and charged with attempting to provide material support to the so-called Islamic State after he expressed support for a terror plot in Times Square. The arrest comes as authorities send a clear message to would-be perpetrators to not even think about attacking this year\u2019s Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade by stepping-up public security, after ISIS propaganda used a photo of the annual event in calling on supporters to attack large outdoor gatherings. That message lauded the July attack on Nice, France, in which 84 people were killed after an attacker ploughed a semi-truck through crowds attending a Bastille Day celebration. While the Department of Homeland Security said last week that it knows of \u201cno intelligence that is both specific and credible at this time of a plot by terrorist organizations to attack the homeland,\u201d authorities are not taking any risks with the parade. \u201cI think this year you are going to see a lot more blocker cars and sand trucks on the cross streets,\u201d NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe will have additional counter terrorism overlay,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see the people out there with the long guns also.\u201d David Handschuh/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images Handlers maneuver the new Snoopy balloon through Times Square during the 80th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Nov. 23, 2006. The commissioner\u2019s words come mere hours after federal authorities arrested 37-year-old Mohamed Rafik Naji, a citizen of Yemen , who was a legal permanent resident in United States and was residing in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. According to court documents, Naji, who is a legal permanent resident in the United States, allegedly travelled to Turkey and onward to Yemen in March 2015 where he made repeated attempts to join ISIS before returning to New York six months later. Naji, according to the criminal complaint, began expressing his support for the terror group in 2014 and continued up until the present through public postings on Facebook accounts and in conversations with a law enforcement source. In a recorded conversation on July 19 of this year with the law enforcement source, he allegedly said: \u201cif there is a truck, I mean a garbage truck and one drives it there to Times-Square and crushes them shshshshshsh...Times-Square day.\u201d Naji is being held without bail. He has not entered a plea. A request for comment sent to his lawyer was not immediately returned. \u201cThis was a disruption arrest, this was an arrest to disrupt a potential attack, given that this individual was following ISIS direction to carry out an attack against a large crowd,\u201d explained Matt Olsen, an ABC News contributor and the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Law enforcement officials were quick to explain the significance of Monday\u2019s arrest. \u201cAs we alleged in our complaint today, Naji has shown continued support to ISIL, beginning in 2014 with social media posts and ultimately traveling to Yemen in March 2015 where he claimed his allegiance to ISIL stating, \u2018I belong to Islamic state only,\u2019\u201d said FBI Assistant Director in Charge William Sweeney in a statement. \u201cHe continued to express support for ISIL and violent jihad upon his return in the U.S. months later.\u201d ISIL-Yemen, which was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department in May of this year, is among several factions waging war in Yemen. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Some store managers and assistant managers are among those expected to be newly eligible for overtime pay under a rule that a court temporarily blocked on Tuesday. (Photo: Tim  A. Parker, for USA TODAY) A federal judge on Tuesday blocked a new rule making millions more Americans eligible for overtime pay, indefinitely pushing back the Dec.\u00a01 effective date while he weighs a challenge to the requirement. The decision by U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant in the Eastern District of Texas to grant a preliminary injunction affects an estimated 4.2 million workers who were to be newly eligible for time-and-a-half wages for each hour they put in beyond 40 a week. The rule, released by the Labor Department in May, would nearly double the threshold at which executive, administrative and professional employees are exempt from overtime to $47,476 from $23,660. Millions more Americans to be eligible for overtime pay Twenty-one states challenged the overtime expansion, arguing that Congress never intended to set any salary threshold for the exemptions or to allow the threshold to be raised every three years, as the Labor Department\u2019s rule specifies. \u201cThis is a victory for small business owners and should give them some breathing room until the case can be properly adjudicated,\u201d said Juanita Duggan, CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business, which is separately challenging the requirement. Small business and other trade groups have argued the overtime rule would swell\u00a0labor costs and force employers to demote managers to hourly employees, hurting morale, among other hassles. Small businesses seek delay of overtime rule But Christine Owens, head of the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group, said, \u201cUnfortunately, for the time being, workers will continue to work longer hours for less pay thanks to this obstructionist litigation.\" Labor Department officials and worker advocacy groups said the rule would help ensure managers and administrative employees are fairly paid for the extra hours they log and narrow a growing divide between wealthy and low- to middle income households. In recent months, thousands of restaurants, retailers and other businesses have reshuffled their staffs to accommodate the regulation. Some raised employee salaries to the new threshold to avoid the overtime costs. Others were expected to convert salaried employees to hourly workers, in some cases cutting their base pay to offset the overtime expense. 1306 CONNECT TWEET 41 LINKEDIN 179 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gidg0X ",

Evanston Public Library Director Karen Danczak Lyons is pictured Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, holding books that were found to have been defaced, with vulgar language and swastikas written in them. (Genevieve Bookwalter / Pioneer Press) Genevieve Bookwalter Contact Reporter Pioneer Press Evanston police are investigating a report of defaced copies of the Quran and other books about the Quran at Evanston Public Library, officials said Tuesday. On Monday, librarians discovered swastikas, homophobic slurs and other offensive graffiti defacing the books as staff prepared for a program that evening focusing on the Muslim holy book. The graffiti appeared to be done in dark pencil and included references to the Muslim Prophet Muhammad with a gay slur and included terms describing the Quran as a book filled with lies and hate, among other graffiti. Librarians discovered the graffiti in seven books around 6 p.m. Monday when they were setting up for the evening's program about the Quran, said Evanston Public Library director Karen Danczak Lyons. \"We will prosecute. If we catch you, we will prosecute,\" Lyons said Tuesday.

Evanston Police Cmdr. Joseph Dugan said his department is investigating the situation, but the time element could pose a challenge. The book most recently checked out was due back over the summer, both Lyons and Dugan said. Others were last checked out in 2014 and 2015. \"The big problem we face now is a time frame,\" Dugan said. Detectives will check library cameras to see if a suspect was caught on video, among other avenues of investigation, he said. Charges could include criminal damage to property and possibly felony hate crime, depending on the motive of a suspect, Dugan said. Those would be decided if and when a suspect is identified, he said, and felony charges would be determined by the Cook County State's Attorney's office. Monday night's program was held in partnership with Northwestern University's Middle East and North African Studies Program as part of the library's MENA Mondays series, Lyons said. About 80 people attended Monday's program, titled \"Is the Quran a 'good' book?\" ",

    "text": "By Larry Light MoneyWatch November 22, 2016, 3:47 PM Donald Trump can get a tax break for his Trump U settlement Email Last Updated Nov 22, 2016 5:30 PM EST Donald Trump can deduct almost all of the $25 million settlement with former students of his defunct Trump University, settling class-action fraud lawsuits against the president-elect over the controversial real estate course. The reason he can write off the money is that it is \u201can expense in the ordinary course of doing business,\u201d said Robert Willens, a New York-based tax consultant. Of the settlement payout, $24 million is earmarked for Trump University students, and another $1 million is a fine. It\u2019s doubtful he could take the fine off his taxes, Willens said. Trump University agreed to a $25 million settlement in a class-action fraud lawsuit - despite that Trump earlier said he would never settle. CBS ... New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the\u00a0 $25 million total settlement on Friday. As Trump hustles to put together his new administration, he agreed to settle three civil actions seeking repayment for up to 7,000 students -- two lawsuits in California and Schneiderman\u2019s in New York. Many of the students will get back at least half their money, lawyers in the settlement said. Some students paid as much as $35,000 to take the Trump-branded instruction. An administrator, selected by New York\u2019s attorney general, will allocate the proceeds to the ex-students, with those who shelled out the most presumably getting more.\u00a0 Trump University, which operated from 2004 to 2010, was meant to give attendees the secrets of Trump\u2019s real estate investing success. But these students complained it was a useless waste of money. The developer responded that many former students thought it was valuable, and launched a website featuring their testimonials.\u00a0 In fraud case settlements that involve a government body, sometimes there is an agreement that a portion will not be deductible. That happened with a $13 billion settlement involving JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) over its sale of rickety mortgage-backed securities, said San Francisco tax attorney Robert W. Wood. Only $2 billion of that was not deductible, he said. \u201cPeople can get outraged over cases that are especially bad\u201d where the plaintiff gets a tax break, Wood noted. A request for comment from Trump\u2019s transition team went unanswered. Trump has pledged not to use his charitable organization, the Trump Foundation, to pay for the Trump University settlement, as it has for at least two other legal actions.\u00a0 That means he will pay to settle from his own pocket or that of his privately owned business, the Trump Organization. The money also could come from a liability insurance policy, although it\u2019s unknown whether he has one in place. If so, then he could not claim the $24 million as a deduction. Lawyers consulted on the subject, though, doubted that he would carry a policy for that much.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

The incident took place in a residence around 4 a.m. in the Center City area, when a package containing some kind of medication exploded, injuring a 62-year-old man, Philadelphia police said. Police say the victim suffered injuries to both hands and his chest and was in stable condition at Jefferson Hospital. The man's roommate told police the package exploded after it was opened and noted that the injured man often received packages of inhalers delivered by mail. Police said there was not significant structural damage to the man's residence. Bomb squad units, U.S. postal inspectors and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents arrived on the scene to investigate. This is a breaking news story.

Pat McCrory is not waiting to see whether his Democratic opponent\u2019s current lead in the governor\u2019s race will hold to demand a recount. McCrory\u2019s campaign said it has filed for the recount in the race against Democrat Roy Cooper, even though votes are still being tallied. McCrory\u2019s campaign made the announcement Tuesday in a news release, reports CBS Raleigh affiliate WNCN reports . \u201cWith many outstanding votes yet to be counted for the first time, legal challenges, ballot protests and voter fraud allegations, we must keep open the ability to allow the established recount process to ensure every legal vote is counted properly,\u201d said Russell Peck, McCrory\u2019s campaign manager. Then-N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper speaks during a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., Wednesday, April 11, 2007.\u00a0 Close AP Photo/Chuck Burton Most counties have yet to complete their counts. McCrory\u2019s campaign acknowledged the recount won\u2019t happen until counties finish those tallies, but they wanted to ensure they didn\u2019t miss a deadline under state law. In response to McCrory\u2019s challenge, the Cooper campaign said: \u201cThis is nothing but a last-ditch effort from Governor McCrory to delay and deny the results of this election...We are confident that a recount will do nothing to change the fact that Roy Cooper has won this election.\u201d Counties were originally supposed to finish their counts by Friday. Recount requests must normally be filed by the second business day after those county reviews. The counting process has been slowed by factors including Republican-led challenges. The trailing candidate is entitled to a recount if he\u2019s behind by fewer than 10,000 votes. Cooper led by more than 6,000 votes Tuesday afternoon. A conservative group filed a lawsuit saying the state can\u2019t finish tallying its close governor\u2019s race until it verifies the residency of thousands of voters who used same-day registration. The head of the Civitas Institute is asking a federal court to require that the state Board of Elections refrain from certifying election results until it has completed verification of same-day registrants. North Carolina law allows people to register and cast a ballot on the same day during the early voting period by offering proof of their address. The lawsuit says North Carolina law requires election officials to check the residency of same-day registrants by sending them mail and seeing if it comes back returned. Since state elections board guidelines indicate that 30 days should be allowed for the mailing process, the lawsuit says the overall tallying of votes can\u2019t be finished before December 7. About two dozen protesters gathered Tuesday outside the entrance of a building hosting the latest State Board of Elections hearing on contested ballots. The hearing started promptly at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Although the board said it would not hear comments from the public during Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the conference room was filled with spectators listening to the testimony. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

But who the hell are they? Video provided by Newsy Newslook Even without counting Michigan, whose 16 electoral votes probably will be awarded to Donald Trump, the GOP nominee has more than a majority of Electoral College votes. (Photo: USA TODAY) Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this report had fewer states with laws governing electors. To supporters of Hillary Clinton, the number looks intoxicating: 155 electors in states where the popular vote went for Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 some by slim margins\u00a0\u2014 who apparently aren't legally bound to vote for the GOP presidential nominee when the Electoral College meets Dec. 19. Solicit them like lobbyists schmooze members of Congress, right? Persuade just a portion, and you've got the first woman president, winner of the popular vote, certified by a constitutional authority. She's got 232 in the bag. She would need 38 \"faithless electors\" to win this game. Tennessee's Electoral College members 'harassed' by anti-Trump emails That's the problem with this particular political fantasy. Though electors in several states report that they're getting thousands of emails, letters and even telephone calls to ask them to switch their votes, they're among the Republican Party's most loyal members. \"I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump,\" said Jim Skaggs of Bowling Green, Ky., one of that state's eight electors,\u00a0who\u00a0added that\u00a0he really doesn't like Trump. \"It's not a law, I don't think. ... But I think it\u2019s a duty.\" \u201cI fully intend to vote for Donald Trump. It's not a law, I don't think. ... But I think it\u2019s a duty.\u201d Jim Skaggs, Bowling Green, Ky. He's right. Kentucky is one of 28 states, according to the Congressional Research Service \u00a0and additional USA TODAY research, that don't mandate their electors to vote for the winner of their state's popular vote. The Constitution and federal law are silent on the matter. More than 4.5 million supporters have signed a Change.org petition advocating electors' change of heart, but the desire is little more than a pipe dream, election experts said. Two Democratic electors in Colorado and Washington state, where Clinton won the electoral votes and electors are obligated under state law to vote for her,\u00a0have launched their own movement that they've dubbed \"Moral Electors\" to achieve the same result\u00a0\u2014 or more likely throw the decision to the House of Representatives as happened in 1824. \u201cThis is a long shot. It\u2019s a Hail Mary,\u201d P. Bret\u00a0Chiafalo of Everett, Wash., told Politico . \u201cHowever, I do see situations where \u2014 when we\u2019ve already had two or three (Republican) electors state publicly they didn\u2019t want to vote for Trump. How many of them have real issues with Donald Trump in private?\u201d Where Chiafalo sees a Hail Mary play, some Trump electors consider the drama more as harassment. \"Hillary's got a great campaign going,\" said Sharon Geise, an elector from Mesa, Ariz., who estimates 8,000 emails have flooded her inbox. \"It's the same thing, pretty much. Basically: Vote for Hillary Clinton. It's bizarre. I don't dare answer my phone.\" ",

    "text": "Nov 22 2016, 6:12 pm ET Is Your Kid's School Bus Driver Running Red Lights? by Scott Friedman and Eva Parks Share advertisement Investigations by NBC-owned stations across the country have found school bus drivers running red lights in four of the nation's largest school districts \u2014 districts that serve more than 2 million kids. In New York City, WNBC found drivers at several bus companies had accumulated more than 6,000 speeding and red light violations in just two years. In Miami and nearby Broward County, WTVJ found hundreds of school bus drivers racked up traffic tickets while driving school buses but continued to drive \u2014 one even on a suspended license. And just last month in Texas, an investigation by KXAS revealed that school bus drivers in the Dallas metro area had racked up nearly 500 tickets in a two-and-a-half-year span, and found traffic camera videos that showed buses racing through red lights. Watch Scott Friedman on Nightly News with Lester Holt for More In some cases bus drivers were even caught on camera running past other school buses that had their stop arms extended for loading or unloading students. An NBC News investigation of traffic violations led Dallas County Schools to suspend more than 200 drivers. KXAS \"We expect our school bus drivers to perform at a higher standard honestly than the rest of drivers driving in public,\" said Deborah Hersman, head of the National Safety Council, which offers driver training programs. \"They are charged with carrying our most precious cargo \u2014 our children.\" Click Here for the KXAS Investigative Series About Dallas County Schools Hersman, a former board member and chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said school bus company managers need to tackle traffic tickets and unsafe driving immediately \u2014 and re-train employees. Said Hersman, \"If there's dangerous driving behavior out there, if there's bad habits that are out there they need to be addressed. And it needs to be done quickly. Sometimes it might mean discipline in very severe situations.\" KXAS found that Dallas County Schools, an agency that provides services in 12 area school districts, had never disciplined any of the drivers caught on video running red lights. Instead, the agency spent $80,000 of taxpayer money to pay the tickets. The drivers walked away with no punishment, until KXAS contacted the school board. Dallas County Schools told KXAS that 13 school bus drivers have been fired and 229 drivers will be suspended without pay for five to nine days as a result of the investigation \u2014 about 10 percent of the agency's drivers. \"It is inexcusable of a bus driver to ever do that. They know better,\" said Dallas County Schools' Board President Larry Duncan. He said two senior managers have also been demoted because of failure to follow procedures and lack of oversight. \"You found a problem. We owned it and we fixed it. We are taking the steps necessary \u2014 both systemic and personnel \u2014 so that this will not and cannot happen again,\" said Duncan. On Monday, a single-vehicle school bus crash in Chattanooga, Tennessee, killed five children and injured more than 30 others. Bus driver Johnthony Walker, 24, was arrested on five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving, Chattanooga police said late Monday. An arrest report said Walker was driving \"well above\" the 30 mph speed limit. Experts note, however, that school buses are still the safest way for kids to get to school. Despite Monday's tragedy, even in crashes kids are rarely hurt badly \u2014 often because school buses are so big. Scott Friedman ",

John Minchillo/AP hide caption toggle caption John Minchillo/AP Former University of Cincinnati police Officer Ray Tensing shot and killed unarmed black motorist Sam DuBose during a routine traffic stop in July 2015. John Minchillo/AP Former University of Cincinnati police Officer Ray Tensing will go on trial again over the fatal shooting of black driver Sam DuBose during a traffic stop last year. As we've reported , Tensing's first trial ended in a mistrial earlier this month after jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on murder and manslaughter charges. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters told reporters Tuesday he is again pursuing a murder conviction and will request that the new trial be moved to a different venue. Tana Weingartner of member station WVXU reports that Deters wants the new trial to begin by next spring. She adds: \"Deters says he firmly believes former University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing committed murder when he shot and killed Sam DuBose during a 2015 traffic stop. He plans to retry Tensing for murder and voluntary manslaughter, and he'll ask to move the trial elsewhere in Ohio.\" Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Deters hinted that the reason he was seeking a venue change was because of the intense scrutiny the original case received. Article continues after sponsorship \"It is our belief that the public attention that has been focused on the Tensing case could have in fact seeped into the jury room. And we're going to try to alleviate that by moving the trial,\" Deters said. Deters said he decided to seek a new trial after reviewing transcripts and conducting interviews with jurors. He said jurors initially were split 10-2 on the involuntary manslaughter charge, and three or four jurors favored a conviction on the murder charge. \"That helps me make my decision,\" he said. Deters said he expects to meet with county Judge Megan E. Shanahan next week to discuss logistics. Tensing stopped DuBose because of a missing front license plate. After a brief interaction, Tensing shot him at point-blank range, as we're reported. Here's more background on the case: \" Body-cam footage of the shooting created an uproar after it showed that Tensing, who is white, engaged in a brief struggle with DuBose before firing his pistol into the car. Seconds before, the two had been discussing whether DuBose had a license, and whether he should take off his seatbelt.\" Correction Nov. 22, 2016 ",

The driver, identified by authorities as 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, taunted students from Woodmore Elementary School by \"slamming on brakes on purpose, making all the kids hit their heads,\" Jasmine Mateen told local NBC affiliate WRCB. She said she reminded school officials that she'd complained about Walker when they called her Tuesday. \"I've been calling y'all since August,\" Mateen said she told them. \"I said, 'Now y'all doing what y'all supposed to been doing now that it's too late ... Y'all doing what y'all supposed to be doing, but my baby laying in a cold freezer.'\" Johnthony Walker, 24, is booked after being charged in a bus accident that killed five children and injured more than 20 others. Hamilton County Sheriff's Office Mateen said one of her daughters died in the crash, and two of her kids were seriously hurt.

She said she also wrote a letter to the driver, which the principal read aloud to him as she and several children watched. \"He said, 'So? I'd do it again,'\" Mateen recalled.

Among the possible evidence will be footage from on-board video cameras, along with a data recorder, NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said. On board were 37 students ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade. Just before 3:30 p.m. ET, Walker appeared to lose control on a curvy road about a mile from school, authorities said. The bus was not equipped with seat belts, Hart said. The bus swerved off the right side of the road before smacking into an elevated driveway and mailbox, a police report said. The vehicle then careened to the left and hit a utility pole, ending up on its side against a tree. Rescue officials work at the scene of a school bus crash involving several fatalities in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Nov. 21. Chattanooga Fire Dept via Reuters Witnesses told police the driver appeared to be going faster than the posted 30 mph speed limit, which authorities said was lower on bends in the road. Walker has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving, authorities said. It took emergency crews more than two hours to extract the students off the bus. Doctors and nurses described a scene of confusion at the Children's Hospital at Erlanger, with dozens of injured students arriving in their matching school uniforms, without parents, many in shock or otherwise unable to share key information. Asked what their parents' names were, some simply said, \"Mama,\" Darvey Koller, a pediatric emergency room physician, said in a news conference. Six children remained hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday, and another six were in stable condition, Koller said. Another 19 were treated and released, he said. Jon Schuppe ",

By Elise Viebeck November 22 at 1:06 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Ben Carson, left, and Mike Pence at a campaign event in King of Prussia, Pa., on Nov. 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Ben Carson just can\u2019t seem to escape the Trump vortex. The former Republican presidential candidate is under consideration to become President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development, Trump tweeted midday Tuesday. I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well\u2013he's a greatly talented person who loves people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 This is a surprise, given comments last week from Carson adviser Armstrong Williams that effectively took the retired neurosurgeon out of the running for a Cabinet position. \u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience. He\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Williams told the Hill in an interview. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d Remember, this refers to a former candidate for president. Carson, who met with Trump on Tuesday in New York, was once said to be in the running for secretary of\u00a0health and human services. (He came to prominence in part because of his criticism of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, which Trump has vowed to repeal.) Some reports said he was being considered for education secretary. \u201cWe have had offers, yes,\u201d Carson told Neil Cavuto of Fox News in an interview Tuesday. \u201cI would say [HUD] was one of the offers that\u2019s on the table,\u201d Carson said. . . . \u201cOur inner cities are in terrible shape, and they definitely need some real attention. You know, there have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been done, so it certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine, and I\u2019ll be thinking and praying about it seriously over the holiday.\u201d As head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Carson would enforce federal fair-housing laws and oversee U.S. housing policy and community development programs. Bob Woodson, the founder and president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, is seen as another candidate for the position. Both men are African American. The Trump transition is focused on building a \u201cbroad and diverse\u201d Cabinet, spokesman Jason Miller said Monday . powerpost ",

Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times For Deaf Tennis Player, Sound Is No Barrier Lee Duck-hee, 18, of South Korea, is ranked 143rd in the world in a sport in which hearing the ball is considered crucial. By BEN ROTHENBERG Continue reading the main story ASAN, South Korea \u2014 To improve its chances in the boys\u2019 team tennis event at the National Sports Festival here, Mapo High School in Seoul brought in a ringer from Jecheon, two hours southeast of the capital. His name was Lee Duck-hee, and he had first caught the coach\u2019s eye when he was in elementary school. Mapo High\u2019s players pressed against the fence beside along the dusty hardcourts and chanted in support while Lee, 18, crushed forehand winners past his bespectacled opponent in the final. The 6-1, 6-1 win took little time \u2014 no surprise, as Lee is the best teenage player in South Korea, and a professional ranked 143rd in the world. \u201cSeeing the level of skill, power and returning is totally different than high school level,\u201d said Jeong Yeong-sok, his doubles partner at the tournament. Lee is exceptional among professionals, too. He is deaf, and no deaf player in the sport\u2019s history has reached these heights. In tennis, simply seeing the ball is believed to be insufficient. Hearing the ball, top players say, enables faster reactions \u2014 a crucial advantage in a sport where powerful serves and groundstrokes mean that every tiny fraction of a second matters. Continue reading the main story \u201cThere are so many different spins in tennis, and I can hear a lot of them coming off someone\u2019s racket because I know what they all sound like,\u201d said Katie Mancebo, a college tennis coach and volunteer coach for the United States deaf tennis team. \u201cBut a deaf player doesn\u2019t know that sound, so they have to focus more on what the other person is doing, how they\u2019re making contact, and what the ball looks like as it\u2019s coming over the net.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Joo Hyun-sang, the tennis coach at Mapo High School, said he was skeptical of Lee\u2019s potential at first. \u201cWhen I met him the first time, I had certain doubts that being deaf would prevent him from being a great player,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I grew confident from watching him develop and improve. I was very confident he could do it.\u201d Though already the second-highest-ranked player of professionals 18 and under, Lee has not fully broken through. He has yet to play a main-draw match at an ATP tournament or a Grand Slam, though he reached the final of a Challenger event, the level below the ATP World Tour, for the first time in September in Taiwan, and has made two semifinals since. Photo Lee, at practice, is ranked 143rd in the world. Although he has yet to play a main-draw match at an ATP tournament or a Grand Slam, he has reached the final of a Challenger event. Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times But if he continues to rise, Lee will debunk much of what is understood about the intricacies of tennis. A Quicker Reaction Studies have shown that humans react more quickly to an auditory stimulus than a visual one. According to research compiled by the National Institutes of Health last year, the mean reaction time to visual stimuli is 180-200 milliseconds, and 140-160 milliseconds for auditory stimuli. At Wimbledon in 2003, Andy Roddick said that his first reaction to an opponent\u2019s shots comes from his hearing, as does his initial information about the shot coming toward him. \u201cYou can hear how hard someone hits a ball,\u201d Roddick said. \u201cIf they hit it hard and flat, it really makes a popping sound. That\u2019s maybe one of the first things that tells you rather than actually seeing the ball. Like trying the drop shot, all of a sudden, I hear it not come off the racket. It\u2019s part of the reaction process. I think you need to hear the ball pretty clearly to play at your highest level.\u201d Todd Perry, an Australian former doubles player who works as a coach, said that he often listens to his players\u2019 shots to hear how strokes can be improved. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201dWhile coaching, you can hear the clean hit off the racket, and you can change things to make sure you get the clean hit off the racket, which is all just through sound,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you watch different people, the sound from different players is quite different if you put your focus in on that.\u201d In his seminal 1974 book \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis,\u201d W. Timothy Gallwey preached attentiveness to the sounds of the sport, describing the feedback loop created by close attention to the sounds of one\u2019s own strokes to replicate the \u201ccrack\u201d of a successful shot. \u201cI learned how effective the remembering of certain sounds can be as a cue for the built-in computer within our brains,\u201d Gallwey wrote. \u201cWhile one listens to the sounds of his forehand, he can hold in his memory the sound that results from solid contact; as a result, the body will tend to repeat the elements of behavior which produced that sound.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Lee and his mother, Park Mi-ja. She taught him to speak and to read lips, and she committed to help him build a career in tennis. Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times Martina Navratilova has been one of the most strident proclaimers of the importance of sound to her tennis. She has called excessive grunting \u201ccheating\u201d because she thinks it unfairly disguises the sound the ball is making off the racket. At the 1993 United Open, she blamed planes overhead for interfering with her play. \u201cYou really depend on hearing the ball being hit, particularly when you are at the net,\u201d Navratilova said. \u201cYou first hear the ball. Then you react to the speed and spin according to the sound. And when you can\u2019t hear it, it really throws you off. I did miss some volleys there because I didn\u2019t hear the ball.\u201d Andy Murray also struggled with cacophonous conditions at this year\u2019s United States Open , when rain pounded down on the newly built roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium. \u201cWe use our ears when we play; it\u2019s not just the eyes,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt helps us pick up the speed of the ball, the spin that\u2019s on the ball, how hard someone\u2019s hitting it. \u201cIf we played with our ears covered or with headphones on, it would be a big advantage if your opponent wasn\u2019t wearing them. It\u2019s tricky, you know? You can still do it, but it\u2019s harder, for sure.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Murray\u2019s hypothetical example was once put to the test. Tobias Burz, a deaf player who now serves as the technical director for tennis at the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf, recounted an experiment he once conducted with a higher-ranked hearing opponent. After winning their first set, 6-2, his opponent was curious what it was like to be a deaf player, and used earplugs and wore headphones for their next set. Burz won, 6-3. A Surprising Diagnosis Park Mi-ja and her husband, Lee Sang-jin, could tell that their infant son was different, but they were reluctant to learn what his condition might be. Lee Duck-hee had been born while his father completed his compulsory service in the South Korean military, leaving Park alone with her young son. She hoped that whatever was affecting her son would pass. Park took Duck-hee to a hospital in Seoul for testing when he was 2. \u201cThe doctor just said, \u2018This baby cannot hear anything, he\u2019s deaf,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was very surprised, and I couldn\u2019t react. But I knew I couldn\u2019t go home right away.\u201d Photo On Lee\u2019s tennis bag, a keychain made by a fan features the South Korean flag and Lee\u2019s initials. Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times Park went to visit her sister, who lived in Seoul, and there she broke down. \u201cFrom the moment I saw her, all the grief and sadness came and I couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she said. After a few hours, she composed herself and called her husband. He drove from Jecheon to Seoul to pick her up. During that ride home, they made the decision not to wallow. \u201cWe started discussing how not to be sad, but instead how we can support and raise Duck-hee,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s our first son. The sadness period was only about a week, and then we were brave enough to move on to the next step, which was researching disability education.\u201d When Duck-hee was 4, his parents enrolled him in a school for the disabled in Chungju, an hour away from home. While most students lived in the dormitory there, seeing their families only on weekends, Park was determined to have more time with her first son, and so she drove him the hour to and from school each day. Wanting him to adapt into the mainstream as well, she sent him to a regular school in the afternoons. \u201cI wanted him to be integrated with normal people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I saw older students at the deaf school, they only knew sign language, so when they took the bus, they had to communicate with the bus driver by writing something down. And when they become 18, 19 years old, the chances for getting a job are very limited to a person who only speaks sign language.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Having observed lessons at the deaf school, Park began to teach her son to speak and read lips herself after he finished at the standard school, using picture cards of various mouth positions. After a few years, Duck-hee left the school for the deaf completely; as per his parents\u2019 wishes, he never learned sign language. \u201cOnly a few percent of the deaf students can be socialized with normal people, making their own money to live,\u201d Park said. \u201cMost of them, they give up and go back to live with their parents, and the parents have to take care of them. We just wanted Duck-hee to be independent and live as a normal person.\u201d Subscribe to the Times Lee Sang-jin had set a record in the 200-meter dash when he competed at the National Sports Festival as a high school student, and saw sports as the best path for his son. He believed his son\u2019s deafness would make a sport that required communication with teammates an impossibility, so he focused on individual sports like golf, archery and shooting. But when Duck-hee went to watch a cousin, Woo Chung-hyo, play tennis, his mind was made up. Continue reading the main story Photo At this year\u2019s United States Open, Andy Murray struggled with the noise of the rain pelting the roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Credit Santiago Mejia/The New York Times \u201dI got really interested in watching tennis, and I said, \u2018Oh, why can\u2019t I play?\u2019\u201d Lee Duck-hee said. \u201cMy cousin gave me the racket, I tried some strokes, and I liked it. I was really attracted to tennis; I just liked swinging the racket.\u201d His parents committed fully, too, placing high stakes on Lee\u2019s nascent tennis career. \u201cIt was not like a hobby or for fun; we were really serious,\u201d Park said. \u201cWhen his father and I had our first meeting with his first coach, we told him that we\u2019re not here just for fun: we\u2019re making his career and a future path. So, please, take these lessons seriously. If he has no chance and no potential, we won\u2019t continue.\u201d Lee remained based in his family\u2019s apartment in Jecheon, where his mother works as a hairdresser and his father as a reporter, but his tennis began to gain notice nationwide. Even as Lee\u2019s wins piled up through each successive age bracket, many parents and coaches remained doubtful. \u201cNinety percent of the coaching staff and parents and family of other players, they always said Duck-hee cannot reach a professional level,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey always said that this is elementary school level and the ball speed is really slow, so he can do it. But when he reaches professional level the ball speed will be really fast, so he cannot react, because he cannot hear.\u201d She added: \u201cWe tried not to hear this kind of criticism. Me and my husband, we tried to give him something he can do for his life as a human being. And we didn\u2019t have anything other than tennis.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Collegiate Success Though no deaf players have achieved professional success comparable to Lee\u2019s, there have been a handful of deaf and hard-of-hearing tennis players who have excelled at the collegiate level in the United States. Paige Stringer, who founded the Global Foundation for Children with Hearing Loss, played for the University of Washington, where she had a doubles partner who was also deaf. She hypothesized that deaf players\u2019 disadvantage in not being able to hear their opponents hit the ball can be compensated for by increased visual acuity. Photo Lee looking at instant messages on a cellphone on his way home after winning a gold medal at the National Sports Festival. Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times \u201cPeople who were born deaf or hard of hearing may have a stronger sense of intuition in general, and tend to see subtle clues in a person\u2019s face or body language better than people with normal hearing,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cThey are more visual, because when one sense is compromised, other senses are heightened to compensate. If my hypothesis is correct, people who are deaf or hard of hearing may have an advantage in tennis because they can pick up visual cues faster and better as to their opponent\u2019s plans, and may have better reflexes because they see things sooner.\u201d Hard-of-hearing players often learn most about how important hearing is to their tennis when they are forced to adapt to playing without the hearing aids or cochlear implants they rely on in daily life, which are not allowed at deaf-only competitions like the quadrennial Deaflympics . Having had the experience of playing both with and without sound makes these players uniquely qualified to comment on the role sound plays in their tennis. Evan Pinther, who played for Florida Gulf Coast University, cited the lack of feedback from his own strokes as his biggest cause of discomfort on court when he was restricted from using hearing amplifiers. \u201cMy anxiety level goes up without my hearing aids,\u201d Pinther said. \u201cI much prefer to play with my hearing aids because I can hear the ball so much better. I always loved hearing the ball explode off my strings when I hit it perfectly; it gave me confidence to hear that sound the ball makes when hit well.\u201d Emily Hangstefer, who played for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, also said the adjustment was frustrating. \u201cTraining for the Deaflympics, I realized I relied on hearing instead of watching or feeling the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me about five weeks to get in the habit of watching the ball instead of hearing it. Once my hearing was taken away, I had to rely on my other senses \u2014 touch and sight.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keen anticipation has become Lee\u2019s strength. Woo, his cousin and coach, said Lee could read what kind of shot his opponent will make by closely watching his backswing. Christopher Rungkat, a former opponent of Lee\u2019s, expressed awe at his anticipation. \u201cHe always seems to know where I am going to hit the ball,\u201d Rungkat told reporters last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is guessing; it is more like he is reading my mind.\u201d Photo Lee speaking to a South Korean television reporter after matches at the National Sports Festival. Formal interviews can be burdensome for him. Credit Jean Chung for The New York Times Striving to Be the Best Reaching a No. 1 world ranking is Lee\u2019s goal, but first he aspires to become the best player in South Korean history, which would mean passing the career high of Lee Hyung-taik, who reached No. 36 in 2007 and won one ATP singles title. Tennis lags behind sports like baseball and soccer in popularity in Asia, and South Korea does not currently host an ATP event. But with Lee Duck-hee and another talented young player, 104th-ranked Chung Hyeon, 20, the Korean Tennis Association hopes the two will be able to lift the country\u2019s Davis Cup team back into the World Group, from which it was relegated in 2008. Under new leadership, the association hopes that newly secured funding will help players like Lee and Chung, as well as develop juniors by paying for travel to warmer climates during winter months. Lee doesn\u2019t believe that his hearing impairment will hold him back \u2014 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he said \u2014 but he acknowledged that another physical disadvantage might: At 5 feet 9, he is a shrub amid the redwoods of professional men\u2019s tennis. In an era of increasingly physical competition, only one player in the ATP top 50 is as short as Lee, David Ferrer. Only six players are under 6 feet. Lee travels with Woo, who serves as a hitting partner and speaks limited English, as the two navigate their first laps on the circuit together. Woo said that although Lee might sometimes feel intimidated by being one of the youngest on tour, he keeps an unrelentingly positive attitude, and is comfortable socially interacting with other players. While Lee can compete without much issue on court, save for sometimes not noticing out or let calls, other tour regulations may prove challenging for a deaf player. All players are required to participate in news conferences after each match, if requested by the news media. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While he is effusive in nonverbal communications across linguistic boundaries, formal interviews can be burdensome for Lee because he must read an interpreter\u2019s lips, and his own speech is often not readily understood. When Lee was interviewed by a Korean television station after a match at the National Sports Festival, the station used subtitles. There can also be benefits to Lee\u2019s unique situation, however. \u201cOf course I do want my player to be treated as a normal player, but we have some opportunities and some advantages from being deaf, business-wise,\u201d Lee Dong-yeop, his agent, said. \u201cBecause no one has done this before.\u201d One of the first boosts came from Hyundai, the Korean car manufacturer, which began sponsoring Lee when he was 13 and recently renewed its support through 2020. In a statement, Hyundai said that it was \u201castonished and inspired by his relentless spirit to reach the top as a tennis player despite his handicap of being deaf,\u201d and that the company \u201cfelt the responsibility to give him support as a responsible company in the Korean society.\u201d Funding from Hyundai has given Lee a stable financial base which few developing players enjoy. His agent hopes that increased funds, both through prize money and additional sponsorships, might someday allow Lee to travel with a full-time manager and translator. \u201cMoney can solve that kind of problem,\u201d he said. Starting Monday, Lee will compete in a playoff in Zhuhai, China, held for Asian players for a regional wild card into the Australian Open. If he does not win that event, he would have another chance to reach his first Grand Slam main draw by winning three matches in the qualifying rounds in Melbourne. With continued success at the Challenger level, his ranking may steadily climb into the Top 100, which would allow him to enter main draws at Grand Slam events directly. Stringer said she believed that there was no reason deaf athletes should be less common in the elite levels of tennis than they are in the general population. \u201cTo reach the top of any sport is limited to a very select group of talented athletes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a percentages thing. The odds are that more people with normal hearing will be in the Top 150 than those with deafness. I bet Lee Duck-hee\u2019s success has to do with his athletic talents, personality, intelligence, work ethic, opportunities, and the support group he has around him; his deafness is less of a factor than those attributes.\u201d Correction: November 22, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a college player. He is Evan Pinther, not Stringer. ",

    "text": "Trump reverses course on Clinton, defends Bannon during New York Times meeting Published               November 22, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 When the \u201cnewspaper of record\u201d refused to go off-the-record, President-elect Donald Trump issued his first veto, canceling a planned Tuesday meeting with The New York Times -- though Trump quickly reversed course and rescheduled the sitdown. After Trump issued a series of tweets early Tuesday morning during which he called the Times a \"failing\" paper and cancelled the meeting, Trump and the Times appeared to reach some sort of d\u00e9tente by late morning, when Trump tweeted \"The meeting with the @nytimes is back on at 12:30 today. Look forward to it!\" Trump met with several Times reporters and columnists as well as the paper's top brass, touching on topics from climate change to whether he favored a further criminal investigation of his general election opponent, Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Trump had repeatedly said he would consider appointing a special prosecutor to look into alleged misdeeds of the Clinton Foundation and Clinton's use of a private email server. \"My inclination would be for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let's go forward. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum,\" Trump said, according to a series of tweets from a Times reporter who was in the room. Trump also discussed putting son-in-law, adviser and real estate developer Jared Kushner in charge of a hypothetical Middle East peace negotiation, and he defended embattled chief strategist Steve Bannon. Bannon has been under fire for days by those who claim he represents or encourages the so-called \"Alt-Right\" or \"White Nationalist\" movements. \"If I thought he was a racist or Alt-Right or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him,\" Trump said. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump clearly disavowed the \"Alt-Right\" movement on several occasions during the Times interview, which was preceeded by a brief off-the-record session. I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 \"It's not a group I want to energize,\" Trump said of the fringe groups. \"And if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why.\" Trump also said he believed \"there is some connectivity\" between humans and climate change and said he was keeping an \"open mind\" on the topic -- a stance that puts him at odds with many of the Republican voters who cast ballots for him just two weeks ago. TRUMP WON'T PURSUE CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON, AIDE SAYS The respectful interview marked a stark contrast from the earlier give-and-take during which Trump and the Times issued dueling statements \u2013 Trump on Twitter, the Times in an article \u2013 regarding who was to blame for the breakdown of the initial sitdown. It was the latest salvo in a war of words that\u2019s raged between the two titans since Trump declared his candidacy for president in June 2015. \u201cI cancelled today\u2019s meetings with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice,\u201d Trump tweeted at 6:16 a.m. He continued in another tweet: \u201cPerhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!\u201d Eileen Murphy, the senior vice president of corporate communications for the Times, said Trump\u2019s tweets were the newspaper\u2019s first indication that the meeting had been canceled. She also disputed Trump\u2019s version of events. \u201cWe did not change the ground rules at all and made no attempt to,\u201d Murphy said in a statement issued in an article on the company's website. \u201cThey tried to yesterday \u2014 asking for only a private meeting and no on-the-record segment, which we refused to agree to. In the end, we concluded with them that we would go back to the original plan of a small off-the-record session and a larger on-the-record session with reporters and columnists.\u201d The session with the Times followed a reportedly contentious \u2013 and totally off-the-record \u2013 Monday meeting with representatives and anchors of the major television networks. Fox was included in that meeting. It was also the first time Trump and a representative for the Times had spoken since a Sunday piece by the Times\u2019 public editor, Liz Spayd, excoriated the paper\u2019s coverage of the election.\u00a0 Spayd wrote \u00a0the paper had received one of the largest influx of letters to the editor since the 9/11 terror attacks. And readers were not complimentary of the Old Gray Lady. \u201cThe number of complaints coming into the public editor\u2019s office is five times the normal level, and the pace has only just recently tapered off,\u201d\u00a0 Spayd wrote . \u201c\u2026Many people are commenting on the election, but many are venting about The Times\u2019 coverage.\u201d Spayd did not reply to requests for comment from FoxNews.com on Monday or Tuesday. After he railed against the Times\u2019 allegedly changing the terms of Tuesday morning\u2019s meeting, Trump sent a tweet alluding to the public editor\u2019s article. \u201cThe failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that \u2013 but why announce?\u201d Trump tweeted. Ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with the paper, the Times also issued a blistering editorial on Tuesday, claiming a \u201ctide of racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia\u201d had \u201cswept the country since the election of Donald Trump, whose campaign stoked these views\u2026\u201d Fox News\u2019 Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.

    "text": "By Anthony Mirhaydari MoneyWatch November 22, 2016, 8:37 AM Stocks party like its 1999 even as risks mount Email U.S. equities kept their post-election party in full swing on Monday, pushing all three major stock market indexes to new record highs together for the first time since Dec. 31, 1999. Investors continue to view the incoming Trump administration and its plans for big tax cuts and spending increases as a huge tailwind for the economy. We\u2019re also in a period of seasonal strength for the stock market (the oft-mentioned \u201cSanta Claus\u201d rally). Helping the latest bull run was some positive moves in the energy market as OPEC inches toward finalizing a deal to freeze production. But the risks of chasing the rally from here are growing amid fundamental headwinds, looming interest rate hikes and evidence of narrow buying demand. Energy has benefited from optimism surrounding OPEC\u2019s ability to hammer out the details of the rough production agreement the cartel sketched out in Algiers in September. The Wall Street Journal cited comments from Iran\u2019s oil minister saying it was \u201chighly likely\u201d a final agreement would be reached at the upcoming Nov. meeting. Headlines out of the \u201ctechnical\u201d OPEC meeting in Vienna highlighted progress as well, and oil rallied in early New York trading on Tuesday by nearly 4 percent, to $47.48 per barrel. Moreover, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he sees no obstacles to a deal being reached and reiterated that if OPEC comes to an agreement, Russia (which isn\u2019t a cartel member) would freeze production as well. No surprise then that energy stocks led the way higher on Monday, up 2.2 percent as a group. While the upside progress in stocks overall is awesome to see, one wonders if some irrational exuberance is materializing. Breadth remains dangerously narrow despite energy\u2019s turnaround, with just 62 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 in uptrends vs. more than 75 percent in September and 80 percent back in April. Just 55 percent of NYSE issues are above their 50-day moving average vs. more than 80 percent in July. Eric Bush of Gavekal Capital noted that more than one in five developed market stocks and more than two in five emerging market stocks are in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from their high in the past 200 days.\u00a0 Looking at developed market stocks alone, the percentage in a bear market has doubled from 11 percent to 22 percent since late September. Also, the futures market is now nearly certain the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December -- something that could magnify the recent selling pressure in bonds and bond-like stocks. On Friday, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hit levels not seen since last November. Higher borrowing costs could cause the housing market, auto sales and consumer confidence to hit the brakes. This binary performance divergence has resulted in some aggressive fund movements as investors try to chase the winners. The latest Flow Show report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows that $28 billion has flowed into stocks (the largest inflow in two years), while $18 billion left bonds (the largest outflow in three-and-a-half years). This gap between stock inflows and bond outflows is the largest ever. Moreover, Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader noted that in some cases, the pile-on might not be supported by the fundamentals. For instance, financial stocks have rallied despite a tightening of financial conditions as interest rates rise. Again, the justification is that higher long-term interest rates are good for bank stocks because they widen banks\u2019 profit margins. But higher rates also tend to reduce the demand for mortgage and auto loans. Historically, financial stocks and financial conditions tend to move in unison. When they don\u2019t, such as back in 1992 and in 2015, bank stocks tend to correct to the downside.\u00a0 There is no other way to say it: The rally to new highs feels incredibly hollow and dangerous for investors looking to chase the move toward Dow 19,000 and beyond.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

The left-field Cabinet picks. The potential business conflicts of interest. Even, as of last weekend, \u00a0neo-Nazis saluting the incoming leader. This month's news landscape bears as much resemblance to a normal cycle as a sand dune does \u200eto an ice cream cone. But current events are where we\u2019d expect things to look different. More surprising is that entertainment has begun assuming new forms too. \u200e The Trump victory is so seismic that it falls onto a very short list of events that change the way we perceive nearly everything. That includes \u2014 and maybe especially applies to \u2014 our cinematic escapism. As this busy fall film season picks up, many of us, seeking either context for our modern world or a respite from it, are heading to movie theaters. We\u2019ll choose from a wide range of movies: Among them are the science-fiction piece \u201cArrival;\u201d the fact-based histories \u201cJackie,\u201d \u201cThe Founder\u201d and \u201cPatriots Day\u201d; the animated adventure \u201cMoana\u201d;\u00a0and the social dramas \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d and \u201cFences.\u201d All these films, which either have just opened or will come out by Christmas, are exactly the same as had Trump not won. No release plans have been shifted; no shots or scenes edited. \u200eAnd yet\u00a0all of them feel different. With the election, innocuous entertainment has become freighted with unintentional meaning. For the more than half the country that didn\u2019t vote for Trump, or for those concerned with the country\u2019s direction after they did, movies now come with added baggage, with new powers to induce chagrin and (in rarer cases) bursts of hope. 'Jackie' trailer \"Jackie\" follows First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, played by Natalie Portman, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. \"Jackie\" follows First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, played by Natalie Portman, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. See more videos Before his post-JFK assassination film played AFI Fest last week, \u201cJackie\u201d director Pablo Larrain stood up and, noting he was a South American outsider, said, \u201cThis is an invitation to [you Americans] think about where you were, and where you are now, and who will soon be in the White House.\u201d\u00a0Only the most politically oblivious wouldn\u2019t free-associate to the headlines while watching the film. When Jackie Kennedy bemoans some of the gauche types her late husband hung out with, for instance, I found myself unable to tune out inner chatter about the new Oval Office occupant\u00a0and thinking anew about how the office has changed. Like so many of the other movies, the \u201cJackie\u201d storyline opens up an unusual two-way street \u2014 it influences how we see films, and the films in turn inform how we return to see the world. But such touchstones don\u2019t need to come so literally. What the Trump election has done is taken more separate stories of race \u2014 the kind that might have seemed likely merely (\u201cmerely\u201d) an important social statement in the now suddenly distant #OscarsSoWhite moment of early 2016 \u00a0\u2014 and given them a third-rail charge. In \u201cFences,\u201d Denzel Washington \u2019s film based on August Wilson\u2019s 1950\u2019s-set Pulitzer winner, the people of color left behind practically become poster children for the challenges of many modern Americans. If the division-minded metaphor of the title didn\u2019t already bring home the message, its monologues do. 'Fences' trailer Denzel Washington directs and stars in \"Fences,\" which features Viola Davis and Jovan Adepo and is based on the play of the same name by August Wilson. Denzel Washington directs and stars in \"Fences,\" which features Viola Davis and Jovan Adepo and is based on the play of the same name by August Wilson. See more videos \u201cSome people build fences to keep people out,\u201d says lead character Troy (Washington) during one of the work\u2019s more powerful moments, \u201cand other people build fences to keep people in.\u201d\u00a0Before the Trump victory, with its fears of Muslim registries and Mexican deportations, we might have more comfortably looked at such talk as the stuff of period drama. But whatever distancing might have occurred before Nov. 8 is gone. Trump\u2019s election has, like a kind of in-multiplex time machine, suddenly made the past present Since he\u2019s been elected, Trump has taken to Twitter to chastise television (\u201cSNL\u201d) and live musicals (\u201cHamilton\u201d). Films, with their long gestation periods, have escaped his gaze. But if he got himself to a movie theater he might change his tune. At least\u00a0to a movie theater playing a certain film. \u201cThe Founder\u201d tells of Ray Kroc\u2019s mid-century maneuvering to steal the locally owned McDonald\u2019s out from under the sweet San Bernardino brothers who founded it. Directed by \u201cThe Blind Side\u201d director John Lee Hancock , it\u2019s a modest if intriguing piece of period Americana. At an earlier time it might have been seen as the relatively benign story of a battle between business interests. Trump is never mentioned, needless to say, as\u00a0most of the story takes place 60 years ago. Watching it this late November, though, I couldn\u2019t help seeing Trump\u2019s name blazing across it. Michael Keaton plays Kroc as a hustler with little knack for creativity, just a ruthless sense of competition. \u201cBusiness is war. It\u2019s dog-eat-dog, rat-eat-rat. If my rival was drowning I\u2019d bring over a hose and put it in his mouth. Would you?\u201d Kroc\u2019s main advantage is his innate understanding of the power of branding.\u00a0His only real addition to the business that has been built with the sweat of others are those eye-catching golden arches, a piece of iconography that loudly echoes the golden lettering atop Trump hotels.\u00a0\u00a0Kroc understood that marketing can make up for a lack of a good product, or any substance at all. Oh, and he\u2019s come up with, he says, \u201ca concept: winning.\u201d That the world can\u2019t be left at the movie theater door the way it did before the election is a notion that transcends the president-elect himself. Ang Lee\u2019s \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d\u00a0explores the divide between the soldiers who fight wars and the people back home who cheer them on \u2014 as crucial a class division as the proletariat-elite gulf that roiled this election. Witnessing this gap, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that Lee was on to something. I briefly felt invigorated by the importance of bridging these divisions. But it also left me more depressed by the doomed nature of the effort. Indeed, the feelings we\u2019ll be left with coming out of these movies are complex. Many, after all, do end on hopeful notes. Can these movies be a crutch, a floating raft in churning waters? Or will they drive home painful truths even harder? 'Arrival' trailer Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker star in \"Arrival.\" Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker star in \"Arrival.\" See more videos The truth is, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cArrival\u201d\u00a0may be one of the most telling examples. Its underlying message is about unity across gender, ethnic, national and linguistic barriers. Such trans-minded politics would seem like a necessary tonic at this moment. It should make us feel good. But that message can also can seem naively out of step with where we find ourselves. The idea of a feelgood movie of unity at a time of protests and hectoring Tweets from the president-elect seems discordant; far from healing wounds, it reminds us that they\u2019re there. \u201cMoana,\u201d with its hard-fought triumph by a young woman of color, follows a similar psycho-cultural trajectory. It seems to be\u00a0in part\u00a0a tale of comeuppance and redemption for a bullish braggart \u2014 just the movie we need right now, as composer Lin-Manuel Miranda has been saying on his press tour. But it\u2019s also a sad reminder of how far away we are from our ideals. Experiencing movies this way isn\u2019t new, of course. It\u2019s just rare. The closest analogue to this complex method of viewing might be the aftermath of Sept.\u00a011, 2001. After the attacks, every on-screen gesture, shot or plot point suddenly landed differently. Images of the World Trade Center caused gasps; movies with urban terrorism or in-flight violence  engaged our minds differently. Most of us tend to watch movies with just a few mental tracks playing \u2014 the plot, the real-life actors maybe a distraction or two from our personal lives. Yet 9/11 added another layer of noise. Vigilante-action movies suddenly seemed urgently needed or desperately problematic. Political thrillers became reminders of the importance of government or evidence of its futility. Trump\u2019s victory\u00a0too\u00a0gives us that track. It changes every moment, every overtone. And it does so in sometimes contradictory ways. Take \u201cThe Founder.\u201d Yes, it makes a Trump-like figure a devil. But it\u2019s also about how the working-class person has been beaten by a rigged system \u2014 a red-state rallying cry that feeds off the same frustrations that elected Trump in the first place. Incidentally, lest these Trumpian readings seem like just the over-active imaginings of people whose nerves have been fried by cable news (I\u2019ll admit to being one), know that filmmakers have been thinking about this too. They\u2019re worried about how to treat these open wounds\u00a0or, in some cases, if they\u2019re wielding a hammer when they should be using a\u00a0 feather. Speaking at a screening of his new movie, \u201cLive by Night\u201d\u00a0\u2014 a gangster story about people inside and outside of a white Protestant power structure \u2014 director-star Ben Affleck said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would turn out to feel so current. But now all of the sudden it sort of does, with the notions of immigration and race, and you have the Klan and the ideas of inclusion.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI thought it would feel distant,\u201d he continued, \u201cand now all of the sudden it feels so current that I almost wish I could dial it back.\u201d Even the more removed world of Hollywood development is being filtered through Trumpian glass. Speaking of a new planned adaptation of the Robert Heinlein fascism-as-patriotism-tinged novel \u201cStarship Troopers,\u201d the original\u2019s director, Paul Verhoeven, lamented how it would play: \u201cYou feel that going back to the novel would fit very much in a Trump presidency.\u201d But then, such sentiments ignore the fact that nearly half the country voted for the real-estate mogul; what makes me and many others uncomfortable might make them enlivened. That\u2019s a lesson I kept reminding myself as I watched this crop of fall movies. 'Patriots Day' trailer \"Patriots Day\" is an account of the Boston Marathon bombing. \"Patriots Day\" is an account of the Boston Marathon bombing. See more videos This is true especially for \u201cPatriots Day,\u201d\u00a0about the Boston Marathon bombing. Ostensibly wrapping itself in the cloak of Boston Strong, Peter Berg\u2019s movie is underneath it all a fetishization of police officers. I stirred uncomfortably through parts of the film at its AFI premiere last week, watching a movie that should have been primarily about victims (and was at its most powerful when it was) too often become a kind of cinematic embodiment of Trump\u2019s \u201claw-and-order candidate\u201d\u00a0campaign pitch. After it ended, some of the real-life officers it was based on faced the audience and spoke. \u00a0Watertown Police Sgt. Jeff Pugliese said that \u201cwe can beat these people.\u201d Another officer said the message was \u201cif you hit us, we\u2019re going to hit you back.\u201d Will the movie catch on in Trump\u2019s America? I suspect it will. Could it also make some people who, like me, worry about the erosion of civil rights and the ascendancy of a militarized police force\u00a0more convinced that dark days lie ahead? I suspect it will do that\u00a0too. One of the film\u2019s most potent moments came during the interrogation of Katherine Russell, the widow of bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev and a person who, to this day, has never been charged. \u201cI have rights,\u201d\u00a0Russell, clad in a hijab and openly proclaiming her Muslim affiliation, said to her interrogator. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got ...\u201d\u00a0the interrogator growled back\u00a0to a huge roar of cheers in the theater. It\u2019s rare that a line about the trampling of an American citizen\u2019s constitutional protections garners enthusiastic applause. But these are rare times. \u200eOne day, this will all be processed. And art \u2014 as it always does, as it certainly must \u2014 will emerge and even flourish. When the fear and ambiguity of that post-9/11 moment subsided, when it was all processed by the national psyche and Hollywood machine, we ended up with \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d\u00a0and \u201cHomeland\u201d\u00a0and countless other powerful works. The unrest and uncertainty of the 1960s, it\u2019s worth remembering, yielded the great anti-establishment cinema of the 1970s. One day. For now, we watch movies through a Trumpian lens. We see a worrying future, clouded by the present, perceiving in films as much our own fears as the entertainment that\u2019s on the screen.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 22, 2016 6:21 PM EST Hosting his last Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony Tuesday at the White House, President Barack Obama described this year\u2019s class as \u201cparticularly impressive,\u201d citing the diversity and variety of talent exhibited throughout the 21 recipients. \u201cWe\u2019ve got innovators and artists, public servants, rabble rousers, athletes, renowned character actors, like the guy from Space Jam,\u201d President Obama said of Michael Jordan to a laughing crowd. \u201cWe pay tribute to those distinguished individuals with our nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u201d The awards recognize especially meritorious contributions to the security or U.S. interests, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors. \u201cEverybody on this stage has touched me in a very powerful, personal way, in ways that they probably couldn\u2019t imagine,\u201d Obama said in the East Room of the White House. Medal of Freedom recipients The president then went on to list the distinguished accomplishments of the honorees, striking a noticeable sense of candor and joviality. He highlighted the irony of a young Maya Lin, whose \u201cB+\u201d college design project would become the blueprint for the Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial on the National Mall. Criticism swarmed Lin, then 21-years-old, when it was revealed that the largely unpopular design belonged to a female Asian American. In an interview with CBS News\u2019 Jan Crawford, Lin said it was the array of her experiences that helped shape her into a pioneer of architecture and design. \u201cWe have to really urge that we accept people of all races, creeds and gender,\u201d she said. \u201cI think [the medal recipients] all helped contribute in some way to building this America we live in, but also how diverse we are.\u201d One recipient, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, had to wait outside the White House for a little while -- she forgot her ID. They haven't let me in to the White House yet because I forgot my ID. #NotJoking #PresidentialMedalOfFreedom pic.twitter.com/sHocwqChKV \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) November 22, 2016 But she eventually made it in -- apparently in time for the Medal of Freedom recipients\u2019 mannequin challenge. A video posted by Tracee Ellis Ross (@traceeellisross) on Nov 22, 2016 at 11:44am PST There were two basketball players on the list -- one, his hometown star Michael Jordan, and the other Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. \u201cHere\u2019s how great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was,\u201d the president declared. \u201cNineteen-sixty-seven. He had spent a year dominating college basketball. The NCAA bans \u2018the dunk\u2019. They didn\u2019t say it was about Kareem, but it was about Kareem. When a sport changes its rules to make it harder just for you, you are really good.\u201d Abdul-Jabbar told CBS News that it was his racial and religious identity, not his athleticism, that played a prominent role in his life. His greatest inspiration came from great American athletes who encountered similar obstacles and fought for what they believed in--names like Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali. \u201cThey stood up to give more in-depth meaning to the statement that all men are created equal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a complete understanding of that yet, so we have more work to do.\u201d President Obama, according to the Washington Post, has awarded more Presidential Medals of Freedom more than any other American president--nearly 114. Among other 2016 recipients included Robert De Niro, architect Frank Gehry, scientist Margaret Hamilton, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d creator Lorne Michaels, Robert Redford, the first chairman of the FCC, Newt Minow, Bill and Melinda Gates, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen, inventor Richard Garwin, and Vin Scully.

    "text": "Katherine Skiba Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune For the last time before he leaves office, President Barack Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Tuesday to a glittering assembly of Silicon Valley, Hollywood, sports and rock stars. Among the honorees were Michael Jordan and Democratic activist and Chicago attorney Newton Minow. Also honored were singers Bruce Springsteen and Diana Ross, actors Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro , philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates, and basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Rounds of applause and laughter rocked the East Room as Obama bestowed the nation's highest civilian honor on 21 legends, two posthumously, in an hourlong ceremony. Obama quipped that great actors were in the room, \"like the guy from 'Space Jam,'\" a reference to a comedy starring Jordan that mixed live action with Looney Tunes cartoon characters. The president called Jordan a man who epitomized greatness, saying that's why people talk about \"the Michael Jordan of neurosurgery\" or \"the Michael Jordan of rabbis\" or \"the Michael Jordan of outrigger canoeing.\" \"Michael Jordan is the Michael Jordan of greatness. He is the definition of somebody who is so good at what they do that everybody recognizes them. That's pretty rare,\" Obama said. Talking about Minow, Obama said he was the only one of the honorees who was \"present on my first date with Michelle\" \u2014 the couple ran into their then-boss at the law firm of Sidley Austin while out at a movie. Vin Scully receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom Vin Scully was one of many to receive the 2016\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom Vin Scully was one of many to receive the 2016\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom See more videos Others decorated included actress Cicely Tyson, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, actor Robert Redford , architect Frank Gehry , Vietnam Veterans Memorial designer Maya Lin, baseball announcer Vin Scully and \"Saturday Night Live\" producer Lorne Michaels. Gehry, one of the world's leading \"starchitects,\" counts as top projects the Walter Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park. It's unlikely President-elect Donald Trump would give the award to Michaels. On Sunday, Trump complained about his portrayal on \"SNL\" from the night before, tweeting, \"It is a totally one-sided, biased show\u2014nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" Springsteen also may find himself on the outs in the Trump administration. He has lent his star power to several Democratic nominees for the White House, most recently performing at an election eve rally for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia that drew Obama and the first lady. Obama conceded the obvious about the suit-clad New Jersey rocker. \"I am the president but he is 'The Boss,'\" he said. Many of the celebrities had publicly backed Obama or his policies over the years \u2014 and he acknowledged the debt even as he hailed their contributions to American life, arts and sciences. \"Everybody on this stage has touched me in a very powerful, personal way,\" Obama said. Jordan lays claim to six championships, all during the 1990s with the Chicago Bulls. He now is owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets . Minow, now senior counsel at Sidley Austin, is best known for decrying bad television as a \"vast wasteland\" after he was appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in 1961. Other honorees included two giants of science \u2014 mathematician and software pioneer Margaret Hamilton, and nuclear physicist Richard Garwin, who helped design the first hydrogen bomb as well as  the MRI, a critical tool in modern medicine. The medal was awarded posthumously to Elouise Cobell, a Blackfeet tribal leader from Montana who led a class-action lawsuit against the Interior Department that restored tribal homelands to the Blackfeet Nation and other tribes in a settlement worth $3.4 billion. Another posthumous award was given to Rear Adm. Grace Hopper, the so-called \"first lady of software\" who was at the forefront of computer and programming development from the 1940s to the 1980s. The constellation of stars made for a high-wattage prequel to another tradition on tap for the president Wednesday. He is to pardon a pair of turkeys in a Thanksgiving eve ritual, an event he never seemed to relish. ",

Here's what we're watching right now: An analysis of preliminary election data shows the California Legislature will be more racially and ethnically diverse this session, though the number of women in the statehouse has dropped. Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison spoke to California Democrats who gathered this weekend for an executive meeting as he tries for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee. Democrats' chances of securing a full supermajority are seeming more likely , with just 187 votes between two state Senate candidates in Southern California. Nov. 22, 2016, 2:14 p.m. Democrat Josh Newman takes the lead in drawn-out battle over state Senate seat and supermajority Christine Mai-Duc (Courtesy of Josh Newman for State Senate) Josh Newman has\u00a0taken the lead in his tightly contested race for a Southern California state Senate seat that could hand a supermajority to Democrats in both houses of the Legislature. Newman, a Democrat, is ahead by 829 votes following the latest release of vote counts by Orange County elections officials Monday afternoon. The new vote count does not include updated returns from Los Angeles County, where about 18% of voters in the 29th Senate District live, or San Bernardino County, which contains 8% of voters.\u00a0 On Friday, GOP Assemblywoman Ling Ling Chang (R-Diamond Bar) was ahead,\u00a0 but her lead had narrowed to fewer\u00a0than 200 votes. Newman's position\u00a0could change yet again with new tabulations from San Bernardino County, where he had previously been trailing Chang by 2,294 votes.\u00a0 Los Angeles County plans to release updated numbers later Tuesday, while San Bernardino County has a planned update Wednesday.

    "text": "Here\u2019s what those possibilities look like, from the most benign to the most disruptive. Scenario 1: The assertive stance, within existing institutions There really are some elements of the United States\u2019 existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the United States. By taking more aggressive stands on some of them, a Trump administration may be able to get better deals. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. A lot of things can fit under the rubric of \u201crenegotiate,\u201d though, and there is room to update the deal in ways that would prove beneficial to the United States. The agreement is 23 years old, after all. And there is plenty of room to adjust terms in ways that preserve the deeply intertwined North American economy. \u201cThere are too many parts of it that are not working,\u201d said David Malpass, an economist on the Trump transition team, at an event in October . \u201cThere is supposed to be regular annual review between the parties of Nafta to see where it\u2019s not working well and to have kind of a constant process of renewal. That\u2019s been dropped away. And so that\u2019s something that needs to be looked at.\u201d The Trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the United States unfairly and bring cases before the World Trade Organization . Paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair behavior, the approach could win more favorable deals. The Bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in 2002, as did the Obama administration with a 35 percent tax on Chinese tires in 2009. Trade experts are generally skeptical that these efforts prove worthwhile. Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated that American consumers paid an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 to safeguard a mere 1,200 American tire-making jobs. That\u2019s $900,000 per job saved. But Mr. Trump\u2019s administration could bring a series of such cases, and if, as he promises, his team members prove to be made up of tougher, smarter negotiators than their predecessors, perhaps they could get better results. Even if they don\u2019t, the $18 trillion United States economy will most likely be O.K. Mr. Trump has said he will instruct his Treasury secretary to declare China a currency manipulator. The George W. Bush and Obama administrations didn\u2019t do this, although they also thought that China artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of Chinese exporters. However, they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than head-on confrontation to get results. But who knows? Maybe that calculation was wrong, and a more confrontational approach would have led China to allow its currency to respond to market forces. The Chinese government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few years, putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue. (But it could still be in the United States\u2019 interest to put in place agreements to make sure this remains the case.) Naming China a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it. Such negotiation would most likely be hard-fought, and it might result in a better long-term arrangement for the United States. Or not. But either way, it wouldn\u2019t need to disrupt day-to-day trade relations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That assumes that Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and authorities, and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries. If so, it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy. \u201cThere would be pushback, but you\u2019d be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by Congress and the W.T.O. and our trading partners,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer at White & Case who has been critical of Mr. Trump. \u201cEverybody will talk about it, but it won\u2019t change the global macroeconomic outlook.\u201d Scenario 2: The bold use of authority, and serious blowback Ambiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy. Mr. Trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest. Subscribe to the Times Rather than focus on targeted duties on individual products as part of a W.T.O. case, the government could invoke emergency authority to place broad-based tariffs on goods from a given country. Think of the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports that Mr. Trump at one point threatened during his campaign, or perhaps an escalating tariff set to rise until the trade deficit with a given country declines. Moves along those lines would get everyone\u2019s attention, but they would also create enormous ripple effects. There would surely be legal challenges by the targeted country\u2019s industries, as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners. China (or Mexico, or Japan) wouldn\u2019t take these kinds of measures lying down. \u201cWith these blunt instruments, there would be a lot of effects,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt would hit poor Americans the hardest in the sense that it\u2019s a regressive tax that makes things like clothing and consumer electronics more expensive.\u201d And the retaliation would most likely be fierce. If China is the target, it might cancel orders for Boeing airliners and buy from Europe\u2019s Airbus instead. (The United States exported $15 billion worth of aircraft to China last year). Or perhaps the Chinese would retaliate against American agriculture, endangering the $10.5 billion in United States soybean exports to China and endangering farms across the Midwest \u2014 prime Trump country, as the decision-makers in China will surely be aware. And with the economic underpinnings of major industries under stress, the financial markets would probably enter a period of remarkable volatility. Expect plummeting stock prices for major United States companies that do business around the world. The Trump administration would be risking significant damage to the United States economy if it took this route, without any guarantee of coming out with a more favorable long-term deal on the other side. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Scenario 3: Upending the world economic order Trade wars that would be started by broad-based tariffs on major trading partners would be economically disruptive but would still leave the basic infrastructure of the global trade system in place. The most extreme versions of a Trump trade policy, however, could wreak havoc on the entire system of global economic connections that the United States helped build since the end of World War II. If the Trump administration can\u2019t get the concessions it seeks in renegotiating Nafta, would he follow through on his threat to use the power, written into the trade agreement, to withdraw entirely with six months\u2019 notice? Or if the administration brings cases to the W.T.O. and loses, will the United States abide by the rulings, or will it follow Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign threat to abandon an organization meant to bring order to the global trade system? If he seeks to do those things using executive authority, will Congress stand by or seek to stop him? \u201cFor the last 100 years or so, Congress and the executive branch have had a kind of gentleman\u2019s agreement where Congress delegates its authority over international trade to the president as long as Congress gets the ultimate say,\u201d Mr. Lincicome said. In a more extreme case of a Trump trade agenda, he said, \u201cthe risk is you have not just an economic crisis but a constitutional crisis.\u201d This is pretty far down the road of speculation. The various business interests who have the president-elect\u2019s ear would surely try to persuade him not to risk everything by being so drastic. Financial markets since the election have appeared to reflect an expectation that the benign scenario for Trump trade policy will emerge. The S.&P. 500 index, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq Composite index and the Russell 2000 index all hit new highs Monday. The question of whether one of the more extreme, every-country-for-itself-trade-war scenarios emerges instead boils down to this: Does Mr. Trump mean some of the things he has said on the campaign trail about reopening the very basics of United States economic relationships, or was it all just words? The economic consequences of the answer are huge. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter .

The California Supreme Court will review a case that gave state and local government new authority to reduce public employee pensions. (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Maura Dolan Contact Reporter The California Supreme Court decided Tuesday to review a ruling that would give state and local governments new authority to cut public employee pensions. The court, meeting in closed session, unanimously\u00a0accepted labor unions\u2019 appeal of a decision that said government pensions were not \u201cimmutable\u201d and could be trimmed. But the court will not review further arguments in the case until a court of appeal resolves another pending pension dispute. That could take months. The case now before the state high court was decided in August by a three-judge panel of the 1st\u00a0District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. The other pension case, which raises similar issues, is pending before a different panel of judges in the same court. That\u00a0panel has not yet scheduled a hearing on it. The court of appeal\u2019s August ruling amounted to\u00a0 a\u00a0major change in California pensions law , scholars said.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President-elect Trump released his first extended remarks since the election in a YouTube video , an Orange County health network is putting doctors in grocery stores , the range and scope of Donald Trump\u2019s business interests are unprecedented , and\u00a0 Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week .

Pensions could be cut for current employees only if an equivalent benefit were added, making it difficult for governments to cut costs. If upheld, the ruling could be a vehicle for reducing a shortfall of hundreds of billions of dollars in public pensions in California. Other states grappling with pension debt also could follow California\u2019s lead. The court agreed to take the case in a brief order that did not reveal the justices\u2019 thoughts. A decision in the case is likely to be issued in several months. The ruling stemmed from a pension reform law passed in 2012 by state legislators. The law cut pensions and raised retirement ages for new employees and banned \u201cpension spiking\u201d for existing workers. Pension spiking has allowed some workers to get larger pensions by inflating their pay during the period in which retirement is based \u2014 usually at the end of their careers.\u00a0 Employees have done this by cashing in years of accumulated vacation or sick pay or volunteering for extra duties just before retirement. The practice in some cases has given employees pensions that exceeded their regular salary. The Marin County retirement system, relying on the new law, decided that pay for various on-call duties\u00a0and for waiving health insurance could no longer be counted toward pensions. Unions objected. They said many employees had been counting on the long-promised benefit and may even have accepted their jobs because of it. In a ruling written by Justice James A. Richman, appointed by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the appeals court said the Legislature can alter pension formulas for active employees and reduce their anticipated retirement benefits. \u201cWhile a public employee does have a \u2018vested right\u2019 to a pension, that right is only to a \u2018reasonable\u2019 pension \u2014 not an immutable entitlement to the most optimal formula of calculating the pension,\u201d wrote Richman, joined by Justices J. Anthony Kline and Marla J. Miller, both Gov. Jerry Brown appointees. A trial judge in the other pension case, brought by employees of\u00a0Contra Costa, Alameda and Merced counties, upheld the anti-spiking provisions but allowed some employees to count pay for regular and required\u00a0on-call duties toward\u00a0their\u00a0pensions. Written arguments in that case were completed months ago, and the panel\u2019s failure to schedule a hearing prompted speculation that it was waiting for the California Supreme Court to decide the Marin County dispute before ruling. Instead, the state high court\u2019s order amounted to a\u00a0\u201cyou go first\u201d message,\u00a0said\u00a0Arthur Liou, \u00a0an attorney who represents unions in both pension cases. He said the Supreme Court may have decided to wait for a decision in the second case because the justices assumed they would have to review it later anyway. \u201cMaybe the court wants to hear and resolve all the issues together,\u201d Liou said, noting that both cases raise similar issues. David P. Mastagni, who represents Alameda County deputy sheriffs in the pending case, said the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to wait for a ruling \u201creally to me signals they understand the gravity and significance of the issues.\u201d Given the complexity and importance of the dispute,\u00a0he said, he was not surprised that the court of appeal has yet to schedule\u00a0a hearing. The court is required to issue a decision within 90 days of a\u00a0hearing. David E. Mastagni, the elder lawyer\u2019s son and law partner, said it was not uncommon for the California Supreme Court to postpone a decision until a lower court acts first in a similar case. \u201cIt gives them a more complete record,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to have another fully developed factual background.\u201d ",

The letter, signed by Friedrich Trump, who left Germany at the age of 16 in 1885, was unearthed at the state archives in the western German region of Rhineland-Palatinate. A document signed by Friedrich Trump, grandfather of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is pictured at the state archive of Rhineland-Palatinate in Speyer, Germany November 22, 2016. RALPH ORLOWSKI / Reuters After the turn of the century, Friedrich Trump returned from the United States to Germany, where he met and married his wife, Elisabeth, with whom he returned to New York. \"She lasted for around two years before making it known that she wanted to return to Germany,\" Franz Maier of the Rhineland-Palatinate state archives in Speyer told Reuters Television. Friedrich had, however, failed to deregister properly before he left Germany and was not therefore allowed to be renaturalised in Bavaria, which was then its own kingdom. An accompanying document in the archived dossier read: \"The settlement in Bavaria cannot be permitted.\" That fateful rejection set off the series of events that ended up with Donald Trump being elected U.S. president.
