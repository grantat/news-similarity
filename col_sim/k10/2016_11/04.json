    "text": "By Sarah Halzack November 2 at 3:17 PM Follow @sarahhalzack Lauren Middledorf poses for photos that she later added to her social-media accounts and her blog, It\u2019s All Good. (Photos by Debbie Cartee) As soon as Lauren Middledorf starts striking poses, you can tell that she\u2019s done this more than a few times before. Smile. Look at the camera. Look away. Reposition the leopard-print purse. Tousle hair. Cross legs. Add sunglasses. Repeat. The photographer \u2014 snapping away at her subject on a shadow-bathed outdoor plaza \u2014 occasionally chimes in with bits of advice. \u201cTeeth,\u201d she offers at one point, prompting Middledorf to give a broader grin. \u201cLet me take some more of your shoes against that,\u201d she says, betting the sleek black stilettos will pop against a beige block of concrete. Middledorf is not a model: She has a full-time job as a corporate event coordinator. The photographer is her mom. And Middledorf put on this ensemble in the bathroom of a nearby restaurant. It\u2019s all part of her effort to gain a modest slice of the mushrooming marketing budgets that retailers and megabrands are funneling to everyday women and men who have amassed large followings for their blogs, Instagram feeds or Snapchat stories. [ Behind that pretty photo in your Instagram feed: Layers and layers of strategy ] Brands regard these social-media \u201cinfluencers\u201d as relatable messengers for their goods. Companies pay them in fees or free products, resulting in sponsored posts in which, say, a millennial gal about town, working mom or fitness buff might talk up a pair of high heels from Kohl\u2019s , show off a recipe made using Progresso bread crumbs or flash a smile that\u2019s been treated with Crest White Strips . What was an experimental marketing practice only a short time ago has morphed into a mini-economy with dizzying financial stakes. The social-media analytics firm Captiv8 estimates that big brands are spending a collective $255\u00a0million per month for sponsored posts on Instagram alone. Captiv8 says Instagram influencers who have more than 7\u00a0million followers command an average rate of more than $150,000 per sponsored post. Some have even signed with agents, who help them get connected for a cut of the earnings. Others have banded into informal syndicates to help promote one another\u2019s posts, making them attractive to more brands. As the business takes shape, and more people rush to join, some wonder whether the new form of marketing can hang onto the sheen of authenticity that made it successful in the first place. Already, regulators and consumer watchdogs have begun clamoring for more disclosure of the paid relationships. And already, some influencers are feeling the strain of their always-on lifestyle, where the product they\u2019re selling is their own personality and taste. Theirs is a world where happy hour with friends becomes a moment to trumpet one\u2019s enviable taste in cocktails to followers. Family vacations become paid photo ops . Pleasure becomes business. In other words, while influencer marketing rose to prominence as a raw, credible antidote to the slick world of television and glossy magazines, it has metastasized into something every bit as calculated. *** Middledorf, 24, has a blog called It\u2019s All Good \u2014 along with related Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest accounts \u2014 where she offers up fashion finds and showcases her life in Northern Virginia\u2019s wine country. She got into the game about five years ago while she was in college, and much has changed since then. \u201cNow that it\u2019s so saturated, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to get sponsored posts,\u201d said Middledorf, who has almost 5,000 Instagram followers. That\u2019s part of why she and legions of other influencers go to greater and greater lengths to make sure their feeds feature only the most polished aspirational imagery. For Middledorf, that means studying Pinterest for fresh posing ideas. She has honed tricks such as walking backward, a tactic she swears actually appears as a more natural walk in photos. And she scouts locations ahead of time to make sure the scenery is a fitting background for a certain outfit. On one Sunday afternoon in October, she shot a date-night outfit \u2014 lacy top, skinny jeans, sexy heels \u2014 in bustling Reston Town Center. Then it was off to a pumpkin patch in Bluemont, Va., to shoot a casual boots-and-flowy-dress look. Across the influencer universe, this kind of meticulous choreography is common. Alicia Chew, a style and food influencer, figured out how to replicate the marble countertops she lacked to showcase beauty products. Her solution: She bought some marble-print contact paper and slapped it on a piece of cardboard. \u201cI have to make my life a little \u2014 well, actually a lot \u2014 more glamorous than it actually is,\u201d Chew said. Alicia Chew, a style and food influencer, poses for photos for her blog. ( Photos by Rosa Carrasco ) Getting the photos to look enticing is just part of the process. Influencers say they often log hours each day trying simply to expand their following so that they can command larger fees: They\u2019ll respond one by one to commenters, post content across channels including Pinterest and Twitter, and \u201clike\u201d other people\u2019s social posts. For some, all that effort can become, well, work. Elizabeth LaBau, who has more than 8,000 Instagram followers on her desserts site SugarHero, said she used to enjoy posting on Pinterest. \u201cNow I schedule my Pinterest time every week, and I just sit down and do it like a kid eating broccoli.\u201d [ Teenage Instagram star says decision to stop chasing likes and shares made her feel free ] *** Behind the work exists a more philosophical challenge: How does an influencer make money without diluting a carefully crafted, real-girl or real-guy brand? Influencers typically gained traction because they did not come off as corporate shills. If they clutter people\u2019s feeds with too many sponsored posts or execute those sponsored posts in a way that feels contrived, they might alienate readers. Chew, for example, maintains a lifestyle blog called Alicia Tenise and an Instagram feed with about 12,000 followers. She has done all sorts of sponsored posts, including with Banana Republic, Rent the Runway, Pepsi, Brita and Enterprise CarShare. But there was one that ticked her followers off. \u201cI did a campaign with a mouthwash company a little over a year ago, and I got so much backlash over that,\u201d Chew said. Readers scoffed, complaining that she was endorsing a product that wasn\u2019t in her wheelhouse. Since then, Chew has tried to rethink her strategy, doing fewer sponsored posts but raising her rates to offset the reduced rate of earning. Sponsors, though, can be tricky to manage. Chew agreed to participate in one brand\u2019s Twitter chat before realizing that the brand had a set of canned answers for her to deliver. \u201cThey asked what a family tradition was for Fourth of July,\u201d Chew said. She was supposed to respond that she and her family go to the lake. Problem is, Chew can\u2019t swim, and so she thought her followers would sense right away it was phony. She told the brand that she\u2019d need to say something that was more true to her real life. Such tight restrictions from brands are not unusual. Kimberly Smith of Penny Pincher Fashion said she\u2019s been asked not to use words such as \u201ccheap\u201d or \u201cbudget\u201d when writing about a low-priced item. Amanda Kushner of Glitter & Spice says one food company asked her to feature its cracker in an original recipe but said she could not show any photos of the cracker in crumbled form. *** At the upper echelons of the influencer hierarchy, there is evidence of just how lucrative this new world can be. Aimee Song, whose Song of Style feed on Instagram has 4\u00a0million followers, has signed an endorsement deal with Laura Mercier cosmetics that is reportedly worth more than $500,000. Emily Schuman, who founded Cupcakes & Cashmere and has racked up more than 300,000 Instagram followers, now has a clothing collection that is sold at Nordstrom and Shopbop. Logan Paul, an influencer who is known for quirky, comedic videos, recently said he was paid $200,000 for a single day\u2019s work . But even with fewer followers, you can do quite well. LaBau, the desserts blogger, said she charged $200 for her first sponsored post years ago but now can command up to 10 times that per post. Elizabeth LaBau, right, displays her Cosmic Brownie Mini Cakes. LaBau says her blog posts can take her 15 to 20 hours to execute, including time devoted to baking, decorating, prop shopping, photography and other steps. (Provided by Elizabeth LaBau) Some of the proposed arrangements do not involve money at all. \u201cI had a company that was going to send me hair extensions \u2014 but not pay me for it \u2014 but wanted a blog post, three Instagram posts, two Twitter posts and a Facebook post spaced out over a three-month period,\u201d said Anna Dille Cobbs, a Dallas-based speech therapist who runs a fashion and recipe site called Fleur Dille . \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d Cobbs charges $250 to $400 for a sponsorship package that includes a blog post and one related post each on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Sponsored posts are not the only way for influencers to monetize their work. They also can join affiliate networks that allow them to make a few pennies on each click they drive to retailers\u2019 websites or that pay them commissions on the sales they facilitate on retailers\u2019 websites. But, overall, it\u2019s an uncertain landscape. Regulators have begun insisting that sponsorships be more transparent, with greater disclosures. And the technological landscape keeps changing. For example, Instagram moved recently from a chronological feed to an algorithm-driven feed. This has some influencers worried that it will become hard to enlarge their followings and get as many \u201clikes\u201d as they need to keep brands happy. Such changes have made some skeptical that the influencer marketing boom can be sustained. Chew, for one, said she has no plan to abandon her day job working full-time for a media group in Tysons Corner, Va. \u201cI\u2019m a little hesitant right now,\u201d Chew said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not exactly sure when the blogger bubble is going to burst.\u201d business ",

The two are seen here visiting a Russian martial arts and combat school in 2013. Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images Actor Steven Seagal was granted Russian citizenship by a decree from President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. The two are seen here visiting a Russian martial arts and combat school in 2013. Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images Russia's President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree Thursday that grants Russian citizenship to action-movie star Steven Seagal, fulfilling a desire that Seagal spoke about as recently as September. Putin and Seagal are longtime friends. Putin and Seagal share a passion for martial arts: Seagal is an expert in aikido, and Putin is an expert in judo. They've appeared together at martial arts demonstrations and official events, including last year's Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. In recent years, Seagal has emerged as an unlikely conduit between U.S. and Russian officials. Back in 2013, members of a U.S. congressional delegation said Seagal \"opened some doors\" for them as they researched anti-terrorism issues \u2014 and it later emerged that in the same year, Putin suggested making Seagal an honorary consul in California and Arizona, a position that could have allowed him to work as a go-between for Putin and President Obama. Today, Sputnik News quotes Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying of Seagal: \"This [was his] desire, he had really applied. He had been really persistent for a long time and been asking to grant him citizenship, he is actually renown for his quite warm feelings toward our country.\" Article continues after sponsorship Seagal isn't the first Western celebrity to cozy up to Russia. \"Seagal follows other Western celebrities with an affinity for Putin's machismo in receiving Russian citizenship,\" The Moscow Times reports, \"such as fighter Roy Jones Jr. and French actor Gerard Depardieu.\" If all this is too much to wrap your head around, it might help to see the language of the decree itself, at the Kremlin website . It's a no-nonsense decree, naming Seagal and listing his date of birth (April 10, 1952) and bestowing citizenship in the Russian Federation upon him. ",

    "text": "Extra! Extra! Newspapers kick into high gear for Cubs World Series win Newspaper front pages marking the Cubs' World Series win from around the country and world. Ally Marotti Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago papers are flying off newsstands, as Cubs fans scramble to get the first newspaper in 108 years with their team and the words \"World Series Champions\" emblazoned across the front page. The Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, both printed at the Freedom Center in the Fulton River District neighborhood, added hundreds of thousands of copies to their normal circulation numbers. The Tribune normally prints about 300,000 copies, said Stew Erskine, product supervisor in the pressroom. Overnight Wednesday it printed an extra 400,000 copies. \"We had extra staff, we had three extra presses running,\" Erskine said. \"We've been planning it since we knew they were going to be in the World Series.\" They fired up the presses again Thursday afternoon, adding another 300,000 copies of the Tribune, bringing the total to about 1 million. The Tribune set up tables in the lobby of Tribune Tower before 8 a.m. to sell copies of the paper, replica press plates and other merchandise. The Sun-Times printed almost 600,000 extra copies, about eight times the normal amount, said Jim Kirk, editor and publisher of the Sun-Times, in an email. It set up a pop-up shop in the Merchandise Mart to sell the paper and take book orders. \"The last time we came this close to adding this many papers was the day after Barack Obama won the presidential election in 2008,\" Kirk said. \"Given the high call volume this morning, we will likely print even more.\" As Game 7 of the World Series pushed into extra innings and a rain delay Wednesday night, the printing staff waited. The presses at the Freedom Center also print copies of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, both of which had late runs. Normally the presses start running at about 11 p.m., Erskine said, but they didn't start until 1:30 a.m. Thursday. Then delivery trucks made extra runs, taking out their normal loads and coming back for more. Photos from Game 7 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland on Nov. 2, 2016. They'll fire the presses up again Thursday afternoon to print a Cubs special section for the Tribune, set to go out with Friday's paper, Erskine said. The presses worked double time when the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup last year, Erskine said, and when Obama won the election. \"But this kind of increase? Never,\" he said. \"This is crazy.\" Copies of Thursday's edition of the Tribune are already for sale on eBay for as much as $26. The suburban Daily Herald newspaper upped the amount of papers it printed for newsstands from about 4,800 to 53,000, said Jim Galetano, senior vice president of circulation. \"And that's just the newsstands, that doesn't include the home delivery,\" he said. \"It's 10 times the normal rate.\" Front pages of newspapers from Canada to Colombia also heralded the Cubs win. amarotti@chicagotribune.com ",

(Victoria Will/Invision/AP) Erik WempleThe Washington Post We knew that Megyn Kelly , the star anchor at Fox News , has alleged that now-ousted Fox News chief Roger Ailes sexually harassed her about a decade ago, before she became a host. Those allegations were among many \u2013 prompted by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson 's sexual harassment suit \u2013 that forced the ouster of Ailes from his post over the summer. As part of an inquiry by the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly came forward with her explosive story. What we didn't know were details. That's changing, thanks to leaks from Kelly's forthcoming book, \"Settle For More,\" whose official release date is Nov. 15. Radar Online is reporting that Kelly wrote in the book that she received word from her managing editor that she'd \"captured the attention of Mr. Ailes.\" She was called in to meet with Ailes at Fox News' Manhattan offices. Via Radar: \"Roger began pushing the limits,\" she alleges. \"There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger's office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me \u2013 veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the 'very sexy bras' I must have and how he'd like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\" ",

The Republican nominee and his campaign have renounced the support of white nationalists.

In a blog post on Medium , Julie Lythcott-Haims wrote that she was a dorm mate with now Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel at Stanford in 1985-86. Lythcott-Haims wrote that Thiel told her that \"moral issues were irrelevant\" to the racist government's economy. As an African-American women, Lythcott-Haims wrote, she was taken aback that he would say this to her \"with no facial affect.\" She went on to say that Thiel made \"no effort to even acknowledge the pain the concept of apartheid could possibly raise for me, a Black women.\" Peter Thiel Stands Out In Silicon Valley For Support Of Donald Trump Lythcott-Haims says she brought up the incident because Thiel is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, who has faced charges of racism in both his past and in the way he has run his presidential campaign. Thiel spoke in support of Trump at this year's Republican National Convention and donated $1.25 million to the campaign. (Thiel has also been in the news for secretly backing a lawsuit against Gawker Media, which filed for bankruptcy after a $140 million verdict against it for posting a sex tape of former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The suit was recently settled for $31 million.) Lythcott-Haims says the apartheid incident stuck like a \"lump in my throat\" for 30 years. But when Thiel, who is now a very high-profile Silicon Valley investor, endorsed Trump \"I knew I shouldn't keep it to myself any longer,\" she wrote. Article continues after sponsorship Lythcott-Haims' account of Thiel's opinion about apartheid was backed up by Megan Maxwell, who also attended Stanford with Thiel. Maxwell, who is also an African-American, told NPR that in a separate incident Thiel also told her that \"morality and governments shouldn't be connected\" and that \"you shouldn't judge a government based on whether it fits your view of morality.\" In a statement, a spokesperson for Thiel said: \"Peter has never supported apartheid, but he can easily see how a conversation might be misremembered 30 years later.\" Both conversations did occur at a time when apartheid was a hot topic on American college campuses. Students were organizing protests over university investments in South Africa and there was debate over the best tactics to use for the country to end its racist system. Thiel was then and still is a Libertarian and if you were to give him the benefit of the doubt he may have been arguing that the U.S. should stay out of South African politics, which would be consistent with Libertarian philosophy. He initially made his fortune as an investor in PayPal and was part of what the tech world calls the \"PayPal\" mafia, a group of early employees and investors that includes Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and Space X, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Thiel's quirky personality is so famous among techies that there's a character spoof of him in the HBO show Silicon Valley. The character Peter Gregory is famously known to be a brilliant investor who has little awareness of the feelings of the people around him. Indeed, Maxwell said you have to wonder about someone who \"would imagine trying to defend apartheid to two black women in separate discussions. Did he have no sense of his audience? Did he just not care?\" Maxwell wondered. \"What is your world that it's OK for you to do this? I think that was the freakiest thing.\" Correction Nov. 3, 2016 ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Majorities of voters say that Mr. Trump is not qualified to be president and that he lacks the temperament to serve in that office. Last Friday, when the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress about a renewed inquiry concerning Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, Mr. Trump seized on the chance to shift campaign\u2019s tenor and focus on the controversy over her handling of emails when she was secretary of state. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Times/CBS poll began hours after Mr. Comey\u2019s letter became public. Most voters who were contacted said they had heard about the development. More voters said they were aware of accusations that Mr. Trump had made unwanted sexual advances toward several women. Yet about six in 10 voters over all said the 11th-hour disclosures about each candidate would make no real difference in their votes. However, more people said the allegations about Mr. Trump were likely to negatively affect their votes than those who said the new email developments would discourage them from voting for Mrs. Clinton. Four in 10 likely voters said Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior toward women made them less likely to support him while fewer, one-third, said the newest development in the F.B.I. investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails had that effect. Also bolstering Mrs. Clinton, and the possibility of a third straight Democratic term in the White House, is President Obama\u2019s popularity. Fifty-two percent of registered voters approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing, an increase from earlier this year. While Mr. Obama\u2019s standing has increased, the campaign has taken a toll on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s image. Only 32 percent of voters say she is honest and trustworthy, and a quarter of Democrats and nearly six in 10 independents do not think she will be able to unite the country if she wins. \u201cThe campaign has gotten uglier and uglier,\u201d said Michael Pappas, a real estate broker in Knoxville, Tenn., who is a Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s been about mudslinging and attacking personalities instead of talking about issues, talking about how we can help our country move forward and succeed.\u201d Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

    "text": "Email CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A man riding with a motorist who was fatally shot by a police officer while running away from a traffic stop testified Thursday that he doesn\u2019t know why his friend tried to flee. Former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, second from right, sits in the courtroom, Thursday, Nov. 3, 2016 in Charleston, S.C.\u00a0 Grace Beahm, AP \u201cThat\u2019s a question I would like to ask him. Unfortunately I can\u2019t. He was murdered,\u201d said Pierre Fulton, who worked with Walter Scott at a distribution warehouse, and was riding in the front passenger seat when Michael Slager, a North Charleston police officer, pulled them over for a broken tail light. A bystander\u2019s cellphone recording of Scott\u2019s death stunned the nation as the images spread on social media. Slager, who is white, faces 30 years to life if convicted of murdering Scott, who was black. He also faces separate federal charges including violations of Scott\u2019s civil rights. Fulton said Scott surrendered his driver\u2019s license and stepped out of the car. Slager then ordered Scott to get back in again, and he complied. Then, as the officer was checking the information, Scott bolted. \u201cThe next thing you know he was out the door,\u201d Fulton said. The gunshots rang out a short time later, he said. Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said Slager fired eight times after failing to subdue Scott with a stun gun; five of the shots hit Scott in the back and buttocks. The bystander\u2019s video showed Scott, 50, being felled from a distance. It did not capture the entirety of the encounter; nor did the dash cam video from Slager\u2019s cruiser, which recorded only the traffic stop itself. Jurors watched that dash cam video in court on Thursday. It shows Scott suddenly running from his car and out of view after Slager goes to his cruiser to check the license. North Charleston Police Sgt. Scott Hille, called by the prosecution to introduce the police video, was asked by the defense if it showed anything unprofessional in Slager\u2019s behavior in handling the stop. An undated photo shows Walter Scott. WCSC via Facebook Hille replied: \u201cNot that I can think of sir.\u201d Scott\u2019s family members and friends were the first to take the stand. His fiancee, Charlotte Jones, called him a \u201cloving and kind person.\u201d Neighbor Arthur Heyward, who had just sold Scott the car, called him \u201ca good friend and neighbor. We looked out for each other.\u201d Wilson told the jury of 11 whites and one black in her opening statement that even if Scott wrestled with Slager over the stun gun, that provocation did not justify being shot to death. \u201cIf Walter Scott had not resisted arrest, he wouldn\u2019t have been shot. He paid the extreme consequence for his conduct. He lost his life for his foolishness,\u201d she acknowledged. But she said Slager must be held accountable for \u201chis decision to go too far -- his decision to let his sense of authority get the better of him.\u201d Defense attorney Andy Savage countered that Slager \u201cearned a reputation of excellence\u201d in his five years with the North Charleston police, and he sought to pin responsibility on Scott. \u201cWhy did he choose not to respect the request to stay where he was? That\u2019s something that I hope you consider,\u201d Savage told the jurors. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Mr. Slager who was angry and full of animosity.\u201d The family has said Scott may have tried to flee because he was worried about having to go back to jail for missing child support payments. Savage called that \u201cpure speculation,\u201d and said there was no way Slager could have known Scott was unarmed. ",

    "text": "'The guy does deserve a bullet,' Eric Trump says of David Duke William Cummings , USA TODAY 8:34 p.m. EDT November 3, 2016 973 Shares x Share Eric Trump made the comment while on a talk radio show Thursday. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Remember when Republican nominee Donald Trump took a lot of criticism after he didn't strongly\u00a0disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke's endorsement during the primary campaign? Well, his son, Eric Trump made sure there was no ambiguity regarding his own opinion of Duke, telling a Denver radio host on Tuesday that he thinks the white supremacist deserves \"a bullet.\" After KHOW host Ross Kaminsky said that Duke \u2014 who is running for a Louisiana Senate seat \u2014 \"desperately deserves a bullet in the head,\" Trump\u00a0agreed. \"Ross, it's disgusting,\" Trump said. \"And by the way, if I said exactly what you said, I'd get killed for it. But I think I'll say it anyway. The guy does deserve a bullet. These aren't good people. These are horrible people.\" Police and protesters clash as David Duke joins Senate debate Trump went on to commend his father's outreach to African-Americans. \"My father is the first Republican who's gone out and said, 'Listen, what's happened to the African-American community is horrible and I'm going to take care of it.'\" Trump said the Democrats are deliberately trying to make his father look like a bigot by tying him to Duke. \"This is the MO of the DNC,\" he said. He said the Clinton campaign intended to discredit his father by labeling him a \"bigot, a racist, xenophobic, this and that.\" Despite Duke's racist views, some might say advocating his assassination is a bit over the top. Perhaps the younger Trump ought to have heeded the advice he said he sometimes gives his father that \"sometimes you're just too brutally direct.\" But, as Eric Trump said in the radio interview , \"In terms of guns we're the most pro-Second Amendment family in the entire world.\" ",

USA TODAY A photo of a Facebook page asking for helping finding Kala Brown and Charles Carver. (Photo: Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail) ANDERSON, S.C.\u00a0\u2014 A woman missing since the end of August was found Thursday chained up in a metal container in upstate South Carolina . Kala Brown and her boyfriend, Charles Carver, 32, were last heard from Aug. 31. On Thursday, Brown, 30, was found \"in a container, chained up like a dog,\" in Woodruff, S.C., said Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright. Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, 45, a registered sex offender from Moore, S.C., was arrested in connection with Brown's discovery, Wright said. No charge was listed on the\u00a0 Spartanburg Sheriff's Office website . Brown worked for Kohlhepp, who is a Spartanburg County\u00a0real estate broker and a licensed pilot. Police searched a home belonging to Kohlhepp and removed a car from the property late Thursday. Police are still looking for Carver. Missing man crawls to road 3 days after deadly crash More than two dozen law enforcement officers were in Woodruff on Thursday focusing on a field and a wooded area surrounded by a chain-link fence. Woodruff is about 30 miles southeast of Greenville, S.C. Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said\u00a0more than a dozen search warrants were issued in their investigation into the couple's disappearance.\u00a0\"We got computer and cellphone records that ultimately led us to the area in Woodruff,\" he said.\u00a0\"We knew that was the last place that a cellphone tied to this case pinged.\" Stewart said Spartanburg County investigators had been looking at the same land for a different case and were on the property Thursday morning when they heard Brown banging in the container where she had been kept. Stewart said Anderson police are still looking for other suspects. \"We are in a wait-and-see mode,\" Stewart said. \"We need more information before we will know how to go forward.\" Stewart said Carver's estranged wife, Nicole Ellen Carver, had spoken with investigators, but wouldn't say\u00a0what information, if any, they got from her. Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, 45, a registered sex offender, was arrested Thursday, Nov. 3, 2016, after police found a woman chained in a container. \u00a0(Photo: Spartanburg County (S.C.) Detention Center via Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail) Brown's close friend, Leah Miller, said Brown helped Kohlhepp clean houses and clear properties before he offered them for sale or rent. \"I was supposed to be helping Kala, but I recently had neck surgery,\" said Miller. \"I'm just in shock, wondering if she tried to reach me to help her before she disappeared. I'm happy that she is alive, but my heart is breaking because we don't know what's going on with Charlie.\" Miller said she believes Brown started working for Kohlhepp just weeks before she disappeared. Wright said Brown told investigators that there may be other victims. \"We're trying to make sure that we don't have a serial killer on our hands,\" he said. Kohlhepp's co-workers were shocked to hear of his arrest. \"This is a nightmare,\" said Manfred Lewis, an agent at TKA Real Estate in Spartanburg. \"I'm shocked. We don't know what's going on but I've never had problems with him. He was always professional to me. Friendly.\" Brown is being treated at a hospital, he said. Before the couple disappeared, they shared an apartment in Anderson, S.C. Carver worked at a tissue plant there. According to police reports, Carver's mother, Claudia Shiflet, had been unable to reach him since Aug. 29. Miller, told police she last heard from Brown in an Aug. 31 text message. \"Are you awake?\" was the message. Miller answered it later that day, but didn't hear back from Brown. ",

USA TODAY Sports This is a Penn State University logo on the side of a merchandise trailer outside Beaver Stadium. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) Penn State University was notified Thursday it will be fined $2,397,500 by the U.S. Department of Education for failure to comply with the requirements of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The sanctions come in connection to former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky's conviction for the sexual abuse of 10 minors. Jury awards ex-Penn State assistant coach $7.3M in defamation suit According to documents, Penn State failed to issue an emergency notification after senior university officials learned of the forthcoming\u00a0charges against Sandusky. A \u00a0former senior Penn State official told the Department's review teams there was an attempt\u00a0to obtain keys to several school facilities from Sandusky in 2010,\u00a0but he refused to relinquish his access. The university didn't try to retrieve the keys again until they changed the locks. The review team\u00a0determined that prior to Sandusky's indictment (Nov. 4, 2011), Penn State had ample evidence Sandusky posed a serious threat to the campus community. The fine is\u00a0the result of a five-year federal investigation into how Penn State handled\u00a0complaints about\u00a0Sandusky prior to his indictment. Penn State has doled out more than $93 million in settlements connected to Sandusky's 32 accusers. The\u00a0former assistant coach is serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence for the sexual abuse of 10 minors. The agency says Penn State largely ignored many of its duties under the Clery Act. It\u2019s the largest fine issued under the law. It says the school violated regulations when it didn\u2019t warn students and employees of the forthcoming charges against Sandusky, who was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse. ",

The Fox News Decision Team announced updates to the scorecard Thursday afternoon, reflecting the following changes based on recent polling and other factors: New Hampshire moves from \u201clean Democrat\u201d to \u201ctoss-up\u201d Ohio moves from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Republican\u201d Indiana moves from \u201clean Republican\u201d to \u201csolid Republican\u201d Missouri moves from \u201clean Republican\u201d to \u201csolid Republican\u201d Despite the changes, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton maintains the clear advantage, and Trump\u2019s path to victory remains a tight one. But the latest ratings show Clinton\u2019s advantage diminishing. If Clinton were to win all the states leaning toward or solidly in the Democratic column, she\u2019d have 283 electoral votes \u2013 more than the 270 needed to win. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 If Trump were to win all the states leaning toward or solidly in the GOP column, he\u2019d be short at 192 electoral votes. But winning all the toss-up states would put him just 15 electoral votes shy of 270. One more win in North Carolina, Michigan or Pennsylvania could get him to victory. The updates and fresh polling comes in the wake of the FBI\u2019s decision Friday to revisit the Clinton email investigation after new messages were found on the laptop used by ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The Clinton campaign and its allies have downplayed the significance of the messages while questioning the FBI\u2019s announcement so close to Election Day. Trump, meanwhile, has seized on the news as well as other developments to press his case in the final stretch. Speaking Thursday in Jacksonville, Fla., he cited reporting by Fox News that an FBI investigation regarding the Clinton Foundation has become a \u201chigh priority.\u201d He also touted new polls in Ohio and elsewhere showing him ahead. Clinton and President Obama have, for their part, made an impassioned case to voters to not elect Trump. \u201cYou want a voice who\u2019s bragging about how being famous lets you get away with what would qualify as sexual assault, and calls women pigs, and dogs, and slobs?\u201d Obama warned voters Thursday in Miami. \u201cAnd when he pays attention to women, it\u2019s because he\u2019s grading them on a scale of one to ten. What kind of message are we sending if that\u2019s our voice?\u201d In the latest states to shift, Ohio is the most highly sought prize. Trump has been leading there for weeks and his recent national bounce moves the state back into his column.\u00a0Early ballot requests also suggest a Republican advantage. The Electoral Scorecard also recently moved Florida and Nevada from \u201clean Democrat\u201d into the \u201ctoss-up\u201d column as well, while North Carolina shifted from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Democrat.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Above, a rainy October day in San Francisco. (Paul Chinn / San Francisco Chronicle) Matt Stevens Contact Reporter A deluge of rain in Northern California has removed about a quarter of the state from drought conditions, the U.S. Drought Monitor reported Thursday. It\u2019s the rosiest picture painted by the federal monitor since the spring of 2013, when about 64% of the state was considered to be in \u201cmoderate drought\u201d \u2014 or worse. The rains so far this fall have given some weather watchers reason for optimism as California braces for a potential sixth year of drought. But much of Central and Southern California remain\u00a0locked in what the drought monitor calls \u201cexceptional or extreme drought.\u201d About 43% of the state has been classified as such for at least the last three months.

Spartanburg County Sheriff's deputies were searching the property Thursday morning in relation to a tip about a sex crime, when they heard a loud banging from a metal storage container. Sheriff Chuck Wright told local NBC affiliate WYFF that deputies discovered Kala Brown, 30, \"chained inside the container like a dog.\" Kala Brown Bobbie Newsom She told authorities she had been held there for two months. \"It's all by God's grace that we found that little girl alive,\" Wright told the station. The sheriff also said Brown told investigators about four bodies possibly buried on the property. A massive investigation is underway, and photos from the scene show a backhoe being brought in. No bodies were found as of 7 p.m., and the search was called off at nightfall and will resume in the morning, the Spartanburg County Coroner's Office said. The owner of the property, Todd Kohlhepp, a registered sex offender, has been taken into custody and will be charged with kidnapping, according to the sheriff. Other charges are also possible, officials said. \"It has been a blessing just having her, but it's, it's great just knowing that she's alive and I can go see her and hug her and tell her how much I love her,\" Cassandra Ellen, a close friend of Brown's, told WYFF. Charlie Carver, Brown's boyfriend, who disappeared around the same time, remains missing. Carver's vehicle was found on Kohlhepp's property during the search Thursday, a spokesman for the sheriff's office told WYFF. Related: Mothers Desperate for Information about Missing Couple Kala Brown and Charlie Carver A close friend of Brown's reportedly had dinner with her the night of Aug. 29 at the couple's apartment outside Anderson, South Carolina. The following day, several friends received texts back from her. But the responses stopped coming on Aug. 31. Todd Christopher Kohlhepp Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office The last images of Carver are on security video from his workplace showing him leaving on August 31. Joanne Shiflet, Carver's mother, told Dateline that she and her son don't go a day without some type of communication. And after no word from her son in several days, Shiflet called the manager of the complex where the couple's apartment was, to see if she could check on them. The manager knocked, but there was no answer. So she went inside. It appeared no one had been there for some time, according to Shiflet. Even more troubling was what she did find. Romeo, Browns Pomeranian dog, had been left without any food or water. \"That dog is her baby. She'd never leave him like that,\" Bonnie Newsom, Brown's mother, told Dateline back in early October.

(Photo: Rick Diamond, Getty Images) 8509 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 44 COMMENTEMAILMORE It's hard to talk about Wednesday night's CMA Awards show without mentioning\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9. And yet, social media accounts for the Country Music Association barely acknowledge\u00a0that the superstar took the stage with the Dixie Chicks. At about 5 p.m. ET, the CMA Facebook page 's only mention of Beyonc\u00e9 was in the comments, with vitriolic country music fans\u00a0expressing their displeasure with her and the Dixie Chicks' rendition of\u00a0Daddy Lessons/Long Time Gone, saying \u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 had \"no business performing\" at the show,\u00a0and that the Dixie Chicks are \"unpatriotic.\" After reports surfaced \u00a0that the CMA was scrubbing posts about Bey and the Dixie Chicks from their accounts, the association started to include photos of them in\u00a0new\u00a0posts. Post by cma . The same went for Twitter: Beyonc\u00e9 and the Dixie Chicks were part of a montage in a photo shared late Thursday, but there was no sign of the musicians\u00a0in tweets before that. #CMAawards50 was Country Music\u2019s Biggest Night\u2026Ever! Relive these greatest moments & more on the ABC App & On Demand pic.twitter.com/RReVMas1IX \u2014 CMA Country Music (@CountryMusic) November 3, 2016 The CMA\u00a0said in a statement sent to\u00a0USA TODAY that\u00a0it \"has not erased any mentions of Beyonc\u00e9's performance on the CMA Awards. In advance of the broadcast, CMA removed a five-second promotional clip from ABC.com and CMA's Facebook page. The promo was unapproved and CMA removed it prior to the broadcast.\" The statement continued: \"Beyonc\u00e9's performance with Dixie Chicks was a highlight of the evening and we are continuing to share the amazing full-length performance clip via our official social channels.\" Sarah Trahern, chief executive of the Country Music Association,\u00a0 told\u00a0The New York Times \u00a0that the only deleted social media post was the promotional clip, taken down at the request of Beyonc\u00e9's camp. \"Fans can get kind of passionate and read other things into it.\" she said. As for why there were relatively few posts about the singer's popular performance, Trahern said that had to do with the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 and her team had\u00a0special requests: Beyonc\u00e9 had to have her own photographer and would approve only one live video of the performance for ABC.com. Many on Twitter noticed that the CMA's accounts largely ignored Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0and the Dixie Chicks, including the official\u00a0Dixie Chicks account, which retweeted the sentiment, \"So, @dixiechicks make a massive comeback with @Beyonce last night & @CountryMusic tries to cover it up?\" So, @dixiechicks make a massive comeback with @Beyonce last night & @CountryMusic tries to cover it up? https://t.co/kDlgbMGdJz #CMAawards50 \u2014 Big D (@BigDradio) November 3, 2016 Others on Twitter called out the CMA, and noticed that the promotional Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0clip was deleted. . @CountryMusic , why did you delete your tweets referring to @Beyonce 's performance at the #CMAawards50 ?

    "text": "Got it By Noy Thrupkaew November 3 at 7:00 AM Former au pair Andrea Villa lost her job, her residence and, potentially, her legal immigration status when a dispute developed between her and her host family. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) It was the stuffed sheep\u2019s fault. Fuzzy, faded, beloved by Andrea Villa\u2019s 4-year-old charge, remarkable to others only for its talent for disappearing. The toy known as Sheepy would go missing at least once a week, inspiring fits of crying from the little girl and a frantic search by her parents and Villa, their Colombian au pair. Desperate to break the cycle, Villa turned to a tactic she\u2019d learned from watching \u201cSupernanny\u201d: The little girl would put Sheepy in a special spot by the window each time she was done playing with it. The strategy worked, until one day it didn\u2019t, exacerbating simmering tensions that resulted in Villa\u2019s expulsion from the house in Northern Virginia where the 28-year-old had worked for three months. Villa, now 32, chuckles ruefully at the memory. Petite, with bright green eyes and a penchant for equally bright clothing, she\u2019s sitting in her tidy Alexandria, Va., apartment. It\u2019s sparely furnished but for a few mementos: a framed certificate from Georgetown University, a purple vase of fabric flowers. Since that incident in 2012, Villa has graduated from business school and, under her student visa, is learning about payroll, invoices and estimates at a painting company. By all measures, she\u2019s come a long way from the time she lost her job, her residence and, potentially, her visa status in one swoop. But the memory still stings. \u201cI felt awful,\u201d she recalls. \u201cScared. I was thinking, \u2018Where will I stay? Maybe I have to go back to Colombia.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Thousands of 18- to 26-year-old foreigners become au pairs annually under a 12-month State Department cultural-exchange program . In 2015, 17,588 au pairs worked in the United States, according to State Department data, with 3,062 of them in the District, Maryland and Virginia. (The top five participating states are New York, California, New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts.) Drawn by promises of American adventure, educational opportunity and the warm embrace of a host family, the au pairs provide up to 45 hours of child care a week in exchange for room, board and a weekly stipend of $195.75, about $10,000 a year. At 45 hours, that would work out to $4.35 an hour. The federal minimum wage is $7.25; many state minimum wages are higher. That stipend amounts to systematic wage theft, according to a 2014 lawsuit filed in Colorado on behalf of five au pairs against 15 sponsor agencies that then administered the program. The origin of the weekly compensation is a major element of the suit: The plaintiffs allege that the agencies set the stipend based on incorrectly interpreted federal regulations; the agencies respond that they set the stipend based on State Department guidelines. Twelve of the now 16 sponsor agencies failed to return calls or declined to answer questions for this article; of the four that responded, none commented on pending litigation or the setting of stipends. The State Department also declined to comment directly on pay issues, citing the pending legal action. The plaintiffs plan to seek class-action status for the suit, which had nine named plaintiffs as of press time and which they believe could cover as many as 50,000 current or former au pairs. In March, U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling that the case can go forward. Many au pairs have wonderful, formative experiences, seeing much of the States and building lifelong relationships. But others say they have been subjected to mistreatment by host families or agencies. One Arlington, Va., au pair \u2014 who worked up to 75 hours a week, plus nights, caring for a colicky baby \u2014 became the subject of American University law professor Janie Chuang\u2019s critique of the au pair program, published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Gender in 2013. Another local au pair, Edna Valenzuela, was featured in news accounts after her agency initially refused to extend her visa so she could receive free, potentially life-saving treatment following a cancer diagnosis \u2014 despite the support of her host family, the fact that she could not receive the care at home and the assurances of the American doctor who was treating her that she\u2019d be able to continue working. (She is now cancer-free as a result of the treatment she was able to receive in the States.) Critics of the au pair program \u2014 including current and former participants, advocates for migrant and domestic workers, private attorneys and legal scholars \u2014 say au pairs are vulnerable to sexual harassment and assault, though few are willing to press charges and only a handful have gone to court. Two au pairs have wound up as victims of human trafficking, according to a 2012 decision on a federal human-trafficking case in Chicago. \u201cThese are the people who care for our children,\u201d says Chuang. \u201cHow much do they have to suffer for us to care about them?\u201d This story, however, focuses on experiences such as Andrea Villa\u2019s, which illustrate the more common disputes involving wages, hours and clashing assumptions \u2014 and the tenuous positions of au pairs who speak up about them. (Illustrations by Matt Rota) It is important to note that not all au pairs are responsible, loving caregivers. And there have been at least four court cases filed since the mid-1990s that allege that au pairs have physically or sexually abused the children in their care, in addition to the widely reported 1997 case against English au pair Louise Woodward, who was convicted of shaking her small charge to death. Yet the very nature of the au pair program, critics argue, makes it most susceptible to misuse by agencies and host parents. \u201cThe agency, they are making money with our work,\u201d says Villa. \u201cBut the families are their customers, so the agencies aren\u2019t on our side if we have a problem.\u201d As the reporting for this story demonstrates, dozens of au pairs claim they have been mistreated. It\u2019s not clear how common their experiences are; language barriers and au pairs\u2019 concerns about being sent home can make it difficult to quantify the problem. But what is clear is that the way the program is structured makes it tough for au pairs who believe they are being mistreated to find recourse. Part of the problem is categorization. The program, launched with a pilot in 1986 under the U.S. Information Agency, is officially classified as an \u201cexchange visitor program\u201d and is housed at the Department of State. Yet in practice, critics say, it functions more like a guest-worker program. Government agencies have questioned the setup almost since its inception. In 1987, an interagency panel of representatives from the State Department, Labor Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service and USIA determined that full-time child-care work programs did not qualify as cultural-exchange programs. The au pair agencies fought efforts to reclassify the program, however, and Congress declined to move it out of USIA or reduce its participants\u2019 hours. The same debates have continued: As recently as 2012, the State Department\u2019s own Office of Inspector General questioned \u201cthe appropriateness of allowing what are essentially work programs to masquerade as cultural exchange activities.\u201d Parents who think they are obtaining \u201cone of the most affordable childcare options available, especially if you have a gaggle of kids,\u201d in the words of one agency, GreatAuPair, are hiring au pairs being told by the same agency that they will have the opportunity to visit \u201cgreat cities, improve your English, and learn more about American culture.\u201d This can lead to clashing expectations and disputes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a citizen ambassador.\u201d Andrea Villa The State Department declares the Exchange Visitor Program, under which the au pair program falls, \u201cfirst and foremost an educational and cultural exchange. The primary goal is to allow participants the opportunity to engage broadly with Americans\u201d and, if there is a work component, \u201clearn new skills or build skills that will help them in future careers.\u201d The 16 designated U.S. au pair agencies, most of them for-profit businesses, recruit, select and train au pairs, connect them with host families and oversee their visa status. Although the department\u2019s au pair program brochure concludes with a disclaimer \u2014 \u201cPlease Note: No guarantee of performance or competency is made by the designation of sponsor organizations\u201d \u2014 it instructs au pairs who have concerns to turn first to their sponsoring agency. Critics such as Chuang say oversight of the program is inadequate. The approximately 100-employee Office of Private Sector Exchange is tasked with monitoring all 15 of the J-1 Visa Exchange Visitor Programs, which include more than 300,000 participants coming to the United States annually to work, study or teach. The State Department initiated a routine internal review of the au pair program in January 2014 and completed it a year later but has not released any results. Officials said they were unable to comment on the content or timing of any new rules. In the interim, the department has made changes to its oversight of the au pair program. The offices that monitor and sanction non-compliant agencies no longer rely on sponsor fees for their funding, which had presented a potential conflict of interest noted by the department\u2019s inspector general. The department also implemented a system of \u201cmeet and greets,\u201d wherein au pairs meet with department staffers, without the presence of agency representatives, to discuss their experiences. It has conducted more than 90 such meetings so far this year. Andrea Villa laughs when she is read a State Department letter sent to new au pairs. \u201c[Y]ou are among many young adult exchange visitors serving as your country\u2019s citizen ambassador in the United States.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t a citizen ambassador,\u201d she says. What was she? \u201cI was a Cinderella.\u201d Former au pairs Loriena Sanchez and Andrea Villa meet for lunch at a Bolivian restaurant in Alexandria. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Villa\u2019s first au pair experience involved a family she had stayed with in 2009 as an exchange student taking English at the International Center for Language Studies in Washington. The Clarks lived in Arlington, had twin girls she adored and were warm and genuinely interested in her life. When they asked her in 2011 to return as their au pair, she leaped at the chance. The Clarks turned to Au Pair International, based in Boulder, Colo., to handle the process; in Bogota, Villa says, she completed the process through Cultural Travel Colombia. Villa went through a barrage of tests and certifications: English-language interview, CPR- and first-aid certification, a psychological-assessment test, swimming test, even a pregnancy test. But the most startling requirement was the $1,600 fee that Villa says she was asked to pay to begin the application process \u2014 more than twice the average monthly salary in Colombia. Villa emailed the Clarks, who were just as surprised. It didn\u2019t make sense to them that she should have to pay to get a job when they were already paying a U.S. agency thousands of dollars. Nevertheless, the Clarks told Villa they would cover the expense. \u201cI was so lucky,\u201d says Villa. \u201cAll the other au pairs have to pay because they don\u2019t have someone to fight for them.\u201d The high cost of participating in the program can be a significant hurdle for prospective au pairs, who are required by agencies to pay for a range of incidentals, which may include \u201cprocessing fees,\u201d embassy-interview fees, visa-application fees and even airfare supplements. Some, such as Villa, also report paying overseas recruitment fees. Three of the top five sending countries are Brazil, Colombia and Mexico; recruitment fees there can place a large financial burden on economically vulnerable participants. Legislative efforts to do away with recruitment fees have run into opposition from the agencies, which have encouraged host families to join them in lobbying against bills that the agencies argue would increase costs. Using an au pair for child care is a good deal, especially in high-cost areas such as Washington. Factoring in agency fees of up to $8,500, the fixed au pair stipend and $500 toward the au pair\u2019s required course work at a post-secondary institution, families pay roughly $19,000 a year. Even considering the expense of supplying room and board, that\u2019s a considerable savings over the average cost for a full-time nanny in Washington, which, according to the New America think tank, is $33,366 \u2014 the highest in the nation. In addition to unexpected recruitment fees, au pairs are often startled by the predominance work takes after they arrive. \u201cThey do say you have to work 45 hours a week, help the family,\u201d says Caroline Nascimento da Silva, a Brazilian who worked as an au pair in Arlington. \u201cBut they don\u2019t emphasize it.\u201d Au pairs also can experience difficulties obtaining the cultural and educational experiences they\u2019ve been promised. Families who live in the suburbs do not always make transportation available, for example, and the $500 host parents pay toward educational expenses doesn\u2019t stretch far beyond basic English-as-a-second-language classes in the Washington region. Villa says she felt awful when her dispute with a host family led to her losing her job and potentially having to leave the country. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) When their year-long experience comes to a close, au pairs have the option to extend for up to 12 more months. Villa was eager to stay in the States to continue her course work, she says, but the Clarks no longer had enough hours for her. So, at the suggestion of Au Pair International, she put up a profile on Care.com, a website that connects caregivers and families, to find another match. When a new family got in touch, Villa was relieved. The husband, wife and two daughters, 4 and 6, also lived in Northern Virginia and seemed kind. Eager to nail down her visa, she did not wait to see if anyone else would contact her. The new family, who declined through an intermediary to be interviewed for this story, timed Villa\u2019s arrival to coincide with the last week of their exiting au pair, Yuka Yamada, who is from Japan. Villa got her first inkling of trouble on Yamada\u2019s last day, when the children\u2019s computer broke and, Yamada says, the host mother accused Yamada of allowing the children to do the damage, or doing it herself. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me to pay, but I felt terrible to be accused of doing that,\u201d Yamada says via Skype from China, where she\u2019s now studying Chinese. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch the computer.\u201d Although she remains in touch with the family and characterizes her relationship with them as good, she regrets that fraught exit. \u201cIt was my last day of my year there, and I cried that it was ending that way.\u201d Yamada says that she occasionally worked over the mandated maximum number of hours, for which she was paid, and that she willingly agreed to sometimes walk and feed the family\u2019s dog. Having been bitten by a dog as a child, Villa did not want to care for the large Saint Bernard, however, and the family acquiesced. She also balked at the extra hours. Her first hosts, the Clarks, suggested she ask for an additional $12 to $21 an hour for the overtime. Villa says the second host father agreed to $6, which disappointed her. The days with the second family could stretch to 12 hours, and those days into 60-hour weeks, Villa alleges. She says she would wake up at 6:30, feed the girls breakfast, drop the older girl off at school, bathe, care for and feed lunch to the younger one, pick up the older one at school, feed the girls snacks, and manage their activities and homework until their parents came home around 7 and made dinner. In between, she says, she would clean the kitchen and vacuum the whole house \u2014 chores she believed went beyond the au pair responsibilities to do light housework related to the children. After her long workdays, Villa would collapse in her basement room. She had little energy to study, she says, and had the gnawing sense that the parents saw her less as a member of their family and more as someone who could be squeezed for more work. Villa\u2019s state concerned her first host mother, Eva Clark. \u201cIt just seemed they were really taking advantage of her,\u201d says Clark. \u201cI could see her getting very down, and Andrea\u2019s a very upbeat, positive, super-helpful, super-friendly person.\u201d Interviews with au pairs suggest that working over the maximum is commonplace, even though agencies can in theory be sanctioned under State Department rules if they fail to ensure host families\u2019 compliance with the 45-hour ceiling. It is also a potential violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which applies to au pairs and requires that employers keep time records of employees\u2019 hours. Au pairs have an opportunity during monthly check-ins with local agency representatives to report any problems regarding hours or cultural or educational opportunities. But it can be difficult for the au pairs to speak up. According to interviews and the class-action lawsuit, they often feel isolated, reliant on host families for food and transportation (even to those monthly check-in meetings), and uncertain how and when to draw the line. Others have taken out loans for recruitment fees, making them even more reluctant to risk being sent home in debt if they anger their host families or agencies. Some worry that they will face long-term consequences if they come forward. When an agency marks an au pair\u2019s status as \u201cterminated\u201d (indicating a program violation instead of the routine \u201ccompleted\u201d designation), it could affect her ability to return to the States in the future, a fear that has kept au pairs from speaking out, according to Julia Beebe of domestic-workers\u2019 rights group MataHari. \u201cThe immigration lawyers and other advocates we\u2019ve spoken with don\u2019t feel confident that a protesting au pair won\u2019t be deported,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we can offer them a guarantee that they can speak out publicly without fear of retaliation.\u201d Villa is learning bookkeeping at a painting company in Alexandria. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Three months into Villa\u2019s stay with the second family, Sheepy went missing. The little girl, wailing, went upstairs to her mother. Her big sister followed. Not wanting to intrude, Villa says, she went to her room, where she began to receive texts from the girls\u2019 mother, questioning her tactic with the stuffed toy and telling her it wasn\u2019t her job to help raise the girls. The next morning, Villa alleges, the girls\u2019 father reprimanded her for going to her room rather than remaining upstairs to fold laundry or do other housework. Villa felt overworked, underappreciated and undermined in her authority to care for the girls. She called her agency, which contacted the host family, then called her back and told her she\u2019d have to leave by the end of the week. But when she got home, her host father told her to leave the next day. Although her local agency representative offered Villa a place to stay at her house, Villa declined. She stayed with friends while she scrambled to find a new family through the rematch process, a high-stakes undertaking in which she had to find a new job within a \u201creasonable period\u201d (as stated in her contract) or fly home at her own expense. Permission to rematch is a matter of agency \u201cdiscretion,\u201d her contract says, as is agency assistance in finding a new family or temporary housing. Villa says that in her case, the local agency representative told her to put her profile back up on Care.com and did not offer any further assistance in finding a new family. Au Pair International, Villa\u2019s agency, did not respond to multiple calls and requests for comment. \u201cI felt awful,\u201d she says now. \u201cAwful.\u201d Her former host mother was alarmed as well. Clark says she called Villa\u2019s agency twice but received no response. She says she looked for a way to contact the State Department but couldn\u2019t find the proper channel. \u201cI thought, \u2018Who can I possibly call to get help? There\u2019s got to be some sort of monitoring of this program that we can report them to or at least get them to look into the situation.\u2019 And I couldn\u2019t find any help.\u201d Since that time, the State Department website for the program has added a hotline and an email address for reporting abuse. Au pair advocates would also like to see a central list of host families who have been accused of violating program rules and a system for collecting confidential feedback from all au pairs. In 2011, the Office of Private Sector Exchange, which oversees the au pair program, began to keep a record of complaints \u2014 logging 237 so far, though spokesman Nathan Arnold says, \u201cNot every incident will be reported to the department.\u201d The complaints were mostly centered on \u201cexpectation management,\u201d involving issues such as hours and pay, according to Deputy Assistant Secretary Keri Lowry, who declined to speak on specifics. Records from the class-action lawsuit and incidents that resulted in official complaints to the State Department reveal a wide range of allegations. One au pair said she was told to cook for the family while not being allowed to eat with them. Another said she was barred from eating the family\u2019s food and left behind to care for the children while the parents went away for days. Another said she was exposed to racist jokes, and another said she was forced to start work at 4 a.m. MataHari\u2019s Beebe says her organization has received 35 complaints since August 2015 for issues that include working far over the maximum 45 hours a week and sexual harassment. Villa did find a rematch, via an au pair friend who was heading home and recommended Villa to take her place. Her next family was gracious and inviting, and Villa \u201cfelt so blessed to be moving into that house. It was like coming back to life.\u201d She took care of one 7-year-old boy and had time to study in between her work hours. But even today, visiting the old neighborhood can leave her shaken. In November 2014, Colorado nonprofit Towards Justice filed suit against the au pair agencies after Colombian au pair Johana Paola Beltran told them she had paid $2,500 in recruitment fees and had been asked to cook her host family\u2019s dinner every night and feed their eight chickens, but had not been allowed to eat with the family. Her lawyers, unfamiliar with the au pair program, were shocked at her paltry stipend. \u201cHow and why is that happening in a functional capitalist society?\u201d asked Nina DiSalvo, Towards Justice executive director. In 2015, Boies, Schiller & Flexner came on as co-counsel for the suit. The plaintiffs allege that the agencies violated anti-trust laws by colluding to set au pair wages; misled families and au pairs into thinking that the stipend was set by the State Department rather than the agencies themselves; and fixed the wage to a sum that violates federal, state and local minimum wage laws. It seeks damages including back pay for its potential class of 50,000 current and former au pairs. \u201cSometimes I think America has a double face. ...\u201d Andrea Villa Meanwhile, MataHari has been actively working to organize nannies and au pairs since 2015. \u201cOnce [au pairs] start understanding the program, they start wondering why they\u2019re getting paid so minimally,\u201d says Beebe. \u201cThey\u2019re meeting other ladies \u2014 nannies \u2014 in the park getting paid four times as much with fewer kids, and then they become very interested in learning their rights.\u201d Advocates have called for moving oversight of the au pair program to the Department of Labor, or for reducing the number of required work hours to 30. When asked about moving the program under Labor, State Department spokesman Arnold responds that State believes it belongs under cultural exchange. \u201cOur discussions with au pairs indicate that they are motivated to come to the United States mainly in order to practice their English, learn about the country through living with a host family for a year, and through travel,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I think America has a double face, especially the immigration system,\u201d Villa says, reflecting on her experience. \u201cThey say this program is for you to come and learn English and travel while you take care of kids. But ... no one will make sure you have a good family and a good schedule. The au pair doesn\u2019t have protections.\u201d Villa, who is considering joining the class-action lawsuit, is thinking through her own solutions. \u201cMaybe this is crazy, but I think about opening an au pair agency,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of paying the agency $6,000, the family pays $3,000. And then pays $3,000 for the au pairs\u2019 education. The au pairs work 30 hours a week and are paid more. I don\u2019t know if it is possible, but it would be good.\u201d Noy Thrupkaew is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles. Editor\u2019s note: For this story, reported in cooperation with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute, writer Noy Thrupkaew drew on thousands of pages of legal documents and court transcripts, news articles, academic studies, a survey of 150 former and current au pairs, and interviews with au pairs, host families, workers\u2019 rights advocates, government officials and au pair agency staff.

    "text": "Timeline of the Wells Fargo Accounts Scandal By Paul Blake Nov 3, 2016, 4:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Wells Fargo Faces $185 Million Fine in Fraud Allegations 0 Shares Wells Fargo is embroiled in a scandal over assertions that bank employees opened accounts without customers\u2019 authorization. Here's a timeline of key events since the allegations came to light: Sept. 8, 2016 The alleged misconduct was revealed when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Los Angeles City Attorney and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) fined the bank $185 million, alleging that more than 2 million bank accounts or credit cards were opened or applied for without customers' knowledge or permission between May 2011 and July 2015. A bank official acknowledged that it had terminated some 5,300 employees, roughly 1 percent of the workforce, in relation to the allegations, and the bank issued a statement saying, \"We regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request.\" Read our story from the time, or see how the scandal affects customers . Sept. 13, 2016 The bank announced that it would be ending its controversial employee sales goals program that was at the center of the allegations effective Jan. 1, 2017. According to the Los Angeles City Attorney, employees were opening and funding accounts without customers' permission or knowledge in order to \"satisfy sales goals and earn financial rewards under the bank's incentive-compensation program.\" The CFPB said the bank imposed the goals on its staff because it \"sought to distinguish itself in the marketplace as a leader in 'cross-selling' banking products and services to its existing customers.\" Read our story from the time. The same day, Stumpf appeared on CNBC, where he rebuffed suggestions that he resign. \"I think the best thing I could do right now is lead this company, and lead this company forward,\" he said. Sept. 14, 2016 It was announced that the FBI and federal prosecutors in New York and California were probing the bank over the alleged misconduct, a development that opened the possibility of criminal charges. Read our story from the time. Sept. 16, 2016 The House of Representative's Financial Services Committee opened an investigation into the bank's alleged misconduct as well as \"the role of Washington regulators in monitoring and investigating\" the alleged misconduct. A letter sent to the bank's general counsel asked him to make four senior executives available for transcribed interviews, including Carrie Tolstedt. Tolstedt, who government filings say is in her mid-50s, was the head of Wells Fargo's community banking division -- which oversees the banks most consumers are familiar with -- until her retirement was announced in July. The CFPB and OCC did not comment. Read our story from the time. The same day, three Utah residents filed what is believed to be the first class-action lawsuit brought by customers against Wells Fargo over the allegations. Wells Fargo declined to comment on the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Utah. Read our story from the time. Sept. 20, 2016 Stumpf appeared in front of the Senate Banking Committee, where Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Massachusetts, called on him to resign and said he should face criminal charges. Republicans chided the embattled CEO as well, with Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tennessee, saying Stumpf would be engaging in \"malpractice\" if the bank didn't \"claw back\" money that it had paid to executives during the period that the accounts were being opened without customers' permission. Read our story from the time. Sept. 22, 2016 A group of Senate Democrats asked the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to open an investigation into whether Wells Fargo violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In response to the senators' request to the DOL, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer G. Dunn told ABC News today that \"our team members are our greatest asset.\" \"We strive to make every one of them feel valued, rewarded and recognized and we pride ourselves on creating a positive environment for our team members, including market-competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits and a strong offering of work-life programs,\" Dunn added. The DOL acknowledged receipt of the letter and a spokesman, Jason Surbey, said, \"while we cannot discuss details of potential law enforcement decision-making, we do take the concerns raised in the letter very seriously.\" Separately, Stumpf resigned from his position on the Federal Advisory Council, which meets with the Federal Reserve four times a year to advise it on banking and economic issues, effective today. The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank confirmed the move to ABC News. Read our story from the time. Sept. 23, 2016 In a letter shared with ABC News, six senators slammed Wells Fargo bank for its use of forced arbitration clauses in its customer account agreements, which the senators said enabled the company to keep its accounts scandal out of the public eye and the courts for years, and asked embattled CEO John Stumpf to provide information so that they can \u201cbetter understand the situation at Wells Fargo\u201d and \"prevent similar fraudulent practices in the future.\" Arbitration, mandated in some if not all basic agreements that customers sign when they open accounts at the bank, \"helps hide fraudulent schemes such as the sham accounts at Wells Fargo from the justice system, from the news media, and from the public eye,\" the senators wrote. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman told ABC News at the time: \"We are reviewing the letter and will respond to the senators who requested this information but have no further comment at this time.\" Read our story from the time. Sept. 26, 2016 Two former Wells Fargo employees filed a lawsuit against the bank related to the accounts scandal. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit. The suit, filed on Sept. 22 in California Superior Court by former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi, seeks to represent employees or former employees who worked for the bank during the last 10 years and who, the suit alleges, were \u201ceither demoted, forced to resign, or terminated,\u201d for not meeting \u201cimpossible\u201d quotas the bank set as goals for employees to open accounts on behalf of customers. Wells Fargo officials said at the time that they \"disagree with the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously defend against the misrepresentations it contains about Wells Fargo and all of the Wells Fargo team members whose careers have been built on doing the right thing by our customers every day.\" \"Wells Fargo works hard to foster a culture that is centered on doing what is right for our customers and exhibiting high ethical standards and integrity, and the vast majority of our team members serve our customers\u2019 best interests every day in every interaction,\" the statement added. Read our story from the time. Sept. 27, 2016 The bank's independent directors announced that Stumpf will forgo $41 million worth of promised compensation as well as his usual salary as they launch an independent investigation. The announcement came two days before Stumpf was set to testify at a House hearing over the accounts scandal. The directors also announced that Tolstedt had left the company. She was slated to leave at \"year's end,\" according to a retirement announcement. Tolstedt, who has been the subject of scrutiny in recent weeks, will not receive a bonus for the year and will not receive severance pay, the directors said in a statement. Similar to Stumpf, she will forgo promised share compensation worth about $19 million. Stumpf, who has been CEO since 2007, will also not receive a bonus, the statement said. Separately, in remarks prepared for Stumpf's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, which were obtained and reviewed by ABC, the CEO is expected to say that the bank is moving up the date it will end its controversial sales program from Jan. 1, 2017 to Oct. 1, 2016. Read our story. Sept. 29, 2016 Just over a week after facing blistering questions in front of a Senate panel, Stumpf went back to Capitol Hill, where he received verbal lashings and further calls to resign from members of the House Financial Services Committee over the scandal. The hearing lasted for more than four brutal hours, with Republicans and Democrats lambasting Stumpf. The committee chairman, Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, opened by saying: \"Fraud is fraud. Theft is theft. And what happened at Wells Fargo over the course of many years cannot be described any other way.\" Read our story. Oct. 3, 2016 The scandal bled into the election, with Hillary Clinton slamming the company during a campaign stop in Toledo, Ohio. Holding up the bank's accounts scandal as an example of \"egregious corporate behavior,\" the Democratic presidential nominee pledged to strengthen consumer protections and further scrutinize corporate America if elected. \u201cLook at Wells Fargo,\" she said as the crowd booed. \"Really shocking, isn't it? It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.\u201d Read our story. Oct. 5, 2016 Fourteen senators sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch urging the Justice Department to \"thoroughly investigate the culpability of senior executives\" at Wells Fargo, as ABC News first reported. The letter suggests that the investigation of senior executives is needed in order to reassure Americans that wealthy corporate leaders can not \u201cpurchase a higher class of justice for themselves.\u201d \u201cFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, the American people watched as senior executives repeatedly escaped accountability for actions that nearly brought down the global economy,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cNo top Wall Street executives went to prison or even faced prosecution.\u201d The senators added: \u201cInstead, the government regularly settled for a penalty that was borne by the bank\u2019s shareholders, not its executives.\u201d Read about the letter, which was reported by ABC News first. Oct. 12, 2016 Shortly after markets closed, word came that Stumpf was out. The bank said he would retire as CEO and Chairman effective immediately. Tim Sloan, an employee of the company for 29 years, took his spot as CEO and Stephen Sanger took over as board chairman. In the same statement announcing Stumpf's retirment, Sloan was quoted as saying that his \"immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo.\" A company official and a source familiar with the the matter told ABC News that outgoing CEO wouldn't receive a severance package. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Stumpf would have access to retirement benefits after six months. The source couldn't detail those benefits at the time. Read our story from the time. Oct. 19, 2016 California Attorney General Kamala Harris launched a criminal investigation into whether Wells Fargo employees committed false impersonation and identity theft as part of the accounts scandal. Documents shared with ABC News included a search warrant requesting, among other things, documents and data related to bank products and services \u201cthat have been identified as being created or issued for the customer without the customer\u2019s consent,\u201d from May 2011 to July 2015. According to the warrant, investigators are also requesting the the names and other identifying information for employees and managers who may have opened or authorized the opening of accounts allegedly without customers\u2019 permission. Asked about the California investigation, a Wells Fargo spokesman said that the bank was cooperating by providing the requested information. Read our story from the time. Oct. 24, 2016 Wells Fargo began running television advertisements, to complement an ad campaign running in other media, in an effort to restore trust in its brand. The ads featured its signature horse-drawn carriage motif and pledges to address customer concerns. A company spokesman said that more ads would be introduced in the coming weeks. Read our story from the time. November 3, 2016 The bank disclosed in regulatory filings that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating its sales practices. In its standard filings made with the SEC, the bank detailed all of the regulatory and law enforcement agencies that had their eyes on its practices. The bank said that \"formal and informal inquiries, investigations or examinations\" were being undertaken by agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice, congressional committees, the SEC, California state prosecutors and attorneys general. The bank said in the filings that it had \"responded, and continues to respond, to requests from a number of the foregoing seeking information regarding these sales practices.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- An Iowa man charged Thursday with fatally shooting two police officers in ambush-style attacks was under intense financial pressure and had been ordered to move out of his mother\u2019s basement just hours before the slayings. Scott Michael Greene Des Moines Police Department Scott Michael Greene , 46, was arrested Thursday afternoon after detectives questioned him at the Des Moines police station. Greene was secured with the handcuffs that had belonged to the patrolmen who were killed, Des Moines Sgt. Anthony Beminio and Urbandale officer Justin Martin, and was being transported to the county jail. Greene was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. If convicted, he would receive an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole. A statement from Des Moines police said the investigation has produced probable cause to support the charges but didn\u2019t elaborate. Police said earlier Thursday that a search dog recovered a high-powered rifle in a wooded area that they believe Greene used to fire on the officers. Greene had been hospitalized for treatment of a pre-existing medical condition following his surrender Wednesday morning. He left the hospital Thursday. Court documents show that Greene, an unemployed father who lived in the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale, was increasingly desperate for money in recent weeks. District Judge Carla Schemmel ruled Tuesday that Greene had committed elder abuse against his 66-year-old mother, Patricia Greene, by \u201cphysically hitting and financially exploiting\u201d her. She ordered him to move out of his mother\u2019s home, where he had been living in a basement bedroom, before Nov. 6 and to stay away from the home for a year. Urbandale police officers gather outside the home of Scott Michael Greene, the suspected gunman of two police officers who were shot and killed in separate attacks described as \u201cambush-style\u201d in Urbandale and Des Moines, Iowa, Nov. 2, 2016. Reuters/Scott Morgan Patricia Greene had applied for the restraining order Oct. 19, two days after she was arrested and charged with striking her son in the face during an altercation that he had recorded with his cellphone. She wrote in the application that she believed her son \u201cset me up to get me in trouble.\u201d Patricia Greene wrote that while she was in jail, Scott Greene told one of her friends that Patricia Greene needed to give him $20,000 and that if his mother paid, \u201che would move and not bother\u201d her again. Patricia Greene also wrote that her son had sent \u201ca bunch of rambling, offensive\u201d text messages, warned that he would no longer take care of her cat and was going through her personal belongings. She said her son had subjected her to mental, emotional and financial abuse. A temporary protective order was issued Oct. 20. Schemmel issued the permanent order during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, where it was served on Scott Greene. The order, which warned that any violations would lead to his arrest, also directed Greene to return $10,000 to his mother and to not take any of her assets. Beminio, 38, and Martin, 24, were shot after 1 a.m. Wednesday while sitting in their patrol cars in separate incidents less than 2 miles apart. Several bullets were fired into the vehicles. The .223-caliber rifle believed to be used was discovered Wednesday by a dog with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives apparently hidden in a wooded area \u201cwhere no person probably could have found it,\u201d said Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek. Parizek became emotional Thursday during a news conference, where he thanked the community for its outpouring of support and said the officers represent \u201cthe security blanket you guys sleep under every night.\u201d He said a motive for the shootings remains unclear. Greene was hired last month to work at Central Iowa Fencing, a small construction business in suburban Des Moines, but quit within days, a manager there said Thursday. Greene \u201cwas pretty desperate\u201d for a job and told the company he had a teenage daughter he needed to support, officer manager Sara Nicklin said. Greene initially contacted the company looking for work last summer but there were no openings. The company gave Greene a chance after he inquired again last month, even though he had no experience building fences, Nicklin said. She said Greene was sent home on the morning of his third day of employment \u201cbecause he was not taking directions and wasn\u2019t working.\u201d Nicklin said the company gave Greene the chance to come back the next day on a different crew but \u201che chose not to show up\u201d and quit instead. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t like the work,\u201d Nicklin said. Greene posted a video on YouTube last week of a cellphone recording showing a worker driving a truck. Greene wrote below the video that he \u201cwas fired\u201d by Central Iowa Fencing after reporting unsafe driving. Nicklin said she hasn\u2019t seen the video but denied that Greene was fired. She said investigators have contacted the business, which has about 20 workers. \u201cWe wish we never would have contact with this person,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all devastated.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

He took himself to the University of Chicago Medicine, where his condition was stabilized.\u00a0 About 7 p.m., two people were shot in the 10020 block of South Malta Street in the East Beverly neighborhood, police said. A man suffered multiple wounds and was in critical condition. A 17-year-old boy suffered a graze wound to the head. Where the two were taken for treatment was not\u00a0immediately available, police said. Another man was wounded in the West Englewood neighborhood about 4:25 p.m. in the 7100 block of South Wolcott Avenue, police said. A 35-year-old man was approached by two people wearing all black. The two opened fire, striking him in the abdomen. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn where his condition was stabilized, police said. Shortly before 2:45 p.m., two people were shot in the 3800 block of West Flournoy Street in the West Garfield Park neighborhood, said Officer Kevin Quaid, a Chicago police spokesman. According to preliminary reports, two men were standing outside when they were approached by a gunman who fired in their direction, said Officer Thomas Sweeney. One of the victims, age 18, was shot in the leg. He was taken in good condition to Mount Sinai Hospital. The second man, age 22, also suffered a leg wound. He took himself to Rush University Medical Center where he was listed in good condition, Sweeney said. Earlier Thursday afternoon, police believed a 21-year-old man was shot in the hand in the 300 block of South Whipple Street in East Garfield Park. But doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital determined the wound was not from a gunshot. Shortly before 10 a.m., a 23-year-old man was shot on the Far North Side in the Rogers Park neighborhood. Police originally said that shooting happened in the 1400 block of West Lunt Avenue, but later corrected that to the 7000 block of North Glenwood Avenue. The victim suffered a\u00a0wound to the left leg and was taken to Presence St. Francis Hospital in Evanston where he was in good condition, Quaid said. According to preliminary reports, the man was standing outside when he saw someone point a gun from a passing vehicle. The man took off running and was struck in the buttocks, Quaid said. About 9:20 a.m., an 18-year-old man was wounded in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side. The man was shot in the hand in the 3500 block of West Jackson Boulevard, said Officer Ana Pacheco, a police spokeswoman.\u00a0 He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, she said. Check back for updates.

    "text": "Report: Upcoming Megyn Kelly book details sexual harassment by Roger Ailes William Cummings , USA TODAY 10:43 a.m. EDT November 4, 2016 2.8k Shares x Share In a leaked excerpt of her new book, \"Settle for More,\" the Fox News host reportedly talks about her experiences with Roger Ailes. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Megyn Kelly is revealing the\u00a0details of \u00a0her alleged sexual harassment by her former Fox News boss, Roger Ailes, in her upcoming book,\u00a0Settle For More, according to Radar Online, which says it obtained a copy of the book. Ailes offered to advance Kelly's career \"in exchange for sexual favors\" and he implied he would not renew her contract when she refused his advances, Kelly writes, according to Radar . Ailes was ousted as the CEO of Fox News\u00a0\u2014 a position he had held since the network's launch\u00a0\u2014 after former Fox News broadcaster Gretchen Carlson sued him for sexual harassment and other women came forward with similar allegations. Fox later settled with Carlson for $20 million. Kelly writes that the inappropriate\u00a0behavior began when she was told by her managing editor that she had \"captured the attention of Mr. Ailes\" while she was working as a legal correspondent for the network's Washington bureau, Radar reports. Ailes summoned her to several meetings in his New York office, and \"began pushing the limits,\u201d Kelly wrote, according to Radar. \u201cThere was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger\u2019s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me \u2014 veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the \u2018very sexy bras\u2019 I must have and how he\u2019d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\u201d She wrote that she rejected every offer from Ailes to advance her career in exchange for sex, but in January of 2006, she wrote Ailes\u00a0\u201ccrossed a new line \u2014 trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.\u201d When she pushed him away, \u201che asked me an ominous question: \u2018When is your contract up?\u2019 And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.\u201d The harassment ended six months later when Kelly reported Ailes to a supervisor\u00a0\u2014 who is left unnamed in Radar's account and presumably in the book as well\u00a0\u2014 and Kelly kept quiet until Carlson sued Ailes for harassment, she wrote, according to Radar. \u201cCrossing him was a major risk,\u201d Radar says she wrote, \u201cbut what if \u2014 God forbid \u2014 he was still doing it to someone?\u201d Kelly then related her experience to Lachlan Murdoch, the co-chairman of Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, Radar reported. When Ailes tried to get Fox News employees and on-air personalities to defend him from Carlson's allegations, Kelly stayed quiet. \u201cI was approached several times, and several times I refused,\u201d she wrote, according to Radar. The book is slated to come out on Nov. 15. \u00a0She is in active talks to renew her contract with Fox News and is seeking $20 million a year, according to The Wall Street Journal. Posted!

The effort is being coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, but reaches across the government to include the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, current and former officials say. Russia has been warned that any effort to manipulate the actual voting or vote counting would be viewed as a serious breach, intelligence officials say. \"The Russians are in an offensive mode and [the U.S. is] working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels,\" said Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. Officials are alert for any attempts to create Election Day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. But what is more likely, multiple U.S. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from Russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. For example, officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it. So far, document dumps attributed to the Russians have damaged Democrats and favored Trump. \"The Russians are in an offensive mode and [the U.S. is] working on strategies to respond.\" The Russians \"want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process in ways they've done elsewhere,\" said a senior Obama administration official. \"So this is to make sure that we have all the tools at our disposal and that we're prepared to respond to whatever it is that they do.\" \"We need to be prepared on every front, not just technical but messaging, and so on,\" the official added, saying the details were classified. \"Because any reporting irregularity could be incredibly disruptive. \u2026 They can cause tremendous chaos, and by the time we are able to attribute, the damage may have already been done.\" Officials were reluctant to discuss how they might be respond to such \"influence operations,\" other than to say they will make efforts to counter misinformation and keep open communication nodes. The U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security assess that it would be extremely difficult for even a nation-state actor to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber-attack, a second senior administration official told NBC News.

    "text": "State Dept. Drops More Clinton Emails Days From Election By JUSTIN FISHEL Nov 3, 2016, 4:28 PM ET 0 Shares Play Carlos Barria/Reuters WATCH Clinton Notes Women Couldn't Vote the Last Time the Chicago Cubs Won the World Series 0 Shares Email The State Department published an additional 1,280 pages of official email belonging to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this afternoon as part of a court-ordered effort to produce some of her more recently discovered correspondence before the presidential election . The documents come from the nearly 15,000 emails the FBI recovered during its investigation into the Democratic nominee's handling of sensitive information on a controversial private email server. When We Might Know More on FBI's Renewed Investigation Into Clinton's Email Server The State Department said today \"a significant number are 'near duplicates' of documents previously provided by former Secretary Clinton\" which have already been released to the public. \"For instance, a 'near duplicate' would be substantively identical to previously released emails,but for a top email in the chain stating 'Please print,'\" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said in an emailed statement. Some 5,600 of the 15,000 emails turned up by the FBI have been deemed work-related, but it's not clear how many of them actually consist of new material. The State Department is under a court order to release another batch of these emails on Friday and the rest will come in monthly, post-election tranches. But Clinton's emails woes have moved far beyond this highly-controlled process of releasing official correspondence from her private server. For nearly a month now, her campaign has been faced with a daily onslaught of hacked emails belonging to her campaign chairman John Podesta, published by document-leaking website WikiLeaks. In addition, the FBI announced last Friday that it has new emails in its possession that may be relevant to its investigation into her handling of classified information on her private server -- essentially re-opening a case that everyone thought had been closed on July 5 -- not to mention throwing a huge wrench into the gears just days before the election. Ironically, one new email from 2010 offers a suggestion on how Clinton ought to respond to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange after he posted roughly 250,000 State Department cables online. \"We view this not as a 'clever game' of wiki leaks but rather as a 'criminal act' against the United States of America,\" the email said. \"He [presumably Assange] might think this is a clever game today -- but when he is prosecuted and if convicted, he will move from being a clever-cyber thief to a convicted criminal -- and will find out that's a whole different kind of game.\" Six years after that email was written, Julian Assange remains free, holed-up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, avoiding extradition to Sweden over a sex-crimes investigation. His site, WikiLeaks, has continued publishing private government and corporate documents it obtains. 0 Shares ",

At the same time, U.S. officials have indicated that a second front against the terror group\u2019s administrative capital in Syria -- Raqqa -- could begin within weeks. As these ISIS strongholds come under assault, the whereabouts of the extremist group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi are in question. According to Col. John Dorrian, spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, \"If we knew where he was, he would be killed at once.\" While al-Baghdadi\u2019s exact location may not be known, some U.S. military analysts suspect he is holed up in Mosul. Officials say he has spent more time in Mosul than in Raqqa over the past two years, and there is no evidence he is in Syria at this time. Here\u2019s some of what is known about the secretive leader. WHO IS ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI? On June 29th, 2014, the jihadist extremist group ISIS declared the formation of a caliphate, an Islamic state, encompassing territory the organization seized in a lightning-fast run of terror across Iraq and Syria. Naming himself Caliph, or leader of the declared state, was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi born in Sumara in 1971. Days later, in early July, a man purported to be al-Baghdadi appeared during Friday prayers at a mosque in Mosul, the city considered the biggest prize in ISIS\u2019s march across the region. The appearance occurred during Ramadan , the holiest month in the Islamic year. At that time, al-Baghdadi confirmed the creation of the Islamic state and called on his followers to \"obey me as far as I obey God.\" Since then, the ISIS leader has not been seen in public and only rarely heard from. \"We really don\u2019t know that much, certainly not as much as we would like to know about his background, and especially about his location,\" Former National Counterterrorism Center director and former ABC News consultant, Matt Olson, said. \"He\u2019s extremely secretive and he\u2019s proven to be very elusive in terms of intelligence gathering efforts by the U.S. and others.\" An alleged audio speech by al-Baghdadi was released just a few days ago. It was the first time an audio message purported to be from the ISIS leader has appeared in ten months. According to an English translation by the SITE Intelligence Group, al-Baghdadi renewed efforts to motivate his fellow Sunni Muslims by claiming enemy Shi\u2019a Muslims will destroy them, urging them to \"start your actions\" in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. While the military would not confirm the authenticity of the tape, \"It is quite clearly an effort on the part of Daesh to communicate to their fighters,\" Col. Dorrian said. Daesh is an alternative name for ISIS. A NOM DE GUERRE Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the nom de guerre \u2013- or battlefield alias -- of Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri. He was already known to U.S. and Iraqi officials when he named himself as the Caliph in 2014. During the Iraq war , al-Baghdadi was held for ten months at American-run detention centers in Iraq, including Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca. An Islamic scholar, al-Baghdadi was a member of al-Qaeda in Iraq, prior to the group severing ties with the broader Al-Qaeda network. Officials believe he was responsible for several large scale attacks in Iraq after Osama Bin Laden \u2019s death at the hands of U.S. special operation forces in May, 2011. \"He\u2019s got a long background in being a militant. He sort of started down this path as early as 2003,\" according to Olsen. \"He\u2019s been in military circles and learning militant trade craft for in excess of a decade.\" IS AL-BAGHDADI IN COMMAND? As ISIS fighters dig in to defend their territory in Mosul and other areas, is al-Baghdadi in charge of the fight? Referring the latest purported audio message from al-Baghdadi, Col. Dorrian said, \"One of the interesting things we\u2019ve seen in this English translation of this is that Baghdadi is saying, 'Don\u2019t fight amongst yourselves.' This is the type of thing that a leader who\u2019s losing command and control and ability to keep everybody on the same page says.\" Some U.S. military commanders have said there are signs that he and a central leadership are guiding the fight. \"What we saw in the Manbij fight was direction from Baghdadi to his fighters to fight to the death,\" Gen. Joseph Votel, Commander of U.S. Central Command said in an October briefing. \"So, I do think there is direction coming from the centralized leadership,\" he said. \"But again, we have to respect our enemy and we have to recognize that he has leadership at the lower level that is also going to continue to make decisions.\" Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced in late October that 35 ISIS commanders in Mosul, some at the highest levels of leadership, had been killed in the three months leading up to the offensive to retake the town. \"In fact, you might say the most dangerous job in Iraq right now is to be the military emir of Mosul,\" Carter said while in Paris to meet with Coalition partners. Gary Cameron/Reuters U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter speaks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Oct. 28, 2016. \"We found that they had enough leadership experience and militant experience in their ranks that they could delegate a fair amount of authority to mid-level leaders,\" counterterrorism expert Olsen said. \"For operational purposes they didn\u2019t have to rely on Baghdadi or anyone in Raqqa giving direction.\" The U.S.-led coalition formed in September of 2014, just months after al-Baghdadi declared the formation of the caliphate. With the United States leading, 67 countries and other partners have worked to push ISIS fighters back on the battlefield, retake territory the group seized in Iraq and Syria and prevent its expansion to other parts of the globe. Nearly 16,000 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria have been conducted by the U.S. and a small group of other coalition members. With nearly 6,000 American advisors -- service members on the ground to advise and assist, but not engage in combat -- Iraq security forces have been able to retake more than 50 percent of the territory ISIS held, including cities like Ramadi and Fallujah. The Iraqis are now concentrating on Mosul. In Syria, the United States has inserted 300 special operations forces to work with the opposition, Syrian Democratic Forces. What to Know About the Upcoming Offensive to Take Raqqa, de Facto Capital of ISIS In an Orlando speech following the Pulse nightclub attack, President Obama said that 120 top ISIS leaders had been killed up to that point. \"ISIL is under more pressure than ever before,\" he said. \"ISIL continues to lose key leaders.\" Among them are military commanders from Mosul, Fallujah and a leader who planned attacks overseas. \"Our message is clear,\" the President said. \"If you target America and our allies you will not be safe. You will never be safe.\" U.S. officials have said they are getting closer to honing in on al-Baghdadi, as well. \"We are getting closer and closer and closer to the very core,\" McGurk said, \"It\u2019s really a matter of time for him.\" A $10 MILLION REWARD The United States government\u2019s Rewards for Justice program offers up to a $10 million reward for information leading to the arrest of al-Baghdadi. Only the leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is higher up on the State Department\u2019s Most Wanted list for terrorism, has a higher reward amount: up to $25 million.

Thursday. Patrick Semansky/AP hide caption toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, spoke at the Main Line Sports Center in Berwyn, Pa. Thursday. Patrick Semansky/AP The last time Melania Trump was in the spotlight, it did not end well. After her address at the Republican National Convention in July, it was discovered that several lines from Trump's speech were lifted from a Michelle Obama speech at the 2008 Democratic Convention. The plagiarism scandal led to online ridicule \u2014 her speech writer accepted responsibility saying that Trump had read passages of Obama's speech to her, which she then wrote down and included in the speech. Since then, she has appeared beside her husband occasionally, but rarely spoken, even when she was the butt of a Donald Trump joke (about his wife's plagiarized speech) at the Al Smith charity dinner last month . Thursday in Berwyn, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, at an event meant to appeal to white suburban, women voters, that changed. After a short introduction from Karen Pence, wife of GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, Melania Trump spent a little less than 15 minutes delivering prepared remarks that were as much an endorsement of her husband as herself. Article continues after sponsorship She detailed her upbringing in Slovenia, talked about looking up to Ronald Reagan in her youth, and pursuing a career in fashion and modeling. She ended the biographical portion of her speech by telling the crowd at the Main Line Sports Center Indoor Training Facility how honored she was to become an American citizen. \"It is the greatest privilege in the world,\" said Trump. \"I'm an immigrant. And let me tell you, no one values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me, both as an independent woman, and as someone who immigrated to America.\" I'm an immigrant. And let me tell you, no one values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me, both as an independent woman, and as someone who immigrated to America. Melania Trump Melania Trump also spoke about the joys of motherhood and raising her child with Donald Trump, Barron. And she said that should she become first lady, she'd be an advocate for women and children. Regarding children, Trump outlined what she says will be one of her main causes as first lady: fighting youth bullying, in person and online. \"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,\" said Trump. \"It is never O.K. when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when that happens on the playground and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet.\" She continued, \"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media. It will be one of the main focuses of my work if I'm privileged enough to become your first lady.\" Her condemnation of online bullying, especially in social media, could be seen as ironic, given her husband's particularly combative persona on Twitter. But after her speech, several in the crowd said that what Trump does is different than the behavior his wife called out. Helen Tracy from Marlton, N.J. said of Trump's Twitter history, \"He's not going after kids. He's not going after innocent people ... He's really after going after people in the Democratic Party or people who are in the media. So I think that's all fair game when you're running for office.\" Another Trump supporter in the crowd took time to defend Donald Trump and his history with women, after weeks of stories documenting allegations of sexual harassment and lewd comments from Trump. \"I have said worse things about men, than Donald Turmp has said about women,\" said Micky DiBella. Her friend, Joanne DiGiuseppe said many have criticized Trump and his behavior unfairly. \"Everybody's high and mighty, during this election.\" But she admitted that in spite of her and most of her friends supporting Trump, he has a problem with women voters, especially in suburbs like Berwyn. \"He is having trouble,\" she said. \"And the women around this area, are statistically not for Trump.\" ",

    "text": "Email With immigration taking a front seat in the U.S. presidential election, some voters may be wondering just how many unauthorized immigrants are working in the American labor market. The answer: Not as many as there were in 2008, according to new research from the Pew Research Center , which analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau. About 8 million unauthorized workers held jobs in the U.S. labor force in 2014, down from 8.3 million in 2008, during the recession, and 8.1 million in 2009. Since 2009, the American labor force -- or workers who were born in the U.S. or are lawful immigrants working here -- has expanded by 2.2 percent, which means unlawful immigrants are making up a smaller share of the labor force than they did in 2009. Republican candidate Donald Trump has focused on immigration as one of his top policy issues, saying that enforcing stricter regulations will boost wages and \u201censure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.\u201d Trump also insists as president he\u2019d build a wall across the border with Mexico, even though, as Pew found in a September report , the number of unauthorized Mexicans living in the U.S. has declined by about 500,000 since 2009.\u00a0 Pew Research Center With the rhetoric heating up about immigration, there are some widespread misperceptions about unauthorized immigrants, said Pew demographer Jeffrey Passel. \u201cI\u2019ve described the discussion as fact-free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis notion that they are doing jobs that Americans want to do doesn\u2019t show up in our data.\u201d Unauthorized immigrant workers tend to concentrate within a few industries, such as agriculture and construction, Pew found. But even the occupations with the largest share of unauthorized immigrant workers -- such as drywall installers, where unauthorized immigrants comprise 31 percent of all workers -- still had a much larger share of native-born employees. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that they \u201ctake jobs\u201d from natives,\u201d Passel said. \u201cThe major consequence is expanding the labor market, and expanding the economy. To the extent that there are groups out there that are affected by new immigrants, the main one is the previous immigrants.\u201d In some occupations, immigrants are filling in roles where native-born workers have retired, or they are finding work in occupations that aren\u2019t as appealing to U.S.-born workers, who typically have the means to find more job opportunities than illegal immigrants. Not surprisingly, unauthorized immigrants tend to work in low-skilled occupations, which is likely due to a lack of education as well as language barriers and the difficulty in finding other work because of their legal status. Pew Research Center So where are unauthorized immigrants coming from? Mexicans make up the biggest slice of the pie, despite their declining numbers. About 5.85 million unauthorized immigrants are from Mexico, compared with 700,000 from El Salvador, which is the second most likely country of birth for unauthorized immigrants. The country representing the biggest increase in unauthorized immigrants since 2009 is India, Pew found earlier this year. Since 2009, there has been an increase in unauthorized immigrants coming from China, Guatemala, and, lastly, Canada. The ranks of unauthorized workers declined in eight U.S. states from 2009 to 2014, including California, Georgia and South Carolina, while seven states witnessed increases in the number of unauthorized immigrants in their labor forces, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Pew found. Below are the 10 occupations with the highest share of unauthorized immigrant workers in 2014, according to Pew\u2019s analysis of the latest available data. 1. Drywall installers (31 percent of drywall installers are unauthorized immigrants) 2. Miscellaneous agricultural workers (30 percent) 3. Roofers (29 percent) 4. Painters, construction and maintenance (26 percent) 5. Brickmasons, block masons and stonemasons (25 percent) 6. Maids, housekeepers and cleaners (24 percent) 7. Carpet, floor and tile installers and finishers (24 percent) 8. Sewing machine operators (23 percent) 9. Construction laborers (21 percent) 10. Grounds maintenance workers (20 percent) \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Roger Morales/Chicago Tribune) A day in the life of Chicago, after 108 years of waiting, the Cubs won the 2016 World Series. (Roger Morales/Chicago Tribune) John Byrne Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The city will honor the World Series champion Chicago Cubs with a Friday \"parade to stand the test of time,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Thursday. The mayor, speaking shortly before noon at an unrelated event, said the parade will be held \"around this time.\" Specifics are being worked out \"as we speak,\" he said. He had no specifics on the route, telling reporters \"just stand somewhere in the middle of the city and you'll see it.\" \"I just talked to Tom Ricketts. I talked to him yesterday a couple times, I talked to him this morning again,\" Emanuel said when asked about the parade. \"I think all of us would just want 20 minutes of consistent sleep, then we're gonna \u2014 Here's the thing: we're going to have a parade in Chicago that will stand the test of time. It will be a parade that 108 years have waited for. It will be a parade and a celebration that all of Chicago for 108 years in their mind's eye, have been envisioning. We're going to make it a reality in the city of Chicago.\" Asked whether the Chicago River will be dyed blue, he said he would like to do that but wasn't certain if it would work. \"I want to do a lot of things,\" Emanuel said. The city had been planning to hold a parade Monday if the Cubs won Game 7, but the team asked to move it up to Friday, a City Hall source said. Baseball general managers will gather Monday in Scottsdale, Ariz. for four days of meetings. And many of the players have offseason homes in other cities and in countries in Latin America, and would prefer not to wait around until next week before getting out of town. Chicago Public Schools students won't have to play hooky to watch the parade \u2014 Friday already was scheduled day off. The mayor's comments came at an unrelated economic development announcement on the South Side. Wearing a Cubs championship hat that he said he grabbed on the field during the celebration in Cleveland, Emanuel repeatedly pleaded for understanding, noting he only got 11/2 hours of sleep after getting back to Chicago. Photos from Game 7 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland on Nov. 2, 2016. \"Where am I, and how did I get here?\" he joked at one point, adding that he forgot his kids' names at a parent-teacher conference at school Thursday.

Local news organizations report Dr. Gene Brewer told jurors Thursday stress could have caused Justin Ross Harris to forget his 22-year-old son Cooper Harris in the Hyundai Tucson, where the boy died in 2014. He added he retraced Harris' short drive to work and testified it's \"absolutely possible\" that Harris could have forgotten his child in such a situation. Brewer studies human memory and works in psychology at Arizona State University. Harris is accused of intentionally killing the boy by leaving him in the car in suburban Atlanta, where he moved from Alabama in 2012. Defense lawyers call the death accidental. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Why a Previously Proposed Route for the Dakota Access Pipeline Was Rejected By Catherine Thorbecke Nov 3, 2016, 4:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Timeline of Events Surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline 0 Shares Email President Obama said in an interview published this week that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was considering rerouting the Dakota Access Pipeline to accommodate the \"sacred lands of Native Americans,\" sparking speculation over the fate of the controversial crude oil pipeline. But it also prompted some to point out that the current path of the pipeline is actually a reroute itself, with critics calling this reroute an act of \"environmental racism.\" A previously proposed route for the 1,172-mile pipeline had it crossing the Missouri River north of Bismarck, North Dakota, according to a document filed as part of the permitting process . The eventual route that was decided on, and is currently in construction, moved the water crossing of the crude oil pipeline south of the North Dakota capital, to just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation. Dakota Access Standoff Unlikely to Reroute Pipeline Due to Major Hurdles, Some Experts Say \u201cThis pipeline was rerouted towards our tribal nations when other citizens of North Dakota rightfully rejected it in the interests of protecting their communities and water. We seek the same consideration as those citizens,\" Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said in a statement on Sunday. \"It\u2019s disappointing to see our state and federal officials advance their corporate, pro-Big Oil energy platform here in North Dakota at the expense of human health, safety and tribal sovereignty,\" Archambault added. Prominent activist Rev. Jesse Jackson , who joined protesters in North Dakota last week, called the reroute \"the ripest case of environmental racism I've seen in a long time.\" James MacPherson/AP Photo Protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline encampment sit on private property near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, owned by the pipeline developer, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, Oct. 26, 2016. The North Dakota Public Service Commission (PSC) refuted allegations of environmental racism, saying that the Bismarck route proposal was never submitted to the agency because permits for it were denied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during its environmental assessment. \u201cThe river crossing north of Bismarck was a proposed alternative considered by the [Dakota Access] company early in the routing process. This route was never included in the proposed route submitted to the PSC and therefore was never vetted or considered by us during our permitting process. It had been eliminated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their environmental assessment,\" North Dakota Public Service Commission Chair Julie Fedorchak said in statement on Oct. 27. \"The final permitted route follows an existing pipeline corridor that has been previously disturbed,\u201d added Fedorchak, who also serves as the \"pipeline siting portfolio holder,\" that is, the person in charge of permitting the pipeline route. Gene Pawlik, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, told ABC News today that \"the Army does not have a set timeframe to complete its ongoing review of previous DAPL permitting decisions. As part of this process, the Army is exploring a range of options that take into account concerns raised by the relevant stakeholders and will decide the best path to move forward.\" \"We cannot speculate on what the possible outcomes of the review might be,\" Pawlik added. In its environmental assessment, the Corps rejected the Bismarck route to protect wells that serve the municipal water supply, according to The Bismarck Tribune . The Bismarck route would also have been more than 10 miles longer and would have made it difficult to meet PSC requirements to keep the pipeline 500 feet or more away from homes, the Tribune reported. The current route of the pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe argues traverses culturally sacred sites and poses a risk to the reservation's water supply, was largely chosen because it runs along existing infrastructure such as railways and other pipelines, Dakota Access argued in its application to the PSC for permits. \"The most significant route revisions occurred early in the routing process and occurred primarily due to attempts to avoid tribal and federally owned lands, minimize environmental impacts, avoid environmentally sensitive areas, and maximize collocation,\" the company stated in its permit application. Josh Morgan/Reuters A log adorned with colorful decorations remains at a Dakota Access Pipeline protest encampment as construction work continues on the pipeline near the town of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, Oct. 30, 2016. However, President Obama's comments on a possible reroute come at a time when the pipeline is nearing completion, meaning there may be major hurdles to rerouting it now, according to some experts. \"For Dakota Access, time is money,\" Tyler Priest, a professor at the University of Iowa who served as a senior policy analyst for the President's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, told ABC News on Monday. \"They want to get this done as fast as they can.\" \"Most of it is already built, so I don't know if it would require pulling up pipeline,\" Priest said of a potential reroute. Afolabi Ogunnaike, a senior analyst at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie who specializes in North America's crude oil markets, told ABC News, \"one would imagine that a reroute is possible, but I don't know how well that would be received,\" adding that the pipeline is \"approaching 90 percent\" completion in areas other than the disputed 20-mile stretch in North Dakota. The movement to block the pipeline has garnered nationwide support, with hundreds of environmentalists and Native American groups camping out in demonstration near the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. A crowdfunding campaign set up for the protesters recently reached the $1 million mark. The fate of the controversial pipeline in its current route currently rests with the Army Corps of Engineers, which is reviewing the final easement that Dakota Access needs in order to construct beneath the Missouri River.

Grace Beahm/AP hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/AP Former North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager (second from left) in the courtroom in Charleston, S.C., on Thursday. Grace Beahm/AP Testimony in the trial of former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager opened Thursday with statements from both the prosecution and defense. Slager is accused of murdering Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, last year. For Many, S.C. Police Shooting Trial May Finally Offer A Turning Point In her opening statement , prosecutor Scarlett Wilson emphasized that Scott had been shot in the back multiple times after fleeing a traffic stop, and called his death an \"extreme consequence.\" Conversely, Slager's defense attorney, Andy Savage, reminded jurors that their consideration of the case must be \"governed by a presumption of innocence.\" Savage argued that it was Scott who provoked the shooting. \"It wasn't Mr. Slager who was angry and full of animosity,\" he said. Slager was fired after video of the encounter taken by a witness emerged. NPR's Debbie Elliott has reported on the video footage of the shooting: \"Video from Slager's dashcam shows the officer at the driver's window, asking for Scott's driver's license and questioning him about documents for the car. After Slager returns to his patrol car, Scott jumps out of the car and runs. Slager gives chase, and there's an off-camera confrontation. \"That's where a bystander video picks up . The bystander recorded the scene unfolding in an empty lot, and it's startling. Scott is running away from the officer when Slager opens fire. \"Slager said Scott had his Taser, but the bystander video that surfaced a few days after the shooting appears to contradict this story. Once it was public, the North Charleston Police Department fired the officer, and a grand jury indicted him for murder.\" Article continues after sponsorship Some Key Facts We've Learned About Police Shootings Over The Past Year The Charleston Post and Courier reported that the jury is made up of 11 white people and one black person from Charleston County. During jury selection, the defense blocked nine potential jurors, including seven minorities, according to The Associated Press. The population of Charleston County, where the trial is taking place, is made up of about 28 percent black people, according to the latest Census data . The newspaper reported that both sides in the case raised objections during the jury selection process: \"The jury [was finalized] after prosecutors dropped a legal challenge, alleging the defense's dismissal of seven minorities from the jury pool was racially motivated. \"The panel members were plucked at random from a pool of more than 100, all of whom knew about the killing, defense lawyer Andy Savage said in court after the group was selected. About 95 percent had seen the footage [of the shooting].\" The Post and Courier reported that Judge Clifton Newman denied a defense request to move the trial to a different county, where fewer people were familiar with the case. Slager faces a sentence up to life in prison if he is convicted, as NPR has reported . Slager is facing separate civil rights charges in federal court. The city of North Charleston approved a $6.5 million civil settlement with Scott's family in 2015, reported South Carolina Public Radio . ",

Less conventional election prediction systems are also sending mixed signals about which presidential candidate will prevail on Nov. 8, making life tough for certainty-loving stock investors. Since U.K. pollsters got the Brexit vote\u00a0wrong back in June, causing a short bout of market hysteria after the surprise decision to exit the European Union, USA TODAY checked out\u00a0what less well-known prognostication systems are saying about the chances of Democrat and incumbent party candidate Hillary Clinton and\u00a0Republican challenger Donald Trump. For clues, we checked out predictions tied to the stock market, Americans\u2019 pocketbooks and the World Series. Market says Trump's a winner Barring a big stock rally heading into Tuesday\u2019s vote, the market is currently predicting a Trump win. The methodology used to tab Trump the winner is simple: when the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index does not post a gain in the three months leading up to Election Day, the incumbent party candidate normally loses. The market is down about 4% since early August, which bodes negatively for Clinton. The indicator, courtesy of Strategas Research Partners, basically says the candidate from the incumbent party benefits from the good vibes a rising stock market creates, but can be doomed by a lousy market. Since 1928 this indicator has correctly predicted\u00a0the next president 19 of 22 times. Says Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas: \"Stocks are now sending one of two messages. First, the probability of a Trump win is increasing. Stocks are down 4% since August 8th and that has not been a good sign for the incumbent party historically.\u201d Pocketbooks pick Clinton\u00a0 A peek inside Americans\u2019 pocketbooks, however, suggests Hillary Clinton will be the next president. The \u201cPocketbook Model,\u201d created by the Anderson Economic Group, predicts the\u00a0former secretary of state will win by 3 to 6 percentage points. The data-driven \u201cPocketbook Model\u201d ignores polls, debate performances, policy positions and candidates\u2019 personalities. It looks at just five variables: unemployment, wage growth, inflation, whether the nation is at war, and third-party candidates. Fitness band RIP? Fitbit fit to be tied \u201cAs divisive, surprising and objectionable as campaigns often are, in the end voters go with their pocketbook,\u201d says Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group. This model\u00a0starts with the assumption that most Americans generally reward the incumbent party with their vote when the economy is good, and punish them when it\u2019s not. Anderson says AEG\u2019s model has predicted the largest vote-getter in 22 of the past 25 elections, and every election since 1980. At the moment, pocketbook issues are trending higher, which favors Clinton. The nation\u2019s 5% unemployment rate is down from its peak of 10% in October 2009. Wages have risen five straight months and inflation remains tame. And then there's baseball ...\u00a0 The \u201cWorld Series Presidential Predictor\u201d gives the edge to Clinton. So Democrats can thank the Chicago Cubs. In the 1972 inaugural issue of The Baseball Research Journal, a study of World Series results between 1952 and 1968 found the Democratic candidate for president won the election every time a National League team won the World Series; the Republican candidate was victorious if an American League team became world champs. The Cubs hail from the National League, which signals a Clinton win. This baseball indicator, however, when stretched out to include presidential elections from 1908 thru 2012, is less illuminating, as its accuracy is just 55.6% (it's been right 15 of 27 times). ",

The Marquette Law poll, the gold standard in Wisconsin, showed Clinton ahead there by six points. A trio of Pennsylvania polls had her ahead by four to five points in the Keystone State. And she was narrowly ahead in Florida and North Carolina, though well within the margin of error. Add them up all, and it was a (slight) sigh of relief for the Clinton campaign, as our sister publication The Lid put it . But they aren't out of the woods. A Colorado poll last night showed a tied race, and Clinton needs both Colorado and Virginia in her column to win without Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio. (A word of caution on that Colorado poll, though: It has the Latino electorate at just 9% , when it was 14% in 2012 -- and will likely be higher than that this year.) And a New Hampshire poll out this morning shows Trump up one point in the Granite State, which is the first survey to show Trump ahead in New Hampshire since the summer . So are things looking better for Clinton with the Comey news no longer dominating headlines? Yes. You'd much rather be Clinton than Trump, especially in the race to 270 electoral votes. But she isn't in the clear just yet. Time for Democrats to start sweating winning back the Senate But if Democrats can breathe a (slight) sigh of relief about the presidential race, the same isn't true in the battle for the Senate. The same Marquette Law poll that showed Clinton ahead by six points had Democrat Russ Feingold up a single point over vulnerable incumbent Ron Johnson (R-WI). A month ago, the Democratic formula for winning control of the Senate was to assume Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana were locked down -- and then hope to win only a couple more out of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Missouri. But right now, instead of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana being 100% locked down, only one of them is: Illinois.

'Just \u2014 we've gotta be nice and cool, nice and cool. Right? Stay on point, Donald, stay on point.'\" By contrast, Clinton's message has been much more negative, which maybe isn't surprising for a campaign that just wants to turn the page from the Comey news. But a week ago, this wasn't the message the Clinton camp wanted to be making down the final stretch\u2026 Clinton on Arizona: \"We have a real chance to turn this state blue\" NBC's Monica Alba : \"Hillary Clinton told supporters in Arizona late Wednesday that the traditional Republican stronghold was 'in play for the first time in years' as she addressed her biggest crowd of the campaign to date. Speaking to a rally of 15,000 people in Tempe, she noted that Arizona has only backed a Democrat for president once since 1948 \u2014 and that was for Bill Clinton in 1996. 'We have a real chance to turn this state blue again,' she added.More: \"Clinton continued to push down-ballot Democrats, but also took a swipe at local Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 who has made a name for himself by targeting Latinos \u2014 and urged voters to support his opponent. 'I think it's time you had a new sheriff in town, don't you?' Clinton said, to loud cheers.\" First Read's downballot race of the day: VA-10 Incumbent Republican Rep.

The drip, drip of deceptions and lies finally overflowed into a cascading pool of criminality and disgust. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The first scandal culminated in Articles of Impeachment.\u00a0 The other an impeachment trial.\u00a0 Is America now hurtling toward the same political abyss? It looks like it. So, fasten your seat belts and brace for impact. Sources tell Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier that the FBI has uncovered an \u201cavalanche of evidence\u201d in the Clinton Foundation investigation. Agents are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case,\u201d calling it a \u201cvery high priority.\u201d Armed with newly discovered email evidence and additional documents revealed by WikiLeaks, these sources say that agents will likely try to get Huma Abedin and others to cooperate in an effort to bring criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. It is a stunning development. But that\u2019s how avalanches happen. Suddenly, you\u2019re buried before you know it. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 If this is true, and if Clinton is elected president in a few days but thereafter indicted, several scenarios could unfold.\u00a0 She could resign before or after inauguration, leaving President Tim Kaine sitting behind a desk in the Oval Office.\u00a0 President Obama could pardon her before he departs that same office.\u00a0 Clinton, as president, could try to invoke broad constitutional immunity from prosecution, delaying her criminal trial until after she leaves office.\u00a0 Or she could pardon herself. \u00a0 However, all of that may not matter much if a Republican House of Representatives moves to impeach her. Neither immunity nor pardons apply to the ultimate constitutional remedy of impeachment. Thus, Americans will again be forced to suffer through another impeachment horror show. But Hillary may not be able to beat the rap the way her husband did back in 1999 when he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 What began as an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents\u2026 has now morphed into suspicions of rampant corruption involving Clinton\u2019s charity. Specifically, that she used her position as Secretary of State to confer benefits to donors who lavished money on her foundation and personally enriched the Clintons. \u00a0And the case against her is accelerating. \u00a0 \u00a0 It was inevitable, I suppose, that her emails would intersect somehow with the incredible wealth amassed by the Clintons since they left the White House. There\u2019s always a paper trail. Or pesky emails. \u00a0\u00a0 Or, in the case of Richard Nixon, those damnable tapes.\u00a0 Two Investigations Merge Hillary Clinton used her unauthorized, private email server not only to conduct State Department business involving thousands of classified documents, but it appears she also used the server for some of her foundation\u2019s communications. The FBI has devoted more than a year to investigating whether the Clintons illegally leveraged their foundation for personal gain -- that is into tens of millions of dollars in potential self-dealing and so-called \u201cpay-to-play\u201d.\u00a0 As I pointed out in a previous column, all of this, if proved, could constitute bribery, fraud, and illegal use of a non-profit charity which smacks of racketeering.\u00a0 What\u2019s that? Operating a criminal enterprise.\u00a0 It is often associated with organized crime.\u00a0 (See \u201cmafia\u201d)\u00a0 There is also the related matter of perjury.\u00a0 And obstruction of justice.\u00a0 The same charges that were leveled against Bill Clinton back in the day. \u00a0 Importantly, the newly discovered Weiner/Abedin electronic devices appear to contain email evidence relevant to both the classified documents case and the Clinton Foundation case. In addition, sources confirm that laptops belonging to Clinton\u2019s top aides, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, are now in the possession of the FBI and are being \u201cexploited for more evidence.\u201d The floodgates are open.\u00a0 While the foundation probe is now center stage, a reinvigorated look at whether Clinton mishandled classified documents has obviously been resurrected. It is possible that FBI Director Comey could reconsider his opinion of Clinton\u2019s legal \u201cintent\u201d under the Espionage Act and reverse himself in his recommendation on prosecuting Clinton.\u00a0 Sources say there is a 99 percent chance that up to 5 foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed Clinton\u2019s emails and stolen them, putting a lie to President Obama\u2019s claim that Clinton did not jeopardize national security. \u00a0 The Clinton Foundation As \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace pointed out in the final debate, \u201cemails show that donors got special access\u201d\u00a0 to Clinton while Secretary of State. While that is surely unseemly or improper, it is illegal only if Clinton used her position to confer a benefit in exchange for money. That is, if donors rewarded Clinton with cash. \u00a0 \u00a0 So, here is an example of what might be illegal.\u00a0 It has been reported that Clinton helped UBS avoid the IRS. Bill then got paid $ 1.5 million dollars and their foundation received a ten-fold increase in donations by the bank.\u00a0 If the money was a reward for Clinton\u2019s work on behalf of UBS, then that could be considered bribery under federal law. And racketeering. \u00a0 Another example: it has been reported that Clinton\u2019s state department approved billions of dollars in arms sales to several nations whose governments gave money to the Clinton Foundation.\u00a0 Again, if it can be proven there was a quid-pro-quo, it would be illegal.\u00a0 This is where the WikiLeaks hacked emails come into play.\u00a0 Messages show that charity official Doug Band, while raising money for the foundation, also steered millions of dollars to Bill Clinton. The cash came from foundation donors who had business before Hillary\u2019s state department.\u00a0 Band\u2019s emails, in which he brags about his prowess in funneling up to $66 million to Bill, make explicit how the Clintons appear to have used their foundation for personal profit. Organized crime and Illegal syndicates tend to use legitimate-looking businesses as a \u201cfront\u201d to try to fool law enforcement.\u00a0 Often, they devise a \u201cdual purpose\u201d company -- one which operates lawfully from the front door, but unlawfully out the backdoor. There is little doubt that the Clinton Foundation operated as a charity. But if there was a secondary, hidden purpose devoted to self-dealing and personal enrichment, and if the foundation was merely a conduit, then prosecution could be pursued under federal anti-corruption statutes. Did DOJ Obstruct The FBI? It\u2019s beginning to look that way. Even after Comey announced in July that he would not recommend prosecuting Clinton, the investigation into her foundation was still being actively pursued by some agents within the FBI. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department became angry over this and agents were told to \u201cstand down.\u201d\u00a0 Whether that happened is disputed.\u00a0 However, it appears that FBI agents wanted to examine emails on non-government laptops that were part of the Clinton classified documents case. They felt there might be evidence that the foundation was being used illegally by the Clintons, as noted above. But Justice Department prosecutors allegedly stopped them from doing it. \u00a0 \u00a0 Why? Was Justice protecting Clinton? Can we be assured that the renewed investigation of Clinton won\u2019t be obstructed by an attorney general with allegiances to both Hillary and Bill Clinton? \u00a0\u00a0 Time For an Independent Counsel \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given these reports of DOJ\u2019s interference, there are serious and legitimate doubts about the integrity of the government\u2019s ability to investigation Clinton.\u00a0 Attorney General Loretta Lynch was compromised from the beginning. She was first elevated to the position of U.S. Attorney by Bill Clinton. She met privately with him just days before a decision was made as to whether his wife would be prosecuted. As if that were not enough, Lynch\u2019s boss, President Obama, defended Clinton publicly last April on \"Fox News Sunday\" by declaring, in essence, she did not break the law. He made the same argument during an earlier \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.\u00a0 He prejudged the outcome of the case. This sent a pretty clear message to those in charge of just how the president wanted the question of prosecution to turn out.\u00a0 Now, it appears that Lynch\u2019s Department is heeding that message by actively obstructing the FBI\u2019s investigation.\u00a0 The attorney general has failed or refused to appoint a Special Prosecutor to ensure that these investigations are fair and impartial. President Obama could demand one, as well. He likely will not. His conflict of interest is as glaring as Lynch\u2019s. After all, the president has been campaigning vigorously for Clinton to succeed him. Why would he now jeopardize the chance of preserving or even burnishing his legacy? Donald Trump is vowing, if elected, to unwind much of what Mr. Obama has accomplished. \u00a0 Therefore, it is up to Congress to reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act to accomplish the same. It would direct the attorney general to petition the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to appoint one. No choice.\u00a0 Sadly, this may be the only way the public\u2019s trust can be restored. Gregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney. Advertisement ",

Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP hide caption toggle caption Pavel Dmitrichenko stands inside a barred enclosure in 2013 at a courtroom in Moscow. Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP Less than three years ago, a Russian court convicted Bolshoi Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko of ordering a shocking acid attack against the Ballet's then-artistic director Sergei Filin. Now, according to multiple media reports, officials from the legendary ballet company have granted Dmitrichenko permission to return to the building for practice \u2013 the same building where Filin continues to work. Dmitrichenko was convicted with two others and sentenced to six years in jail in December 2013. Reuters reports he was freed on parole in May. During the trial, he admitted organizing the attack, as we reported , but \"told authorities that he didn't intend for acid to be used.\" Now he \"denies any role in the events,\" according to The New York Times . Bolshoi management said that Dmitrichenko has now been given a pass to enter the building \"at his request merely for morning exercise routines,\" the Times reported. \"This in no way means that he will work for the Bolshoi in the future,\" a spokeswoman for the theater told Reuters. The attack badly burned Filin and left him partially blinded. He underwent more than two dozen surgeries, as NPR's Elizabeth Blair reported . Filin told her that \"the vision in his left eye fluctuates around 50 percent\" and \"he can only see shadows of objects with his right eye.\" Filin now leads the theater's young choreographers' studio, according to Reuters. Article continues after sponsorship As for the attack's motive, writer Christina Ezrahi told Morning Edition in 2013 about one possible source of tension between the two men: \"[T]he first soloist who confessed to the crime, Pavel Dmitrichenko, his own career has been going actually quite well. However, he has a girlfriend at the theater, a young, upcoming talent from the Russian provinces, might have been disgruntled because she wanted to dance 'Swan Lake.' Sergei Filin thought it's still too early. She's only 20.\" And since he returned, Dmitrichenko told the Times that he has \"encountered Mr. Filin at the theater, describing the meeting in an offhand manner as 'nothing special.'\" Filin has not publicly commented on Dmitrichenko's renewed presence. In a Times interview in May prior to his release , Filin said \"I don't think I feel safe\" at the Bolshoi and acknowledged the possibility that Dmitrichenko could come back: \"Everything is possible in this world.\" Artistic director of the Bolshoi ballet Sergei Filin attends a 2013 meeting of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP hide caption toggle caption Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP The Bolshoi's decision is indicative of some of the decisions in Russia's ballet world, as the Times reports: \"Opinion in Russia's ballet world swung between questioning what some called an ethically dubious decision sure to ignite the scandal anew and considering it a kind act for someone who had already paid for a past mistake. \"Basically, the rifts within the Bolshoi that led to the attack have never healed, with rank-and-file dancers tending to champion Mr. Dmitrichenko while the elite dancers favor their mentor Mr. Filin.\" ",

Hennigan Contact Reporter The new U.S. military wants you --\u00a0even if you're overweight, covered in tats\u00a0and stoned on weed.\u00a0 The Pentagon is considering that recruiting pitch as it scrambles to keep up with America's changing social mores and strives to attract the tech-savvy talent it needs to fight future wars. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced a broad review of recruiting standards this week, saying he wants to ensure that rules are not \u201cunnecessarily restrictive\u201d on issues like fitness, tattoos, marijuana use and letting single parents enlist. \u201cWe're going to review and update these standards as appropriate,\u201d Carter said Tuesday in a speech to Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps cadets at the City College of New York. \u201cNow, some of these things we\u2019ll never be able to compromise on,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we will always have to maintain high standards. But at the same time, these benchmarks must be kept relevant for both today\u2019s force and tomorrow\u2019s, meaning we have to ensure they\u2019re not unnecessarily restrictive.\u201d The review reflects recognition, in part, that the all-volunteer military may rely less on ground infantry operations in the future\u00a0 and more on desk-bound analysts, robotics operators, software engineers and cyberwarriors. (John Spencer) It also reflects the fact that a growing number of states have legalized marijuana sales, even though the federal government has not, and that some branches of the military already have eased their tattoo bans. The recruitment review marks the latest step by the Obama administration to push the tradition-bound, male-dominated Pentagon onto a more modern footing. Over the last year, the Pentagon has opened combat positions to women, given gay and lesbian service members protection from discrimination\u00a0and lifted bans against transgender\u00a0men and women serving openly in the military. Some military leaders and outside critics say the Pentagon is moving too fast on these initiatives. And the next president is almost certain to pick a new secretary of Defense, so Carter\u2019s recruitment review may yet get sidelined. \u201cThe Pentagon is in a bind because there is a shrinking number of people that meet all their criteria, but there are certain standards that shouldn\u2019t be jettisoned just because we need recruits,\u201d said Phillip Carter, a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s a balance to be struck.\u201d For now, all the uniformed services are meeting their recruiting goals, and there is no plan to expand the current force, which totals 1,281,900 active-duty members and 801,200 in the reserves. But Secretary Carter wants more young people to consider joining who may\u00a0not meet current enlistment standards. The majority of those who now apply are rejected due to health, drug use and other problems. More Americans than ever before are overweight or obese, for example. Though no one suggests easing body-mass standards for active-duty soldiers, the Pentagon may allow portly, paunchy and potbellied recruits to enlist \u2014 and then whip them into shape in boot camp. \u201cSome of the fitness standards can be addressed in remedial fashion after recruiting,\u201d said Michael E. O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cI'm less happy about relaxing them definitively,\u00a0though there's a reasonable debate to be had even about that,\u201d he added. Under Pentagon rules, anyone who reports to a processing center\u00a0for boot camp and tests positive for illegal drug use is rejected. Some services go further, refusing to enlist anyone who admits to previous recreational drug use. That has created clear obstacles in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Washington, D.C., where recreational marijuana is now legal, and 20 other states that permit its medicinal use. (David Montero) California, Arizona, Nevada and six other states will consider ballot initiatives on Tuesday to legalize or decriminalize marijuana, potentially making pot legal in much of the country. Tattoos also are more common. Nearly half all Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s sport at least one tattoo, according to a poll conducted by Harris Interactive Inc. in February. Recruits are checked for tattoos at initial physicals, and each service has its own rules. Symbols such as swastikas or gang signs are explicitly forbidden. Face, neck and hand tattoos are largely barred as well. In April, the Navy announced it would allow sleeve-length\u00a0arm tattoos and, in some cases, tattoos on the hands and neck. Last year, the\u00a0Army\u00a0eliminated a rule that limited soldiers to four tattoos below the elbow or knee, each smaller than the wearer's extended hand. Easing tattoo restrictions will give recruiters more leeway to accept recruits for cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence and other fields that may attract hackers and others not traditionally drawn to military service.\u00a0 Carter has made a priority of trying to modernize the military. After taking office in 2015, he opened the Pentagon\u2019s first office in Silicon Valley to highlight his focus on finding cutting-edge military technology\u00a0and the people to develop and operate it. \u201cAs technology evolves, the military may need a different type of soldier for certain jobs,\u201d said Peter W. Singer, a fellow at the nonpartisan New America Foundation who studies the future of war. \u201cThe guy with a crew cut is not always the best for the job. Sometimes you need some weirdos on your team to get things done.\u201d The military likes to portray itself as a trailblazer on social issues, although the record is mixed. The armed forces were racially segregated until 1948, when\u00a0 President Truman signed an order requiring equality of treatment and opportunity in the military without regard to race. Discrimination persisted for decades afterward, however. Women were not allowed into the service academies until 1976 and were barred from flying on combat missions or serving on combat ships until the 1990s. The Pentagon ended its transgender ban in July after a one-year review. That was after the Departments of Justice and Education ordered schools that receive federal funding to ensure the civil rights of transgender students.

By Greg Miller and Adam Entous November 3 at 6:35 PM Follow @gregpmiller U.S. intelligence agencies do not see Russia as capable of using cyberespionage to alter the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, but they have warned that Moscow may continue meddling after the voting has ended to sow doubts about the legitimacy of the result, U.S. officials said. The assessment reflects widespread concern among U.S. spy agencies that a months-long campaign by Russia to rattle the mechanisms of American democracy will probably continue after polls close on one of the most polarizing races in recent history, extending and amplifying the political turbulence. U.S. security officials have not ruled out Russian-sponsored disruption on Election Day. In recent weeks, officials at the Department of Homeland Security have collected evidence of apparent Russian \u201cscanning\u201d of state-run databases and computer voting systems. \u201cWhether they were really trying hard to get in, it\u2019s not clear,\u201d a U.S. official said. Still, the decentralized nature of U.S. polling would make it extraordinarily difficult to subvert a nationwide race. Instead, U.S. officials said it is more likely that Russia would use hacking tools to expose or fabricate signs of vote-rigging, aiming to delegitimize an election outcome that Republican candidate Donald Trump has said he may refuse to accept if he does not win. \u201cI think it\u2019s correct to say the Russians don\u2019t think they can dictate the outcome,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. But even as votes are being tallied Tuesday, Schiff said, Russian intelligence services are likely to be \u201clooking through their troves of hacked documents and seeing what they can release.\u201d At the third and final presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Russian President Vladimir Putin would \"rather have a puppet as president.\" (The Washington Post) Whether Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevails, Schiff said, the United States \u201ccan expect a lot more of the same in terms of cyber-malevolence and influence\u201d from Moscow. U.S. officials said there is still time for last-minute disruptions, even if the overall election appears relatively secure. Several officials said they fear that even an isolated operation that forces a voting system offline could erode confidence. Schiff and others said they remain worried that Moscow could dump doctored documents over the weekend that appear to expose illegality by the Clinton or Trump campaigns \u2014 disclosures designed to create confusion among voters and be difficult to disprove before citizens cast their votes. No forgeries have so far been identified among the thousands of files that U.S. officials believe were stolen by Russia and essentially laundered to the U.S. public and media through the WikiLeaks website. The fact that Russia has so far refrained from altering documents or planting forgeries among the leaked emails is seen by some U.S. officials as potentially setting the stage for a more sinister plot. The media and public have come to see the WikiLeaks stockpiles as authentic, increasing the potential impact if Russia were to insert a deliberate but compelling falsehood. Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin has repeatedly denied any Russian involvement in the \u00adelection-related hacks. But those assertions have been dismissed by U.S. intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts, with some saying that Russia engaged in sloppy tradecraft or seemed not terribly concerned about covering its tracks. Anxiety about late-election vulnerabilities has factored into the Obama administration\u2019s reluctance so far to retaliate against Russia. The White House has opted against authorizing any countermeasures despite high confidence across U.S. spy agencies that Russia alone orchestrated the digital theft of thousands of sensitive documents posted online in recent months by WikiLeaks. The releases have included hacked files of the Democratic National Committee and emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, among others. 1 of 48 What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail View Photos The GOP presidential nominee is out on the trail ahead of the general election in November.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The White House has been weighing countermeasures for months but worried that retaliating before the election would give Moscow time to inflict more direct damage in the waning days of the campaign. \u201cEscalation in the cyber-realm can happen quickly,\u201d a senior U.S. official said. Those urging restraint say they believe the Russian threat would be diminished after Election Day. Officials said the White House is also reluctant to take decisions on an escalation that could have profound implications for the next president. U.S. officials said the options under consideration include kicking more suspected Russian intelligence officers out of the United States, imposing new economic sanctions against Russian entities tied to the alleged hacking and potentially launching cyberattacks on Russian computer systems. Obama used cyberweapons to hobble Iran\u2019s nuclear program early in his first term but has been reluctant to go down that road again, aides say. The administration\u2019s decision could depend on what the Russians do in the coming days. An election-disrupting attack would probably trigger a more aggressive U.S. response, according to officials. U.S. officials say the stakes have been made clear to Moscow. The election-related tensions are part of a broader escalation in the level of antagonism between the United States and its former Cold War adversary. The two countries are fighting a proxy war against each other in Syria, are competing for influence elsewhere in the Middle East and are at odds over Russian intervention in Ukraine. The hack of the DNC was blamed on Russia by cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials the moment it was publicly disclosed in June. The administration formally went public with its case last month , issuing a statement from Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson concluding that intrusions were authorized by \u201cRussia\u2019s senior most officials.\u201d Even so, there is still disagreement among some agencies and analysts over Moscow\u2019s objectives. The White House has maintained that it does not believe Russia\u2019s operations have been aimed at delivering an election win for Trump, who has praised Putin and argued there is no evidence of Russian involvement in the hacks \u2014 a position at odds with what he has been told in classified briefings. The operations could be a more general effort to embarrass the United States and disrupt democratic institutions. Clinton has said that Russia is seeking to ensure her defeat, a contention some U.S. intelligence officials say they believe is supported by the one-sided nature of the leaks. U.S. officials have speculated that Putin harbors personal animosity toward Clinton, believing that while serving as secretary of state she helped incite mass protests in Moscow that embarrassed the former KGB operative. Even if there are no further election-related disruptions and Clinton emerges victorious, some U.S. officials believe that Russia has already accomplished many of its goals. \u201cThey\u2019ve weakened Secretary Clinton by dumping information from her campaign manager and others,\u201d Schiff said. The leaks have exposed infighting between Clinton and her former Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, forced the resignation of the DNC chief and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 cast Russia and its capacity to inflict damage as an ominous figure looming over the 2016 campaign. \u201cThey enjoy being the subject of discussion in an American election,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt enhances their prestige in a bizarre way that they\u2019re considered a player. This is also their way of payback, and I think they are delighting in that.\u201d Read more: ",

In the latest twist, retailer Nordstrom was forced to defend carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing line after a Twitter backlash called for the store and other chains to pull her wares. Brand experts say that while Ivanka Trump may get dinged, she will endure, no matter who wins the election. A recent Morning Consult poll found that more than half of women overall would not consider buying Ivanka Trump brands. But the line's target demographic is millennial women. And 51 percent of them said they were \"extremely\" or \"very likely\" to purchase Ivanka Trump-branded items, according to a survey by research firm Brand Keys. Their credit card swipes won't come pain-free, though. In an open letter that had over 825 retweets and 1,100 likes, a self-described lifelong Nordstrom customer said that selling Ivanka's clothes helped promote her father's \"hate speech.\" The writer further criticized the clothing line for its treatment of women and laborers.

Joe Raedle / Getty Images \"There are a whole lot of women out there that are furious with Donald Trump. This is a way of venting and of striking out,\" said Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. \"I don't think its going to last.\" That's because Ivanka has been a \"smart brand steward,\" said Ronald Goodstein, an associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University, who has largely managed to maintain an aura of grace and style during this contentious election cycle. \"Her line of clothing becomes intertwined with her father's and his image,\" he said. \"If her dad is touting hate, it doesn't mean shes a hater.\" Pasikoff questioned how much the social media outcry will play out into decreased sales. \"The things that go on in terms of 'hey did you see that,' the 'likes' and the 'tweets' and these online conversations... they're more indicative of emotion than they are of actual brand engagements,\" he said. While her dad may win or lose the election, Ivanka Trump will still get on with business. \"There's three ways to vote. You can vote with your ballot, vote with your wallet, and vote with your feet. I think feet and wallet people will come back to her brand,\" said McCown. \"She'll survive this.\" Ben Popken ",

Lyman, Special for USA TODAY 10:11 a.m. EDT November 4, 2016 x Share Drone video captured the damage in two towns in central Italy following Sunday's 6.6 magnitude earthquake. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has vowed that Italy will rebuild the homes, churches and other structures destroyed in the latest quake.

Aftershocks continue to keep people on edge in the areas of central Italy. (Photo: Massimo Percossi, European Pressphoto Agency) ROME \u2014 When Italy was shaken by its fourth earthquake in a week early Thursday, the jolt was part of the country's most significant streak of seismic activity in a generation. Nearly 250 medium-strength or greater earthquakes have hit Italy since the massive Aug. 24 quake that killed nearly 300 people in and around the town of Amatrice, according to Italy\u2019s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. Those are earthquakes with a magnitude\u00a0of at least 4.0, the lightest level that can cause structural damage. Thursday\u2019s magnitude-5.0 quake\u00a0damaged dozens of buildings and monuments in central Italy. It was not nearly as severe\u00a0as the magnitude-6.2 tremor near Amatrice in central Italy, or the magnitude-6.6\u00a0quake on Oct. 30,\u00a0which was the strongest to hit Italy in 36 years. 'Everything collapsed': Another quake rattles central Italy The more recent series of earthquakes have\u00a0leveled medieval villages, including numerous\u00a0homes, churches, public buildings\u00a0and monuments. And more damage may be on the way, according to the geophysics and volcanology institute\u2019s Gianluca Valensise. Valensise said one earthquake can weaken a nearby fault, making it rupture and causing a new earthquake. The resulting domino effect can last months or longer, particularly in an area like Italy\u2019s Apennine Mountains, dense with fault lines and running down most of the Italian peninsula. \u201cThis is probably what we have been experiencing since August,\u201d Valensise said. \u201cAt least in theory, this process can continue indefinitely.\u201d It is nearly impossible to determine when an earthquake will strike or how long its aftershocks will last.\u00a0That\u2019s a lesson Italy learned the hard way: Six Italian geologists and one civil servant were found guilty of manslaughter in 2009, after downplaying the risks of an earthquake six days before a deadly magnitude-6.3 earthquake flattened much of the city of L\u2019Aquila, east of Rome. Their conviction was overturned only in 2014. Improved building standards and evacuation plans have reduced the death tolls in recent years, but the impact is still devastating. Since August, more than 150,000 Italians have been forced from their homes by earthquakes and aftershocks. And countless historical and cultural riches have been destroyed or severely damaged. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. Part of our town died in that (Oct. 30) earthquake,\u201d said Rosa Piermattei, mayor of San Severino Marche, a town of 12,000 with roots dating back to the Roman Empire. More than 500 buildings\u00a0were damaged, and at least\u00a01,500 residents were left homeless. \u201cWe never experienced such a strong earthquake,\u201d Piermattei said about her town, 120 miles northeast of Rome.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve always been among those who rush to help when other towns are hit. This time it\u2019s time for us to get the help.\u201d The last time Italy was so damaged by a series of earthquakes was in 1980, when a magnitude-6.9 quake\u00a0and its aftershocks left 3,000 dead. A view of destroyed graves in the earthquake aftermath in Norcia, Italy, on Nov. 2,  2016. \u00a0(Photo: Massimo Percossi, European Pressphoto Agency) Italy has a long and tortured history with tremors. Ancient Rome was periodically devastated by earthquakes. Historical records include\u00a0relatively detailed information for major earthquakes as far back as the year 1117, when a magnitude-6.5 quake left 30,000 dead near the northern Italian city of Verona. The deadliest quake in the modern era struck the city of Reggio Calabria \u2014\u00a0the toe of Italy\u2019s boot-shaped peninsula \u2014\u00a0and across the narrow straights of Messina to northern Sicily in 1908, killing more than 100,000. The strongest quake to strike Italy in the past 1,000 years was a magnitude-7.4 tremor that pounded eastern Sicily in 1693. \u201cCompared to Northern Europe and Spain, Italy is geologically young,\u201d explained Paolo Spagna, with Italy\u2019s National Council of Geologists. \u201cThese events are more common, because the crust of the earth is still settling.\u201d In August, Arquata del Tronto, a town of 1,250 near Amatrice, had to hold funerals in another city because no buildings large enough survived the earthquake. In the October quake, the town's remaining structures were flattened. \u201cThe beautiful town of Arquata del Tronto may now become a ghost town,\u201d said Marco Morra, 33, a mechanic who grew up nearby. Those who live in the area say they learn to live with the risk of earthquakes. Piermattei, the mayor, said that with each aftershock, residents automatically go outside to parks or town squares, or sleep in their cars or campers to be safe. Other residents of at-risk areas say the ability to forget the pain of an earthquake becomes essential. Some from other parts of Italy say they are still attracted to the beauty of the region, despite it being vulnerable to quakes. Salvatore Mazza, an earthquake expert with the geophysics and volcanology institute,  was born in Sicily and lives in Rome, but said he bought a\u00a019th-century vacation home near Amatrice, even though he understood the risks of the area more than most. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of retrofitting the house to make it more resilient,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cYou can never reduce the risks to zero, but after the earthquakes we had only minor damage. It feels safe.\u201d Why buy a vacation home in that area, along one of the riskiest fault lines in the developed world? \u201cAnyone who asks that question hasn\u2019t been in the area to take in the views,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most beautiful spots on earth.\u201d ",

Devon Thomas, 22, is charged with stomping and beating his son, Tayveon Thomas, age 3, to death on Halloween, and attacking his fiancee, the boy's mother. (Chicago police photo /) Liam Ford Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A West Pullman man beat and stomped his 3-year-old son to death and knocked his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, the boy\u2019s mother, into a wall so hard when she tried to intervene that she delivered their baby prematurely, prosecutors said Thursday. Devon Thomas, 22, is charged with murder in the death Monday of Tayveon J. Thomas, and aggravated battery of a pregnant woman in the attack on the boy\u2019s mother, who had been eight months pregnant. He was ordered held without bail in a hearing midday Thursday in Cook County Bond Court before Judge Laura Marie Sullivan. Tayveon was pronounced dead \u00a0at Roseland Community Hospital on Monday at 1:15 p.m., after his father called 911 from the family\u2019s home in the 12200 block of South Green Street, prosecutors said. Thomas had punched Tayveon several times in front of his mother on Saturday, and when she tried to stop Thomas, he choked her until she started to lose consciousness, Assistant Cook County state\u2019s attorney Holly Grosshans said Thursday. On Sunday, Tayveon had a stomach ache and vomited, and his mother gave him a generic medication meant to treat an upset stomach, prosecutors said. At the family apartment on Monday, Thomas, who was wearing boots, punched Tayveon multiple times in the chest and torso, then stomped on his legs, arms and body, prosecutors said. Tayveon\u2019s mother walked into his room to bring him some medicine and saw Thomas punching and stomping on Tayveon. When she tried to get Thomas to stop, he slapped in the face, knocking her into a wall and causing her to fall to the floor, prosecutors said. Thomas then grabbed her by her ponytail and dragged her to the apartment\u2019s front room. The two argued in the front room until his mother went to Tayveon\u2019s room and found him lying unresponsive, face down on his bed, his body against the wall, prosecutors said. His mother began doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and chest compressions on Tayveon and called for Thomas, who called 911, prosecutors said. Thomas took over doing chest compressions on the boy until fire department paramedics arrived. Paramedics took Tayveon to Roseland, where he was pronounced dead. Within a few hours of Tayveon\u2019s death, his mother began to have contractions, and delivered her baby prematurely, prosecutors said. Thomas was arrested and made a videotaped statement to detectives, admitting he punched Tayveon in the chest four times and kicked him once in the stomach. Signs abuse on Tayveon included fresh cuts to his face and scalp, interior abdominal bleeding and right and left lung contusions, prosecutors said. He also had an old fracture to the left arm and scars from a previous burn on his body, including on his lower abdomen, lower back and buttocks. The Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office determined Tayveon died from multiple injuries due to child abuse in a homicide. Thomas\u2019 attorney said her client was engaged to be married to the victim\u2019s mother. ",

Patrick Smith/Getty Images HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Department of Education is hitting Penn State with a record $2.4 million fine for violating a law that requires colleges and universities to report campus crimes and warn people if their safety is threatened. The fine announced Thursday was the result of a five-year federal investigation into how Penn State officials handled complaints about former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky before he was charged in 2011 with child molestation. The agency says Penn State largely ignored many of its duties under the Clery Act. It\u2019s the largest fine issued under the law. It says the school violated regulations when it didn\u2019t warn students and employees of the forthcoming charges against Sandusky, who was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse. Penn State says it\u2019s reviewing the findings. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

    "text": "What to Know About the British Court's Ruling on Brexit By Lena Masri Nov 3, 2016, 3:00 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Boris Johnson Sees 'False Analogy' Between Brexit and US Politics 0 Shares Email Today, the High Court in the U.K. ruled that Britain's Parliament has to vote on whether the United Kingdom can leave the European Union. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, who was elected in the wake of the British vote to leave the EU , said she wants to begin the formal negotiation process for \" Brexit \" by the end of March 2017. But today\u2019s court decision, if it stands, will not allow her government to proceed until Parliament makes its determination. What exactly does that mean for Brexit? Here are some key facts: Why is a court involved? A group led by investment manager Gina Miller, which raised money for its challenge to the government through crowd-funding, launched a Brexit legal case arguing that a government shouldn\u2019t be able to act independently and leave the EU without consulting Parliament. The government argued that it should be able to use its royal prerogative powers, meaning it could act alone, to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty and begin the formal process to leave the EU. Today, the government lost the case. The Court has ruled against the Government. Our argument that #ParliamentIsSoveriegn has WON! \u2014 People's Challenge (@ChallengeArt50) November 3, 2016 The people voted, why does Parliament have to vote? Nearly 52 percent of British voters voted \"Leave\" the EU, while around 48 percent voted \"Remain\" in June. But the voters were not asked about what leaving the EU should entail and how the process should be carried out. \"People gave consent to leave the EU. They did not say exactly how the government will interpret it,\" Dr Peter Paul Catterall, Reader in History, Sociology and Criminology at the University of Westminster, told ABC News. \"The referendum shouldn\u2019t give the government carte blanche to how they interpret it. They\u2019ve been interpreting their mandate to mean a series of other things which people didn\u2019t vote on. How is that democratic?\" \"The court ruling stops the government from establishing a very dangerous precedent that they can set up referendums and then interpret them the way they want,\" he said. What happens next? The government is appealing today\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court. A hearing is expected next month. \"I expect the Supreme Court may affirm the judgement of the High Court because from what I\u2019ve seen from the judgment I can\u2019t see grounds on which they will find an alternative interpretation,\" said Catterall. If the Supreme Court upholds the High Court\u2019s decision, the government might be able to appeal the case to the European Court of Justice. But that is still unclear. If the government loses its appeal and accepts the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote on whether Article 50 should be triggered and when it should happen. I now fear every attempt will be made to block or delay triggering Article 50. They have no idea level of public anger they will provoke. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 3, 2016 I would vote in favour of triggering Article 50 if this comes to Parliament. Here is my Facebook post on the matter: pic.twitter.com/0OsMTr9oiJ \u2014 Matt Warman MP (@mattwarman) November 3, 2016 Why is the ruling significant? It could sink Theresa May\u2019s hopes of triggering Article 50 by the end of March. \"Even if Parliament eventually votes to start Article 50, that could take months and so delay the start of formal negotiations between the U.K. and the E.U.,\" Tim Oliver, Dahrendorf Fellow at the London School of Economics and visiting scholar at New York University, told ABC News. What does this mean for Brexit? It is unlikely that MPs will try to block the referendum result, even if they are against leaving the E.U. But the government will have to give the Parliament much more information about the process, which may be delayed as a result. \"Brexit will still happen in some way, but when and how will now take longer than May had hoped,\" Oliver said, adding that this may not be bad because the government is not yet ready to negotiate Brexit. \"They don\u2019t have the people in place or the ideas as to what to negotiate with the E.U. and others. Plus the rest of the E.U. is in no position to negotiate because the main deals will only happen after the French and German elections.\" Why does Brexit matter for the U.S.? It is in the U.S.'s interest that the U.K. remain strong, stable and has a good relationship to other European countries. Brexit may push the country into turmoil, Oliver said. \"The U.K. is one of the U.S.'s closest allies,\" he said. \"The British vote to leave the E.U. has the potential to tear apart the country, radically change its political and economic landscape, consume the time and effort of its political class for several years, add to growing tensions between it and its closest allies in Europe and around the world, and generally cause a crisis that is more often the result of revolution or defeat.\" Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that it was the \u2018Supreme Court\u2019 that had made the ruling, a mistake that came in during the editing process. This has since been corrected to note that it was the \u2018High Court\u2019 of the UK. 0 Shares ",

Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., here at the Republican National Convention in July, is facing his toughest bid for reelection. (Michael Reynolds/EPA) Nigel Duara Contact Reporter Katherine Dittmer has voted for Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio four times since she retired to Arizona, and she guesses nothing can stop her from bubbling-in her ballot for\u00a0the sheriff yet again.\u00a0 Not federal criminal contempt charges handed down against Arpaio last week, nor an investigation into the wife of a federal judge overseeing his case. And never mind the misspent jail funds, his insistence that President Obama was born in Africa or his department\u2019s failure to adequately investigate more than 400 sex-crime cases. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bunch of garbage,\u201d Dittmer said. \u201cI mean, he may be guilty. But I don\u2019t see anybody that\u2019s any better.\u201d Dittmer lives in a mobile home in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise, one of the few remaining strongholds of reliable Arpaio voters, with a significant population of middle-class white retirees. She and her husband have given $250 this election cycle to Arpaio\u2019s campaign. She would give more if she could. Protesters display an effigy of Maricopa Country Sheriff Joe Arpaio wearing prison clothes in front of U.S. District Court in Phoenix. Ross D. Franklin/AP Protesters display an effigy of Maricopa Country Sheriff Joe Arpaio wearing prison clothes in front of U.S. District Court in Phoenix. Protesters display an effigy of Maricopa Country Sheriff Joe Arpaio wearing prison clothes in front of U.S. District Court in Phoenix. (Ross D. Franklin/AP) For the first time in his political career, after 24 years in office over six terms, Arpaio is trailing by a significant margin late in the campaign after a series of public missteps, the most consequential of which could land him in jail. Arpaio was charged in mid-October with criminal contempt of court after federal prosecutors said he intentionally defied a judge\u2019s order to stop targeting Latinos in massive traffic patrols. Federal Judge G. Murray Snow found Arpaio liable for a civil violation concerning the same patrols. During his trial on those issues, Arpaio acknowledged hiring an investigator to look into statements Snow\u2019s wife made about Arpaio. Arpaio has run a series of negative ads against his opponent, retired\u00a0Phoenix police Officer Paul Penzone, but\u00a0Arpaio\u2019s old bases of support on the outskirts of Phoenix are shrinking as reliably red Arizona is experiencing a rush of young and Latino voters who could give Hillary Clinton more votes than a Democrat could expect in Arizona. Arizona may not be turning blue this cycle, said Thom Reilly of the Morrison Institute for Public Policy, but Arpaio,\u00a0along with ballot measures that would legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage, could be drawing an outsized population of liberal voters. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone can say with confidence, if Arpaio is voted out or if Clinton wins in Arizona, whether that really means we\u2019re a purple or blue state going forward,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cBut his deficit is significant.\u201d Regardless, the election marks a signal moment for the city of Phoenix. Republicans are losing ground to Democrats in Maricopa County, the state\u2019s largest county, and emboldened Latino groups have mounted get-out-the-vote campaigns at a rate unseen so far in the nation\u2019s sixth-largest city. Rallies against Arpaio have been marked by the presence of a 20-foot-tall inflatable figure of a handcuffed Arpaio in his own jail\u2019s striped uniform. On election night, anti-Arpaio groups are planning an \u201cArpaio Retirement Party\u201d outside of his Phoenix office, complete with a street concert. The group Bazta Arpaio (Stop Arpaio) has a running clock on its website, counting down the minutes until \u201cwe end Arpaio\u2019s rule.\u201d Even the endorsement of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Phoenix could not help Arpaio\u2019s ailing poll numbers, nor shift the strong unfavorable views voters hold of him. For years, he needed neither national endorsements nor even particularly favorable ratings to succeed at the ballot box. When Arpaio cruised to a 13-point victory in 2008, the strong-borders movement that he embodied was at its apex: Mass workplace immigration raids were ordered by the George W. Bush administration, which Arpaio endorsed in frequent national television interviews. He\u00a0then conducted\u00a0dozens of smaller raids within Maricopa County. By 2012, Arpaio\u2019s opponent, also Penzone, came within six points of Arpaio.\u00a0 But in mid-October a Morrison Institute/Arizona Republic poll had Arpaio trailing Penzone by 15 points. What changed is his unfavorability rating among white voters, now at 53%, Reilly said.\u00a0In the same poll, respondents overwhelmingly rejected building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border or the mass deportation of immigrants. Arpaio has responded to his low poll numbers by taking his case to the airwaves. \u201cThe Obama DOJ \u2026 has been after me since Day One for doing my job,\u201d Arpaio says, speaking directly into the camera. \u201cThis is all politics. Hillary gets a free pass, but they\u2019re coming after me?\u201d Long the beneficiary of out-of-state money in financing his elections, outside donors are now lining up against Arpaio. Though Arpaio still maintains a fundraising advantage and far larger war chest than Penzone, liberal billionaire George Soros has poured in more than $2 million to defeat him. \u201cJoe Arpaio has put his personal agenda ahead of public safety, costing taxpayers more than $142 million,\u201d said an ad from Maricopa Strong, the Soros-backed group sponsoring the anti-Arpaio effort, referring to the total amount Arpaio and the rest of his office have cost taxpayers in legal expenses. Reliable Arpaio voters are confused by the sudden, calamitous storm that has seized their 84-year-old candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s been so rock solid,\u201d said Dittmer, of Surprise. \u201cHe keeps the law, puts people in that outside jail.\u201d Volley Cole, a retiree in Sun Lakes, cannot fathom not returning Arpaio to office. Cole, 85, has given $676 to Arpaio in this election cycle. Like the retirees who live near him, Cole has voted for Arpaio in every election. Inside of their cloister, the thought of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Toughest Sheriff\u201d losing is either a joke or a conspiracy. And those anti-Arpaio ads? More signs of conspiracy. \u201cI\u2019m not believing what they put out,\u201d Cole said. \u201cHe is strongly in favor of our country. Men like that win.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The Chicago Cubs win the World Series , the Presidential race is tightening up , California voters will decide the fates of 749 death row inmates , and families flee Mosul .

    "text": "advertisement Donald Trump holds the advantage in the reliably Republican states of Arizona and Texas five days until Election Day, but he's running neck and neck with Hillary Clinton in Georgia, according to a trio of new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls. In Arizona, where Clinton campaigned Wednesday night, Trump leads Clinton by five points among likely voters, 45 percent to 40 percent, while Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3 percent. Back in September, Trump was ahead by just two points in this four-way race, 40 percent to 38 percent. In a head-to-head matchup in Arizona, Trump's edge remains five points, 46 percent to 41 percent. In Georgia, however, Trump is ahead by just one point among likely voters, 45 percent to 44 percent, with Johnson at 8 percent. (Stein isn't on the ballot in the state.) In September, Trump was up two points, 44 percent to 42 percent. Trump's lead is an identical one point in a race without Johnson - Trump 47 percent, Clinton 46 percent. And in Texas , Trump's advantage over Clinton is nine points, 49 percent to 40 percent, with Johnson at 6 percent and Stein at 2 percent. But among the larger universe of registered voters, Trump's lead in the Lone Star State is just four points, 45 percent to 41 percent. (The poll finds a smaller percentage of Latino voters in Texas being likely voters than their makeup of all registered voters in the state.) Clinton's African-American performance is keeping it close in Georgia One of the biggest reasons why Georgia is more competitive than Arizona is due to the African-American vote in Georgia being a larger - and more lopsided - force than Latinos in Arizona. According to the poll, African Americans make up 29 percent of likely voters, and they're breaking for Clinton by a 91 percent to 6 percent margin. In Arizona, by contrast, Latinos make up 21 percent of likely voters, and they're supporting Clinton by a smaller 66 percent-to-26 percent clip. Play ",

    "text": "Embed Embed Transcript For the first time in history, the financial markets seem to prefer the Democratic candidate for president over the Republican, and anything that lessens her chances of victory is likely to hurt asset prices, according to a paper written by Zitzewitz and Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. \"This election is going to be a very big deal economically. That's what we're finding,\" Zitzewitz said in an interview with NPR. The paper says a victory by Trump would have a much bigger impact on stock, energy and currency prices than previous elections. The Standard & Poor's 500 index, as well as British and Asian stock markets, would see a decline of 10 to 15 percent under Trump, the paper says. Oil prices would fall by $4 a barrel and the Mexican peso would lose 25 percent of its value, it says. Article continues after sponsorship The Stock Market Stumbles After Friday's Clinton Email News. Here's Why \"The market really cares. We have a 12 percent difference in the value of the S&P; under the two candidates. When we did this work on past elections we were getting results more like 2 percent. This election is very different in that regard. The economic stakes are quite high,\" Zitzewitz told NPR. As many market analysts have noted, Trump's tax policies and their impact on the deficit and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, as well as his attacks on trade, would make him an unknown commodity in the economy. \"I think that the market has sold off here because Donald Trump's prospects are improving,\" Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management said in an interview on CNBC this week. Economists Warn: Trump 'Promotes Magical Thinking And Conspiracy Theories' \"The market isn't saying, 'I like Hillary and I don't like Donald.' It's saying, 'I like certainty and I don't like uncertainty,' \" Doll said. Although Clinton is no favorite of Wall Street's, the markets at least have a sense of where she stands, Doll added. In their paper, Wolfers and Zitzewitz sought to quantify the market reaction to a Trump victory by looking at what happened during the first Clinton-Trump debate on Sept. 26 and correlating the results with data from the British betting exchange Betfair. As the evening wore on, Clinton appeared to be winning, and Betfair said her odds of winning rose. At the same time, stock futures and prices rose in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Asia and crude oil prices were also up, the paper says. Meanwhile the currencies of major U.S. trading partners such as Canada, Mexico and South Korea rose. How Did Trump's And Clinton's Economic Policy Speeches Compare? Nothing else was happening that evening that would explain the market reaction, the paper says. The markets also rose over the weekend of Oct. 7-9, after the release of the Access Hollywood video in which Trump bragged about touching women without their consent. The reverse happened last week after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress saying his agency had discovered new emails that might be related to Clinton. As CNBC noted , \"Bond yields have moved lower, and so have stocks, as the markets have begun to react to the possibility of a Trump victory in the last several days.\" NPR's Chris Arnold contributed to this report.

USA TODAY Early voters enter the Center for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Nov. 3, 2016. (Photo: Gabe Hernandez, Corpus Christi Caller-Times) TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Wanda Williams-Jones and Scott Warmack did their civic duty Thursday \u2014\u00a0two foot soldiers in what is fast becoming a record-setting battle\u00a0of early votes cast in this year's race for the White House. The two voted for different presidential candidates but for the same reason: They had long since made up their minds, and they wanted to put the electoral cacophony behind them. \u201cI\u00a0wanted to get it over with,\u201d Williams-Jones, 52, said after casting her ballot at the Leon County Courthouse and affixing the iconic \u201cI voted\u201d sticker to her blouse.\u00a0\u201cMy mind won\u2019t quit racing, and I won\u2019t have to listen anymore now.\u201d \u201cI was done thinking about all of this,\u201d said Warmack, 51, an auto conversion shop owner in a Tallahassee suburb. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to get in my way of not voting on Election Day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to get in my way of not voting on Election Day,\" said Scott Warmack of Tallahassee, Fla. \u00a0(Photo: Brett Blackledge, USA TODAY Network) Americans who voted early Thursday, like some 34\u00a0million others before them, have their minds made up. They're done thinking about the FBI and Hillary Clinton's \"damn e-mails.\" Or Donald Trump's sexually charged Access Hollywood\u00a0tape. By Election Day, early voters could swell\u00a0to 50\u00a0million. \u201cPeople are so freaked out about the stakes in this election that they are doing whatever they can to make sure that their vote counts,\" said Doug Chapin, an elections expert at the University of Minnesota. Early voters interviewed Thursday by the USA TODAY Network from North Carolina to California indicated a similar desire to lock in their choices now, having seen and heard enough from the candidates, commentators and commercials. They also were eager to avoid long lines \u2014 and potential chaos \u2014 at the polls on Tuesday. President Trump or President Clinton? These key groups offer clues to Tuesday's outcome There were Clinton voters\u00a0convinced the former first lady, senator and secretary of State is\u00a0most qualified for the presidency. And in many cases,\u00a0they were eager to make history by electing the first female president. \"I did get a little choked up, I have to say,\" Cathi DuPuy of Columbus, Ohio, said after voting for Clinton. \"That felt amazing to me.\" There were Trump voters assured the New York developer would best manage the economy and reduce the federal budget deficit \u2014 including some who worried the election, as Trump claims,\u00a0could be rigged. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s talking about,\" said Jay Poage of Wichita County, Texas. \"A man, his mouth can get him in trouble occasionally. But Hillary is under investigation. She should be in jail right now. If you or I did what she did, we\u2019d be locked up already.\" And there were people fed up with both major-party candidates and looking for a third option, contributing to what has been a major increase over 2012 in the number of unaffiliated voters coming to the polls ahead of time. Some landed with Libertarian Gary Johnson . Others opted for a write-in candidate. \"I like that he is fiscally conservative, but progressive socially,\" Stuart Otto of Bellevue, Wis., said of Johnson, the former New Mexico governor. \"I think it's important in this day and age to have a nice combination of both.\" Choosing between Clinton and Trump, he said, would be like \"the lesser of two evils.\" Faced with vague threats of voter intimidation at the polls on\u00a0Tuesday, many were\u00a0going out of their way to vote early for the first time. Earlier this week, Google Trends reported\u00a0that searches for the question \u201cwhere do I vote early?\u201d had\u00a0reached an all-time high . In California, early voters were out in droves Thursday. A steady stream of voters lined up in the Riverside County registrar\u2019s office,\u00a0where teams of volunteers collected mail-in ballots and instructed voters on how to cast their ballot in writing or on electronic machines. California residents participate in early voting in Riverside County on Nov. 3, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Richard Lui, The Desert Sun) Theresa Roush, 55,\u00a0who turned over her ballot in person but would not say who received her vote, hailed early voting for allowing her to research the candidates and ballot measures at home,\u00a0rather than being put on the spot at the polls. First-time voters in Green Bay, Wis., found the process far easier than negotiating potentially long lines next week. \"It's just a time-constraint thing,\" said Joe Kiger, an 18-year-old student at De Pere High School who cast his first presidential vote for Trump. \"I figured next Tuesday would be really busy, especially since I have limited time after school because I have clubs and stuff.\" Various tallies kept by elections experts show early voting could surpass 2012 in popularity by the time Election Day arrives. The percentage of voters who cast ballots early rose from 30% in 2008 to 32% four years ago. That represented about 46 million mail and in-person early votes. This year, Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida who keeps the most up-to-date statistics, expects as many as 35% of the votes to be cast early \u2014 possibly approaching 50 million. \"They have made up their minds,\" McDonald said. \"They feel comfortable about casting their votes.\" Just in case they don't, President Obama added his voice to the effort during one of his many college campus events for Clinton on Thursday. The president urged\u00a04,500 mostly young people at Florida International University in Miami to vote early,\u00a0as a large banner\u00a0hanging over the crowd recommended. Obama campaigning like it's 2008 and reviving the old energy \"We're making this really simple for you.\u00a0I am telling you right now where you can go vote after this rally,\" Obama said, giving out the address of the nearest early voting center at the International Mall library in Doral, Fla. \"If you are just watching on television, or you're not from around here and you're trying to figure out, 'Well, where else could I vote,' then you go to IWillVote.com, and it will give you additional locations,\" the president said. Early voters stand in line in Corpus Christi, Texas. \u00a0(Photo: Gabe Hernandez, Corpus Christi Caller-Times) Among early voting trends seen by experts, and driven home by Thursday's voters: \u2022 Those studying early voting trends in states where voters must register by party say Clinton appears to be doing well in Colorado and Nevada, while Trump looks to be keeping things close in Florida and Ohio. \u2022\u00a0Changes in voting procedures approved by Republican-controlled state legislatures appear to be influencing the votes in some states\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly North Carolina, where a federal court ruled that it discriminated against African Americans. But while the black vote is down there compared to 2012, the number of women voting early has increased far more than the number of men, a factor which could help Clinton blunt her losses. \u2022\u00a0Last week's announcement by FBI Director James Comey that his agency is reviewing more e-mails possibly related to Clinton's use of a private server while secretary of State isn't having much\u00a0impact on early voters from North Carolina to Nevada. \"The preliminary evidence is little or no effect of Comey\u2019s letter depressing Democratic enthusiasm,\" McDonald said. \"I think it's a big non-event.\" \u2022\u00a0So far, African Americans are not turning out for Clinton in the numbers they did for Obama, the nation's first black president. In North Carolina, a key battleground state, black turnout was running 16% lower on Tuesday than on the same day in 2012, said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College. By Thursday morning, white turnout was outpacing black turnout, 35% to 34%. \"I'm not going to align myself with the Democratic Party every time they say 'jump,' \" Theo Noel said while voting early in Asheville, N.C. \"I wrote in somebody that I felt earned a write-in position.\" \u2022\u00a0Hispanic voters appear to be turning out in large numbers, which could help Clinton in the Southwest.\u00a0In Texas\u2019 15 most populous\u00a0counties, more than 3.6 million early and mail-in ballots were\u00a0cast as of Wednesday night, or 37.5% of all registered voters. Early voting has been particularly popular in areas that are heavily Latino. In El Paso on the Mexico border, more than 120,000 people have cast ballots, a 64% increase over 2012. \"I\u2019m very emotional, because this is the first time I vote,\" Clinton supporter Alicia Gonzalez\u00a0said. \"In 2007,\u00a0I became a citizen\u00a0but couldn\u2019t vote because I was working nights.\" \u2022\u00a0Voters are dissatisfied with all of their choices.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s a hot mess,\u201d said Elizabeth Popacostas, 22, a\u00a0University of Nevada-Reno student who voted for Clinton. \u201cI still feel like it\u2019s sort of a joke.\" Randy Mengel, a high school\u00a0history teacher in Asheville, N.C., toyed with voting for Green Party nominee Jill Stein even though she is not on the North Carolina ballot. But he wound up sticking with Clinton \u2014 in part because he rejects Trump's refusal to commit to honoring the results. \u201cI think one thing about Americans is no\u00a0matter how much we disagree, we do agree in the sacredness of the election,\" Mengel said. Royce Turner took part in early voting in West Des Moines, Iowa, on Nov. 3, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: William Petroski, The Des Moines Register) \u2022 Late developments in the campaign have moved a few voters, but not enough to call it a trend. One such voter was\u00a0Royce Turner, a lawyer from West Des Moines, Iowa, who voted at the Polk County Election Office. \u201cI kind of got persuaded with the most recent things that have been going on,\" Turner said. \"I was kind of thinking about Trump, but I am going with Hillary Clinton now. He just said too many things about minorities.\" Trump, who has trailed in the majority of battleground state polls throughout the campaign, has urged early Clinton voters to switch their votes in about a half dozen states where that's permitted. Among them are Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the types of Midwest states he needs to overcome his deficit. \"You can change your vote in six states. So\u00a0now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday. McDonald, for one, doesn't see that happening. \u201cPeople who have been paying attention\u00a0to this election, they have made their choice,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not something they\u2019re going to take back.\u201d Contributing: Gregory Korte in Florida; Eliza Collins in Washington, D.C.; John Moritz\u200b, Matt Woolbright, Sara Sanchez and Christopher Collins, USA TODAY Network-Texas;\u00a0Jessie Balmert, Cincinnati Enquirer; Shelby Le Duc and Todd McMahon,\u00a0USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin; Emily Patrick, Asheville (N.C.)

(Video: The Washington Post/Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post) By Abby Phillip , Jenna Johnson and Sean Sullivan November 3 at 10:02 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @wpjenna Follow @WaPoSean WINTERVILLE, N.C. \u2014 With fewer than five days left before the election, the bitter fight for the presidency descended Thursday on North Carolina, a crucial battleground where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump attacked one another at competing campaign events. Clinton urged African American voters here to turn out, warning them that Trump\u2019s vision for his presidency would leave them behind. About 200 miles to the west, in Concord, Trump cast Clinton as a \u201ccandidate of yesterday\u201d and complained that he is held to a different standard than his Democratic rival. Hours later, the Democratic and Republican nominees held dueling events in Raleigh and Selma, respectively, throwing more jabs at one another. It all came on a whirlwind day on the campaign trail as a full slate of surrogates, including President Obama and Melania Trump, were dispatched to key swing states to make closing arguments for their candidates. Polls show a tightening contest, adding a sense of urgency to each campaign stop. Clinton told a crowd of about 1,800 on the grounds of Pitt Community College that Trump \u201chas spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\u201d She said he \u201cretweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories,\u201d and noted that Trump had been endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's wife, Melania, gave a speech in Berwyn, Pa., Nov. 3, in which she said as first lady, she would fight online bullying and press for the advancement of U.S. women. (The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s campaign has rejected the endorsement. Trump\u2019s son Eric said in a Thursday radio interview with KHOW in Denver that former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke \u201cdoes deserve a bullet,\u201d agreeing with an assertion his interviewer made. Clinton noted that Trump had been repeatedly accused of housing discrimination at his real estate properties and that he had continued to proclaim the guilt of five black and Hispanic men, the Central Park Five, on assault and rape accusations, even after DNA evidence exonerated them. \u201cDo any of us have a place in Trump\u2019s America?\u201d Clinton asked. At his Concord rally, Trump drew attention to the FBI\u2019s renewed inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email practices while she was secretary of state, when she used a private server. \u201cNow she\u2019s got bigger problems. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis that would cripple the operations of our government,\u201d Trump said. He did not present evidence for his claim. The GOP nominee also criticized now-interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile, after an email released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks indicated that she had provided debate questions in advance to the Clinton campaign. Trump said that if he had done something similar, he would have faced a bigger backlash. \u201cHeadlines: \u2018Trump to leave race,\u2019 \u201d he said, opining about what the media reaction would have been had that happened. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes will be among the biggest prizes Tuesday night, and Thursday\u2019s schedule reflected that. At one point in the afternoon, both Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s airplanes were at the Raleigh-Durham airport. After the state voted Republican for seven straight presidential elections, Obama turned the state blue in 2008. But it flipped back to Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, and the GOP further reasserted itself in the 2014 midterms. Clinton\u2019s appeal to black voters in North Carolina has become increasingly urgent as early voting results show turnout among African American voters in the state has fallen from 2008 levels. A combination of fewer early voting sites, lower enthusiasm for Clinton and legal disputes about voter registration records are to blame. But the Clinton campaign has pointed to higher black turnout in recent days, after the number of polling places in the state were dramatically increased, as a sign that the situation is improving. Trump continued his attack on Clinton at an outdoor rally in Selma, N.C., on Thursday night that attracted more than 15,000 people. Trump was joined on stage by decorated military veterans who support him. \u201cYou know, when I look at these brave admirals and these great generals and these great medal of honor recipients behind me, to think of her being their boss? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said. Trump reiterated his military-related campaign promises, telling the crowd that he would fully fund all branches of the military, push allies to pay more for U.S. protection and only resort to military force when it\u2019s vital to the safety of the country, among other things. Trump again criticized Clinton for using a private email server while secretary of state. As he spoke of Clinton, one man screamed: \u201cCommunist!\u201d And the crowd repeatedly chanted: \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d Clinton, meanwhile, held a joint rally Thursday night in Raleigh, N.C., with her former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and musician Pharrell. The mostly younger crowed of 5,200 at an outdoor concert venue screamed energetically as Sanders took the stage and delivered remarks that didn\u2019t stray very much from the stump speech that had become his staple in the Democratic primary. Sanders urged the crowd to vote for Clinton based on the issues \u2014 particularly economic fairness and access to health care. \u201cThis campaign is not a personality contest,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re not voting for high school president, we\u2019re voting for the most powerful leader in the entire world.\u201d Clinton promised that she and Sanders would work together to push shared priorities in January, including a plan they jointly drafted to make tuition free at public colleges and universities for families making less than $125,000 a year. \u201cThis election has been a lot more fun now that we\u2019re on the same side,\u201d Clinton said. She also argued that the best way to reject what she characterized as Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric would be to vote in record numbers. \u201cThe best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, Trump and Obama held dueling rallies in all-important Florida, with the president seeking to rally young voters for Clinton, and Trump trying to stoke concerns about Clinton\u2019s practices as secretary of state. Speaking at Florida International University in Miami, Obama called Trump \u201cuniquely unqualified\u201d and \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to be president. Later, in Jacksonville, Trump claimed that Clinton is under \u201ccriminal investigation\u201d for \u201cpay-for-play corruption\u201d by the FBI, though no such investigation has been announced. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, made her highest-profile appearance on the campaign trail since her speech at the Republican National Convention. She delivered a speech in a Philadelphia suburb, vowing to be \u201can advocate for women and children\u201d if she becomes first lady. In Berwyn, Pa., she talked about her journey from Slovenia to becoming a U.S. citizen. She praised her husband for being \u201cbeholden to no one,\u201d and told the crowd: \u201cHe certainly knows how to shake things up, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Melania Trump also voiced concerns about online bullying directed at children, saying that \u201ctechnology has changed our universe,\u201d but that \u201clike anything that is powerful, it can have a bad side.\u201d As a candidate for president, Trump has routinely used his Twitter account to attack and belittle critics, rivals and others with whom he takes issue. Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), delivered an entire campaign speech in Spanish on Thursday afternoon in Phoenix, where he stressed his belief in an inclusive politics that celebrates diversity. He criticized Trump\u2019s controversial rhetoric about immigrants, calling the GOP nominee a \u201cpayaso,\u201d or clown. Kaine later appeared at a rally in Tucson that also featured former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords. Giffords and her husband have become leading gun control advocates in the aftermath of an assassination attempt against her in 2011 that left her with a brain injury. The Clinton campaign announced Thursday that her final rally before Election Day will be Monday evening in Philadelphia. She will be joined by Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and Bill and Chelsea Clinton, the campaign said. Trump\u2019s campaign released a new TV ad that seeks to highlight the renewed scrutiny of Clinton\u2019s emails and tie her to disgraced former representative Anthony Weiner, whom the narrator of the commercial calls a \u201cpervert.\u201d Emails were found on a computer belonging to Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a 15-year-old girl, triggered the FBI to revisit Clinton\u2019s email practices. Weiner is separated from Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s long-time aide. The Trump campaign continued to argue it has its sights set on Democratic-leaning states in the final days of the race. In an interview on MSNBC, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the campaign is trying to make a push into Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin . But polls show Clinton leading in those states. \u201cI mean, look, if you try to apply conventional political wisdom to Donald Trump, you lose every time,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThe idea that, well, Michigan or Wisconsin have been elusive to Republican candidates. He\u2019s just different. His message on illegal immigration, trade and jobs and patriotism. . . . It\u2019s just a different messenger.\u201d Johnson reported from Concord, N.C., and Selma, N.C. Sullivan reported from Washington. Jose A.

    "text": "In final days, Clinton is once again trying to make the election all about Trump Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton campaigns at Pitt Community College in Winterville, N.C. Hillary Clinton campaigns at Pitt Community College in Winterville, N.C. (Win McNamee / Getty Images) In the final days of the 2016 presidential race , Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign has a consistent theme: Donald Trump . There was a point at which Clinton \u2019s advisors had envisioned a more positive ending, but in the final days of a tight race, the Democratic nominee has backed away\u00a0from emphasizing\u00a0a sunny message of inclusiveness. Instead, she has dwelled repeatedly\u00a0on a vision of a dark future of America under her opponent.\u00a0 On Monday, the Democrats \u00a0launched their\u00a0version of Lyndon Johnson \u2019s \u201cDaisy\u201d ad from the 1964 campaign, an apocalyptic warning about the dire consequences of turning over America\u2019s nuclear arsenal to an untested and short-tempered leader \u2014 in this case Trump\u00a0instead of Barry Goldwater. Tuesday\u00a0brought the\u00a0campaign\u2019s\u00a0first\u00a0television ad featuring Trump\u2019s graphic boast, caught on an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video,\u00a0about how he would grope women he found attractive and\u00a0get away with it because of his fame. And Thursday, at a rally here, Clinton was introduced by\u00a0Mae Wiggins, whose application years ago\u00a0to rent an apartment at a development owned by the Trump family\u00a0was rejected \u2014 an incident that became\u00a0part of a racial discrimination case against Trump and his father. Trump, said Clinton,\u00a0has spent his entire campaign offering \"a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She cited the endorsement of Trump earlier this week\u00a0by the official newsletter of the Ku Klux Klan as proof those signals were\u00a0being heard\u00a0\"loudly and clearly.\" \"They said it's about preserving white identity, and they placed their faith and hope in him,\" she said, noting the endorsement was written under Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again.\u201d \"You have to ask,\" she added, \"do any of us have a place in Trump's America?\" David Lauter, Kyle Kim and Armand Emamdjomeh Trump, for his part, has displayed a\u00a0concerted effort in recent days to remain\u00a0disciplined, stick to his stump speech and not veer into the sort of perilous improvisations that often have sidetracked his campaign message. Speaking in a cavernous equestrian center in Jacksonville, Fla., he stayed with a script that combined promises of a muscular economic resurgence with an exaggerated recitation of controversies that have dogged Clinton. He alleged the FBI was \"investigating how Hillary Clinton put the office of secretary of State up for sale in a violation of federal law\" \u2014\u00a0an assertion that goes well beyond anything the bureau is known to be doing. And in an effort to appeal to voters' memories of scandals during President Bill Clinton's tenure, he lamented \"here we go again with Clinton \u2014 with the impeachment and the problems. She's likely to be under investigation for many, many years.\" By staying on message, Trump avoided overshadowing his wife, Melania , who made her first solo campaign speech since the Republican convention in July. The previous address drew unwanted attention after key passages turned out to be nearly identical to ones in a speech by Michelle Obama . In Thursday\u2019s speech, to a small rally in Berwyn, Pa., in the Philadelphia suburbs, Melania Trump said\u00a0she would devote her energy as first lady to reducing online bullying of children and promoting more civil discourse in American society. \u201cOur culture has become too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.\u201d Democrats were quick to say that her plea for civility clashed with her husband\u2019s campaign, which has been punctuated by insults directed at opponents and cries of \u201cLock her up\u201d aimed at Clinton.\u00a0 A similar dissonance came later in the speech as Trump, a Slovenian immigrant, recounted her personal story of success in America.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant, and let me tell you, no one values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me,\u201d she said. Her husband has argued for sharp new restrictions on legal immigration, a wall against illegal immigration and a ban on immigration from many majority-Muslim countries. He has also warned that many who enter the country will bring an added risk of crime and terrorism. Those positions are among the ones that Clinton has pointed to all week as she has\u00a0repeatedly called on supporters to imagine what America would look like under a President Trump. \u201cI would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else,\u201d she said at a rally earlier this week in Florida. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just talk about all the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is a consequential choice, so we\u2019ve got to talk about something that frankly is painful.\u201d The steely, if reluctant, focus on her rival\u2019s flaws rather than her strengths reflects difficult truths that have vexed Clinton throughout the race. She has had limited success in changing negative\u00a0voter perceptions of her, an effort that was complicated again last week by the FBI\u2019s eleventh-hour resuscitation of the email controversy that had dogged her over the summer. That difficulty, combined with Trump\u2019s unchallenged ability to dominate\u00a0public\u00a0attention, has caused\u00a0Clinton to accept as inevitable that her best path to victory involves keeping voters focused on her rival. Wednesday night in Arizona, a state where a surge of Latino voter registration has helped create an unexpectedly tight race,\u00a0Clinton warned that Trump\u2019s immigration policy would lead to him \u201cliterally sending law enforcement officers house to house, school to school, business to business\u201d to break up families. Her warnings included the possibility that Trump could appoint Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who has championed controversial immigration policies, as his secretary of Homeland Security \u201cto oversee the massive deportation force.\u201d \u201cSometimes, sometimes the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton aides deny that her focus on the negative has come in reaction to the FBI\u2019s announcement of the renewed scrutiny of her emails. And they insist that\u00a0Clinton will return to making a more affirmative case for her candidacy as election day grows closer. On Thursday they announced that the campaign\u2019s closing rally Monday night would feature not only Clinton, her husband and daughter, but President Obama and the first lady. At that rally, in Philadelphia, where she accepted the Democratic nomination in July, Clinton will outline how she intends to keep promoting the \u201cAmerican ideals of progress, inclusion, equality and strength that our founders enshrined in our Constitution,\u201d the campaign said. The campaign has long believed that Clinton thrives\u00a0when she can speak directly to the widest possible audience. Those opportunities, though, have been limited to the convention and the three prime-time debates. In the day-to-day media, she\u2019s more likely to get attention for attacks on Trump than for policy speeches or calls for more \u201clove and kindness\u201d in the national dialogue. Asked about the dark tone, the campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, noted that\u00a0voters were making up their minds, and\u00a0\u201cin the closing week we want to reestablish for voters what that choice is.\u201d \u201cThe fact is,\u201d she said, \u201cthe choice that Donald Trump represents is pretty dark.\u201d Memoli reported from Winterville and Bierman from Washington, D.C.

Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright says deputies heard 30-year-old Kala Brown banging on the walls of the container as they served a search warrant at the nearly 100-acre Woodruff property related to the search for her and her boyfriend, Charlie Carver. Brown told investigators she had been held there against her will for two months. Carver, 32, remains missing. Todd Kohlhepp WSPA \u201cIt was pretty emotional, to say the least,\u201d Wright told reporters. \u201cWhen she was found, she was chained like a dog \u2013 she had a chain around her neck. It\u2019s only by God\u2019s grace we found that little girl alive.\u201d Wright says registered sex offender Todd Kohlhepp was also on the property Thursday morning, and he was arrested \u201cimmediately.\u201d He would likely be charged with kidnapping, Wright said, though more charges are possible. Kohlhepp, 45, has an address listed in Moore, and\u00a0 CBS affiliate WSPA reports he is listed as the owner of the Woodruff property. Brown also told investigators there may be four bodies on the property, but Wright says investigators aren\u2019t sure whether that\u2019s true. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t have a serial killer on our hands,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt very possibly could be what we have.\u201d Brown said she had been fed during her time in captivity, Wright said. She\u2019s being treated at a medical center and was in good condition. Charlie Carver WSPA Wright said investigative leads led them to the property. He wouldn\u2019t detail whether Brown told them any details about Carver\u2019s whereabouts. Carver and Brown were last heard from by family in friends in late August, WSPA reports. The missing case gained national attention after\u00a0 suspicious posts appeared on Carver\u2019s Facebook page that his family suspected were posted by someone else. The page was later taken down. On Thursday, Wright said \u201cit\u2019s super possible [Kohlhepp] was doing that to try and get people off his trail, but that\u2019s just a thought, I don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d The national sex offender registry lists a kidnapping count for Kohlhepp in Arizona in 1987. Spartanburg County Jail records don\u2019t list a charge. A lawyer for Kohlhepp couldn\u2019t immediately be located. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "CBS News November 3, 2016, 6:08 PM FBI finds emails related to Hillary Clinton's State Department tenure Email The FBI has found emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state on the laptop belonging to the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, according to a U.S. official. These emails, CBS News\u2019 Andres Triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on Secretary Clinton\u2019s private server. At this point, however, it remains to be seen whether these emails are significant to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton. It is also not known how many relevant emails there are. In a letter to Congress last Friday, FBI Director James Comey indicated that the agency was taking steps to review newly discovered emails relating to Clinton\u2019s private email server. Those emails came from the laptop of Weiner, a former New York congressman. Abedin reportedly said she had no knowledge of the existence of any of her emails on Weiner\u2019s laptop . On Monday, CBS News reported that the FBI had obtained a warrant for the emails. In a separate matter, CBS News confirmed that there were disagreements between FBI agents looking into the Clinton Foundation and their superiors in Washington and at the Department of Justice. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the FBI was facing an \u201cinternal feud\u201d over how to handle the Clinton Foundation case in the middle of election season. Officials say tension like this is common in many cases. It is still unclear whether the FBI inquiry into the Clinton Foundation was a full-blown investigation. The current status of that inquiry is also unclear. However, no known charges have been filed related to the foundation. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images Email LOS ANGELES -- Lu Parker, a local television news anchor in Los Angeles and a former Miss USA, was arrested Wednesday at Los Angeles International Airport on suspicion of stealing a pair of earbud headphones belonging to an off-duty police detective, authorities said. Parker, 48, was taken into custody at about 7 a.m. in connection with a theft at a Transportation Security Administration screening area in Terminal 6, according to a statement by Airport Police Officer Rob Pedregon. She was booked at a police station on suspicion of petty theft and later released. The headphones\u2019 owner is an off-duty Los Angeles police robbery-homicide detective and she made the arrest as a private citizen, Pedregon said. CBS Los Angeles reports the headphones are worth $200. The KTLA-TV anchor, whose full name is Frances Louise Parker, took the earbuds at the security station and was arrested after boarding a plane. \u201cWe believe this is a misunderstanding, Lu is cooperating fully with the authorities and we are confident she will be able to clear this all up,\u201d KTLA said in a statement. Parker was traveling to visit her ill father and was in the security line when she noticed that the earbuds had been left behind, according to the statement. \u201cShe picked them up intending to return them to the owner whom she had been speaking with while in line to clear TSA,\u201d KTLA said in a statement. However, she couldn\u2019t find the owner and boarded her flight, according to the station.

By Callum Borchers November 3 at 4:43 PM Follow @callumborchers Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was accused of copying a phrase from Marla Maples, Trump's second wife, during a speech on Nov. 3 in Berwyn, Pa. (The Washington Post) After Melania Trump delivered a partially plagiarized speech at the Republican National Convention, journalists wondered whether she would speak on the campaign trail again. On Thursday, more than three months later and with just six days left in the election, the would-be first lady finally gave another speech. This one left reporters asking questions, too: Did she just plagiarize Marla Maples? She thinks how many women live in poverty? Has she met her own husband? The last question is a bit facetious, of course. But as Melania Trump denounced cyberbullying, journalists noted that she is married to the year's cyber-bully-in-chief. \u201cIt is never okay when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked,\u201d Melania Trump said in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other.\u201d . @DanaBashCNN on @MELANIATRUMP appeal for decency on social media: \"I kept thinking, 'Have you met Donald Trump?'\" \u2014 Karen Tumulty (@ktumulty) November 3, 2016 Dept. of Are You Kidding Me?: Melania Trump's platform would be making people nicer on social media. \"Our culture has gotten too mean.\" pic.twitter.com/DVyPGQAR3b \u2014 Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) November 3, 2016 Melania Trump talking about social media is\u2026 https://t.co/CpIdqp18gT \u2014 Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) November 3, 2016 re: Melania 'let's fix social media' context: recent ADL report showed marked uptick in anti-semitic harassment and: https://t.co/a2h8gJS1QN pic.twitter.com/SEu5XxbHHd \u2014 Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) November 3, 2016 Melania Trump talks about how social media can be hurtful - doesn't mention her infantile husband's twitter addiction \uf914\uf644 \u2014 Diane Gordon (@thesurfreport) November 3, 2016 Uhm Melania, \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) November 3, 2016 At least Melania Trump is not alone among Donald Trump surrogates who act like the Republican presidential nominee hasn't said the things he has said \u2014 on Twitter and elsewhere. Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway are probably the best at it. [ Kellyanne Conway isn\u2019t even trying to defend Donald Trump anymore. She\u2019s pretending he\u2019s someone else. ] Melania Trump is, however, uniquely positioned in the crosshairs of the plagiarism patrol, after she (and/or the speechwriter, Meredith McIver, who took the blame) lifted portions of a Michelle Obama speech in July. Several journalists\u00a0quickly noticed that one of Melania Trump's hopeful mantras \u2014\u00a0\u201cif you could dream it, you could become it\u201d\u00a0\u2014 was uttered first by Donald Trump's second wife, Marla Maples , in 2011. Just googled \"if you could dream it you could become it\" which Melania just said. Result is quote from Marla Maples! https://t.co/grfeU8Dnx3 \u2014 Jeremy Hobson (@jeremyhobson) November 3, 2016 Melania just plagiarized Trump's second wife Marla Maples.

As for the number of women in poverty, it sure sounded like she said \"50 percent.\u201d That would be a huge exaggeration, of course. It also sounded like she said \"60 million\u201d people lack health insurance. That would also be a big stretch. . @MELANIATRUMP : \"We cannot call ourselves a fully-developed or advanced nation when 50 percent of our women live in poverty.\" pic.twitter.com/h6Iy04tBc6 \u2014 FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) November 3, 2016 According to a\u00a0transcript of Melania Trump's prepared remarks, provided after the speech by the Trump campaign, she meant to say \"15 percent\u201d of women live in poverty,\u00a0 which would be accurate , and \"16 million\u201d people lack health insurance. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation report published in September, there were 28.5 million uninsured non-elderly Americans\u00a0at the end of 2015. It makes little sense that the Trump campaign would have wanted to underreport the number of uninsured Americans, since the point was to paint a grim picture of the country. Thus, the figures in Melania Trump's prepared remarks seem a bit suspicious. The script could have been tweaked before it was distributed to reporters, in an attempt to make Melania Trump's erroneous delivered remarks seem like innocent malapropisms from a nonnative English speaker. Whatever the case, Melania Trump speeches always leave the media with questions. 1 of 10 ",

By Mike DeBonis November 3 at 6:30 PM Follow @mikedebonis Travis Klinefelter of Dubuque, Iowa rouses the crowd before a rally for Donald J. Trump \u00a0on Oct. 28, 2016 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The crowd of a few thousand warmed up by chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d and waving signs of Women for Trump. (Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images) Senior Republican lawmakers are openly discussing the prospect of impeaching Hillary Clinton should she win the presidency, a stark indication that partisan warfare over her tenure as secretary of state will not end on Election Day. Chairmen of two congressional committees said in media interviews this week they believe Clinton committed impeachable offenses in setting up and using a private email server for official State Department business. And a third senior Republican, the chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, told The Washington Post he is personally convinced Clinton should be impeached for influence peddling involving her family foundation. He favors further congressional investigation into that matter. \u201cIt is my honest opinion that the Clinton Foundation represents potentially one of the greatest examples of political corruption in American history,\u201d said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who leads the Constitution and Civil Justice subcommittee. \u201cNow that perspective may be disproven, time will tell. But given that conviction on my part, I think all options are definitely on the table.\u201d The impeachment talk is the latest sign that Clinton will not be handed a clean slate \u2014 let alone an extended honeymoon \u2014 by Republican lawmakers should she win the presidency. It comes after months of accusations from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to his rival as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d before and after federal investigators announced they would not charge Clinton or her associates over the email matter. When some in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., started chanting \"Lock her up!\" about Hillary Clinton on Oct. 10, the Republican presidential nominee replied: \"Lock her up is right.\" (The Washington Post) Chants of \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d coursed through crowds at the Republican National Convention and at dozens of Trump rallies. The FBI\u2019s disclosure last week that it is examining potential new evidence in the email probe has offered new fuel for the attacks. [ Trump\u2019s un-American campaign: Unleashing the worst ] \u201cHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency, and if she were elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Pensacola, Fla. \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen. And in all fairness, we went through it with her husband. He was impeached. . . . Folks, do we want to go through this again?\u201d Republican lawmakers have aggressively questioned Clinton\u2019s State Department dealings for months, with a special committee impaneled to probe the handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks and separate probes of the department\u2019s personnel practices and handling of classified documents found on her private email server. Top GOP leaders have previously indicated they will aggressively investigate Clinton if she is elected president. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last month he considered a Clinton administration a \u201ctarget-rich environment\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ve got two years\u2019 worth of material already lined up\u201d for investigations. [ House Republicans are already prepping for \u2018years\u2019 of investigations ] Should they keep control of the House in the next Congress, Republicans could easily launch impeachment proceedings, with political will as the most significant obstacle. The House Judiciary Committee typically investigates charges of official wrongdoing and, if it finds them to be warranted, forwards articles of impeachment to the House floor. Articles approved by a majority of the House are then sent to the Senate for a trial, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction. Neither Chaffetz nor House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte (R-Va.) have called for Clinton\u2019s impeachment, but they have made clear they intend to continue probing her emails. In a joint letter sent Thursday, the two chairmen called on Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to preserve documents related to the email investigation, including the new evidence the FBI disclosed last week. Chaffetz and Goodlatte have also asked the federal investigators to probe whether Clinton committed perjury during 2015 testimony before the Benghazi panel. Democrats have warned voters in recent days of apparent GOP obstruction to come, citing the impeachment threats. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what evidence . . . they\u2019ll find something \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying already,\u201d President Obama said Wednesday during a campaign stop in Chapel Hill, N.C. \u201cHow does our democracy function like that?\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that impeaching Clinton for alleged actions that took place before the election \u201cwould be a brazen attempt to nullify the vote of the American people, outside our constitutional framework and destructive to the Framers\u2019 intent.\u201d The Clinton campaign declined to comment. But the senior Republicans say they are convinced Clinton has broken the law and are speculating that she could be criminally charged after she is elected. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News Tuesday the probe into Clinton\u2019s emails \u201cwill continue whether she wins or not.\u201d \u201cAssuming she wins and the investigation goes forward and it looks like an indictment is pending, at that point in time under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial,\u201d he said, warning of a possible \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d In a separate Fox News interview Thursday, McCaul accused Clinton of committing \u201ctreason\u201d in mishandling classified documents. FBI Director James B. Comey said in July there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Clinton or associates willingly broke federal laws but \u201cwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d [ FBI agents knew of emails in early October ] Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, told a Wisconsin newspaper Monday that Clinton could be impeached, citing federal laws against \u201cwillful concealment and destruction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,\u201d he told the Beloit Daily New s. \u201cI would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.\u201d Both McCaul and Johnson have political imperatives for taking a hard line on Clinton: Johnson is locked in a close race to keep his Senate seat and has moved recently to shore up his support among his Republican base. McCaul is said to be considering a possible Senate run against fellow Republican Ted Cruz in 2018. Former GOP congressman Tom Davis, who served on the House Oversight Committee during the first Clinton administration, warned lawmakers against overreach. \u201cThe news reports don\u2019t look good, but we\u2019re a long way\u201d from impeachment, he said. \u201cThere may absolutely be a place for this, I don\u2019t know, but when you jump the gun way ahead, you lose the credibility of your mission before you start. And that\u2019s my caution to both sides.\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a current member of the Oversight panel, called the impeachment talk \u201creprehensible, reckless and un-American\u201d and called it part of a two-decade GOP campaign to\u00a0undermine Democratic presidents. But he said the failure of the 1998 Bill Clinton impeachment and President Obama\u2019s current popularity shows that perpetual opposition isn\u2019t necessarily good politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a base, too, and for every action in politics there is a reaction,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cIf you want to fire up our base, keep on making statements like that.\u201d Other prominent Republicans stopped short this week of suggesting that impeachment should be in the offing. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called the talk \u201cpremature\u201d during an interview on a Texas radio station Tuesday. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been elected or sworn into office,\u201d he said, according to a CNN report on the interview. \u201cAnd unless there is some additional evidence that the FBI director and the Justice Department would take to a grand jury, then she is not likely to be convicted of a crime.\u201d Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), a former Judiciary Committee chairman who played a leading role in the 1998 Clinton impeachment, called talk of a Hillary Clinton impeachment \u201cspeculative\u201d in a Wisconsin radio interview Tuesday. But he said there would be a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d should she be indicted as president. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go through another Watergate,\u201d he said. \u00a0 ",

That should put in the mind of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick one thought: that he missed a great opportunity. Kaepernick created a prominent platform through his refusal to stand for the national anthem this season. It is a platform he could have used to mobilize the African American voters who are needed to spur policy change around\u00a0the racial injustices Kaepernick has spotlighted through his protests. It\u2019s important to note the positive results from Kaepernick\u2019s refusal to stand during the national anthem, and there have been several: sparking an important national conversation, inspiring fellow athletes to meet with law enforcement officials in their own cities and Kaepernick donating $1 million to groups he said address social injustices. But an election, this presidential election, has far greater consequences. And in September, when asked about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the quarterback said of Clinton and Trump: \u201cBoth are proven liars and it almost seems like they\u2019re trying to debate who\u2019s less racist.\u201d He was off the mark. First, NAACP president Cornell William Brooks says mobilizing voters is a key potential byproduct of a protest like Kaepernick\u2019s. Second, three prominent Black Lives Matter activists were\u00a0among a host of civil rights advocates who\u00a0endorsed Clinton \u2014 evidence that she is more committed than Trump to issues of social justice. It\u2019s a message that Kaepernick could\u00a0have used his platform to deliver in attempt to encourage African Americans to vote. Only now it\u2019s too late. ",

    "text": "'Self-recruited' Trump volunteers break mold for how campaigns are run By Tori Richards Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Alaska resident Mike Robbins putting up a sign in Anchorage, Alaska. \u00a0(Courtesy: Mike Robbins) Alaska can be an afterthought in presidential elections, a frigid electoral landscape that often sees the race decided before its polls even close. But this time, volunteers from the deep-red state with its three Electoral College votes started campaigning for Donald Trump long before the campaign kicked in staff members \u2013 and without the help of the state or national Republican Party. \u00a0 \u201cI woke up one day and said, \u2018I have to do something.\u2019 I was losing sleep over it,\u201d said Mike Robbins of Anchorage, who owns several radio stations. That was back in January. Robbins went on to hold fundraisers to buy shirts and signs, enlist hundreds of volunteers and wage a social media blitz on Trump\u2019s behalf. He became an alternate delegate for the national convention, blanketed Anchorage with Trump signs and bumper stickers and welcomed the campaign\u2019s Alaska director in August with a highly organized machine already in place. This scenario has played out in states across the country. Despite tensions between Republican leaders and Trump \u2013 and concerns that the GOP nominee\u2019s campaign lags Hillary Clinton\u2019s in raw organizational strength \u2013 one factor Trump has going for him is an army of volunteers who began boosting his ground game, in some cases, before the professionals got heavily involved. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 FoxNews.com talked to volunteers in five western states who were among\u00a0Trump\u2019s main source of on-the-ground support at a time when neither the Trump campaign nor the RNC had dedicated staff. This is in marked contrast to Clinton, who had early support from the Democratic National Committee and a huge volunteer network already in place due to highly organized state Democratic committees. \u200b\"We have 80 offices throughout the state that we activated last fall, all with volunteers ready to go,\" said Michael Soller, communications director for the California Democratic Committee. \u200b Five days before Election Day, Clinton still maintains the clear advantage in most assessments of the electoral map. A Democratic National Committee spokesman said field organizers are updating their robust voter file, an important election tool. \u201cWe don\u2019t take any vote for granted. We have a robust ground game focused on making sure all of our voters get to the polls, not just for Hillary Clinton but for Democrats up-and-down the ticket,\u201d the spokesman said.\u00a0 But voter enthusiasm is a factor \u2013 and the Trump campaign points to the energy of its supporters. \u00a0 \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019re running a grassroots movement,\u201d said Jessica Ditto, Trump\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cPeople are fired up about it. They feel like they are enlisted in the campaign.\u201d For the most part, Trump\u2019s campaign did not assign a paid staff member to organize volunteers in individual states until March or later. By then, many supporters were hosting their own fundraisers, call centers and speeches. \u201cWhen I was first hired in April and word got out, within 24 hours I had 1,000 emails -- how these folks found me and got to me, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tim Clark, California director of the Trump campaign. \u201cThe next day it was another 1,000 [emails] and it\u2019s been that way ever since. I\u2019m not recruiting volunteers because our volunteers are self-recruited.\u201d Clark says he was thankful to have a relatively easy job: pockets of Trump supporters already existed across the state, formed through Meetup and Facebook groups. He just stitched them together into a bigger statewide group. \u201cThey were already talking to each other online, putting up their own signs and training each other,\u201d he said. Across the West Over in southern Texas, Miriam Cepeda has been a one-woman Trump operation since March. Back then, everywhere she went people were supporting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump only really had a presence in Austin, Houston and Dallas. \u201cI appointed myself to take care of Rio Grande area,\u201d said Cepeda. \u201cNo one was speaking on behalf of his campaign or encouraging people [in south Texas]. I took the bull by the horns and ran with it.\u201d A 25-year-old graduate student, Cepeda crisscrossed cities across the Rio Grande Valley, marketing Trump until the campaign noticed her and made her an official part of its network.\u00a0 \u201cI posted signs, started a list of volunteers, sent out emails, located donors, started Facebook and Instagram pages,\u201d she said. In New Mexico, Cecilia DeBaca, 63, decided she wanted to support Trump when she heard him talk last year about the restrictions of political correctness. \u201cYou can\u2019t say Merry Christmas, can\u2019t sing Christmas carols,\u201d DeBaca said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything anymore.\u201d So she started talking to everyone she could about Trump \u2013 at Walmart, gas stations, grocery stores and the pharmacy. DeBaca also went to the Trump website and found out how to start making phone calls for the campaign. Then she contacted her local Republican Women chapter and led efforts to set up booths at public events to lead voter drives and engage bigger audiences. Undeterred that her state has been blue since President Obama took office, DeBaca said she has had almost a perfect record convincing strangers to vote Trump. She and her husband both became state and national delegates. Up the West Coast in the northern Seattle area, business strategy consultant Luis Valdes has \u201cput up signs, held fundraisers -- anything to help Mr. Trump.\u201d He started campaigning after the national convention. Back then, Valdes didn\u2019t see any Trump presence in the historically blue state. Valdes said he started going to festivals, events and job sites where he could talk to large groups of Hispanic voters. A refugee from Cuba, Valdes is now an American citizen and understands oppression. \u201cI explain, \u2018Don\u2019t try to make this country into the one you just left,\u2019\u201d Valdes said. Trump has been to Washington state three times, more than any other GOP candidate in recent history. While the state is still considered to favor Clinton heavily, Trump backers may have made some inroads. During a recent drive from Portland to Seattle, Trump signs dotted the freeway, Valdes recalled. \u201cRight now I\u2019m driving up I-5 and I just passed an overpass with about 15 people who were holding Trump Pence signs and waving flags,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong the whole way I only saw a few Hillary signs.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Kevin Turner, Lead NFL Concussion Suit Plaintiff, Had CTE By jimmy golen, ap sports writer BOSTON \u0097 Nov 3, 2016, 7:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Kevin Turner, Lead NFL Concussion Suit Plaintiff, Had CTE 0 Shares Email Dozens of times since beginning their work on the brains of former football players, boxers and military members who suffered repeated blows to the head, researchers have announced their findings with slides of damaged tissue, strong words about the danger of concussions and perhaps a call for sports officials to take the issue more seriously. At a Boston University medical conference on Thursday, doctors put a human touch on the often clinical diagnoses, announcing to a room stocked with family members of CTE casualties that former Patriots and Eagles fullback Kevin Turner \u2014 the lead plaintiff in the NFL's concussion lawsuit \u2014 also was a victim of the disease. \"There's people there, not just brains,\" Tamara Alan, executive director of the Kevin Turner Foundation, said as she choked back tears to thank the researchers for their work. With Turner's parents in the crowd, neuropathologist Ann McKee said the former Alabama and NFL star had the most severe form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a traumatic brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head. CTE likely caused the Lou Gehrig's disease that killed Turner in March at the age of 46, according to McKee. \"The severity of Mr. Turner's CTE was extraordinary and unprecedented for an athlete who died in his 40s,\" she said. CTE has been linked to repeated brain trauma and diagnosed in hundreds of former football players. It can also cause symptoms of Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Showing slides with evidence of both CTE and ALS in Turner's brain, McKee said that it's not possible to establish that the CTE caused Lou Gehrig's disease through an autopsy, \"but this is the best circumstantial evidence we will ever get.\" After helping Alabama to the national championship in 1992, Turner played eight years in the NFL for New England and Philadelphia. He was diagnosed with ALS in 2010 and pledged his brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation that year. McKee said Turner had several symptoms associated with CTE, including cognitive and impulse control difficulties. She said it also appears that the disease damaged the motor cortex of his brain when he was young, \"likely leading to his ALS symptoms.\" \"What Kevin Turner's case shows is that when you start playing football at 5 years old, and you're successful, it destroys your brain,\" said Chris Nowinski, a founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Nowinski said children whose brains are still developing shouldn't be playing tackle football, pointing to medical research \u2014 and even football coaches \u2014 who say there would be benefits from playing non-contact football until ninth grade. \"This is a totally preventable disease,\" McKee said. \"Let's start preventing it.\" Raymond Turner, Kevin's father, said Kevin's son stopped playing tackle football before resuming when he reached high school. Raymond Turner said he didn't regret that Kevin played football, but he wouldn't have started him on tackle football so early if he'd known the risks. \"We'd probably do it again,\" Raymond Turner said, \"just in a safer way.\" Turner was one of the named plaintiffs from as many as 6,000 potential players who reached a $1 billion settlement with the NFL to monitor more than 20,000 NFL retirees over 65 years old and compensate those with dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other serious neurological conditions. Turner also created and served as president of the Kevin Turner Foundation, which seeks to show the potential connections between repeated brain trauma and Lou Gehrig's disease, which causes muscle weakness, paralysis and eventually respiratory failure. In the documentary \"American Man\" featured on the foundation's website, Turner said he wants to help convince \"old-school\" coaches to take concussions seriously. \"I believe this is the most important thing I'll ever do in my life, other than raising my kids,\" he said. \"This is by far bigger than any game or practice or tryout or whatever.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http:// twitter .com/AP\u2014NFL 0 Shares ",

Slager, 34, who is white, faces 30 years to life in prison if he's convicted in the April 4, 2015, shooting death of Scott, 50, an unarmed black man who was fleeing a traffic stop in North Charleston. The shooting, which was caught on video by a bystanders cellphone, was one of a series of confrontations between white police officers and black subjects that fueled national protests against alleged police bias in the last two years. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter L. Scott, testifies Thursday at the murder trial of former North Charleston, South Carolina, police Officer Michael Slager in Charleston. Grace Beahm / AP Scott's mother, Judy Scott, collapsed after her emotional testimony Thursday, crying and screaming \"Hallelujah!\" Scott told the jury \u2014 of 11 white men and women and one black man \u2014 that she and her grandson were on their way to get the young boy's eyeglasses repaired when she got a phone call from her son. \"He didn't sound very good at all,\" Scott said. \"He sounded in distress.\" Related: Nearly All-White Jury Seated in Trial of Ex-Cop Who Shot Unarmed Black Man Scott said she could hear another man's voice in the background, yelling, \"Get on the ground and put your hands behind your back.\" Referring to her son by his middle name, Lamar, Scott said her son told her: \"They Tasing me.\" Then, beginning to sob, she said, \"I heard him groaning like he was in excruciating pain a couple of times.\" \"I say, 'Lamar, just, just do whatever he say,'\" Scott testified. \"I told him, 'You know North Charleston policemen, so just do whatever they say.\" Walter L.

Her grandson took the phone from her before she could hear the gunshots that killed Walter Scott, she said. Jurors also heard from Pierre Fulton, a co-worker who was riding with Scott when their car was pulled over for a broken brake light. Asked why Scott tried to run away, Fulton said: \"That's a question I would like to ask him. Unfortunately, I can't. He was murdered.\" Fulton said Scott gave Slager his license and stepped out of the car but was told to get back in again and complied. \"The next thing you know, he was out the door,\" Fulton said. Jurors were also shown the dashboard camera video of Scott bolting from his car after Slager went to his cruiser to check Scott's driver's license. Play ",

The students were not dead, and an announcement, about 10 minutes later, explained the lesson. It happened in Brodhead, a rural part of Wisconsin about 100 miles southwest of Milwaukee. \u201cA lot of our fellow friends and students actually started crying because they thought these people were actually dead,\u201d said student Madison Trombley. \u201cI think a lot of them actually called their parents in school, too.\u201d Another student, Sam Bolen, said the stunt wasn\u2019t effective. \u201cThey were trying to teach using scare tactics, which doesn\u2019t teach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just makes you not trust the teachers and any of the announcements you\u2019re going to get.\u201d The superintendent and principal of the school said they only received a few complaints from parents about the drill.

ZGF Architects LLP via AP Email WASHINGTON -- A proposal to build a ski resort-style gondola system over the Potomac River connecting the nation\u2019s capital to nearby Virginia is technically feasible and would cost $80 million to $90 million to build, according to a study released Thursday. The bottom line: the aerial gondola project isn\u2019t some fanciful, futuristic idea or a tourist gimmick, and it\u2019s an option for commuters that\u2019s \u201ccool and feasible,\u201d said Joe Sternlieb, the president of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, one of the groups that paid for the study. The study said if officials want to move forward, getting the necessary state and local approval to build the project would take three to four years, and construction would take two years. The system of enclosed cabins would likely have a weekday ridership of 6,500 and just under 2 million riders a year. The proposal envisions a 4-minute ride with cabins coming every 20 to 60 seconds. Each cabin would hold eight to 12 people, Sternlieb said. Similar urban systems carry passengers in Portland, Oregon, and New York City. The Portland system opened in 2007 while a tram system in New York has been taking passengers to Roosevelt Island since 1976. In Washington, the idea is for the system to be an extension of the region\u2019s Metro train system, with riders using their Metro card, Sternlieb said. It would link Virginia with Washington\u2019s Georgetown neighborhood, which does not have a Metro stop. Mary-Claire Burick, the president of the Rosslyn Business Improvement District, another group that helped pay for the study, called the project an affordable transit solution. \u201cOur roadways are already at capacity. Our bridges and tunnels are already at capacity,\u201d she said, adding that putting in a Metro stop is \u201ccost prohibitive.\u201d The study identifies several possible endpoints of what\u2019s being called the Georgetown-Rosslyn Gondola. One side would be near the Rosslyn Metro station in Arlington, Virginia, and the other near Georgetown University in Washington. The system would cost $3.25 million a year to operate and maintain, the study said. The next step for the project is for regional officials and leaders to take a look at the results. If officials want to move forward, they would need to discuss funding and conducting an environmental impact study. The District of Columbia, Arlington County, Georgetown University and others helped pay for the study. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

John McCain and Mitt Romney -- will unite for a final get-out the vote effort. The once bitter primary rivals will seek to make the case for McCain to return to the U.S. Senate for a sixth term in a state that has become a presidential battleground in this election cycle. But don't expect them to make the same argument for Donald Trump's candidacy even as the hours until Election Day tick down. McCain is a heavy favorite to win but the fate of the state's 11 electoral votes is anything but certain, leaving the duo with the sensitive task of energizing Republicans around McCain's candidacy without publicly supporting the top of the GOP ticket.

Although Trump openly questioned his war record and expressed skepticism over the heroism of prisoners of war, McCain eventually endorsed him, albeit tepidly, and received Trump's support in exchange. Related: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Disliking Trump and Clinton, Votes McCain for President But after the infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" taped leaked last month, in which Trump was caught bragging about sexual assaulting women on a open microphone, McCain rescinded his endorsement . He had also previously condemned Trump's attacks on federal judge Gonzalo Curiel and Khizr and Ghazala Khan, a Gold Star family. Romney, on the other hand, has been one of the most prominent Republican faces of the \"Never Trump\" movement. Although Romney aggressively sought and touted Trump's endorsement four years ago, he delivered a blistering speech in March, outlining why he believed the real estate mogul was an unacceptable candidate for president, while also declining to throw his weight behind any of the other candidates in the race. He even told NBC's \"Today Show\" that same month that he'd do everything he could within \"political bounds\" to stop Trump. Play ",

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regularly releases a list of carcinogens in an effort to help reduce cancer cases. Currently, the HHS has listed 248 known carcinogens that run the gamut from X-rays to alcohol consumption. Today it added five viruses to the list, including HIV and the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause mononucleosis. Two other substances -- an industrial solvent called trichlorethylene (TCE) and the element cobalt, often used in rechargeable batteries and military equipment -- also made the list. \"Given that approximately 12 percent of human cancers worldwide may be attributed to viruses, and there are no vaccines currently available for these five viruses, prevention strategies to reduce the infections that can lead to cancer are even more critical,\" Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP), said in a statement today. \"The listings in this report, particularly the viruses, bring attention to the important role that prevention can play in reducing the world's cancer burden. There are also things people can do to reduce their exposure to cobalt and TCE.\" The five viruses were listed in the report after medical studies found they were associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus): The virus, which weakens the immune system, increases the risk of several cancers, including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas, anogenital cancers, Kaposi sarcoma and liver cancer. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1: The virus is a kind of retrovirus that can cause adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, a rare cancer. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): This common virus is a form of the herpes virus, and about 90 percent of adults are infected at some point in their lives. While most people remain healthy, this virus can cause mononucleosis, commonly referred to as \"mono.\" In rare cases, the Epstein-Barr virus can cause certain types of cancer, including four types of lymphoma. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV): This virus is a herpes virus that has been linked to several cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma and two rare kinds of lymphoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV): This is a common virus that generally lives on the skin and rarely causes cancer or even symptoms. It can cause Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare kind of skin cancer where a nerve in the skin develops cancer. The full report can be found here. 0 Shares ",

Militant video/AP Email Last Updated Nov 3, 2016 3:17 PM EDT ERBIL, Iraq -- The shadowy leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, has released a new message urging his followers to keep up the fight for Mosul as they defend the city against a major offensive aimed at routing the militants from their last urban stronghold in Iraq. Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes launched coordinated military operations to retake Iraq's second-largest city Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s rallying cry came in a sermon-like recording, more than half an hour long, distributed by the militant group\u2019s al-Furqan media arm late on Wednesday. It was not clear when the recording was produced. Al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts are unknown. Iraqi special forces stormed into Mosul\u2019s eastern outskirts on Tuesday after two weeks of advances through surrounding ISIS-held territory. They continued to consolidate their foothold in the eastern district of Gogjali despite a pair of attempted car bomb attacks on their positions Thursday. The city of more than one million people and the surrounding territory fell to ISIS fighters during the militant group\u2019s surprise attack in June 2014. Al-Baghdadi visited the city soon after the takeover, and from inside Mosul declared an Islamic caliphate that at one point covered nearly a third of Iraq and Syria. In his recording, al-Baghdadi rallies his fighters - especially in Mosul - and calls on them to obey orders while remaining resilient and steadfast. An American guilty of supporting ISIS speaks in his first interview with Scott Pelley. \u201cOh you who seek martyrdom! Start your actions! Turn the night of the disbelievers into day,\u201d he says, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. organization that monitors militant activity online, which reported the al-Baghdadi recording first. \u201cTotally decimate their territories, and make their blood flow like rivers,\u201d al-Baghdadi also says. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said there was no reason to doubt the authenticity of the tape, CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep the pressure on them, and no audiotape is going to change that,\u201d Toner said. He then said Raqqa, the de facto capital of the militants\u2019 self-proclaimed caliphate, was next. Hours after al-Baghdadi\u2019s call, an explosives-laden vehicle sped out of an ISIS-controlled area in Mosul and attacked Iraqi special forces positioned in the city\u2019s easternmost Gogjali neighborhood on Thursday. The special forces fired a rocket that blew up the car, killing the attacker. How did a Minnesota teenager -- a fan of basketball, music and poetry -- become a leader of an ISIS cell? Abdirizak Warsame speaks with Scott Pel... A second suicide attacker also emerged from the same area, the more central Samah district, Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil said, but that vehicle managed to get away. ISIS fighters were also using explosives-laden drone aircraft, he said, adding that the militants had deployed two since the previous night but that both had been destroyed. Troops in Mosul are stationed in the far east of the city, and have yet to push deep into the densely packed urban areas less than a mile away. Iraqi forces continued to consolidate their gains into the evening, hunting for any ISIS fighters who may have stayed behind, checking houses and streets for booby traps, and handling an influx of hundreds of people who fled ISIS-held territory deeper in the city. The commander of the Joint Military Operation Command, Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati, told reporters on Thursday that more than 5,000 civilians have been evacuated to nearby camps since Wednesday from Gogjali and surrounding areas. The vice president, in an interview with Face the Nation, mocks Trump's suggestion that the coalition fighting ISIS is liberating Mosul to help H... Inside Gogjali, security forces fired into the air to disperse civilians who were standing in a line to receive aid materials distributed by the Ministry of Migration and Displacement, concerned that large groups of people could be targets of militant attacks. In his recording, al-Baghdadi also urges ISIS militants elsewhere to carry out attacks in Saudi Arabia, whose leadership ISIS opposes, and Turkey, which has deployed troops and artillery north of Mosul and is training Sunni Arab and Kurdish forces there. The recording was the reclusive al-Baghdadi\u2019s first released message to supporters since Iraqi forces launched the decisive battle to retake Mosul, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from ISIS. Al-Baghdadi attempts to harness the feelings of Sunni disenfranchisement that preceded the 2014 ISIS takeover of Mosul, a largely Sunni city in Shiite-majority Iraq. Using a derogatory term for Shiites, he says followers of the Muslim sect want to drive \u201cempty Iraq of Sunnis and replace them with the worst of people.\u201d ISIS is still in control of Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, but Iraqi and Kurdish forces are closing in and U.S. warplanes and special forces ... He calls on fighters to \u201crespond to all attacks,\u201d and to \u201ctarget all in their media and forces, and all who belong to them.\u201d The audio message could not be independently verified, though the speaker\u2019s voice and style of delivery resembled previous recordings of al-Baghdadi. ISIS is fighting to hold Mosul as Iraqi forces and allied Kurdish forces advance on the city from multiple directions with U.S.-led coalition support. It is the Iraqi military\u2019s largest offensive since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Iraqi forces have proceeded cautiously since breaching Mosul\u2019s eastern outskirts this week. They have yet to move into more densely populated areas that could lead to weeks, if not months, of clearing booby-trapped buildings and bloody house-to-house combat. Donald Trump raised questions about Hillary Clinton's health and took aim at the fight against ISIS on the campaign trail this week. CBS News' Ma... On Wednesday, residents in the easternmost district of Gogjali cautiously welcomed liberating Iraqi troops, with some raising white flags and flashing the \u201cV\u2019\u2019 for victory sign. Men in the area celebrated by shaving the beards they were forced to grow under ISIS rule. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch warned that ethnic tensions were boiling over in Kirkuk, some 100 miles southeast of Mosul, where ISIS launched a surprise attack late last month that resulted in gun battles that lasted two days and killed at least 80 people. In a statement, the New York-based group said that Kurdish authorities in the city have been ejecting Arab residents and Arab internally displaced people there since the attack, without explanation and in actions it considers \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d \u201cForcing families out of their homes and into the streets or to unsafe parts of the country is a serious violation of their rights and does nothing to strengthen Iraq\u2019s political cohesion,\u201d said Lama Fakih, the group\u2019s deputy Middle East director. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

University President Drew Faust said in a statement Thursday night that an investigation into the 2012 team found that their \"appalling\" actions were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few, but appeared to be more widespread across the team and continued through the current season. \"The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard's view that both the team's behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,\" Faust said. A 2012 document uncovered last month by The Harvard Crimson student newspaper rated the attractiveness of recruits on the women's team and included lewd comments about them. Members of the men's team called it their \"scouting report\" and circulated it online. \"I was saddened and disappointed to learn that the extremely offensive 'scouting report' produced by the 2012 men's soccer team continued through the current season,\" Dean Rakesh Khurana said in a statement. \"As I have stated, such behavior is antithetical to Harvard's fundamental values.\" Athletics Director Robert Scalise sent an email to student athletes Thursday announcing that the university was canceling the remainder of the team's season, including postseason play. The men's soccer team is currently in first place in the Ivy League. Scalise said the team would forfeit its remaining games and decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or participate in the NCAA tournament this year. \"As we move forward, Harvard Athletics will partner with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and other Harvard College resources to take additional steps to further educate the members of our men's soccer team, and all of our student-athletes, about the seriousness of these behaviors and the general standard of respect and conduct that is expected,\" Scalise said in the email. 0 Shares ",

Oscar Baez, 52, resigned from the Prairie Grove Police Department the day after the Nov. 29 crash. But on Thursday, McHenry County Judge Michael Feetterer acquitted Baez of DUI and official misconduct, saying there was reasonable doubt as to whether Baez was under the influence of alcohol. Baez, of Bensenville, had testified at his trial last month that he'd consumed two cups of eggnog at about 11 a.m. the day of the crash, hours before starting his shift at 3 p.m. On the witness stand, he said he was not much of a drinker but just wanted to taste \"a little bit\" of the eggnog. Baez also testified that his brakes failed as he approached an intersection about 10:30 p.m., causing his vehicle to strike the pole, which was nearly severed by the impact. ",

The scale of Mario Tama's aerial views of Antarctica is at once stunning and humbling -- humanity can seem like an insignificant development in face of these endless landscapes. The paradox, though, is that as vast and overwhelming as the Antarctic may be, humans may be instrumental in the changes affecting it. For the past eight years, NASA's Operation IceBridge has been tracking how polar ice is responding to climate change. Scientists studying the data collected on the thickness and shape of Antarctic snow and ice believe that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be in irreversible decline.

Mountains poke out from a section of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet on Oct. 28 during a NASA flight over Antarctica. The IceBridge mission for Antarctica is based in Punta Arenas, a city at the southern tip of Chile. From there, IceBridge is carrying 12-hour flights back and forth to Antarctica, covering most of the western section of the frozen continent. The region is experiencing the fastest changes and is Antarctica's biggest contributor to sea level rise. Mario Tama / Getty Images 3. NASA and University of California, Irvine (UCI) researchers have recently detected the speediest ongoing Western Antarctica glacial retreat rates ever observed.

Onboard the plane is a laser altimeter that records minute changes in the height of the ice surface from one year to the next. Accompanying the laser are three radars that analyze the elevation and layer composition of the snow and ice, as well as the shape of the land underneath.

    "text": "(Matt Pearce and Jaweed Kaleem) One of the officers, Martin, was shot near the high school that Greene\u2019s daughter attended. Police said Thursday it was unclear whether the Confederate flag incident and the shootings were related. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we can connect those two incidents right now,\u201d Parizek said. \u201cA lot of this will depend on what he tells us, if he tells us anything.\u201d Greene lives\u00a0with his mother, Patricia Ann Greene, and\u00a0his teenage daughter, a cheerleader at the school.\u00a0Police said they were called to the house the day of the football game after Greene got into a fight with his mother. He accused\u00a0her of hitting him following an argument over a pit bull\u00a0she wanted removed from the house, according to court records. A few days later, his mother asked for a protection order against her son for abuse and financial exploitation. A judge ruled Tuesday that Greene had committed elder abuse and ordered him to move out of his mother\u2019s house. It also was revealed in court that he was facing intense financial problems. Greene\u2019s family \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for this. They didn\u2019t do this. \u2026\u00a0They are just as torn apart,\u201d\u00a0Parizek said Thursday. Q&A: What we know about ambush cop killings \u00bb Those who know Greene say his life took a downward turn\u00a0about six years ago when his father died, his son joined the military\u00a0and he moved in with his mother. He worked part time at two hardware stores in recent years but had quit to look for a full-time job. He was hired last month at Central Iowa Fencing, a local construction business, but he quickly quit the job. \u201cHe was never disrespectful,\u201d said Phyllis Nace, a neighbor of the Greenes.\u00a0 Greene and\u00a0his mother would sometimes visit as Nace worked in her yard, tending her perennials. He often wore camouflage and dog tags, she said.\u00a0She and her husband\u00a0never saw him with guns or displaying the Confederate flag. His mother \u201cwas\u00a0kind of frustrated with Scott because he was just having trouble getting on with life,\u201d Nace said. \u201cShe just said that he\u2019s been a challenge.\u201d\u00a0 In the four or five days before the shooting, Greene had been moving \u201call kinds of stuff out of the house and taking it somewhere, and all of a sudden, this ordeal shows up,\u201d said\u00a0Richard Nace. By Thursday, signs of collective mourning had spread throughout the towns. Outside the Urbandale and Des Moines police headquarters, residents left hundreds of cards, flowers and posters. Churches hosted vigils. And police said they had received unsolicited support. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy. I don\u2019t live far from where the shootings happened, and it\u2019s just not the kind of thing you ever see here,\u201d said Liz Mortensen, who brought her young son to Timberline Church in Urbandale to pray for the fallen officers and her community. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our trust in the Lord to heal our neighborhoods, to protect our police.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The Chicago Cubs win the World Series , the Presidential race is tightening up , California voters will decide the fates of 749 death row inmates , and families flee Mosul .
