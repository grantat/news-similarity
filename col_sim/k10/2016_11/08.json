    "text": "Twitter Instagram Donald Trump's campaign released his final campaign video on Friday. It began with ominous piano music playing under one of Trump's speeches. As he condemns the \"corrupt political establishment,\" grainy archive footage of his opponent Hillary Clinton and world leaders is mixed with stern, disappointed faces of everyday Americans. YouTube \"I'm doing this for the people and the movement,\" Trump is heard saying to a cheering crowd. \"We will take back this country for you and we will make America great again.\" The two-minute video is also generous with footage of his crowded rallies. But the ad was met with immediate criticism from those who noticed what they saw as anti-Semitic undertones. The Anti-Defamation League called out the Trump campaign for using images of Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and billionaire George Soros as examples of corruption. All three are Jewish. \"Whether intentional or not, the images and rhetoric in this ad touch on subjects that anti-Semites have used for ages,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL. \"This needs to stop.\" Minnesota Sen. Al Franken spoke out against the ad on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. \"When I saw the ad, I thought that this was something of a German shepherd whistle, a dog-whistle, to a certain group in the United States. I think, I'm Jewish, so maybe I'm sensitive to it, but it clearly had sort of Elders of Zion kind of feel to it, international banking crisis ... uh, plot, or conspiracy rather, and then a number of Jews. So I think it does speak to a certain part of his alt-right base.\" Article continues after sponsorship Franken went on to say the ad was \"an appeal to some of the worst elements in our country as a closing argument.\" The Trump campaign responded, saying it was \"offended and concerned\" that the ADL would engage in partisan politics. \"Mr. Trump and his campaign have laid out important ideas, a vision and critical polices for our country,\" said Jason Greenblatt of the Trump Organization and Trump's Israel Advisory Committee. \"The suggestion that the ad is anything else is completely uncalled for.\" On Monday, the Clinton campaign released a closing statement of its own. In sharp contrast to the Trump ad, Clinton sits facing the camera and speaks directly to voters with a cozy background of lamps, picture frames and bookshelves. Without mentioning him by name, she appears to be responding to Trump's ominous tone seen on the campaign trail. \"Is America dark and divisive? Or hopeful and inclusive? Our core values are being tested in this election.\" The Clinton campaign has been promoting the idea of staying positive in recent days. Traveling to several states before the election, Clinton has told crowds that \"anger is not a plan.\" YouTube The ads are essentially two-minute summaries of how each candidate chose to run for president. Trump found a passionate following by speaking to a base of voters who saw themselves as disenfranchised socially and economically and focused on threats to the nation like terrorism and illegal immigration. Trump rallied against the status quo and called for radical change in Washington. Clinton, seen by many as the personification of that establishment, attempted to convey a more positive tone with her slogan \"Stronger Together.\" That message was helped along by Michelle Obama, one of her most popular surrogates, who coined what later became an unofficial campaign slogan: \" when they go low, we go high .\" ",

Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016.</p> Close AP Photo/Richard Shiro WOODRUFF, S.C. -- The South Carolina man who confessed to a 2003 quadruple murder after authorities found a woman chained on his property will represent himself in court. Sheriff Chuck Wright told the Spartanburg Herald-Journal that Todd Kohlhepp is choosing not to hire an attorney. Investigators looking for more bodies on alleged S.C. killer's property Kohlhepp became a suspect in at least seven deaths after 30-year-old Kala Brown was found Thursday chained by her neck and ankle in a metal storage container on his 95-acre property near rural Woodruff. CBS affiliate WSPA-TV reports that authorities granted three requests before Kohlhepp confessed to the 13-year-old slayings at a Chesnee motorcycle shop. Wright says he let Kohlhepp talk to his mother. Wright delivered a photo to Kohlhepp\u2019s mom. And he transferred money to a girl Kohlhepp says he\u2019s helping raise, to help pay for college. Kohlhepp is charged with kidnapping Brown, as well as four 2003 killings known as the \u201cSuperbike murders.\u201d He has confessed to the notorious quadruple slaying at a motorcycle shop in the small town of Chesnee, investigators said. He was denied bond Sunday during a brief court appearance on four murder charges for those slayings. A body found Friday on the property has been identified as the boyfriend of the woman found a day earlier. Kohlhepp has shown officers where he says two more people are buried. Human remains were found in one gravesite Sunday and the search for more possible remains continues. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Close WSPA One body was uncovered at the location Kolhepp pointed to on Sunday, and another was discovered Monday, Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger said at a press conference Monday night. Brown\u2019s boyfriend Charlie Carver, with whom she had vanished from Anderson in late August, was also found dead on the property, bringing the total number of bodies uncovered on the sprawling 100-acre lot to three. Investigators say Kohlhepp also confessed to the shooting deaths of four people in a\u00a0 notorious 2003 case in Chesnee known as the \u201cSuperbike murders.\u201d In total, he is a suspect in seven deaths. Clevenger did not release details on the state of the two bodies found Sunday and Monday, including their gender or whether they were decomposed, pending an examination. Both of the bodies were removed from the lot Monday and are now off-site, he said. New details on woman held captive for months \u201cI can\u2019t state how long they have been deceased or how long they have been buried,\u201d Clevenger said. Lt. Kevin Bobo, a spokesman for the Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s office, said the majority of the property has been searched and authorities don\u2019t believe they will uncover any more remains. He said there would be a \u201cscaled-down\u201d \u00a0law enforcement presence at the site Tuesday to re-check the grounds. \u201cRight now we feel like we have found all the bodies that are here,\u201d Bobo said. On Sunday, Kohlhepp appeared in an orange jumpsuit for the brief bond hearing and declined to make a statement. He\u2019s indicated he is not planning on hiring an attorney. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Early voters lined up outside the West Regional Library in the Westchester neighborhood in Miami. Credit Angel Valentin for The New York Times Hispanic voters were largely credited with President Obama\u2019s victory in 2012, but they weren\u2019t as crucial as many believed. Mr. Obama didn\u2019t even need to win the Hispanic vote to put him over the top, thanks to high black turnout and support among white voters in the North. The turnout among Hispanic voters didn\u2019t surge, even though exit polls implied that it had. This year, Hispanic voters, perhaps motivated by Donald J. Trump \u2019s policy proposals (including deportation) and harsh language aimed at undocumented Hispanic immigrants, really might decide this election. Early voting data unequivocally indicates that Hillary Clinton will benefit from a long awaited surge in Hispanic turnout, vastly exceeding the Hispanic turnout from four years ago. It\u2019s too soon to say whether it will be decisive for her. The geographic distribution of Hispanic voters means that many of her gains will help her in noncompetitive states like Texas and California, not Michigan and Pennsylvania. But the surge is real, and it\u2019s big. It could be enough to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among white-working class voters in the swing states of Florida and Nevada. If it does, it will almost certainly win her the election. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Florida, voters who indicated they were Hispanic on their voter registration form represent more than 15 percent of the early vote. In 2012, Hispanic voters were just 12 percent of the final electorate. The numbers are striking in part because of the sheer magnitude of the early vote so far. Already, more than 6.4 million total voters have cast their ballots in the state \u2014 equal to 75 percent of the final turnout in 2012. In total, as many Hispanic voters have already cast ballots in Florida\u2019s early voting period as cast ballots in all of 2012. The Hispanic surge in Florida isn\u2019t simply because Mrs. Clinton has drawn typically reliable Election Day voters to vote early instead: According to Daniel Smith of the University of Florida, fully 36 percent of the Hispanics who have voted so far did not vote in 2012. It\u2019s also striking because Hispanic voters are typically among the least likely to participate in early and absentee voting. If that pattern continues this year \u2014 suggesting a robust Hispanic turnout on Election Day \u2014 Mr. Trump is probably in serious trouble. The pre-election polls in Florida appear to have assumed a lower level of Hispanic turnout. The final Upshot/Siena poll in Florida suggested that the state\u2019s electorate would be 67 percent white, by registration, and 14 percent Hispanic \u2014 just two percentage points higher than the 12 percent of 2012. A new Quinnipiac poll today had Mrs. Clinton ahead by one point in the state, and put Hispanic voters at 16 percent of the electorate. But this was based on the race that registered voters self-reported to pollsters, not the race that they indicated on their voter registration form. In our two Florida polls, registered Hispanic voters represented 13.6 percent of the electorate, but 16 percent of likely voters were self-identified Hispanic voters. ",

Chip Somodevilla, Mark Wilson (2)/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla, Mark Wilson (2)/Getty Images Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire (from left), Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. Chip Somodevilla, Mark Wilson (2)/Getty Images Republicans are feeling the best they have this cycle about their chances of holding their majority in the U.S. Senate, but doing that would require several states to break their way on election night. That's a risky place to be one day before control of the Senate is decided. The tightening of the presidential race over the past week may have had an impact on these Senate contests. Most of the contests remain firm toss-ups, though Democrats still have multiple paths to winning back the five seats they need (or just four if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the presidency). Illinois is all but assured of being in the Democrats' column, but it is the only seemingly sure thing. Former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold's lead in Wisconsin has shrunk in the closing days, and both parties are spending anew. Republicans, though, privately say they would be shocked if it broke their way. Article continues after sponsorship A Week From Election Day, Democrats Have Many Paths To A Senate Majority The next two most likely to flip, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, depend so much on the presidential race. Both are tight, but Democrats might have the edge because of a superior turnout operation. Weak GOP incumbents in Missouri and North Carolina continue to give Democrats an ever-so-slight edge, but in Missouri especially, the conservative lean of the state is certainly helping Republicans. North Carolina will also likely track closely to the presidential results in the battleground state. Perhaps the biggest shift over the past week has been in Indiana. Former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh hasn't had a cakewalk since he jumped into the race in July. His advantage here is gone, while Republicans are increasingly optimistic. And it's another state that's likely Republican in the presidential race. Nevada, the lone GOP offensive opportunity, has sunk on the list of most likely to flip control, with early voting in the state signaling heavy Democratic and Hispanic turnout. Still, if Democrats do take back control of the Senate, it will be by a much slimmer margin than they had hoped for weeks earlier. And if it's a one-seat majority, get ready for another fight in a year if Clinton does become president. That's because Vice President Tim Kaine's Senate seat in Virginia will come open in 2017, and it would become the focus of a very competitive special election. Even if Republicans lose the majority, they would have every incentive to delay and not go along with major legislation. Why? The 2018 Senate map is a minefield for Democrats. Expect some late calls across the board. And at least one race, possibly two, may go into overtime. The open Louisiana race won't be decided until a Dec. 10 runoff, because Tuesday is actually the all-party primary. And if Georgia GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson falls below 50 percent, he'll be forced into a Jan. 10 runoff. Both, however, won't decide the Senate, as they should stay in Republican hands. Here's our final ranking of the vulnerable Senate races, from most to least likely to change party hands: 1. Illinois (R-Mark Kirk) Previous rank: 1 'Your Parents Came All The Way From Thailand': Senator Wrongly Hits Rival On Heritage This one was baked a long time ago, and Kirk's downward spiral in the closing weeks certainly didn't help. No suspense here \u2014 Democrats start out at least a net one for the night with Rep. Tammy Duckworth poised to become the state's next senator. 2. Wisconsin (R-Ron Johnson) Previous rank: 2 It would be a pleasant surprise for Republicans if Johnson did hang on here in his rematch with former Democratic Rep. Russ Feingold. Final polling in the state showed this one was neck-and-neck, and spending from both sides has proven that. But Democrats view the last-minute investments as an insurance policy \u2014 you don't want to look back and regret not having done what it takes. If Johnson does pull what would be an upset here, it's going to be a very long night for Democrats. 3. Pennsylvania (R-Pat Toomey) Previous rank: 3 Clinton is favored in the Keystone State, but the margin may decide whether she takes Democratic nominee Katie McGinty with her. Toomey has pulled out all the final stops at the end, and his closing ad even quoted President Obama praising him for his work on gun-control legislation. But that tactic drew a sharp statement from the White House. Of the toss-up states, though, Democrats feel best about this one while Republicans don't. 4. New Hampshire (R-Kelly Ayotte) Previous rank: 6 The Granite State is tight across the board, but when you factor in Democrats' get-out-the-vote operation, and the fact that late deciders typically break their way here, it might be good news for Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Still, this one could go either way. 5. Missouri (R-Roy Blunt) Previous rank: 4 This race had to be a perfect storm for Democrats to even have a chance, and that has happened. Blunt is viewed as the ultimate insider, and he hasn't taken his challenge from Secretary of State Jason Kander seriously enough. Kander, a war veteran, was an early, solid recruit. Still, the Republican lean of the state is showing up in polls. If Blunt is able to win, it will be Trump who carries him across the finish line \u2014 the opposite of most of the other races on here. 6. North Carolina (R-Richard Burr) Previous rank: 7 Burr has been another underwhelming incumbent, but former state Rep. Deborah Ross has taken plenty of hits from Republicans over her tenure as head of the state's ACLU. Burr has also had some foot-in-the-mouth moments that are adding to the GOP's headache here. As the presidential race goes, so likely goes this Tar Heel State contest. 7. Indiana (Open, R-Dan Coats is retiring) Previous rank: 5 In Indiana's Senate Race, Political Royalty Tries To Put On A Fresh Face No candidate has seen his stock fall as far and as fast as former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh did this year. His late entry into the race this summer was heralded as a major shake-up, and it was, forcing Republicans to worry about this seat. But his double-digit lead has evaporated, thanks to questions about his residency, lobbyist ties and his final months in office back in 2010. Now, the momentum is all with GOP Rep. Todd Young, who has a slight edge in the final polls. Republicans are increasingly bullish, and with good reason. Trump's prospects have improved in the Hoosier State as well, which should help Young. 8. Nevada (Open, D-Harry Reid) Previous rank: 8 Hispanic Voters Key In Deciding Nevada's Tight Senate Race This is the only Democratic-held seat on this list. Republicans liked the trajectory of this race for months, but the state's Democratic tilt seems to have won out. An uptick in Hispanic turnout in the early vote, fueled by antipathy for Trump, isn't helping GOP Rep. Joe Heck, who has seesawed back and forth on his party's controversial presidential nominee. This state is hard to poll, but it almost always underestimates Democrats, particularly Latinos. Some Republicans point out that Sen. Dean Heller was able to win here in 2012 even as Obama carried the state, but his opponent, then-Rep. Shelley Berkley, was a poor candidate who was under a House ethics probe. 9. Florida (R-Marco Rubio) Previous rank: 9 There may be some Wednesday morning quarterbacking going on if Rubio is able to beat Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy by just a few points. But caution: Results may appear closer than they actually are. Some Democrats have begun finger pointing, saying they are missing a chance to take out a possible 2020 presidential candidate. But Democratic money was likely better spent putting multiple cheaper races into play. This is an incredibly expensive state, and the minute Rubio decided not to retire, he was going to be incredibly hard for Democrats to knock off. Not ranked: Arizona or Ohio Yes, we're stopping our rankings with just nine, because those are the only truly competitive races to watch on election night. Clinton playing in Arizona had given Democrats renewed hope they could knock off Sen. John McCain there, but there's no data to back that up. And Ohio Sen. Rob Portman likely sealed his ticket back to the Senate a long time ago, running maybe the best race of the cycle and putting away his opponent early. ",

    "text": "Closing Arguments: Trump pledges jobs, security; Clinton sounds unity message in final push Published               November 07, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton barnstormed the country on election eve Monday to deliver their respective closing arguments before the raucous 2016 presidential race goes to the voters, with Trump vowing to make America safe and prosperous again and Clinton vowing to unite a divided nation. \u201cAnger is not a plan,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said in Pittsburgh, Pa. As Clinton blasted what she called her opponent\u2019s \u201cdivisive vision\u201d for America, Trump blamed her and her husband\u2019s policies for manufacturing job losses and vowed a change if he\u2019s elected. \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you. We\u2019re going to bring back wealth taken from this country,\u201d Trump, the Republican nominee, said in battleground state North Carolina, the second of his five stops Monday. \u00a0\u00a0 Trump began his day in Florida before heading to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. The race remains tight hours before voting gets underway. The latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard shows Trump\u2019s prospects improving in four key states -- Arizona, Iowa, Utah and North Carolina \u2013 though Clinton still has the advantage on the electoral map.

See Predictions Map \u2192 Clinton returned to the campaign trail Monday, less than 24 hours after the FBI concluded a revived probe into her personal email use as secretary of state, lifting a cloud off her campaign in the final hours as she seeks to become the first woman elected president in U.S. history. \u201cTomorrow we face the test of our time,\u201d Clinton said at her first rally, in Pittsburgh. \u201cWill we come together as a nation or split further apart? \u2026 We don\u2019t have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive big-hearted America.\u201d Before embarking on her three-state campaign swing, Clinton told reporters that she has \"some work to do to bring the country together\" and that she wants to be president for those who vote for her and those who don't. Clinton after Pennsylvania went to battleground state Michigan before planning to return for an event in Philadelphia, then a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Trump on Monday resumed his breakneck race through the country to make a final appeal to voters to help him \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. In the wake of the FBI announcement, he urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box.\"\u00a0 On Sunday, Trump and running mate Mike Pence held events in seven states, with the last starting after midnight in Virginia. \u201cShe wants to fight ISIS?\u201d Trump said Monday in North Carolina about Clinton, who has essentially led for the entire 2016 election cycle. \u201cShe wants to fight nobody. She\u2019s got no chance.\u201d Trump is aiming for an upset victory Tuesday, which is still possible if he is able to win key toss-up states and pick off one or more strategic states considered Democratic territory. The former reality TV star shocked the country\u2019s political class this spring when he defeated 16 major candidates in the Republican primaries, among them several senators and governors. While seeking victories in the so-called battleground states, which have a mix of voters who could go for either major party candidate, Pennsylvania is considered critical for Trump. The state has not elected a GOP presidential nominee since 1988 in the candidates\u2019 race to get 270 Electoral College votes. Trump still expressed optimism Monday about winning Pennsylvania. \u201cAre you watching what\u2019s happening in Philadelphia?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cWe are going to win.\u201d The public transit system in liberal-leaning Philadelphia will be running in time for Election Day, after a weeklong strike, which is good news for Clinton and other Democratic candidates on Tuesday's ballots. City officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls. Pennsylvania does not offer early voting, so Election Day turnout is key. Early voting in other battleground states suggests Clinton is leading among Hispanics, a key voting bloc. However, the African-American vote does not appear as strong for her as it was in 2008 and 2012 when black voters helped elect and re-elect Barack Obama.\u00a0 The Justice Department said Monday that it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls. That's a 35 percent reduction from the number four years ago, amid Trump\u2019s persistent warning about potential voter fraud at polling stations. Department officials say personnel will be sent to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations. The announcement also came amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show that the staff has not stopped Trump from tweeting despite a report suggesting otherwise.\u00a0 Many of Trump\u2019s most inflammatory comments during the campaign were made on Twitter. But he has exhibited unusual restraint on social media in the final days of the campaign. After days of attacks on Trump's qualifications and temperament, Clinton this past weekend cast herself as the candidate of \"healing and reconciliation,\" despite being one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Overshadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI Director James Comey's latest letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.

    "text": "Nov 7 2016, 6:13 pm ET Russian Interference Follows Putin Pattern and Won't Stop Tuesday by Josh Meyer advertisement The new leak of 8,000 hacked DNC emails is a textbook example of how the Putin regime ramps up state-supported active measures on the eve of an election, a top former U.S. intelligence official and Russia expert told NBC News. Fiona Hill, who wrote a book about Putin's rise to power, ticked off a series of other elections, including Ukraine, Montenegro and Georgia, that featured eleventh-hour propaganda blasts and Russian military aggression. Hill said the daily torrent of leaked emails, plus Putin's dispatch of Russia's lone aircraft carrier to Syria, fits the pattern of Russian escalation prior to a major event. Watch Cynthia McFadden on Nightly News with Lester Holt for more \"He is trying to reset the relationship in a very confrontational way by kicking us when we're down, and piling everything on at the weakest and most vulnerable moment,\" said Hill. \"There is a longstanding and very clear pattern of this, and cyber is just one of many weapons he uses.\" Play Exclusive: Putin Targeting Microsoft in Effort to 'Nationalize' Internet 2:40 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161107232245if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/798636099746\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Other examples, according to Hill and others: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's \"exclusive\" pro-Russia interview with Russian media outlet RT, numerous reports of fake tweets and news stories sowing confusion about the U.S. election, and increased propaganda about how the U.S. is really behind the hacking campaign. As Russian intervention in other countries' elections has shown, attempts to manipulate the outcome by tampering with internet and social media platforms could be hugely disruptive, especially in real time when the information matters the most. \"A coordinated disinformation campaign would happen quickly through use of trolls and digital [troll] farms all over the world,\" said Moira Whelan, a former senior strategic communications official at the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security. \"With some states having just hours to cast their votes, any effort that may keep someone from a polling place or change their mind can have an impact.\" Stopping a disinformation campaign, especially a state-sponsored and sophisticated one, isn't easy, Whelan said. It would require coordinating complex responses in real time across many government agencies, and with media and social media companies that are reluctant to interfere with any kind of messaging due to First Amendment concerns. \"The best thing the government can do now is help the private sector and the public prepare,\" said Whelan, of BlueDot Strategies. With open communications lines, \"they can share information and limit the scope and scale of an electronic attack.\" Computer keyboard. Oliver Nicolaas Ponder / Getty Images/EyeEm The latest email dump, via WikiLeaks, has also stoked fears among U.S. intelligence officials that Vladimir Putin will keep escalating Russia's disinformation campaign after Tuesday's election. They believe he's not just trying to undermine the legitimacy of tomorrow's voting but wants to undercut the effectiveness of whichever candidate takes office. \"Don't think that the Russian activity was solely about the election, or about Trump,\" a senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News. \"It wasn't. It was about their agenda, what they are trying to accomplish\" in expanding Russia's power and influence throughout the world. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Russia expert at the Pentagon and State Department, said the flurry of suspicious activity shows that Putin \"is working on strengthening his negotiating position with the next president. The more he can show he can make life uncomfortable for America and Americans, and undermine confidence in the election and our Democratic institutions, the stronger he thinks his negotiating position is.\" Play ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story What will happen to financial markets after the election? More so than usual, we have a decent idea. That\u2019s because there has been a clear and identifiable swing in a variety of asset prices \u2014 especially the stock market and currencies \u2014 at inflection points in the presidential race. A stock market rally on Monday is the latest evidence. The more than 2 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 appears to be linked to the announcement on Sunday by James Comey, the F.B.I. director, that an examination of newly discovered Hillary Clinton \u2019s emails revealed nothing warranting charges . Market swings over the course of the election suggest that people and institutions with money on the line view a world with Mrs. Clinton as president offering a less volatile economic and financial environment than one with Donald J. Trump in charge. It\u2019s a risky game to try to tie swings in financial markets to political news. Markets often rise and fall for reasons that have nothing to do with the day\u2019s biggest headlines. And if Monday\u2019s rally were a one-time occurrence, it would be safer to attribute it to random chance than to the market\u2019s collective judgment of the future under the two potential presidents. But in this election cycle, there has been a clear pattern in which the odds shifted in the race and different financial indicators moved in a consistent direction. Good news for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has coincided with higher stock prices, a rally in the Mexican peso and a decline in expected stock market volatility. Good news for Mr. Trump has coincided with the reverse swings. (The impact on the value of the dollar and Treasury bonds has been more ambiguous.) That movement was evident when audio emerged of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women and Mrs. Clinton had strong debate performances. It went in the opposite direction when Mr. Comey indicated on Oct. 28 that investigators were examining newly obtained emails tied to Mrs. Clinton. S.&P.; 500 Index % An analysis around the first debate by the economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz found that the coinciding movements between Mrs. Clinton\u2019s odds and market prices implied that Mr. Trump\u2019s winning would lead to a 10 to 15 percent drop in major stock markets and substantial drops in the price of oil and the Mexican currency, combined with higher volatility. (Mr. Wolfers is a contributor to The Upshot). Stock market analysts agree on the direction of the likely movements in the event of a Trump win, if not their magnitude. In a research note Monday, Evercore I.S.I. interpreted the evidence as signaling that a Trump win would create a drop of 5 to 6 percent in stocks, with a 2 percent gain if Mrs. Clinton wins. Citigroup analysts see a drop of 3 to 5 percent. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cA Democratic sweep could cause investors and corporate leaders to worry about higher taxes and regulation,\u201d wrote Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cA Trump win could have an even greater impact due to uncertainty about how campaign promises translate into policies,\u201d particularly around the risk of trade wars. Even if estimates like those correctly predict the near-term market reaction to the election, their ability to correctly judge the long-term consequences of a political shift for the economy and the business environment isn\u2019t particularly good. Complex feedback loops among political decisions, public policy and the economy aren\u2019t always evident in the immediate aftermath of elections or referendums. The June 23 vote by British voters to leave the European Union is a prime example. In the days just after the vote, the British stock market fell sharply, as did the country\u2019s currency. In the weeks that followed, the stock market largely rebounded, as there was no evident damage to British companies\u2019 profitability and the cheaper pound made shares of those companies a bargain. British stocks are now higher than they were the day of the vote, as measured by the FTSE 100 index. The pound has fallen further. Photo On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press Similarly, a Trump win would set in motion shifts that market analysts can only guess at. Even if the stock market dropped as analysts are forecasting, that might make the Federal Reserve less likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting, and low rates tend to strengthen asset prices. And investors would surely start to game out which companies stood to gain the most from Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of a lower corporate income tax rate and lighter regulation \u2014 and which could suffer from less availability of immigrant labor. Fundamentally, the tone from economic and market analysts is that they don\u2019t know exactly how Mr. Trump would govern. Nor do they know the composition of the new Congress and how it would deal with a Clinton or Trump administration. First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

    "text": "Decision day for Illinois voters on president, Senate and beyond Duckworth, Kirk Stacey Wescott, Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Rep. Tammy Duckworth, left, and Sen. Mark Kirk make campaign appearances on Nov. 7, 2016. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, left, and Sen. Mark Kirk make campaign appearances on Nov. 7, 2016. (Stacey Wescott, Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy An ever-more-polarized electorate goes to the polls Tuesday to decide races from the White House to the county courthouse in one of the most contentious and expensive elections in Illinois history. Polls open statewide at 6 a.m. and close at 7 p.m., though voters in line at closing time are still eligible to vote, election officials said. A chance of morning rain is in the forecast. Voters throughout Illinois will pick a successor to hometown two-term Democratic President Barack Obama , choose a U.S. senator and weigh in on a special election for comptroller. In many parts of the state, voters also will decide Illinois House and Senate contests that have amassed record spending by forces allied with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic Speaker Michael Madigan . Congressional, judiciary and county races also are on the ballot. Before voters even get to those choices, though, they'll be asked if they want to change the Illinois Constitution with an amendment that aims to prevent transportation-related funding from being used for nontransportation purposes. Once they wade through that lengthy question, voters will get to the marquee contest \u2014 the race for president featuring Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , who was born in Chicago and raised in Park Ridge, against New York real estate mogul and former reality TV star Donald Trump , the GOP nominee. The winner here gets Illinois' 20 electoral votes, with 270 securing the presidency. Donald Trump hammered Hillary Clinton in the final hours before Election Day as corrupt and urged voters to \"deliver justice at the ballot box,\" while Clinton pivoted away from the email controversy that has dogged her campaign and suggested Monday that early voter turnout was breaking her way. ... ... (Sean Sullivan, Anne Gearan, Matea Gold) As has been the case in most recent presidential elections, Illinois largely has served as flyover territory, owing to the state's tradition of heavily favoring the Democrat. Illinois last went Republican in 1988, voting for Republican George H.W. Bush against Democrat Michael Dukakis. As a result, the presidential contest in Illinois has served more as a point for questions about voter intensity and turnout, particularly in the first presidential race without Obama on the ticket in eight years, and whether the battle for the White House will have any down-ballot effects. Monday was the last day for early voting, and at times lines of people wrapped around the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners' special voting center in the Loop. On the eve of Election Day, more than 1.6 million people statewide had voted early or by mail as the number of registered voters crossed the 8 million mark, the State Board of Elections said. Early voting records were expected as the chance to cast a ballot ahead of time was expanded to more than a month after running 13 days in 2012. Election officials said they weren't sure if it was a sign of large turnout or just a substitution from normal Election Day voting. Voters also can register on Election Day. Rather than serving as a contested battleground state, Illinois has served as a significant source of cash to federal candidates, including those running for president. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated Illinois donations to federal candidates and national political parties at more than $125 million during the two-year 2016 election cycle. The group ranked Illinois fourth nationally in contributions to Democrats at more than $66.8 million and seventh to Republicans, with more than $58.4 million \u2014 not including money given to super political action committees. But big money, especially from outside groups, failed to materialize in the U.S. Senate campaign between Republican Sen. Mark Kirk , of Highland Park, who is seeking a second term, and Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth , a two-term congresswoman from Hoffman Estates. The contest is central to Democratic efforts to retake the Senate from Republicans. With a Clinton victory, Democrats need to take four seats currently held by the GOP, five if Trump wins the White House. Heading into the Senate contest, Kirk faced difficult headwinds due to Illinois' Democratic presidential-year propensity. Duckworth also raised more money than Kirk for more than a year, and major Republican-backed national super PACs and independent spending groups shied away. Mark Kirk Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Sen. Mark Kirk greets supporters as he makes a campaign stop at the New Trier Republican headquarters Nov. 7, 2016, in Winnetka. Sen. Mark Kirk greets supporters as he makes a campaign stop at the New Trier Republican headquarters Nov. 7, 2016, in Winnetka. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) On Monday, Kirk stopped by a Republican campaign office in Winnetka, where he spoke to about two dozen campaign workers and supporters. He predicted an \"upset win\" on Tuesday as he lamented the difficulties of running as a Republican statewide. \"When you're a Republican in Illinois, everybody discounts you,\" said Kirk, who noted that his own campaign polling showed him trailing Duckworth. \"People usually are surprised by a Kirk win that comes on a Tuesday election day.\" It wasn't long ago that a Republican won statewide office here \u2014 Rauner did it in 2014. But aside from publicly supporting Kirk's candidacy, the Republican governor and de facto leader of the Illinois GOP hasn't figured much in Kirk's campaign, which has centered on a pledge to restore fiscal order to the federal government. Since Rauner took office, state government has been embroiled in a political stalemate between the governor and Democrats who control the General Assembly \u2014 and the dysfunction has helped to drive the state far deeper into the red. \"It's probably my strategy, that I have not sought to borrow every single problem from Springfield,\" Kirk said when asked why he hadn't tapped Rauner for help on the campaign trail. \"My job is to take care of problems in Washington, D.C. I am up to the minute on Washington, D.C. ... let Bruce run the state, because I think \u2014 I very much support the governor.\" Tammy duckworth Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune Tammy Duckworth, 8th District Congresswoman and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, greets well-wishers Nov. 7, 2016, outside her campaign office in Arlington Heights. Tammy Duckworth, 8th District Congresswoman and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, greets well-wishers Nov. 7, 2016, outside her campaign office in Arlington Heights. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Duckworth made an election eve stop at a Democratic campaign office in Arlington Heights, where she and fellow candidates spent a few minutes dialing for votes. \"I'm pushing hard every single minute, every single hour, all the way through the election day,\" Duckworth said. \"I learned in the Army never to give up on the mission before it's accomplished, and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can.\" Flanked by U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky , of Evanston, and Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza , who is running against Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger, Duckworth thanked campaign workers for knocking on doors \"not just for me but for everyone on the ticket.\" \"I can't wait to get to work and get past tomorrow,\" Duckworth said. The Rauner-Madigan battle will play out in General Assembly contests. All 118 House seats and 40 of 59 Senate seats are up, though more than 60 percent have candidates running unopposed and additional contests feature only token opposition. ",

    "text": "By James Hohmann November 7 at 10:37 AM Follow @JamesHohmann Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross speaks to campaign volunteers in North Carolina. (Jonathan Drake/Reuters) With Breanne Deppisch: THE BIG IDEA: CARY, N.C.\u2014Richard Burr, the senior Republican senator from North Carolina, knows how closely his fortunes are tied to Donald Trump at this point. In a state where the GOP presidential nominee is running neck and neck with Hillary Clinton, he\u2019s stuck with him. Last night he campaigned with Mike Pence. \u201cThere's not a separation between me and Donald Trump,\u201d Burr told a group of party activists recently . Like 2016 in miniature, Trump has sucked up all the oxygen and allowed Democrats to turn several Senate races into referendums on him. As a result, a lawmaker like Burr finds himself vulnerable in a year when he did not expect to. The 60-year-old, once a football star at Wake Forest, has been in Congress since 1994. He could lose to Deborah Ross, a former state legislator and the onetime state director of the ACLU. The final Quinnipiac poll of North Carolina, published this morning , shows the Senate race tied (47 percent to 47 percent) and Clinton leading in the presidential race by two points (47 percent to 45 percent). Ross said in an interview that she can imagine any of the four possible scenarios playing out tomorrow. Trump could win the state narrowly and pull Burr across the finish line. Or Trump could win, and she could still beat Burr (she said she\u2019s met several people in rural areas who support Trump and her). Clinton could win the state, and that could get her across. Or Burr, because of split-ticket voting, could narrowly hold on. \u201cI think all scenarios are possible in a situation where races are close,\u201d she explained, adding that she tries not to think about it. An adviser to Burr said he has been working to win over some later ticket-splitters in the suburbs around Charlotte and Raleigh, like this one, and expressed hope that the incumbent will prevail even if Trump narrowly loses the Tar Heel State. If Senate Democrats win North Carolina, they will almost certainly get back their majority after two years in the wilderness. Richard Burr and Deborah Ross square off in the Research Triangle at their final debate.\u00a0(Gerry Broome/AP/Pool) -- Bigger picture: I spoke yesterday with 20 strategists and operatives who are closely involved in the battle for the Senate, both nationally and in the states. It was an even mix of Republicans and Democrats. I granted them all anonymity to encourage candor. What follows are the most interesting points and predictions that emerged from these interviews, with the important stipulation that any of it could wind up being wrong. The 2016 cycle has shown the shortcomings of conventional wisdom, and a big surprise somewhere is totally conceivable. -- Every person I talked with presupposes that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency, even though the race has tightened. That means Democrats need to pick up four seats because Vice President Tim Kaine would be the tie breaking vote. -- Both sides are girding themselves for what they expect will be a very late night, but the conventional wisdom is that it is more likely than not that Democrats net at least four. Reflecting the high stakes, a study out this weekend showed that more than $532 million has now been spent by outside groups on Senate ads in the general election. -- Republicans say that they\u2019ve done remarkably well at staying in the game, considering what a debacle Trump could have caused down the ballot. One GOP power player likened the party to a football team that\u2019s playing on the road and down a touchdown with two minutes left in the fourth quarter. Despite everything that\u2019s gone wrong in the previous 58 minutes \u2013 injuries, turnovers, penalties \u2013 they could still find a way to get to the end zone. (Political operatives favor sports and war analogies.) Ron Johnson, left, and Eric Trump, right, campaigned together in Eau Claire. (Dan Reiland/The Eau Claire Leader-Telegram via AP) -- Democrats have multiple paths to 50: Everyone agrees that Republican Sen. Mark Kirk will lose in Illinois, a guaranteed pick-up. Ron Johnson has made late strides in Wisconsin after being written off for months. National Democrats stopped running negative ads against him for nearly a month, which allowed the race to tighten. For a stretch, Trump was also spending in Wisconsin and Clinton was dark, which helped. Democrat Russ Feingold is not as good a candidate as he once was, but he is still ultimately expected to narrowly win the rematch. The modeling shows there just are not enough votes for the Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s just not in the cards for RonJohn,\u201d said a Republican. FBI Director James Comey makes his initial announcement about Clinton on July 5. (Cliff Owen/AP) -- Jim Comey\u2019s latest bombshell announcement, clearing the former secretary of state of criminal wrongdoing (once again), helps Democrats the most in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Neither state has early voting, so no ballots have been banked. The GOP incumbents in both places have emphasized the argument that they should get reelected to be a check and balance on Clinton. The news that the FBI is not going to pursue the email matter further may energize some Democrats who are lukewarm about their nominee while also convincing independents who have been contemplating split-ticket voting to support the Democratic challenger. (Much more on the Comey news below...) Hillary Clinton meets casino workers at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas last week with Senate Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) -- Most Republicans have lost hope in Nevada, a place where their candidate Joe Heck led in polls for much of the year. The early voting numbers look pretty bad for the GOP, especially with a spike in Latino turnout. Harry Reid\u2019s machine , which I wrote about recently , got its people out. Heck has been unable to stake out a clear position on Trump, which cost him some base support and accelerated the slippage. Catherine Cortez Masto is poised to become the country\u2019s first Latina senator. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) talks with reporters after the weekly Republican Senate policy luncheon this spring. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) -- Missouri, Indiana and North Carolina are coin flips. Republicans say they feel better about holding the Tar Heel State than they do the Show Me State. -- Roy Blunt and Evan Bayh, two guys who have come to epitomize everything that voters hate about Washington, might both go down. Though from different parties, they are consummate insiders in the year of the outsider. Trump should win Missouri by a pretty solid margin, which could help Blunt pull it out. Some GOP operatives are actually a little nervous that if The Donald expands the electorate too much it will actually hurt Blunt. There is a fairly sizable universe of low-propensity \u201cTrump, not Blunt\u201d voters who will vote for the GOP presidential nominee and the Democratic Senate candidate because they want to reject the status quo. (Blunt\u2019s wife and kids are all lobbyists, and he\u2019s never effectively pushed back on ads about his votes to raise his own pay and his posh mansion in Washington.) Jason Kander, Missouri\u2019s secretary of state, has run a great campaign and released the best commercial of the cycle (the one where he built a rifle blindfolded). But he remains relatively unknown and does not have the built-up institutional goodwill of someone like Bayh, which has made it easier four outside spending to drive up his negatives. Evan Bayh\u00a0thanks volunteers at his field office in Indianapolis. (Michael Conroy/AP) -- Evan Bayh was heavily favored when he jumped into the race in July , but the ex-senator has not had a good news cycle since then. The GOP feels supremely confident he will lose tomorrow (despite polls showing it close and Democrats expressing hope). Republicans masterfully caricatured Birch\u2019s boy as an out-of-touch D.C. influence peddler who has spent little time in the state. His leaked Senate schedule was full of damning revelations about his close ties to Wall Street. The latest oppo hit is that Bayh stayed in a Marriott using taxpayer money, instead of staying in his tiny condo nearby, when he came back to Indianapolis at the end of his last term. Bayh says he will reimburse the government . \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like the Jeb Bush of Senate candidates,\u201d said a Republican who worked to define him. \u201cThe political world has moved on, and he didn\u2019t keep up with the times.\u201d Bayh could win because of the strength of his family name, but he\u2019s the only Democrat in the country who needs a sizable number of Trump supporters to cross over to vote for him. If Trump wins the Hoosier State bigly, and remember Pence is the governor of Indiana, there may not be enough. One\u00a0 poll published Friday put Republican Todd Young ahead by 5 points. -- Pat Toomey will probably not survive if Trump loses Pennsylvania by more than five points, but he still could find a way to hold on. One GOP operative said it will be \u201csurprising but not shocking\u201d if the freshman wins, no matter Trump\u2019s margin. The Republican has known since narrowly winning in the wave year of 2010 that he\u2019d have a hard time surviving with presidential-level turnout, and he\u2019s acted accordingly. His closing ad highlights his support for tougher gun laws after the Sandy Hook massacre and\u00a0 features a clip of Barack Obama praising him three years ago. This prompted the president to issue a weekend statement slamming him . The senator has never endorsed Trump and still won\u2019t say who he is voting for, afraid to alienate Donald\u2019s supporters. During a cringe-worthy interview last Thursday, for instance, he was asked 10 times by the Philadelphia Fox affiliated who he\u2019d be voting for. And he became deeply exasperated. (Amber Phillips posted\u00a0 the transcript . Click below for the video.) WATCH: GOP incumbent Sen. Toomey refuses to answer question on #Fox29GoodDay - will he vote for @realDonaldTrump ? https://t.co/ZPAblPhJbw \u2014 FOX 29 (@FOX29philly) November 3, 2016 Right now, Toomey is over-performing his target numbers in the Philadelphia media market (by resonating with suburban moderates who loathe Trump) and underperforming his targets out-state (where Trump is running pretty strong). But the Democratic emphasis on Philly during the final five days \u2013 the Obamas and the Clintons are holding a blowout rally tonight on Independence Square with Bruce Springsteen \u2013 may juice African American turnout enough to break the GOP modeling that gets him to victory. Republicans get hope from the fact that Rick Santorum and Arlen Specter won reelection even as their party\u2019s presidential nominee lost. Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan shake hands following their final debate last Wednesday in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, Pool) -- Trump\u2019s improved standing in New Hampshire has benefited Kelly Ayotte, but she can probably outrun him by no more than five points (depending on who you ask). Republicans are cautiously optimistic and believe that Trump supporters have come home after temporarily defecting when she repudiated Trump over the now infamous 2005 video (just days after calling him a \u201crole model\u201d). The most amazing dynamic in the Granite State might be how static the race has been. After more than $100 million has been spent, the polls look remarkably similar to how they did on the day that Gov. Maggie Hassan, the Democrat, jumped in. \u00a0-- In a lot of these tight races, a superior and more coordinated Democratic ground game could be good for one to three points. New Hampshire\u2019s same-day voter registration, for instance, will allow the Clinton campaign to lock in a lot of lower-propensity voters from places like Hanover, home of Dartmouth, tomorrow. And a lot of Republicans are privately dubious of recent polling showing Trump as strong as he is, in part because they don\u2019t think some of his core voters will actually show up. Tim Kaine stumps for HRC in Pittsburgh. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) -- Three different tip-top Republicans separately predicted a 50-50 split, which would mean that Chuck Schumer becomes majority leader. That would also mean that a 2017 Senate race next year\u2019s Virginia Senate race could tip the balance of the chamber. The race to replace Kaine, in this scenario, would almost certainly become the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history. Whomever Terry McAuliffe appoints to replace him would face a still unknown Republican. Ted Cruz running-mate Carly Fiorina, despite blowing a totally winnable 2010 Senate race in California, keeps telling people she wants to run. But she would (to put it nicely) not be able to clear the field. Virginia\u2019s demographics may be changing, but with the exception of 2013, the commonwealth has a storied history of rejecting the newly-elected president\u2019s party in its off-year elections. (This is why so many expect Ed Gillespie to be the next governor.) Rubio\u2019s closing ad goes positive. -- Marco Rubio will likely win reelection, but the outcome will be closer than most people in D.C. expect. This will generate a round of stories about whether Democrats should have spent more money in Florida to head off his presumed 2020 run for president. Party decision-makers preemptively explain that they could get way more bang for their buck in other states that were easier pick-up opportunities, and that their primary job is winning the majority \u2013 not thinking about getting Clinton reelected. Rob Portman tours Pioneer Pipe last week in Marietta, Ohio. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) -- An important lesson from 2016: Candidates and campaigns matter. Burr and Blunt made many mistakes. Many of his allies describe the North Carolinian as lazy and complain that he did not engage with the race until too late (some wonder whether he really wants the job). There is a widespread feeling that Blunt erred by putting his son in charge of his campaign, which made it hard for the campaign to grapple objectively with his residency challenges. Unlike those other two states, which were seen as likely Republican holds a year ago, Ohio was expected to be one of the marquee races of the cycle. But Rob Portman put it away by Labor Day because he ran a solid, textbook campaign.

It was, as the children\u2019s book says, a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. But Strickland \u2026 has had his share of those lately.\u201d -- John McCain is also safe at this point. Arizona appears to have moved out of reach for Democrats. Democratic Rep.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) CLINTON CLEARED AGAIN\u00a0-- THE LATEST EMAIL BOMBSHELL:\u00a0 -- FBI Director James Comey\u00a0announced that Clinton will not be charged criminally following a second probe of her private email server. In a letter to congressional committee chairmen, Comey said investigators had worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to review the emails, ultimately finding them either duplicates of previously reviewed correspondence, or personal emails that did not pertain to State Department business. \"We have not changed our conclusions expressed in July,\" he wrote.\u00a0( David A. Fahrenthold, Rosalind S. Helderman and Jenna Johnson have the full story . Tom Hamburger had the scoop yesterday.\u00a0 Read Comey's\u00a0letter here.) -- Serious damage was already done, and it is too late to totally reverse it. By clipping Clinton\u2019s comfortable lead in several states and taking other red states off the map,\u00a0Comey might have deprived HRC of a clearer electoral mandate:\u00a0\"Clinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states that included Georgia and Arizona, drew back to defend blue turf like Michigan and Pennsylvania. In those days, millions of votes were cast. In Colorado, for instance, voters submit their ballots by mail. Daniel Cole, a Republican strategist in the state, said the number of Democrats returning ballots had been surging past the GOP total \u2014 until Comey announced his inquiry. Then, on Friday, the GOP total actually eclipsed the Democrats. 'There was an enthusiasm gap,; Cole said. 'Until the latest bend in the email scandal, the wind was kind of out of our sails.'\" -- The Clinton team's public response was surprisingly measured: \u201cWe were always confident that nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,\u201d Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted. \u201cTrump\u2019s hopes of using Comey to distract the voters in closing days of the campaign just went up in smoke.\" -- Trump said yesterday morning that his opponent would definitely be indicted soon. After Comey gave lie to that, Donald changed his tune in Michigan to again argue that Clinton is \"being protected by a rigged system.\" \"She is\u00a0is guilty,\" he said. \"She knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. Now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8th.\"\u00a0( Jenna Johnson ) -- Reflecting how much the markets want the stability that would come up with a Clinton presidency, stocks and the dollar jumped this morning based on the Comey announcement: Futures pointed to a 1.5 percent opening gain for the S&P 500, slated to end its longest losing streak in more than 35 years. The Mexican peso also gained, the Wall Street Journal notes. -- \u201cIn another kind of political season, that might have settled the matter. But instead, it generated a new round\u00a0of dark theorizing from some of the same people who had praised Comey only nine days before,\" Karen Tumulty writes in an analysis piece. \u201cThe two sides are likely to be arguing for years over the question of who was helped and who was hurt by Comey\u2019s string of late-breaking announcements. And on the Republican side, the bureau will face a host of new questions. ...\u00a0The whole saga also will probably reinforce the disillusioned American public\u2019s perception that the political system is corrupt, and that the institutions of government are failing.\u00a0It is likely, as well, to further undermine the legitimacy of whoever wins the election in this deeply polarized country. \u2018Regrettably, this is of a piece with every event that happened before it in the campaign,\u2019 said William A. Galston, a governance expert at the Brookings Institution. \u2018In a way, it is a perfectly fitting end to a truly awful campaign.\u2019\u201d -- While Democrats expressed relief, they also castigated Comey for announcing such an ill-timed investigation. Harry Reid use the word \"irresponsible\" multiple times in his statement. And three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed how badly Comey has hurt his standing: Ranking member Patrick Leahy read the letter aloud from his phone during an event in Vermont (where he\u2019s coasting to reelection). The crowd roared. \u201cI won't add to what was said because the fact is, I've always believed in Hillary Clinton's honesty,\" Leahy said. \"I've always supported her. \u2026 You know, once in a while it's nice when everything comes together.\" (\u00a0 Seven Days ) \u201cThis should end the email saga once and for all,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement . \u201cThe October surprise that came only 11 days before Election Day has unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election. The letter makes Director Comey\u2019s actions nine days ago even more troubling. There\u2019s no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency\u2019s inquiry.\" Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) called for Senate hearings to rake Comey over the coals for botching this: \"I think that there should be hearings, and I'm certain there will be hearings in the Judiciary Committee on this matter,\" he said\u00a0during a morning TV hit. -- Some congressional Republicans said they won't let this\u00a0go:\u00a0 Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley\u00a0(R-Iowa) claimed the \u201cvague\u201d announcement \u201cfailed to provide context\u201d and that he was \u201cunsure\u201d whether the review was actually over. \u201cThe growing number of unanswered questions demand explanations: Is the FBI continuing to review the newly-revealed emails?\u201d he\u00a0 said in a statement . \u201cDid the FBI limit its review to email from when Clinton was Secretary of State, leaving out emails that could shed light on possible obstruction of Congress?\u201d \"Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\u201d Speaker\u00a0 Paul Ryan said in a statement. \u201cLet's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday.\" -- Objectively, Comey really screwed the pooch . \u201cNBA referees ref the first 44 minutes of a game differently than they ref the final four minutes,\u201d writes The Fix's Chris Cillizza .\u00a0\u201cThey understand that in the final four minutes, the bar for a foul is higher because the stakes are raised. Shooting two free throws in a two-point game in the first quarter is very different from doing the same thing with 35 seconds left \u2026 Same goes for Comey. He needed to understand that to say something about Clinton's email investigation so close to the election meant that he had very real concerns about the possibility of a president-elect being indicted. To simply say \u2014 after a nine-day hurricane of news stories about Clinton's emails \u2014 that there was never anything to see here is a remarkable swing and miss on Comey's part.\" -- Comey has perhaps irreparably hurt the FBI's brand. Ellen Nakashima, Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky look back on 10 nightmarish days for the bureau : \"As the agents worked, the bureau faced a\u00a0seemingly endless\u00a0torrent of criticism. News leaked that agents in the FBI\u2019s New York field office had been advocating for a separate investigation of the Clinton Foundation, even though public integrity prosecutors had told them that they did not have a case. That fueled the perception that at least some in the bureau, an organization of predominantly white men, might have partisan motivations, and Democrats called for the Justice Department inspector general to look into the matter.\" LATEST POLLING: -- Our Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll finds Clinton with a four point lead over Trump (47-43), regaining her edge in popularity and matching Obama\u2019s advantage among minorities in the final hours of the race. -- Bloomberg Politics poll \u00a0gives Clinton a three point national lead (46-43). She was up nine in the mid-October poll. Clinton holds a 46-38 lead among people who say they\u2019ve already voted.\u00a0The email issue appears not to have dogged Clinton\u2019s standing among her supporters: just three percent said it caused them to change or seriously consider changing their vote. (70 percent say it hasn't worried them.) -- A CBS News national poll also shows Clinton holding a four point lead (45-41), with just five percent of likely voters saying they could potentially change their mind. -- The final Quinnipiac numbers : Clinton up 46-45 in FLORIDA and 47-45 in NORTH CAROLINA. -- A Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell poll in MICHIGAN shows Clinton up five points, compared to a three point lead last week. -- A UNH Granite State poll finds Clinton up 11 (49-38) in NEW HAMPSHIRE.

Hillary landed at the airport in Westchester, N.Y. at 11:06 p.m. after her nighttime rally with James Taylor in Manchester, N.H. -- The Republican nominee will hold five rallies today, jetting from Florida to North Carolina to Pennsylvania to New Hampshire and then to Michigan. Clinton, by contrast, will appear in three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. -- USA Today has\u00a0op-eds\u00a0from both Clinton and Trump making the case for \"why you should vote for me.\" THE LATINO SLEEPING GIANT AWAKES: -- A Telemundo/Naleo poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 62 points among Latino voters (76-14). And 56 percent of Latino voters said they were \u201cmore enthusiastic\u201d about voting this year than in 2012. -- \u201cIn Florida \u2026 there are early indications that Hispanics have mobilized for this election like no other in U.S. history, Robert Samuels writes . \u201cOn Saturday, the Democrats\u2019 efforts to court Cuban Americans was on display in Hialeah, the heart of the exile community. In addition to [a] chiva bus, Clinton allies parked a van blasting hip-hop and reggaeton music \u2026 [and] handed out guava pastries from a tent. Waiting for them were a group of Trump supporters who started yelling, \u2018Lock her up!\u2019 The Democrats started shouting back, comparing the GOP presidential nominee to the reviled Cuban dictator: \u2018Castro, no! Trump tampoco!\u2019 They also chanted another Spanish phrase that suggested Trump and Castro were funded by the Russians.\u201d -- President Obama focused on Hispanic voters as he campaigned for Clinton yesterday in Kissimmee, Florida (where I wrote last Tuesday\u2019s big idea on Hispanic GOTV efforts from). \u201cThis election is about the character of this country,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWho are we? What do we stand for? ... If we win Florida, it is a wrap. If we win Florida, it is over.\u201d ( Greg\u00a0Jaffe ) -- Evidence mounts that the Democratic outreach is paying off: Some numbers: Trump campaign officials have zeroed in on Florida as the most important state for Trump to win on Tuesday, Bloomberg\u2019s Joshua Green notes \u2013 and believe Miami-Dade County is \u201cthe most important county\u201d for Trump\u2019s chances to take home a victory in the state. Whether Trump can win enough voters in Miami-Dade is another question, however: \u201cThrough Saturday \u2026 707,844 county residents had already voted: 44 percent were Democrats, 30 percent Republican, and 25 percent had \u201cno party affiliation,\" a group that tends to skew younger and Hispanic, and thus toward Clinton. The demographic mix of early voters also looks highly favorable to Clinton: 58 percent Hispanic, 17 percent African-American and 20 percent white.\u201d A telling anecdote: \u201cCanvassing on Saturday morning in North Miami, Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, and a handful of local members focused on households, many of them Haitian or Hispanic, with an infrequent voting history. But nearly every resident who answered their door assured her they had already voted.\u201d (Jonathan Martin in the Times ) -- Most of Trump\u2019s own Latinos employees will vote against him --> \u201c Latina Hotel Workers Harness Force of Labor and of Politics in Las Vegas ,\u201d by New York Times\u2019 Dan Barry: \u201cMs. Vargas, who is from El Salvador, and her Latina union colleagues are a growing force in the politics and culture of Nevada, vocal in their beliefs and expectations.

He took kids on rides in his helicopter in Iowa and stopped by a high school homecoming. There were no fundraisers, no sprawling staff, no teleprompters, no one telling him no. He held rallies in struggling former industrial towns with low median incomes and high rates of anger \u2014 and thousands would show up. [A September rally in] Oklahoma foreshadowed what would come. There was the crowd \u2014 loud and adoring, no matter what Trump said or did or what might be revealed about his past. There was the palpable anger, the sharing of conspiracy theories, the mob mentality. \u201cPick up your pitchfork!\u201d a local politician shouted, firing up the crowd before Trump arrived. \u201cFollow our next commander in chief!

He mentioned a recent case in which 10 people were stabbed at a Minnesota mall. The attacker was a Somali man who had immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was 2. A news agency tied to the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the man was a \u201csoldier\u201d for the group. \u201cYou\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota,\u201d Trump said.

Peters and Michael Barbaro : \u201cOn the surface, there is the semblance of stability that is robbing [Clinton] of her most potent weapon: Mr. Trump\u2019s self-sabotaging eruptions, which have repeatedly undermined his candidacy. Underneath that veneer, turbulence still reigns, making it difficult for him to overcome all of the obstacles blocking his path to the White House.\u201d Five nuggets: The operation is embarrassingly unsophisticated: \u201cOver a cheeseburger, fried calamari and an \u2018Ivanka Salad\u2019 at the Trump Grill in the basement of Trump Tower last week, several aides flipped open a laptop and loaded the popular website 270towin.com, which allows users to create their own winning electoral maps. For 10 minutes, they clicked through the country, putting Democratic-leaning states won by Mr. Obama four years ago, like New Mexico and Colorado, into Mr. Trump\u2019s column. Their analysis seemed more atmospheric than scientific.\u201d Trump aides have wrested control of his Twitter account, which he has often used to shoot himself in the metaphorical foot , in order to help him stay on-message. Advisers pleaded with Trump not to threaten to sue his female accusers during last month\u2019s Gettysburg speech, warning that such threats could make him appear \u201csmall.\u201d But Trump was adamant, telling staffers there had to be a \u201csevere penalty\u201d for those who dare attack him.

Those dueling impulses powered the rise of both Clintons: one impulse galvanizing supporters who deeply admired their commitment to public service, the other galling critics who saw them as playing by their own rules \u2026 [The Clintons] would be bookends on their cohort, one seizing the national stage on behalf of their generation in its prime, the other, who now qualifies for Medicare, vying to lead it into its dotage.\u201d -- \u201c Jewish Voters, Prized in Florida, Tell What Drives Them ,\u201d from The Times\u2019 Rick Rojas: \u201cRepublicans are sending around cards showing a glowering Hillary Clinton, an Iranian flag and missiles, and saying: \u2018The Obama/Clinton Iran Deal Puts Israel at Risk.\u2019 \u2026 Then there is the Facebook ad and robocall campaign puckishly titled \u2018WWJD.\u2019 It answered the question many Jews here were wondering: What would Joe (as in Lieberman) do? One of the most prized groups of voters in the Sunshine State is its hundreds of thousands of Jews \u2026 Layered on top of [typical concerns about the nominees] are specific concerns over support for Israel; the nuclear arms agreement with Iran, which is unpopular with Jewish conservatives; and unease over anti-Semitism that has surfaced among segments of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\u201d WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- \u201c Civil rights advocates work to prevent polling chaos ,\u201d by Janell Ross:\u00a0\u201cBehind the locked glass doors of a downtown Washington office \u2026 volunteers are fielding phone call after phone call. ... It is one outpost of the Election Protection Coalition voter hotline, a volunteer-staffed nonpartisan network of organizations devoted to protecting the right to vote. The advocates behind the operation say they are worried that more than any presidential election in the past 50 years, the 2016 contest carries a pronounced risk for impropriety and mischief. They, too, like Trump, worry that the election could be rigged. In response, the coalition has set up 23 call centers across the country for what it thinks will be a fractious and contentious Election Day.\u201d -- \u201c For some Syrian women, refugee life proves unexpectedly liberating ,\u201d by Kristen Chick: \u201cSamar Hijazi stood in front of the judge of the Sunni sharia court \u2026 last month as he addressed her in rapid-fire bursts from behind an imposing desk. \u2018This is against God\u2019s will,\u2019 he said. \u2018If you divorce, you\u2019ll have problems with your children. God will be against you. Will you reconsider?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 she said firmly. Just like that, Hijazi, 45, was freed from a 33-year marriage to a man she described as abusive and domineering. The refugee from Syria\u2019s war had long wished for such an ending, but it had never seemed possible \u2026 That changed when the family fled to Lebanon two years ago. \u2026 For some Syrian women living in Lebanon, the bitter realities of life as a refugee have nourished an unexpected side effect: empowerment. Uprooted from some familiar social constraints and exposed to programs promoting women\u2019s rights through contact with aid groups, some of them have obtained a degree of personal autonomy they never experienced in Syria.\u201d -- \u201cAs the most frightening election of my lifetime draws to a close, I find myself thinking of a teenager I met many years ago in Siberia who was moved to tears after sitting for an exam to win a U.S.-sponsored study trip to the United States,\u201d editorial page editor Fred Hiatt writes in a first-person column. \u201cShe didn\u2019t yet know whether she had won or lost \u2014 but it was the first time she had ever felt she was competing for something on her merits, where bribes or connections to people in power would have no effect. That alone made her grateful and admiring of the United States. She was seeing what, to me, is the real America. To me, America is not at heart selfish, petty, hateful or bigoted. One candidate for president may be all of those things, and may suggest that we are like him. But I don\u2019t believe most Americans \u2014 including most Americans voting for him \u2014 share those ungenerous traits. I don\u2019t believe we will elect such a man, either. But if we did, I believe the real America would be strong enough to survive and outlast him and remain \u2014 or once again become \u2014 the kind of place a teenager in Siberia can admire.\" SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Tom Toles's last cartoon before the election laments the dearth of substantive debate about policy: Demonstrators vandalized the FBI building (click to watch): ",

    "text": "[ For FBI, email investigation yields little but criticism ] Earlier Monday, her campaign manager Robby Mook criticized Comey\u2019s handling of the probe as \u201cbizarre,\u201d even as he said that he was relieved by the outcome. \u201cWe were glad obviously that this was resolved,\u201d Mook told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on ABC. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t have just looked into the matter and resolved it and not created such a ruckus in the campaign, but we\u2019re just glad in this last day Hillary can get back on the road.\u201d In July, Comey ended an FBI probe into the server saying that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with classified information in the emails, but that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would recommend criminal charges. A government official said Comey\u2019s latest letter represented the conclusion of the FBI\u2019s investigation. Trump, who had been trailing badly in the polls when the new emails were revealed, has since narrowed the gap, leaning on a message that Clinton was \u201ccrooked\u201d and likely to be charged. But Clinton appears narrowly ahead in most polls, and her campaign officials pointed to heavy turnout among Hispanics and Asians in crucial swing states, such as Florida and North Carolina, as evidence that the race was moving in their direction. More than 6.4 million voters in Florida have voted early, up nearly 35 percent over 2012, according to the Clinton campaign, with big early surges in majority Hispanic Miami Dade county. More broadly, the Clinton campaign said that early voter turnout was breaking records \u2014 with more than 41 million Americans casting ballots before Election Day \u201cWe are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history,\u201d Clinton said in Pittsburgh. \u201cIf the lines are long tomorrow, please wait.\u201d The Justice Department said Monday that it would deploy more than 500 poll-watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, including at least three in each of the swing states. Many of the jurisdictions have large Native American, black, Latino and Muslim populations The department said its lawyers would be working to enforce federal voting rights laws \u201cto ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot.\u201d It also has a hotline (toll free at 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-3931) to register complaints. In the last few days of the campaign, Trump has invested time and resources in blue-leaning states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees. The real estate developer told crowd after crowd Monday that he was on track to victory, urging his supporters to ignore the \u201cphony stuff\u201d in the media. And Trump continued to erroneously assert that he had given \u201cover $100 million\u201d of his personal funds to finance his campaign. (In fact, he donated a little more than $66 million, according to Federal Election Commission reports.) \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy \u2026 and money,\u201d Trump said in Raleigh, adding, \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, honestly, we\u2019ve all wasted our time.\u201d On Sunday, Trump used a swing through the Midwest to warn about the threat of refugees, including in Minnesota, where he singled out \u201clarge numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state ... and with some of them then joining ISIS.\u201d Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, said Trump\u2019s remarks would backfire on him by spurring Somali Americans to go to the polls. \u201cAny young Somali who was wondering \u2013 should I vote? should I not vote? \u2014 is off the fence now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe probably gave us two to three points, and he badly misunderstood who our Somali immigrants are. They\u2019re neighbors. ... If you attack them, you attack the whole state of Minnesota.\u201d Both Trump and Clinton scrambled across the country Monday, appearing within hours of each other in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Raleigh. The appearances reflect an electoral map that seemed to shift in the wake of Comey\u2019s announcement of the new emails nine days earlier. Clinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states that included Georgia and Arizona, has turned back to defend blue turf such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Monday, Clinton was set to hold four rallies in three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. She will finish the day with a rally in Philadelphia that includes President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, followed by a midnight speech in Raleigh, where Lady Gaga was set to appear. The Clinton campaign is leaning heavily on the president and Michelle Obama to drum up enthusiasm and spur voter turnout on election day. Obama appeared in Michigan several hours ahead of Clinton and used his remarks to praise the Democratic nominee and tout his work in the first term to bolster the country\u2019s then-sputtering auto industry. \u201cI think I\u2019ve earned some credibility here,\u201d Obama said of his efforts to shore up the auto industry. When it comes to voting for Clinton on Tuesday, he continued, \u201cI am asking you to trust me on this one.\u201d [ Clinton holds edge in swing state Virginia ] Later in the day, in Durham, N.H., Obama grew reflective, noting that it was his final solo rally as president. He recounted the story of Edith Childs , the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan \u201cFired Up! Ready to Go!\u201d \u2014 the same story he told at his last rally on the eve of his first election. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us,\u201d the president told thousands of cheering supporters who filled an arena at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cThis is one of those moments,\u201d Obama added. \u201cDon\u2019t let it slip away.\u201d Gearan reported from Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Mich., Sullivan from Raleigh and Sarasota, Fla., and Gold from Washington. Abigail Hauslohner and David Weigel in Washington and David Nakamura in Durham, N.H., contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

She was definitely taken against her will,\u201d Keith Papini told ABC News in a Sunday interview. Sherri Papini, 34, of Shasta County was reported missing on Wednesday at about 6 p.m. after having gone jogging at approximately 2 p.m. According to a poster that was distributed in the search effort, Papini was last seen jogging alone on Sunrise Drive in Redding. Described by her family as being a \u201csuper mom,\u201d she failed to pick up her two young children from child care on Wednesday, sparking concern. Northern California \u2018Super Mom\u2019 Vanished While Jogging \u201cI received a text message from her at 10:37 a.m. that day asking me if I was coming home for lunch,\u201d Keith Papini said. \u201cI usually don\u2019t bring my personal phone in on my job. So I didn\u2019t respond to that message until 1:39 p.m. that day.\u201d Papini added that he traced his wife\u2019s cellphone using an app that tracks lost phones and found the device on the side of a road. \u201cKnowing that she didn\u2019t pick up our kids \u2014 there is no way that ever happens,\u201d Papini said. \u201cShe could drop her phone, but she would never in a million years not pick up our children on a time that she normally would have.\u201d Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said on Saturday that the missing woman was \u201cconsidered at risk due to the suspicious circumstances.\u201d She was last seen wearing a pink jogging top. Search teams have been scouring the area, and Papini\u2019s family has offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who can provide information leading to her whereabouts. \u201cShe has a family that loves her. Please just bring her home,\u201d said her sister, Sheila Koester. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH Officials Hopeful ISIS Leader's New Audio and Sightings Mean He's Cornered 0 Shares Email Iraqi Kurdish fighters exchanged heavy fire with militants early on Monday as they advanced from two directions into a town held by the Islamic State group east of the city of Mosul. Meanwhile, troops advancing south of Mosul discovered a mass grave with some 100 decapitated bodies. Here is a look at the main developments on the 21st day of the Mosul Offensive: PUSH FROM THE EAST The offensive to reclaim the town of Bashiqa is part of the broader push to drive IS out of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the militants' last major urban stronghold in the country. Combat began at dawn with a Kurdish barrage of heavy artillery, Katyusha rockets and mortar rounds slamming into IS positions, providing cover for the advance of armored columns. Smoke rose from town throughout the day, with large explosions sending dark clouds into the sky. MASS GRAVE FOUND On Mosul's southern front, Iraqi soldiers were advancing into Hamam al-Alil, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the city center. Private broadcaster Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen showed images of soldiers hoisting the Iraqi flag on a rooftop in the town. Army spokesman Brig. Firas Bashar said the city had been retaken, although fighting still continued and other reports said that IS fighters remained in several areas. IN MOSUL, TROOPS QUESTION CIVILIANS As Iraqi forces struggle to solidify gains in neighborhoods in eastern Mosul, more and more civilians are fleeing the city. At a checkpoint on the edge of Gogjali, Mosul's easternmost neighborhood, civilians fleeing Mosul were screened to catch any IS fighters who may be hiding among them. Since Iraqi forces first pushed into the eastern edge of the city last Tuesday, dozens of people have been arrested. At the checkpoint, men were waiting for their names to be screened by a pair of informants from the area and multiple Iraqi government databases. Women and children waited further back from the road in the shade of an abandoned building. U.N. SENDING EMERGENCY AID TEAMS Meanwhile, the U.N. health agency said it has set up 82 \"rapid response teams\" to manage risks of epidemics, chemical exposure and other health worries among people fleeing Mosul. The World Health Organization says that water and sanitation in camps for displaced people could \"face disruptions\" as the numbers of those who fled Mosul is growing, raising the risk of food- and water-borne diseases such as cholera . It also says that additional concerns include children who reportedly haven't been immunized since the radical Islamic State group seized control of Mosul in June 2014. 0 Shares ",

Republicans entered the 2016 election cycle on the defensive: Of the 34 seats up for grabs this year, 24 are currently held by the GOP and just ten by the Democrats. Eight of the nine most competitive races are for GOP-held seats and six of those contests feature first-term GOP incumbents who were elected in the tea party wave of 2010.

Voters are indicating that they want a Congressional check on the president. While Clinton led by 4 points in the final pre-election NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , 51 percent of likely voters said they were more likely to support a Republican congressional candidate who would serve as a check on a potential Clinton presidency. Just 40 percent said they would be more likely to support a Democratic congressional candidate who would support Clinton's agenda. (Still, when voters were asked if they prefer a Congress led by Democrats or by Republicans, Clinton's party retained an advantage, 47 percent to 44 percent.) Last-minute cash infusions by the parties and by super PACs are keeping Senate races competitive and outcomes uncertain.

Illinois: Republican Sen. Mark Kirk v Democrat Tammy Duckworth Kirk was elected to the Senate to fill the remaining days of Sen. Barack Obama's seat in 2010 while simultaneously winning his own six-year term. Kirk could very well be a one-term Senator, however, as polls in this race show Kirk is seven points behind challenger Duckworth. Kirk has taken some moderate positions to better represent his Democratic-leaning state, including his support of gun control legislation and a vote on Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.

He recently called President Barack Obama a \"drug dealer in chief,\" but the most egregious comment was less than two weeks before Election Day when he said during a debate that Duckworth's parents came to the U.S. to \"serve\" George Washington. Kirk apologized for racially offensive remarks While the race is more a referendum on Kirk, Duckworth, his challenger, is running on her record. As an Iraq War vet who lost both her legs while piloting a Black Hawk helicopter, she spent much of her post-war career on veterans issues, eventually winning election to the House in 2012. Duckworth was endorsed by the right-leaning Chicago Tribune editorial board, citing Kirk's health as a reason. Kirk suffered a stroke in 2012 and in an attempt to dispel any concerns from voters, he released a letter from his doctor recently that said he has made \"a full cognitive recovery.\" 2). Wisconsin: Republican Sen. Ron Johnson v Democratic former Sen. Russ Feingold This is a re-match from 2010 when upstart Johnson beat 18-year incumbent Feingold in the tea party wave of 2010. Six years later, the match-up between the conservative Johnson and the liberal Feingold, is much closer than anticipated. Early in the race, Feingold dominated the polls , resulting in the national super PACs and the respective campaign committees to stop spending money there. But the race has become nearly tied in the final weeks. Attempting to walk a very fine line, Johnson has not defended Trump but hasn't denounced him either; he supports him but won't endorse him. At a debate earlier this month Johnson said he agreed with the nominee on issues like border security but that he won't \"defend the indefensible.\" Feingold is attempting to paint Johnson as a rigid conservative who is too extreme for Wisconsin while Johnson says that Feingold has spent too much time in Washington and will say anything to get elected. 3). Pennsylvania: Republican Sen. Pat Toomey v Democrat Katie McGinty Toomey is another Republican senator who was elected in the wave of 2010 at risk of losing his re-election. He is considered to be a moderate - and popular - Republican who was endorsed by Gabby Giffords pro-gun regulation group because of his support of gun laws. He even released an ad in the final weekend before Election Day featuring President Barack Obama praising Toomey for his support on gun control. But Pennsylvania is a presidential battleground state and that race is having an impact on Toomey, who is down two points, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average . He has refused to say if he plans to vote for Trump, saying he \"remains unpersuaded,\" giving fodder to his challenger, McGinty, who says that Toomey doesn't have the \"courage\" to stand up to Trump. Toomey has responded that he's running his own race but vows to \"stand up\" to Trump in Washington.

Indiana: Republican Rep. Todd Young v Democrat Evan Bayh In this open seat to replace retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats, Democrat Bayh is trying to win his seat back. He retired from the Senate in 2011 and with more than $10 million left over in his campaign account, Democrats recruited him to return to the Senate. But Bayh, also a former governor and son of former senator Birch Bayh, has not been able to coast to what was expected to be an easy victory because of his 20-point lead earlier this year. But his challenger, Rep. Todd Young and allies have effectively painted him as a disconnected politician who has spent hardly any time in Indiana since he left the Senate six years ago and is more interested in making money and pleasing corporate interests than serving the people of Indiana. Young, a former marine, has received enthusiastic support from conservative groups who have spent readily to help him. The IndyStar tabulated the amount spent on the Senate race by the candidates and outside groups has been more than $30 million through September, with Young receiving the slight advantage with the help from the main Senate Republican super PAC Senate Leadership Fund's $9 million worth of advertising in the state. Young has endorsed Trump but threatened to renege on his support after the Access Hollywood video was leaked. But Young has not yet withdrawn his support in the conservative state that is likely to support Trump on November 8. 5). Missouri: Sen. Roy Blunt v Democrat Jason Kander The Missouri Senate race was not expected to be close until Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the political environment difficult for down-ballot candidates. Simultaneously, however, Kander has proven to be a strong campaigner, resulting in the tightening of polls in recent weeks with Blunt seeing only a one point advantage, making this one of the races that Democrats could win. Blunt, who rose through the ranks in the House of Representatives and quickly became a part of leadership in his first term in the Senate, has endorsed Trump but has tried to run as an independent separate from the bombastic nominee. As the Kansas City Star notes, Kander has not focused on Blunt's support of Trump because Kander might need some of Trump's supporters if he wants to beat Blunt in the conservative state. And Kander has had one of the most effective ads this campaign cycle. The telegenic 35-year old Missouri secretary of state assembles a rifle blindfolded, while saying, \"Sen. Bunt has been attacking me on guns.\" He continues to detail his role in the U.S. Army and his positions on guns. While Kander has sought to tie Blunt to Washington, and Blunt is trying to tie Kander to Hillary Clinton. What could be a damaging closing argument ad by the Senate Leadership Fund in the red state ties Kander to Clinton. \"One Hillary in Washington would be bad enough,\" the narrator says. 6). Nevada: Rep. Joe Heck v Catherine Cortez Masto Heck and Cortez Masto are running to fill Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's open seat. Cortez Masto, Sen. Reid's hand-picked successor and former Nevada attorney general, would be the first Latina to serve in the Senate if she won. She is aggressively trying to tie Heck to Trump, hoping that the large Latino population backs her. Heck, a doctor and brigadier general in the U.S. Army, was first elected to Congress in 2010, in the Republican wave, but has been struggling to balance the shadow of Trump. He withdrew his endorsement of Trump after the Access Hollywood tape but Democrats are taking advantage of a leaked tape of Heck saying at a fundraiser, \"I want to support him, I really do.\" Heck continues to say, according to CNN, that Trump \"has got to change his tone.\" Heck was consistently leading in the polls until mid-October when Cortez Masto is nearly tied, but showing the volatility of the race, Heck has a four point advantage according to a RCP average in the final week. A tremendous amount of money has been spent in the race with Democrats spending at least $37 million and Republicans at least $35 million in television advertisements alone - and that doesn't count the last two weeks of the election. 7). North Carolina: Republican Sen. Richard Burr v Deborah Ross Of all the Republicans running in competitive Senate races this year, Burr is the only one who wasn't elected in 2010. He's served in the Senate for two terms and is on the Senate Intelligence committee. He's trying to fend off Ross, a former state representative and former head of the ACLU in the state, in a race that has unexpectedly become close. Burr, who easily won his last re-election in 2010, didn't start campaigning in earnest until the Fall, forcing the Republican Party and allied groups to spend money to bolster him there as Ross started to close. As for the Trump impact, Burr has not come to Trump's defense after the Access Hollywood tape was released but said he will vote for him. Burr is, however, trying to tie Ross to Clinton, especially after the new laptop was found 11 days before Election Day. Ross has stood by Clinton and has received the benefit of a large cadre of big-name Clinton surrogates campaigning for her in the Tar Heel State, including President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The polls show the race tied, with the latest Real Clear Politics polling average showing Burr with 1 point advantage. 8). New Hampshire: Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte v Gov. Maggie Hassan Incumbent Sen. Ayotte, who was elected to her first term in 2010, has struggled to manage the Trump factor in her race. After months of refusing to say she supports him or doesn't, a Trump moment became her most high profile moment from the campaign. During a debate with Gov. Hassan, she bumbled through her answer to a question about Trump before finally saying Trump was a \"role model\" for children. She came out days later saying she \"misspoke.\" Play ",

    "text": "A Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s investigative report says Kohlhepp \u201cconfessed to investigators that he shot and killed\u201d the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop. \u201cKohlhepp gave details ... that only the killer would know,\u201d the report says. Authorities say Kohlhepp is a suspect in at least three other deaths. Sheriff Wright says Kohlhepp also showed law enforcement officers Saturday where he says he buried two other victims on his 95-acre property near Woodruff. Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, was at the site for less than an hour. The sheriff would not say whether more bodies were found in the graves Kohlhepp led them to, but he did say they would be excavated, reports CBS Spartanburg affiliate WSPA-TV . Those alleged grave sites are in addition to the body found Friday at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver , the boyfriend of the woman found Thursday. Carver and the woman went missing around Aug. 31. Their last known cellphone signals led authorities to the property. The Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted. Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds. An anthropologist is helping determine how long Carver was buried, Clevenger said. He declined to say how many times Carver had been shot. The sheriff says it\u2019s possible more bodies will be uncovered. The wife of one of the 2003 victims said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the shop several times. Melissa Ponder told The Associated Press she was resigned that her husband Scott\u2019s death would never be solved before getting a phone call Saturday evening from one of the case\u2019s original detectives. Detectives told family members of all four victims of the confession at the same time. \u201cHe knew too much about the crime scene,\u201d Ponder said of Kohlhepp\u2019s account to detectives. \u201cHe knew everything.\u201d The Superbike killings stunned the Chesnee community, with rumors like they were committed by a Mexican drug gang or were part of a love triangle crushing the families of the victims. Melissa Ponder is glad the rumors weren\u2019t true. \u201cIt isn\u2019t closure, but it is an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am thankful for that.\u201d Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. Fifteen years after he was released from prison for that crime, Spartanburg County deputies were brought to his property by the last known cellphone signals of two missing people. On Thursday, they found Brown chained in a container for two months. She told investigators that Kohlhepp shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her.\u00a0 His prison stint didn\u2019t stop Kohlhepp from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm. Wright said \u201cit\u2019s strange\u201d that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long. Scott Waldrop, who\u2019s lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \u201cprepper\u201d who liked his privacy, but \u201che didn\u2019t seem like a threat.\u201d Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \u201cI was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hate to know somebody who\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private but liked to brag about how much money he made day trading online. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Trump's Tax Returns Remain Mystery as Election Day Looms By Meghan Keneally Nov 7, 2016, 6:12 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Under Scrutiny for Tax Returns, Comments on Veterans 0 Shares Email Election Day is just hours away and one of the campaign's greatest mysteries remains unsolved: Donald Trump never released his tax returns. The Republican presidential candidate 's campaign was full of firsts, but he also earned the title of the first major party candidate not to release his tax returns since President Gerald Ford . Trump repeatedly claimed that his taxes were under routine audit and said that he would release them as soon as the audit was completed. He later said that he would do so if Hillary Clinton released the 33,000 emails that she deleted. Experts Say No Legal Barrier to Donald Trump Releasing Taxes During a Republican primary debate in February, Trump said that he wanted to release the returns but an audit was being conducted. Several tax experts told ABC news that there are no legal reasons barring a subject of an audit from releasing their own returns. Three pages that appeared to be from Trump's 1995 state tax filings were anonymously sent to The New York Times in October and they reportedly show that he declared a $916 million loss. The paper claimed that the loss could have allowed Trump to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years. Trump's camp did not dispute the documents, but said he paid hundreds of millions of dollars in other taxes over the years. The topic came up in the first presidential debate as well, with Clinton suggesting a few reasons Trump might be refusing to release his returns, and after she charged that he didn't pay federal income taxes in some years, he couldn't stop himself from boasting, \"That makes me smart.\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, released 10 years of his family's tax returns in September. By contrast, Hillary Clinton released her family's tax returns from 2007 through 2014, and they had previously released returns dating back to 1977. Her campaign states that their family paid an effective tax rate of 35.7 percent in 2014. Clinton's campaign his criticized Trump's lack of transparency, speculating that the tax returns could reveal Trump's net worth is lower than he claims or he's given less to charity than he says. 0 Shares ",

Cyber centers at the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI \u2014 as well as the Pentagon, the CIA and other intelligence agencies \u2014 will be on alert, with extra staff hunting for any possible threat, officials say. Watch Cynthia McFadden on Nightly News with Lester Holt for More The concern is so high, intelligence officials told NBC, that for the first time, hundreds of military and intelligence cyber experts who work out of top secret facilities, including underground bunkers, will be monitoring intelligence about a U.S. presidential election.

U.S. officials have accused Russia of using cyber operations to meddle in the election, hacking into Democratic Party accounts and leaking the material to embarrass the Hillary Clinton campaign. American officials are worried Russia will use its cyber capabilities to try to disrupt the presidential election itself, possibly by releasing fake documents and creating bogus social media accounts designed to spread misinformation. \"There is maybe a one in three chance of this happening but it's not insignificant.\" On Tuesday, former NATO commander Admiral James Stavridis told CNBC his concerns about possible Russian activity included a dump of false documents and an attack on the U.S. power grid. \"There is maybe a one in three chance of this happening but it's not insignificant,\" said Stavridis. On Friday the hacker known as \"Guccifer 2.0\" \u2014 which U.S. officials say is a front for Russian intelligence \u2014 tweeted a threat to monitor the U.S. elections \"from inside the system.\" U.S. officials have delivered a back channel warning to Russia not to do anything that would affect the vote. But there are widespread fears that cyber mischief by hackers, either from Russia or elsewhere, will somehow mar the election. There are limits to what the U.S. government's cyber force can do to protect American networks, most of which are owned by private companies. But the Pentagon's cyber command has the capacity to retaliate in the event of a major attack on critical infrastructure. \"There is a whole-of-government effort in cyber around the election,\" a senior intelligence official said.

But if partisan trench warfare is inevitable, few people have more experience in the muck than Clinton. Related: Hillary Clinton's Victory Prize: Congressional Investigations \"There's nothing that she's going to confront that she hasn't faced before from Congress,\" said Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. \"So that should put her in a pretty good place to handle recalcitrant Republicans.\" With the avenue for action largely obstructed in Congress, Clinton has already signaled that she's prepared to cut Congress loose and redirect energies to the executive branch and the judiciary, where should would have the opportunity to change the balance of the Supreme Court. It took years for Obama to come to the conclusion that he needed to work around the GOP, while Clinton could skip that learning curve. So she's set goals in line with what she could control, like making the government look more like America, with a Cabinet that is half-female. But she would need a Democratic Senate to confirm her nominees for both. Progress where possible Clinton's legislative agenda has been kept in line with that reality. While her website lists dozens of policies \"from Alzheimer's to Zika,\" as top policy adviser Jake Sullivan likes to say, she's promised to target only three major policy goals in her first 100 days. In order of feasibility, they are: push for a jobs and infrastructure bill, introduce a comprehensive immigration reform and push for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United campaign finance court ruling, which is largely symbolic. Related: NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll: 2016 'An Election About Fear' The infrastructure package, likely paid for with some modest tax reform, is at the top of Clinton's priority list because it is widely seen in both parties as one of the few issues on which Republicans might be willing to work with a President Clinton. \"In the approach that she takes to Republicans and in the issues that she prioritizes, she's not going to do anything to fritter away an opportunity to find consensus,\" said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton. \"She intends to make the infrastructure jobs package the test of people's willingness to get something done.\" Progressives are already pushing for the package to go beyond bridges and roads and the hard-hat jobs (read: male) they create, to include more human infrastructure like health and child care jobs (read: female). \"Our traditional notions of infrastructure are very gendered,\" said Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a liberal think tank. Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employee International Union, said: \"Service and care workers all over this country expect the next president to announce the most ambitious jobs program since World War II.\" Competing priorities There's a limited window for action in any new administration and especially one in which there would be little, if any, congressional willingness and bandwidth for legislating. So Clinton would have to triage competing interests of key interest groups in the Democratic coalition. First and foremost would be Latinos, who feel frustrated by a lack of action on immigration in Congress and empowered to make demands by a surge in their turnout this year. \"We need to make sure that the fact that our community will be seen as essential in turning this election is considered and the issues that we care about will be given a heightened sense of priority,\" said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. Given the divisive nature of the immigration debate, Murguia and others are hoping to reframe the issue around immigration's economic benefits, so it could coupled with or sequenced behind an infrastructure plan as part of major economic push. Related: Trump and Clinton Sprint to Election Day Finish Line \"There needs to be real serious run at legislation \u2014 an assertive, affirmative effort to address this in Congress,\" Murguia added. \"We just need to make sure it is not seen as a side issue or a special-interest issue but as an issue that is integral to strengthening the U.S economy.\" Bipartisan cooperation on immigration reform seems doubtful after the Republican Party nominated Trump, but Democrats are hoping a Trump loss would lead the GOP on another soul-searching process that allows moderates in the party to reassert themselves, especially on this issue. \"Trump has damaged the Republican brand with Hispanic voters to the point perhaps where it's beyond repair unless there is fast action among Republicans to be seen as reasonable and constructive on issues important to that community,\" Fallon said.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 340 points, or 1.9 percent, to 18,228 as of 1:13 p.m. Eastern time. The S&P 500 index gained 42 points, or 2 percent, to 2,128 in midday trading. The Nasdaq composite jumped 116 points, or 2.3 percent, to 5,163. CBS News' Nancy Cordes looks at the possible political impact of the FBI's decision to once again clear Hillary Clinton in the private email serv... Investors have been anxious in recent weeks over signs that the U.S. presidential race was tightening. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is coming off its longest losing streak since 1980 . Monday\u2019s surge erased more than half of those losses.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Banks and health care companies rose more than the rest of the market. UnitedHealth and JPMorgan Chase led the Dow higher. Clinton got a boost late Sunday, when FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers that a review of new emails from the Democratic candidate did not change the bureau\u2019s recommendation that she should not face charges. The market fell on Oct. 28 after the FBI notified Congress that it was reviewing newly discovered emails linked to Clinton, who is seen by Wall Street as likely to maintain the status quo. Donald Trump\u2019s policies are less clear, and the uncertainty and uncomfortable closeness of the polls caused jitters in financial markets ahead of Tuesday\u2019s general election. The VIX, a measure of how much volatility investors expect to see in the market over the next 30 days, slumped 17.5 percent Monday after surging 40 percent last week to its highest level since June, when Britain voted to leave the European Union. The slide in the VIX reflected less anxiety among investors. Safe haven investments also slumped as investors felt comfortable taking on more risk. Bond prices fell, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 1.82 percent from 1.78 percent late Friday, while the price of gold fell $23.60, or 1.8 percent, to $1,281 an ounce. Utilities and phone stocks, two other havens investors seek when they expect turmoil, lagged the market. U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $44.32 a barrel in New York. The price of oil is coming off a six-day losing streak. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, was up 6 cents at $45.64 a barrel in London. The dollar strengthened across the board. It was up to 104.57 yen from 103.13 on Friday. The dollar was down 2.2 percent to 18.61 Mexican pesos from 19.03 pesos. The Mexican currency has become an indirect proxy among investors for Trump\u2019s chances to win the White House. Investors have speculated that a Trump administration would be negative for the Mexican economy, and would cause the Mexican peso\u2019s value to fall as a result. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "WATCH Earthquake Hits Oklahoma; Damage Reported 0 Shares Email Dozens of buildings sustained \"substantial damage\" after a 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck an Oklahoma town that's home to one of the world's key oil hubs, but officials said Monday that no damage has been reported at the oil terminal. Cushing City Manager Steve Spears said 40 to 50 buildings were damaged in Sunday's earthquake, which was the third in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries have been reported, and Spears said the damage included cracks to buildings and fallen bricks and facades. Oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday's quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week. Some longtime Cushing residents said Monday they've become accustomed to the unsettled ground beneath their feet. Others shrugged it off as a cost of doing business living next to an oil hub. Fearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Spears said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled Monday classes. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake's epicenter. The quake struck at 7:44 p.m. Sunday and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said Sunday's quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0. \"I thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,\" said Cushing resident Cindy Roe, 50. \"It was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground. \"It was awful and I don't want to have another one.\" In recent years, Oklahoma regulators have asked oil and gas producers to either close wastewater injection wells or cut back on the volume of fluids injected. The reductions have generally led to a drop-off in quakes and their severity, though not always. Regulators said Monday they would shut down some disposal wells near Cushing and restrict the volume that can be used in others, but said details would be released Tuesday. Oklahoma's strongest quake on record, a magnitude 5.8 temblor on Sept. 3, occurred in Pawnee, on the fringe of an area that had already restricted wastewater disposal. Shortly afterward, geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault. Oklahoma Geological Survey geophysicist Jefferson Chang said Sunday's quake and several aftershocks have been occurring on a fault line located about 2 miles west of Cushing. \"The activity has been going on for the past year and a half or so,\" Chang said. \"This is just a spike in the activity.\" Cushing's oil storage terminal is one of the world's largest. As of Oct. 28, tank farms in the countryside around Cushing held 58.5 million barrels of crude oil, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The community bills itself as the \"Pipeline Crossroads of the World.\" Cushing Assistant City Manager Jeremy Frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late Sunday but that the community hadn't heard from all companies. Gov. Mary Fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at Cushing's oil storage terminal. Some residents tried to resume normal lives Monday, treating the earthquake as more nuisance than calamity, even though the temblor could be a predictor of more to come. \"We live in Cushing,\" said resident Susie Wooten, who was taking pictures of the cracked bricks outside her dry cleaning business. \"You can't blame the oilfields; we're on a major fault line.\" For truck driver James Mutters, having oil tank farms so close to where he lives is a fact of life. \"If you live here, obviously you know about the oilfields,\" he said. \"I drive a truck, so I need to have gas. You can run all the stuff you want from the sun, but most of the stuff has to be run off something.\" According to USGS data, there have been about two dozen earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume. \"I was at home doing some work in my office and, basically, you could feel the whole house sway some,\" Spears, the Cushing city manager, said Sunday night. \"It's beginning to become normal.\" \u2014\u2014 Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City and Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Ark., contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Nov 7, 2016 1:20 PM EST SPARTANBURG, S.C. \u2014 Nearly three decades before suspected serial killer Todd Kohlhepp was arrested and accused of killing seven people and chaining up a woman in a storage containe r, a juvenile judge was concerned that there was no way to protect the public from Kohlhepp, reports CBS affiliate WSPA . In 1987, Kohlhepp was convicted in Arizona for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. He was 15 at the time of the crime. According to court records obtained by WSPA, Kohlhepp forced the girl into his home, tied her hands and put tape over her mouth before sexually assaulting her. The judge in that case noted that \u201cat the age of nine, Kohlhepp was \u2018explosive\u2019 and \u2018preoccupied with sexual content.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHe has not changed,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe has been unabatedly aggressive to others and destructive of property since nursery school.\u201d A psychiatric evaluation filed with the juvenile court said that in previous instances during his childhood, Kohlhepp had shot a dog with a BB gun, used Clorox to kill a goldfish, smashed things in his room with a hammer, destroyed other children\u2019s projects, and was dismissed from the Boy Scouts because he was too disruptive. His father said the only emotion Kohlhepp was capable of was anger, according to the report The juvenile judge worried that the justice system had no solution for a teen like Kohlhepp. Todd Kohlhepp enters the courtroom of Judge Jimmy Henson for a bond hearing at the Spartanburg Detention Facility, in Spartanburg, S.C. Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016. Close AP Photo/Richard Shiro \u201cTwenty-five months of the most intensive and expensive professional intervention, short of God\u2019s, will provide no protection for the public and no rehabilitation of this juvenile,\u201d the judge wrote. Kohlhepp served 14 years in prison for that crime and registered as a sex offender when he got out, but he resettled in South Carolina, where seemingly few knew about his past. He became a real estate agent, eventually starting his own company and employing as many as 10 other agents. He also reportedly had a pilot\u2019s license. Though authorities haven\u2019t pointed to any aspects of Kohlhepp\u2019s public persona that may have hinted he was a killer, the suspect\u2019s biography on the now shuttered website for Todd Kohlhepp and Associates included the kind of off-color jokes not found on a typical professional website. \u201cSo we went out and got professional graphic designers, web developers, specialists in marketing in a variety of fields, and gave them a job. Then we threatened not to feed them if it didn\u2019t work. Its amazing the motivation you can get after day three!\u201d\u00a0 Similarly dark statements in other web postings have been attributed to Kohlhepp. Investigators are looking into product reviews Kohlhepp may have left on Amazon.com . For a shovel with a folding handle, the user alleged to be Kohlhepp wrote, \u201ckeep in car for when you have to hide the bodies and you left the full size shovel at home.\u201d\u00a0 Kohlhepp was arrested on Thursday after investigators discovered 30-year-old Kala Brown \u201cchained up like a dog\u201d inside a metal storage container on his rural South Carolina property. Police say Brown had been there for weeks after she was lured to Kohlhepp\u2019s home for a cleaning job.\u00a0 ",

Reno, 78, died early Monday of complications from Parkinson's disease , her goddaughter Gabrielle D'Alemberte told The Associated Press. D'Alemberte said Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends. SLIDESHOW: Janet Reno, Tom Hayden and Other Notable People Who Died in 2016 Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters \"I don't do spin,\" served nearly eight years as attorney general under President Bill Clinton \u2014 the longest stint in a century. Her sister, Maggy Reno Hurchalla, told The Associated Press that Clinton called over the weekend and said to \"tell Janet I love her\" and that many others from her career visited or called, including former Florida Gov. and Sen. Bob Graham. \"When I tucked her in at night, I said, 'I love you,'\" Hurchalla said. \"She looked like she was asleep and raised one eyebrow and said, 'I love you too, very much.' She was surrounded this weekend by people who love her.\" One of the Clinton administration's most recognizable and polarizing figures, Reno faced criticism early in her tenure for the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, where sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished. She was known for deliberating slowly, publicly and in a typically blunt manner. Reno frequently told the public \"the buck stops with me,\" borrowing the mantra from President Harry S. Truman. After Waco, Reno figured into some of the controversies and scandals that marked the Clinton administration, including Whitewater, Filegate, bungling at the FBI laboratory, Monica Lewinsky, alleged Chinese nuclear spying and questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign. In the spring of 2000, Reno enraged her hometown's Cuban-American community when she authorized the armed seizure of young Elian. The boy was taken from the Little Havana home of his Miami relatives so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. During her tenure, the Justice Department prosecuted the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case, captured the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, the same year and investigated the 1993 terrorist attack on New York's World Trade Center. The department also filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., and Reno was a strong advocate for protecting abortion clinics from violence. Attorney General Loretta Lynch praised Reno's integrity and status as a trailblazer, calling Reno in a statement \"one of the most effective, decisive and well-respected leaders\" in Justice Department history. Reno, added Lynch, approached challenges \"guided by one simple test: to do what the law and the facts required. She accepted the results of that test regardless of which way the political winds were blowing.\" Miami U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer, who worked for Reno in Washington from 1995 to 2000, recalled her compassion for the nation's dispossessed, her warm relationship with employees and her practical approach to problems. \"Even if you agreed or disagreed with her, you knew she was coming from a place of integrity,\" he said in an interview. \"Through her work, through her decisions, she exhibited a lot of strength and a lot of courage. And that is also inspiring.\" After leaving Washington, Reno returned to Florida to run for governor in 2002 but lost in a Democratic primary marred by voting problems. The campaign ended a public career that started amid humble beginnings. Born July 21, 1938, Janet Wood Reno was the daughter of two newspaper reporters and the eldest of four siblings. She grew up on the edge of the Everglades in a cypress and brick homestead built by her mother and returned there after leaving Washington. Her late brother Robert Reno was a longtime columnist for Newsday on Long Island. After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in chemistry, Janet Reno became one of 16 women in Harvard Law School's class of 1963. Reno, who stood over 6 feet tall, later said she wanted to become a lawyer \"because I didn't want people to tell me what to do.\" In 1993, Clinton tapped her to become the first woman to lead the Justice Department after his first two choices \u2014 also women \u2014 were withdrawn because both had hired undocumented immigrants as nannies. Reno was 54. \"It's an extraordinary experience, and I hope I do the women of America proud,\" she said after she won confirmation. Clinton said the vote might be \"the only vote I carry 98-0 this year.\" A little more than a month after taking office, however, Reno became embroiled in controversy with the raid on the Branch Davidian compound. The standoff started before Reno was confirmed as attorney general. On Feb. 28, 1993, agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms made a surprise raid on the compound, trying to execute a search warrant. During the raid, gunfire erupted, killing four agents and six members of the religious sect. That led to a 51-day standoff, ending April 19, 1993, when the complex caught fire and burned to the ground. The government claimed the Davidians committed suicide, shooting themselves and setting the fire. Survivors said the blaze was started by tear gas rounds fired into the compound by government tanks and that agents shot at some who tried to flee. Reno authorized the use of the tear gas to end the standoff and later called the day the worst of her life. \"It was a dangerous situation,\" Reno said of the incident during a 2005 lecture at Duke University. \"The tragedy is that we will never know what was the right thing to do.\" Things got no easier after Waco. In 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson's after noticing a trembling in her left hand. She said from the beginning that the diagnosis, which she announced during a weekly news conference, would not impair her job performance. And critics \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 did not give her a pass because of it. Republicans argued she should have sought appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of Clinton fundraising violations. Democrats, meanwhile, grumbled that she failed to act like a team player. In early 2000, Reno tried to negotiate the return to Cuba of young Elian, who had been rescued after his mother and others drowned trying to boat from Cuba to Florida. He had been placed in the care of a Miami uncle, but his father, who lived in Cuba, wanted him returned to the island. When Reno decided talks had broken down that April, she ordered an early morning raid by federal agents, who seized the boy, provoking the ire of Miami's Cuban-American community. She insisted that Elian should be with his father \u2014 she even kept a snapshot of a smiling Elian in his father's arms near her home computer. Reno said later that federal officials tried up until the last minute to negotiate a voluntary handover and avoid the raid \u2014 where Elian was found hiding in a closet and confronted by an agent with a gun. \"We have been to great lengths to resolve this case in the least disruptive manner possible,\" she said at a news conference after the raid. As attorney general, Reno often was teased by late night talk show hosts for her unassuming appearance and no-nonsense attitude. Comedian Will Ferrell memorialized her in a recurring \"Saturday Night Live\" skit called \"Janet Reno's Dance Party,\" and Reno visited the skit the night she left the Justice Department in January 2001. Reno began her career in Miami in the mid-1960s and had her first encounter with the glass ceiling, getting passed over for a job at a law firm because she was a woman. She later made partner. In 1972 she lost a race for a Miami-area legislative seat but learned the importance of sticking to her principles from mentor John Orr, a former state lawmaker. \"Don't equivocate, don't pussyfoot, don't talk out of both sides of your mouth, and you'll wake up the next morning feeling good about yourself,\" he told Reno. It became one of her favorite sayings. After losing that election, she was hired by the Dade State Attorney's Office, where she established herself as an organized and competent lawyer. In 1978, when State Attorney Richard Gerstein decided to step down, Reno was named his successor. As prosecutor, she built programs to help reform drug dealers and combat domestic violence. Another program strong-armed deadbeat dads into paying child support, inspiring a rap song named after her. It included the line \"All the money you get, all the checks you make, Janet Reno will make sure and take.\" She also weathered a 1980 riot after an all-white jury acquitted five police officers for the beating death of a black insurance salesman. Eighteen people were killed in the rioting, and crowds chanted Reno's name, accusing her of being a racist and demanding her resignation. She refused. \"To resign was to give in to anarchy,\" she said. Reno eventually won the support of the city's black community, attending countless community meetings, church services and parades. Her last foray into politics was the race for Florida governor. Known for being down-to-earth \u2014 her home number was listed in a city directory before and after her time in Washington \u2014 and even folksy, she crisscrossed the state to campaign in a red Ford Ranger pickup truck. But Reno lost the primary to Tampa lawyer Bill McBride despite her name recognition. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush defeated McBride to win a second term. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who also worked for Reno at the Justice Department in the 1990s, marveled at the twists and turns in her journey. \"Hers was a great and uniquely American life and was well lived,\" he said in a statement. \"All who truly knew Janet loved her, and all in this nation were made better by her service and by her sacrifice. I will miss her.\" After retiring from politics she served on the boards or as an adviser to several organizations. In 2004 she joined the board of the New York\u2013based Innocence Project, which works to free prisoners who can be proved innocent through DNA testing. She also spent more time with her family. Reno never married and remained extremely close to her tight-knit family. Asked to describe her legacy after ending her gubernatorial campaign, she quoted George Washington, saying, \"If I were to write all that down, I might be reduced to tears. I would prefer to drift on down the stream of life and let history make the judgment.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Jessica Gresko in Washington and AP video journalist Joshua Replogle in Miami contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Lindsey Bever November 7 at 4:23 PM Follow @lindseybever JJ Holmes with his sister, Grace, and President Obama. (Family photo) Twelve-year-old JJ Holmes has been enamored with the 2016 presidential election. By Election Day, the boy would encounter\u00a0two of the most polarizing figures in this campaign season\u00a0\u2014 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and President Obama\u00a0\u2014 and his experiences with them would be vastly different. For months, JJ, who has a severe case of cerebral palsy, has been sitting\u00a0on his knees at his home in Longwood, Fla., using his nose to type searches on his iPad for \u201cMary Poppins\u201d plays and Trump events, his mother said. Throughout the election, she said, he had been itching to go to a rally \u2014 to express his disdain for Trump, who came under fire last year for mocking a reporter with a disability. \u201cI wanted to go because Donald J. Trump made fun of disabled people,\u201d JJ said in a video statement Monday to The Washington Post, using his computer vocalization device. [ Trump draws scornful rebuke for mocking reporter with disability ] On Saturday, JJ got his wish \u2014 his mother, Alison Holmes, agreed to take him to a Trump rally in Tampa. In the wee hours of Saturday morning, Holmes woke up her son, asking him whether he still wanted to go. She said she had told him what it would mean \u2014 a 3 a.m. wake-up call, a two-hour drive from their home in Longwood to Tampa, long lines and pushy protesters and, possibly, the boot. JJ\u00a0made a\u00a0pouty face \u2014 his Trump imitation \u2014 as his\u00a0signal that he was ready to roll, his mother said. She\u00a0said JJ had preprogrammed chants, such as \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cTrump mocks the disabled,\u201d into his computer vocalization device. Once he was inside the arena, he pushed a button to say his piece, his mother said. J.J. Holmes, a 12-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, met President Obama the day after he was removed from a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Here he works on his message for the president. (Alison Holmes) \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that loud,\u201d she\u00a0said about his chants, adding, \u201cTrump was laughing about how his supporters drown out JJ. So my daughters and I started chanting.\u201d She said the crowd around them turned rowdy. Trump supporters across the arena joined in \u2014 then Trump reportedly spoke out from the stage. \u201cOh, we have a Hillary Clinton person. Are they paying that person $1,500?\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said, according to Fox\u00a0News. \u201cGet him out, please. Get him out.\u201d The crowd started chanting \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d \u201cI must tell you, the Bernie Sanders protesters had much more enthusiasm and spirit than this one,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThe problem with these Hillary protesters is my people make all the noise. \u2026 You can\u2019t even hear the person.\u201d At the same time, Alison Holmes said, Trump supporters near\u00a0them started pushing her son\u2019s wheelchair, and calling her a \u201cchild abuser\u201d and telling others to \u201cgrab her p\u2014y.\u201d The boy and his family were escorted from the arena , she said. \u201cI thought we may get kicked out,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d start shoving his wheelchair.\u201d Some\u00a0people also criticized Holmes for taking her son to the rally, accusing her of using him to protest. \u201cHe\u2019s not some puppet I wheeled in there,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThis was him \u2014 this was all him.\u201d Trump\u2019s media representatives did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment. [ Obama is back in Florida amid early signs of a big Hispanic election turnout ] Outside, a reporter who covered the rally heard that the boy hoped to one day meet Obama, Holmes said; the reporter called Valentina Pereda, Florida press secretary\u00a0for the\u00a0Hillary\u00a0Clinton\u00a0campaign, who used to be the White House deputy director for Hispanic media. The idea? See how close they could get JJ to the rope line at a Democratic event Sunday\u00a0in Kissimmee, Fla., where Obama was speaking in support of Clinton.\u00a0Maybe he would shake JJ\u2019s hand on his way down the line. Pereda wrote on Facebook about the moment the reporter told her JJ\u2019s story. \u201cI freeze: first in disbelief and, next, feeling utterly helpless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat the hell could I do to make this child even slightly forget that experience? I\u2019m a nobody! \u201cI tell the reporter to share my number with JJ\u2019s mother and that the only thing I can do is escort them into President Obama\u2019s rally the following day. No chance for VIP treatment and much less to meet the President.\u201d On Sunday, Pereda said she devised a plan, with help from a friend who she said travels with the president. \u201cI point him to where in the VIP area JJ is sitting with the hope that when POTUS would work the ropeline, he\u2019d somehow remember JJ\u2019s story and spend two extra seconds with him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd with that, I was satisfied with [what] was to be accomplished. A handshake.\u201d Then it happened. \u201cShortly after, colleagues begin to frantically text and call me to tell me my friend from the WH was looking for me,\u201d Pereda wrote. \u201cI sprint about half a mile back into the stadium and push my way through angry Secret Service agents and thick crowds. I finally spot my friend who, once again, asks me to point out where the boy is sitting, which I do. Then \u2014 out of the blue \u2014 I tell him, \u2018well, how about I wheel him out of the VIP area and bring him around?\u2019 \u201d JJ Holmes with his sister Grace and President Obama. (Family photo) \u201cWow, this is really happening,\u201d Pereda wrote. \u201cAt that moment, JJ\u2019s mom tells him he\u2019s going to meet the President. The rest is indescribable. . . . JJ jumps out of his seat and erupts into cheer . . . his smile almost bursting out of his face. His body overcome by light, when just the day before it almost succumbed to hate.\u201d JJ\u2019s mother said he told the president he loved him, thanked him for the handshake and asked him, \u201cCan you vote?\u201d \u201cHe wanted to make sure he could vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d she\u00a0said. JJ said Monday that meeting Obama was the highlight of his weekend,\u00a0but when his mother asked him, \u201cAre you happy that you went to the Trump rally?\u201d he shouted: \u201cYeah! Yeah! Yeah!\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d she\u00a0said, laughing. \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cHe was over the moon,\u201d his mother\u00a0said. \u201cHe really feels that he made a stand.\u201d Read more:\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Updated Nov. 7, 2016Mon., Nov.  7 at 6:24 PM ET Jen Psaki, the White House communications director, said that Mr. Obama had always understood he was part of a continuum. \u201cHe recognizes that who he passes the baton to will have a huge impact on whether you build on the progress he made,\u201d she said. White House aides point to what they call the highlights of that progress: digging the country out of a deep economic recession, rescuing the auto industry, extending health insurance to 20 million people, pressing the world to confront climate change , reducing America\u2019s combat role in two overseas wars. But for a president who won the highest office in the land by promising big, sweeping change, Tuesday\u2019s election is a reminder that it will be up to someone else to complete the change he long envisioned. Health care may be the most important example. Passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 drastically reshaped the insurance markets in the country, improving access to medical care. But even Democrats agree that much more needs to be done to improve the cost and quality of that care. \u201cIf this was a football field, I\u2019d put us on the 30-yard line with 70 yards to go,\u201d said Mr. Daschle, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first pick for secretary of health and human services but withdrew after questions about his taxes. Mr. Daschle said the unfinished nature of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program was partly the fault of Republican obstructionism and partly the result of delays that always occur when trying to overhaul such a large social program. The Affordable Care Act gave Mr. Obama\u2019s administration great latitude to reshape the nation\u2019s health care system, and the next president will inherit that same authority. Advertisement \u201cThat latitude has worked for us,\u201d Mr. Daschle said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Trump presidency, it could work against us.\u201d The Obama Era Over the next months, The Obama Era will explore the sweeping change that President Obama brought to the nation, and how the presidency changed him. Sign up to receive an email when we publish the next stories in this series. Climate change, too, remains a work in progress. Internationally, Mr. Obama successfully pressed world leaders to aggressively confront the threats from a warming planet. At home, he demanded tougher fuel standards for cars and imposed new regulations on coal-fired power plants. But the international agreements Mr. Obama helped forge will play out over decades. It could be years before his environmental regulations are in place, if ever. It will be up to future presidents to navigate the politics of climate change, around the world and here at home. \u201cObama has set the stage for both effective domestic and global climate protection,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. \u201cBut most of the heaviest lifting is going to be done by his successor, especially regarding domestic politics.\u201d First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) 33 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Message to investors: Don't rule out a Brexit-like market shock related to the U.S. presidential election just yet. Sure, stocks surged more than 2% Monday after the FBI said\u00a0over the\u00a0weekend that\u00a0it won't press charges against Hillary Clinton regarding her email use, as investors bet\u00a0her chances of besting Donald Trump have improved. But the polls in the race for the White House are still tight, despite Clinton getting a bump after the latest FBI decision. A\u00a0Trump upset win can't be ruled out. Today's big market rally for the Standard & Poor's 500 index was its best since early March. It also snapped its\u00a0longest losing streak in 36 years and erased 72% of its losses in its nine-day skid. Seems like good news, but is it setting financial markets up for an even\u00a0bigger market fall Wednesday if\u00a0Trump wins, similar to the U.S. stock market's 5.6% two-day plunge after the United Kingdom's vote June 23 to exit the single-market European Union? Dow surges 300 points as FBI clears Clinton on eve of election It's possible, some Wall Street experts say, noting that the too-close-to-call U.S. election has many of the same traits as the Brexit vote, namely polls that may not be totally trustworthy, a populist movement and angry electorate, and investors that are betting mainly on their base case: in this case, a Clinton win and a split Congress. (Clinton is favored by Wall Street as she is viewed as more status quo, in contrast to Trump who is feared by investors due to his unpredictability and his negative views on free trade.) \"Most analysts seem to agree with the markets that a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race is good news for the dollar, stocks and risk assets,\" Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at\u00a0Forex.com, told USA TODAY. \"This is a very risky assumption to make. An even riskier assumption to make here is to convince ourselves of a Clinton victory now that she\u2019s in the clear with regards to her email issues. The polls are still very tight, and a lot of people will have made up their minds already, regardless of the FBI probe. So a win for Donald Trump is still a big risk, which may be underpriced (in markets). The key point: Don\u2019t assume anything; be prepared, flexible and nimble in the coming days.\" Election Day deals, freebies and dining experiences According to RealClearPolitics, Clinton leads Trump by 2.6\u00a0percentage points, based on an average of about a dozen different presidential polls focusing on a four-way race that includes independent candidates. History still says Clinton is at risk, as the incumbent party candidate normally loses the election when stocks are down in the three months heading into Election Day. The S&P 500 stock index is down 2.6% since Aug. 8. Monday's rally could easily be unwound Wednesday if Trump wins. Keep in mind, during the first trading after the Brexit vote, the S&P 500 plunged 3.6%. And the second day after the vote, it fell another 1.8%. With the FBI removing the email cloud from Clinton, \"financial markets will probably double down on Hillary winning,\" says Luke Hickmore, senior fixed income manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. And that's risky. \u201cNo one should conclude that this campaign is over or that Hillary is going to win,\" Hickmore said. \"Financial markets are edging towards Clinton largely because of polling, and we saw in the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum how wrong that can be. The memory of that referendum should loom large in investors\u2019 memories because so much of the polling was wrong then.\" 33 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fw7V5T ",

By Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake November 7 at 11:11 AM Follow @thefix Follow @aaronblake The presidential election ends \u2014 we hope!\u00a0\u2014 Tuesday. Below we offer our last ratings of the race, our look at the truly competitive states on the eve of this most unpredictable of elections. While we are moving two states in Donald Trump\u2019s direction on this second-to-last day of the campaign, the overall map still clearly favors Hillary Clinton: She has 275 electoral votes solidly or leaning her way \u2014 five more than she needs to win the White House on Tuesday night. In fact, even if Trump holds all of the states either solidly or leaning his way and wins all three states currently rated as \u201ctoss-ups,\u201d he is still seven electoral votes short of 270. [ Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win ] Our big change on the eve of the election is to move North Carolina from \u201clean Democratic\u201d back to \u201ctoss-up.\u201d From mid-September to mid-October, Clinton led in 19 of the 20 polls conducted in the state. But, of the nine most recent polls, four show Clinton ahead, three show Trump in the lead and two project a tie. Trump has a 1.4 percent edge in the RealClearPolitics polling average . And, unlike the early voting in Florida and Nevada that appears to have favored Clinton, North Carolina\u2019s early vote has been much more of a mixed bag . While more than 3 million votes have been cast early, black turnout is down from where it was in 2012, while white turnout has surged more than 300,000 as compared with the last election. That should be good news for Trump. The other change in our final map is Utah moves back to \u201clean Republican\u201d from \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Trump is drastically underperforming in the Beehive State and the presence of Brigham Young University grad (and Mormon) Evan McMullin on the ballot is a major problem. But the last five polls in the state have shown Trump with leads ranging from five points to 11 points and his average lead, according to RCP , is in the low double digits. Utah was always going to be a tough state for Clinton given the conservative nature of its electorate. And Trump appears to have done just enough to hold it. Toss-up (48 electoral votes) ",

(Photo: Katie Klann, Naples Daily News-USA TODAY Spor) 38 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 Call it the Trump Effect. Every four years, spending in presidential races soars to new heights. Until now. A new estimate from the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics predicts the final price tag of the 2016 White House campaign will hit about $2.65 billion, a dip from the $2.76 billion that flowed into the 2012 contest, when adjusted for inflation. Broadcast TV advertising to shape the 2016 White House contest has\u00a0tumbled\u00a0from four years ago, a byproduct of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s decision to rely more on free media coverage, digital outreach and his own prolific tweeting than traditional advertising to promote his candidacy. Between June 8 and Oct. 30, for instance, Trump had aired more than 68,000 ads to boost his White House ambitions, a striking drop from the roughly 182,000 ads that 2012 Republican presidential Mitt Romney aired on broadcast TV, national networks and national cable during the same period in that election, an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project shows. \u201cIt\u2019s just apples and oranges to compare Trump to any other major-party nominee,\u201d said Shelia Krumholz, who runs the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else who could take this playbook and make it work.\u201d Trump conducts election eve campaign marathon Trump\u2019s approach already has taken a toll. \u00a0Sinclair Broadcast Group, which controls 173 TV stations and has a big footprint in the battleground state of Ohio, earlier this year lowered\u00a0revenue forecasts for the third quarter. Officials cited\u00a0the presidential election\u2019s \u201cunique nature\u201d as one reason for the\u00a0move. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The 2016 election could have been a banner\u00a0year for political advertising, with\u00a0a wide-open White House race in which neither a sitting president nor vice president was running for the job. The lower presidential spending \u201chas depressed revenues and, therefore, depressed profits in what\u2019s normally one of the better years in a four-year cycle for local TV companies, especially,\u201d said Jan Dawson, who analyzes consumer technology and media at Jackdaw Research. Instead of surging to new highs, overall political spending on broadcast TV is likely to be flat, said Steve Lanzano, president and CEO of The Television Bureau of Advertising, the trade group for local TV broadcasters. \"It's not like the dollars went away,\" he said. Instead, money flowed into ballot initiatives and\u00a0down-ticket races for the House and Senate, where Republicans are scrambling to retain their majorities. \"It's a year that's an anomaly,\" Lanzano said, insisting \"it's not a referendum\" on television advertising or its effectiveness.

Diver Sean Smyrichinsky tells the Vancouver Sun that he was searching for sea cucumbers recently when he spotted a bizarre object underwater that resembled a giant metal bagel cut in half, with bolts \"molded into it.\" He says he told his buddies he might have spotted a UFO\u2014and when he told some fishermen about the sighting a few days later, \"some old-timer said \u2018Oh, you might have found that bomb.'\" The bomb the \"old-timer\" was referring to was the Mark IV bomb missing since the Feb. 13, 1950, crash in the area of the US bomber, which had left a base in Alaska on a Texas-bound mission that included a simulated nuclear bombing of San Francisco, the Guardian reports.The bomb was packed with TNT and weighed almost 11,000 pounds, though records indicate that its core was packed with lead, not plutonium, so there isn't risk of a nuclear accident.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 7, 2016 2:34 PM EST In such a tumultuous election year , it\u2019s hard to know what to expect on November 8th. There are, however, a few tried and true predictors of U.S. presidential elections that have weighed in yet again. Sure, one\u2019s a monkey and another\u2019s based on the sales of Halloween masks. But combined, they have an estimated 112 years of successful predictions to their names. And currently, these five offbeat predictors are skewing 3-2 in favor of Donald Trump. 1. Benjamin Franklin Elementary School Close Benjamin Franklin Elementary School For the past 48 years, students at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School \u00a0in Yorktown Heights, New York, have been casting their \u201cvotes\u201d to determine the winner of the U.S. presidential election. They spend months learning about the candidates. They debate the facts. Then, in small groups of around five students, every class from kindergarten through fifth grade heads into the mock polling booth.\u00a0 And for the past 48 years, the school has never been wrong. \u201cWe have minority groups, students that speak English as a second language, white collar, blue collar,\u201d Benjamin Franklin Elementary School principal Patricia Moore told CBS News. \u201cIt could be representative of the nation.\u201d Clearly, it is. For nearly half a century, the little melting pot has correctly predicted the outcome of the election based on the popular vote. And this year, after all the votes were tallied, Hillary Clinton won with 52 percent (277 votes) compared to Republican rival Donald Trump with 43 percent (230 votes). Now, the students just have to wait and see if they\u2019re right... again. 2. The Mask Index Masks of presidential candidates (L-R) Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders  hang in a Halloween store in Miami, Florida, on October 27, 2016.\u00a0 Close Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images Every four years, the retail chain Spirit Halloween puts out a survey of which\u00a0 presidential candidate\u2019s mask \u00a0people plan to dress up in for Halloween. And for the past two decades, this poll has correctly predicted every presidential election winner. This year, the \u201cmask index\u201d has Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton, 55 to 45 percent. 3. The Monkey info A monkey holds a fan with Chinese characters that read \u201celected\u201d as it sits between cardboard cutouts of U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton before making a selection intended to predict the result of the election, at a park in Changsha, in China\u2019s Hunan province, on November 3, 2016.\u00a0 Close STR/AFP/Getty Images A mystic monkey in Changsha, China also got in on the action this year. Shiyanhu Ecological Tourism Park in China\u2019s Hunan province regularly utilizes the animal, named Geda, to predict the results of European soccer matches. In fact, this year, Geda correctly predicted that Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Portugal would win the European football championship, which they did... in overtime.\u00a0 So, fresh off his sports success, Geda\u2019s handlers figured, why not try the monkey\u2019s luck at politics as well? The 5-year-old monkey, whose name means \u201cgoose bumps,\u201d is believed to have the gift of prophecy, after all.\u00a0 Consequently, last Thursday, Geda stood on a red table between two life-size cardboard cutouts of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, as eager reporters looked on. He wore a yellow t-shirt which read \u201cking of prophets\u201d in Chinese. And after a thoughtful process of sampling bananas next to each cutout, the clairvoyant monkey chose Donald Trump as the clear winner. The animal even thrilled nearby cameramen by planting a celebratory kiss on the Republican candidate\u2019s face. 4. The American University Professor American University professor Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the results of every presidential election since 1984. Interestingly, though, his method does not rely on polls, demographics or an analysis of swing states. Rather, Lichtman has developed 13 keys to predicting the election based on the performance of the party currently in the White House. This professor has a formula to predict the 2016 election \u201cThere\u2019s a real theory behind this. And the theory is presidential elections don\u2019t work the way we think they do,\u201d Lichtman told CBSN anchor Josh Elliott in June. \u201cThey\u2019re not decided by the turns of the campaigns, the speeches, the debates, the fundraising. Rather, presidential elections are fundamentally referenda on the performance of the party holding the White House. If that performance is good enough, they get four more years. If it\u2019s not, they\u2019re turned out and the challenging part wins.\u201d Lichtman says his 13 keys to predicting the results of the presidential election are simply ways of \u201cmathematically and specifically\u201d measuring that performance. They are: (1) incumbent-party mandate, (2) incumbency, (3) third party, (4) short-term economy, (5) long-term economy, (6) nomination contest, (7) policy change, (8) scandal, (9) social unrest, (10) foreign or military success, (11) foreign or military failure, (12) incumbent charisma, and (13) challenge charisma.\u00a0 The history professor says he came across this method \u201ctotally by accident in 1981,\u201d when he met a Russian geophysicist who wanted to collaborate using the methods of earthquake prediction to predict elections. Lichtman insists that\u2019s not nearly as far-fetched as it sounds because both prediction formulas gauge stability vs. upheaval. As for the results of this election, Lichtman says 2016 has been the hardest race he\u2019s ever attempted to predict. When the author of \u201cThe Keys to the White House\u201d appeared on CBSN in June, he had yet to make his call. However, since then, he has doubled down on a Trump win on November 8th. 5. The Cup Challenge Close themonogramshops.com Every election season since 2004, The Monogram Shop in East Hampton, New York has correctly predicted the winner of the U.S. presidential election based on its sales of reusable plastic cups. The cups \u2014 which are emblazoned with the names and logos of the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets \u2014 are sold for $3 a piece, and a tally of the cup sales is then kept updated in the store\u2019s window. It is wet and raw here in East Hampton but her for you all is the current Monogram Shop cup count!! Posted by Sherae Barham on\u00a0 Friday, September 30, 2016 The Monogram Shop\u2019s presidential cup sales begin just after Super Tuesday. And for the past three elections, the candidate that has sold more cups has gone on to win the election. So, local residents are anxiously keeping an eye on this year\u2019s tally. As of this weekend, Hillary Clinton has a strong lead over her Republican opponent, with 4,946 cups to Trump\u2019s 3,388. It\u2019s important to note, however, that the sampling of the electorate this contest measures is far from representative of the entire U.S. population. Residents and visitors in East Hampton are overwhelmingly white and very wealthy, with many houses in the town serving as vacation homes for the New York City set. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

With polls showing him trailing, Trump is frantically trying to pave the way for an upset win with stops in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Michigan. \"This is the last day of our campaign. Who would have believed this? Who would have believed it? It's been some campaign too,\" Trump said during a morning rally in Sarasota, Florida. Clinton will hit both of Pennsylvania's largest cities \u2014 Pittsburgh and Philadelphia \u2014 along with stops in Michigan and a midnight get out the vote rally at North Carolina State University with Lady Gaga. Her running mate, Tim Kaine, will barnstorm North Carolina and Virginia. \"Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger in our country. But I've gotta say, anger is not a plan, my friends,\" Clinton said during her rally in Pittsburgh.

Trump has continued to focus much of his message on his opponent and her email controversy. \"Look at what she's done with the emails, as an example. I mean, did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course, the FBI, the director, was obviously under tremendous pressure,\" Trump said during his North Carolina rally. The final NBC News battleground map shows the Democratic nominee with a comfortable lead over Trump, netting 274 electoral votes. Trump garners 170 with 94 votes in the toss up column. And the former secretary of state got more good news on Sunday, when FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to lawmakers saying a review of newly discovered emails had not changed the FBI's previous conclusion that Clinton is not guilty of criminal wrongdoing. But the closing days of the campaign have been filled with surprises in how both candidates have spent their time and resources. The final national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of the 2016 presidential race shows a tightening race with Clinton hanging on to a four-point lead. She had an 11-point edge in the poll last month following the release of a 2005 tape where Trump talks about groping women. Clinton's Allendale, Michigan event Monday will mark the second time in recent days she has visited the Great Lakes State that was once thought to be solidly in her corner. But polling in the state has shown Clinton's lead shrinking. Trump also continues to push in Michigan with a joint rally with Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence in Grand Rapids. On Sunday, he made a surprising stop in Minnesota, where polling shows Clinton with a sizable lead. Play ",

By comparison, a\u00a0Times review of campaign finance reports and daily campaign disclosures found total contributions to the 17 ballot measure campaigns are roughly twice what Republican candidate Donald Trump has reported raising\u00a0for his presidential campaign. The Times review includes cash donations to campaigns, as well as non-monetary donations like staff time\u00a0and even loans that are expected to be repaid. The total is on pace to break the previous record from 2008, when ballot measures generated\u00a0$471 million in contributions, according to\u00a0data since 2003 compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. Ballot measure campaigns: $1\u00a0million a day On average, more than $1.5\u00a0million has been raised every day this year to influence the outcome of propositions on the November ballot. In the last few weeks, the rate of donations has\u00a0increased dramatically. On Oct. 19, ballot measure committees reported a one-day total of more than\u00a0$24\u00a0million in donations. More than a third of the money has come from tobacco and pharmaceutical companies The two most expensive measures are the ones potentially most damaging to the profits of the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries. Pharmaceutical companies have been the force behind the campaign to defeat Proposition 61, an initiative to influence prescription drug costs . At more than $109\u00a0million, it's one of\u00a0the most expensive ballot measure campaigns in California history, according to data from the\u00a0National Institute on Money in State Politics. Proposition 61 would\u00a0limit state government spending on prescription drugs to\u00a0the prices paid by\u00a0the\u00a0 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs .\u00a0Because the VA typically negotiates the lowest prices for prescription drugs of any public or private entity, the measure\u2019s supporters say they hope to curb rising drug costs paid by the state. Drug companies and trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have provided almost all the funding. Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson are the top three contributors to defeating Proposition 61. Tobacco companies have mounted the second largest campaign cash effort this season in their bid to defeat Proposition 56, which would impose a $2-per-pack tax on cigarettes . Tobacco giant Philip Morris alone has\u00a0spent more than $44 million to oppose the measure. Sign up for our Essential Politics newsletter \u00bb Hospitals and teachers have poured in a lot of money, and so have several\u00a0wealthy Californians The California Hospital Assn. and the California Teachers\u00a0Assn. have both contributed millions to support an income tax proposal to finance schools, healthcare and other government programs. The groups have each donated more than $20 million to support Proposition 55, which would extend current income tax rates on wealthy Californians \u00a0that are set to expire in 2018. The hospitals group\u00a0has donated another $10\u00a0million to Proposition 56, the tobacco tax increase , and\u00a0has also partnered with healthcare organizations to fund the majority of the nearly $60-million campaign to support Proposition 52. If passed, that proposal\u00a0would make permanent a program to help fund Medi-Cal , the state\u2019s subsidized healthcare program for low-income residents. Several wealthy donors\u00a0are also spending millions to influence November ballot measures. Tom\u00a0Steyer, a former hedge fund manager and potential 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has donated more than $11 million to ballot measure campaigns this cycle. Most of his money has gone to Proposition 56, but he\u2019s also contributed to Proposition 55, death penalty repeal measure\u00a0 Proposition 62 , prison parole initiative\u00a0 Proposition 57 \u00a0and bilingual education measure\u00a0 Proposition 58 . Palo Alto physicist Charles Munger\u00a0Jr. has donated more than $10 million to Proposition 54, a measure requiring legislative bills at the state Capitol to be in print for three days before lawmakers can give final approval. Former Facebook president Sean Parker has contributed more than $8 million to support Proposition 64 , the campaign to legalize marijuana. Gov. Jerry Brown has made a last-minute push for his parole proposition and against another\u00a0to impose\u00a0new rules on state borrowing In the final weeks before the election, the governor has devoted time and resources to two measures in particular: Proposition 53 and Proposition 57. Last month, Brown used his 2014 gubernatorial campaign account to\u00a0donate more than $4 million to defeat Proposition 53, which would require voter approval \u00a0before the sale of revenue bonds of $2 billion or more, the kind of bonds used to fund large infrastructure projects.\u00a0Brown also appears in a new\u00a0 television ad \u00a0opposing the measure.

NBC's final battleground map: Clinton 274, Trump 170 In our final battleground map of the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton holds a substantial lead over Donald Trump with one day before Election Day. Clinton has 274 electoral votes in her column -- which is unchanged from last week, and which also is more than the 270 needed to win the presidency. Trump, meanwhile, is at 170 electoral votes, down from 180 last week. And we have 94 electoral votes in the Tossup column. We made only two changes to the map: We moved Utah from Tossup to Lean GOP, and we moved Georgia from Lean GOP to Tossup. That's it. Play Election may hinge on Rust Belt; Trump focusing on rural, white areas, analyst says 1:32 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161108010448if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/802659395899\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The more things change, the more they stay the same The final national NBC/WSJ poll we released yesterday morning told two stories. The first: It showed a tighter horserace. Clinton's lead over Trump is four points in the two-way contest, 44%-40%, and five points in the head-to-head matchup, 48%-43% -- which is down from 11 points and 10 points, respectively, in last month's NBC/WSJ poll released after the \"Access Hollywood\" video. But here's the second story: The numbers inside the poll are incredibly stable and consistent with what we've seen all year: The two demographics to watch tomorrow night: Latinos and college-educated whites. And if you want to see even more stability, here are the final numbers from our weekly online NBC|SurveyMonkey tracking poll : Clinton 47%, Trump 41%, Johnson 6%, Stein 3% -- which is unchanged from last week. Another Comey bombshell: FBI clears Clinton But while the race -- structurally -- has been incredibly stable, the storylines have been anything but. And yesterday we received yet another bombshell from FBI Director James Comey. NBC News : \"FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the bureau won't change the conclusion it made in July after it examined newly revealed emails related to the Hillary Clinton probe. 'Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,' Comey wrote in a letter to 16 members of Congress.\" More: \"A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on [Anthony] Weiner's laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton's server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server.\" Play Donald Trump blasts FBI decision on Clinton emails as part of 'rigged' system 2:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161108010448if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/802653763899\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump on FBI outcome: \"It's a totally rigged system\" It's difficult to quantify the impact that Comey's initial letter, on Oct. 28, had on the Clinton-vs-Trump race, but it 1) certainly dominated the news environment for close to a week, 2) allowed Trump and Republicans to go on offense, and 3) forced Clinton and Democrats to play defense. But now Trump is saying that the FBI's determination was part of a \"rigged\" result. \"Right now, [Clinton] is being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system,\" Trump said on the campaign trail yesterday. \"I've been saying it for a long time. You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days, you can't do it, folks.\" Two quick points here: One, there weren't 650,000 Clinton-related emails; that was the number of total Weiner/Abedin emails on the computer. Two, computers certainly help to sort/verify information very quickly. Clinton to release new two-minute TV ad speaking to camera NBC's Andrea Mitchell report that the Clinton campaign will release a two-minute TV ad of Clinton speaking to the camera, per a campaign official. The theme will be bringing the country together and reaching out to all voters including Trump supporters. NBC/WSJ poll on the downballot situation Dems hold a three-point lead on the congressional generic ballot: Yesterday's national NBC/WSJ poll also found that Democrats were holding a three-point lead on which party likely voters preferred to Congress, 47%-44%, which is unchanged from mid-October. The poll also showed that voters, by a 51%-40%, prefer a Republican candidate who would serve to check and balance a President Clinton instead of a Democratic candidate to support her agenda. First Read's downballot race of the day: FL-7 Republican John Mica has been in Congress for 24 years, but recent redistricting is putting his long-held Orlando-area seat in peril. Stephanie Murphy, Vietnamese-American 38-year-old suburban mom and former Defense Department analyst, decided late in the cycle to challenge Mica after the Pulse nightclub shooting.

    "text": "GOP Sen. Perdue Says Senate Must Act on High Court Vacancy By erica werner, ap congressional correspondent WASHINGTON \u0097 Nov 7, 2016, 12:49 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Merrick Garland: In a Minute 0 Shares Email Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said Monday it would be a \"dereliction of duty\" for the Senate to fail to act on Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominees if she becomes president. A few Republican senators and GOP activist groups have suggested that if Clinton wins the White House, Republicans should try to keep the existing vacancy on the Supreme Court unfilled throughout her tenure. \"I hear what's being said about that, but I think that's a dereliction of duty,\" Perdue said, pointing to the Senate's constitutional role on judicial nominations. \"We're called to advise and consent. Now, we can say no, but that means that you do have a hearing.\" \"So I'm going to be one that says 'Look, our oath of office says that we're going to govern, and that's what we should do,'\" he said. He spoke with reporters Monday after presiding over a brief pro forma Senate session held one day before the election. Perdue struck an optimistic note, saying Republican Donald Trump will be elected and the GOP will retain its majority in the Senate. But he said that if Clinton becomes president, Republicans will work with her. \"Both parties need to find a way to compromise and get the country moving again,\" Perdue said, \"so whoever's in the White House , we're going to give them a fair shake here in terms of trying to move forward, and that means the budget. That means the appropriations process.\" Several GOP senators in recent weeks, including Richard Burr of North Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas, have suggested that Republicans should take an unyielding stance toward any Clinton nominee, even though there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court for the better part of a year, since the death of Antonin Scalia. The GOP-led Senate has refused to take any action on Merrick Garland , President Barack Obama's nominee. The Senate could confirm Garland during a post-election lame-duck session, but Perdue said doing so would be \"improper.\" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also ruled out a lame-duck confirmation. 0 Shares ",

The Sunday before the 2016 presidential election saw NBA superstar LeBron James campaign with Clinton in Cleveland. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Straining toward the finish line of the wildly unpredictable White House race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump blitzed through battleground states Monday in a final bid to energize supporters. Clinton urged voters to embrace a \"hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America,\" while Trump called for support to \"beat the corrupt system.\" The candidates planned to campaign late into the night, a frenzied end to a bitter election year that has laid bare the nation's deep economic and cultural divides. Clinton opened the day Monday buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. The inquiry had sapped a surging Clinton momentum at a crucial moment in the race, though she still heads into Election Day with multiple paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the nation's first female president. \"I think I have some work to do to bring the country together,\" she acknowledged as she boarded her plane for her last battleground tour. \"I really do want to be the president for everybody.\" As Clinton took the stage in Pittsburgh, supporters yelled out, \"We love you\" \u2014 an unusual occurrence for the Democratic presidential candidate who has sometimes struggled to connect with voters. \"I love you all, too. Absolutely,\" Clinton said with a slight chuckle. Trump was aggressive to the end, repeatedly slamming Clinton at his first event of the day in Sarasota, Florida. Having made the new FBI review a centerpiece of his closing case to voters, he argued that Clinton was being protected by a \"totally rigged system.\" \"You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice,\" Trump said. \"Do not let this opportunity slip away.\" Images of the presidential campaign's final days as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump make their final push. The comments were a reminder that Comey's news, delivered in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, was a doubled-edged sword for Clinton. While it vindicated her claims that the emails would not yield new evidence, it ensured that a controversy that has dogged her campaign from the start would follow her through Election Day. Across the country, nearly 24 million early ballots were cast under the shadow of Comey's initial announcement of a new email review. That number represents more than half of the roughly 42.5 million people who had cast votes by Monday afternoon, according to Associated Press data. The inquiry involved material found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide. Comey said Sunday the FBI reviewed communications \"to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state.\" Clinton tried to fly above the controversy Monday and was not expected to address the matter during stops in Michigan and North Carolina. She was also headlining an evening rally in Philadelphia with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, along with rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. Full coverage: 2016 election Open link Nearing the end of his two terms in the White House, Obama was nostalgic as he launched his own busy day of events, noting that he was probably making his last campaign swing for the foreseeable future. \"Whatever credibility I have earned after eight years as president, I am asking you to trust me on this. I am voting for Hillary Clinton,\" Obama said. Clinton is banking in part on high turnout \u2014 particularly among Obama's young, diverse coalition of voters \u2014 to carry her over the finish line Tuesday. Roughly half the states with advance voting have reported record turnout, including Florida and Nevada, which have booming Hispanic populations, a possible good sign for Clinton. In Florida alone, Hispanic participation is up by more than 453,000 votes, nearly doubling the 2012 level. Black turnout is up compared to 2012, but that share of the total vote is lower due to bigger jumps among Latinos and whites, according to University of Florida professor Daniel Smith In Nevada, where more than three-fourths of expected ballots have been cast, Democrats also lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie downplayed the impact of increased Hispanic participation, telling reporters on a conference call, \"We feel that we're going to get a good share of those votes.\" However, he sidestepped two questions about the level of Hispanic vote Trump needs to win the presidency. Without victories in Florida and Nevada, Trump's path to 270 electoral votes would be exceedingly narrow. He already must win nearly all of the roughly dozen battleground states. Trump planned to campaign at a breakneck pace through Election Day. Following the rally in Florida, he headed to North Carolina and then was off to Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. After voting in New York Tuesday morning, After that, Trump was to return to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire. Midway through his travels Monday, Trump praised his supporters for having created a \"movement.\" But he warned it would all slip away if he loses Tuesday. \"Go vote,\" he urged. \"Or honestly, we've all wasted our time.\"\u00a0 Associated Press ",

In this Oct. 5, 2015 file photo, the Supreme Court is seen in Washington. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The U.S. Supreme Court turned down a request Monday from Ohio Democrats to issue an order aimed at preventing Donald Trump 's supporters from harassing or intimidating voters on Election Day. The high court released a one-page denial, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noting that Ohio law already forbids voter intimidation. The case was part of a flurry of courtroom efforts by the Democrats in crucial battlegrounds around the country to head off what they say is vigilantism by Trump's presidential campaign and his friend Roger Stone's political organization, Stop the Steal. Lower-level courts on Monday were weighing arguments in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada. The Republican nominee has called on his supporters to act as election observers in certain parts of the country to help prevent fraud. That has stirred fears of minority voters being confronted and challenged by self-appointed poll watchers. Last week, a federal judge in Cleveland issued a temporary restraining order warning that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who engages in intimidation or harassment near or inside polling places will face contempt of court charges. But a federal appeals court blocked the order on Sunday after the Trump campaign argued that it tramples on the First Amendment right to free speech and was issued without evidence of voter intimidation even though early balloting has been going on in Ohio for weeks. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate the restraining order. Ginsburg criticized Trump over the summer before apologizing for her remarks. Her comments raised questions about her impartiality and whether she would participate in election disputes involving Trump. ",

Compare your picks with ours. (Los Angeles Times) We've updated our electoral map for the final time in this topsy-turvy campaign year.\u00a0 For this version, our goal was no toss-ups. We're giving you our best estimates, based on public polling, state vote histories and the reporting done by our campaign staff, on which way we think each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia will fall this year.\u00a0 The previous version of the map had five toss-up states. In the end, we're predicting that three of them -- North Carolina, Ohio and Arizona -- will go for Hillary Clinton. Iowa will go to Donald Trump , we expect. So will Utah, where independent\u00a0candidate Evan McMullin\u00a0has been threatening Trump, but seems likely to come up short.\u00a0 Our projection would give Clinton 352 electoral votes, while Trump would end up with 186. That would put Clinton's electoral majority midway between President Obama's 2008 win and his 2012 reelection. Of these last picks, Ohio and Arizona were the hardest. Polls have been close in both states. Ohio does currently seem like a jump ball, but we lean toward Clinton winning there\u00a0because of the strength of her get-out-the-vote operation. In Arizona, we're expecting that the surge in Latino votes that has been visible next door in Nevada will put Clinton over the top. Polls that show Trump winning may be underestimating the size of the Latino turnout. That's what we think, anyway. But the map allows you to test out your own hunches. Have at it. Latest updates ",

His border wall would be \"the most difficult to accomplish\" on his immigration wish list, former Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Doris Meissner said. He would need Congress to approve funding for it in the budget and would face legal obstacles in order to build on vast stretches that pass through private, state, and tribal lands. Democrats in Congress would oppose construction of the wall out of hand, especially if it's not attached to immigration reform measures including a path to citizenship for existing undocumented immigrants. Republicans would be divided as well, making passage unlikely. Mexico's leadership has also made clear they won't pay for the wall as Trump as promised, and his promise to compel them to do so by cutting off transfer payments by private citizens between Mexico and America may not be legally or politically possible. Finally, Trump would face the task of nominating a new Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, who died last year. He already has put out a growing list of possible names, all of whom are broadly in line with conservative wish lists. A bumpy foreign policy ride Trump would almost certainly face a global crisis even before he took office, as allies abroad are alarmed by his \"America First\" rhetoric and stated disregard for the international institutions the United States has led since World War II. In particular, Trump's threats to abandon NATO countries and military allies like South Korea and Japan if they fail to shoulder more of the cost of American protection have caused a firestorm. He would also have to chart a course with allies in the Muslim world like Saudi Arabia, who he has criticized regularly, after promising to ban all Muslims from America. \"He's taken a stand that is farther than what anyone in the security community has previously advocated,\" Jacob Shapiro, a professor of international affairs at Princeton, said. Dozens of foreign leaders, breaking from more typical diplomatic tones towards potential US presidents, have publicly warned Trump would damage relations with their countries and have criticized him in unusually personal terms. A poll by Pew of residents in a variety of European and Asian allies in June found broad opposition to Trump , with majorities and pluralities across the board saying they had \"no confidence\" in his ability to lead. Trump listens to a speaker during a meeting with Cuban supporters at Trump National Doral, on Oct. 25 in Miami. Evan Vucci / AP Presidents have extremely broad authority on foreign policy and Trump has some big ideas, making this the area early in his presidency to watch most. Does he reach out to reassure foreign leaders that some of his campaign lines were for show? Or does he actively start calling into question international agreements, from military alliances to trade deals to the Geneva Convention , which he has said should be altered to allow torture and other war crimes? \"Many of these questions would be shaped by the foreign policy team around him, about which we know nothing,\" Galston said. \"Virtually the entire Republican foreign policy establishment has jumped ship.\" In another flashpoint, Trump has called climate science a hoax and said he'd pull out of the Paris climate agreement, a massive global priority already backed by over 190 countries. He'd also look to undo energy regulations that would keep the US on track to meet the deal's emissions targets that scientists warn are the bare minimum to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change. Among other problems, this would also create instant tension with China which agreed to a major deal with the U.S. on climate emissions ahead of Paris. When it comes to the war against ISIS, Trump would face immediate questions about how to handle Syria, where he would have an opportunity to put his call for warmer relations with Russia to the test. It would also be a battleground within the party and likely his own administration. Trump has said repeatedly he'll look for cooperation with Russia, including on a joint military campaign against ISIS, and not pursue avenues to remove Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. His running mate Pence, however, said in a nationally televised debate with Tim Kaine that he would threaten Assad with military force over his use of indiscriminate bombing and opposes Russian involvement. Trump later said Pence was wrong. Pence has also threatened consequences against Russia if they're found to be involved in election related hacks, which Trump has denied is the case despite a consensus assessment by U.S. intelligence officials. Trade wars Then there's Trump's top agenda item: Trade. Trump would likely follow through on his campaign promise to reopen talks on NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, which he has threatened to leave if they go poorly. He's also floated withdrawing from the World Trade Organization , which could set off an international trade war and financial panic, although he has put less emphasis on the idea. \"From what I've noticed, he's moved away from saying he will automatically take the US out of these agreements to saying that he will demand renegotiation,\" Robert Howse, a professor of international law at New York University, said.

Running mate Mike Pence is heavily involved and is expected to have a major role in a Trump administration, similar to more active vice presidents like Joe Biden and Al Gore. One telling name under consideration could point to how Trump, who has sounded torn between co-opting the existing GOP and smashing it to bits, might govern as president. Reince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is under consideration as Trump's chief of staff. Priebus earned Trump's trust over the course of the campaign by steadfastly defending him while other top Republicans denounced Trump or shied away from brand. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus campaigns for Donald Trump during a rally at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire on Nov. 1. Matt Rourke / AP \"They're thinking, 'We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'\" the senior campaign adviser said. But the adviser added it was unclear if Priebus was interested in the job, or if he would be the best fit managing Trump's populist movement in the final calculus. Related: Clinton Maintains Edge Over Trump in Election Eve Poll If Priebus leaves the RNC, two close Trump allies could be considered to take his position. Trump's team is talking about former campaign manager and current CNN contributor Corey Lewandowski or current deputy campaign manager David Bossie as possible options. While Priebus is an olive branch to the establishment, Lewandowski, who had a tumultuous relationship with the RNC while campaign manager, would send a message that Trump won't forget his base. \"Washington still doesn't get it,\" another senior aide said. \"You have to understand the party will never be the same.\" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as he speaks with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn during a town hall in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on Sept. 6. Evan Vucci / AP Many top figures who worked under previous Republican presidents are still opposed to Trump's candidacy, limiting the pool of possible names available. But one veteran of the George W. Bush White House who met with members of Trump's transition team for several hours said he came away convinced they were interested in seasoned players from prior administrations. \"They're reaching out to people with experience, they're listening to them, they're taking their counsel,\" the former official said. \"I was very impressed.\" Within Trump's campaign, some of the biggest player may move on. Campaign CEO Steve Bannon has already said he'll return to Breitbart, where his outlet would undoubtedly be a prime mover of Trump's message as president. Sources say Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, might also decline an administration job after a grueling general election Asked for comment on the above names floated for cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied by e-mail that \"none of this is accurate.\" She added Trump had not been too closely involved in the transition effort because he \"is entirely focused on the campaign and the American people.\" Play ",

The celebrity push is \"important in generating some excitement about Clinton despite some of the concerns and disapproval ratings that have been a constant part of her candidacy,\" said Julian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University. \"In terms of her appeal to younger voters, this is extremely important given some of the reservations that exist\". It is almost impossible to quantify whether or not celebrity endorsements translate into actual votes, although they certainly grab media attention. In both of his White House runs President Barack Obama enjoyed broad celebrity backing from stars ranging from Shakira to George Clooney. His own celebrity status was mocked by his opponent Sen. John McCain in an ad that dubbed Obama \"the biggest celebrity in the world.\" However, when Obama deployed celebrities it wasn't to combat voter reservations, Zelizer said. \"It was more to complement an image that voters already had of him.\" In this election cycle, it appears at though celebrities' largely symbolic value is not without purpose, it's a signal to parts of her political coalition who may be wavering to stay the course. Related: Do Celebrity Endorsements Help or Hurt? For instance, when LeBron James appears alongside Clinton in Cleveland, Ohio, where some voters there may be cynical about her, they trust in him \u2014 the man who brought the city its first NBA title earlier this year. Or when she cozies up for an intimate chat with beloved R&B singer Mary J. Blige , that's also an implicit shout out to women of color across the country, one of the most reliable Democratic voting blocs. NBA basketball player J. R. Smith (L) and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (2R) listen as basketball player Lebron James speaks during a rally at the Cleveland Public Auditorium on Nov. 6, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.                                  Donald Trump barnstorms five states Sunday while Hillary Clinton implores her most fervent supporters to get to the polls, in a frenetic final 48-hour dash to the US presidential election. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP - Getty Images Republican nominee Donald Trump is also not without his share of famous allies. He has been accompanied by aging rocker Ted Nugent on the stump, a move aimed at playing to voters who deeply dislike and distrust Obama and Clinton. Earlier this year Nugent said in F acebook post that Obama and Clinton should be \"tried for treason and hung.\" Trump featured actors Scott Baio and Antonio Sabato, Jr . at the GOP's national convention this summer, which could have been perceived as a play for Boomers and Latinos respectively.

It may help make the case for her in ways that she is incapable of herself, but it could also threaten to overshadow her or risk making her seem like an elitist. Like you\u2019ve never seen them before. @MaryJBlige sits down with @HillaryClinton . #The411 \u2014 Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 27, 2016 The Clinton campaign decided early on that they are willing to bet big on Hollywood \u2014 with the Democratic National Convention boasting a host of largely female A-listers like Meryl Streep, Lena Dunham, Elizabeth Banks and America Ferrera, all singing her praises Related: How Celebrity Surrogates Could Help Hillary Clinton Here are just a few of the stars that are aligning with Clinton during the home stretch \u2014and which demographic segment of the public they are supposed to be speaking to: Bruce Springsteen - \"The Boss\" has become a staple now on the campaign trail for Democrats (he memorably stumped alongside President Obama during the last two cycles ), so much so that some of Republican nominee Donald Trump's supporters recently booed his classic song \"Born In the U.S.A.\" (which is not the jingoistic theme some interpret it to be) at one of his recent rallies. But the popularity of Springsteen with Baby Boomers, as well as blue collar suburban men and women, is undeniable, which is why Republicans have attempted to co-opt his music since 1984 with mixed results . Katy Perry speaks at a rally in support of Clinton on Saturday in Las Vegas. John Locher / AP Katy Perry - She already has proved to be a reliable surrogate for Obama, and this go round the \"Roar\" singer is making a direct appeal to young women, who could make a crucial difference for Clinton in a number of swing states. Not unlike Beyonc\u00e9, a thread of female empowerment runs strong throughout some of Perry's pop hits, which coalesces nicely with the \"I'm with her\" spirit of the Clinton campaign. Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 - Speaking of Beyonc\u00e9, her pantsuit clad performance at a Cleveland rally for Clinton this past week may go down as one of the pop culture highlights of the 2016 campaign. Her endorsement, coupled with her husband rapper Jay-Z's, could be interpreted as an overt olive branch to black voters, who appear to be far less enthused with her candidacy than they were Obama's. The power couple, who appeared at Obama's inauguration in '08, giving their blessing to the former first lady will not go unnoticed. Beyonce performs during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Cleveland, Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. Matt Rourke / AP Jennifer Lopez - If the early vote is any indication, Latinos will be out in full force this year \u2014 and the polls suggest that that's good news for Clinton. Jennifer Lopez \u2014 as well as several other Latino celebrities \u2014 has been arguably more outspoken than ever before this cycle. And Lopez in particular could be an important persuader, since many first time Latino voters are Puerto Rican, and she is one of the most prominent figures to hail from that community. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) Chance the Rapper - Haven't heard of this Chicago-based performer? Chances are you aren't under the age of 35. Lost amid the hoopla over Jay and Bey, is the fact that this rising star is headlining a \"Parade to the Polls\" on Monday and has also appeared on Clinton's behalf. His presence on trail could corral young minorities of color, and should he help persuade those voters to get behind the Democratic ticket, it could pay off in the election cycles to come. Thank you to @Beyonce , @S_C_ , @Pharrell , @ChanceTheRapper , @BigSean , @JColeNC , and all the amazing artists helping to get out the vote. -H \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 6, 2016 Adam Howard ",

    "text": "In Boomers\u2019 Sunset, Election Reawakens an Old Divide By JONATHAN MAHLER Continue reading the main story Photo Antiwar protesters on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in December 1972. Credit Librado Romero/The New York Times They came of age in the 1960s and \u201970s, in the traumatic aftermath of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They fought and protested a war together, argued over Nixon and Kissinger together, laughed at Archie Bunker together. As children, they practiced air-raid drills; as adults, they cheered the fall of the Berlin Wall . In the 1990s, they saw one of their own become president, watching him gain glory as one of the most gifted politicians of his time, but also infamy as one of its most self-indulgent \u2014 a poster child for the Me Generation. They are of course the baby boomers, the collective offspring of the most fertile period in American history. At 75 million strong, they have been the most dominant force in American life for three decades, and one of its most maligned. Enlightened but self-centered, introspective but reckless, they are known among the cohorts that followed them \u2014 and even to some boomers themselves \u2014 as the generation that failed to live up to its lofty ideals, but still held fast to its sense of superiority. If Bill Clinton was their white-haired id, Hillary Clinton is their superego in a pantsuit. A second Clinton presidency could represent a last hurrah for the baby boomers. But it could also offer a shot at a kind of generational redemption. \u201cThere is a kind of do-over quality to it,\u201d said Landon Y. Jones, the author of the 1980 book \u201cGreat Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation.\u201d \u201cThis is their last chance to get it right.\u201d Photo Hillary Clinton greeting supporters last week in Dade City, Fla. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times A shared history binds the boomers \u2014 as do, broadly speaking, some shared traits. Their parents suffered through the Depression and World War II before rearing them in the most prosperous society the world had ever seen. Inevitably, perhaps, they were guided by two polestars: responsibility and entitlement. Those dueling impulses powered the rise of both Clintons: one impulse galvanizing supporters who deeply admired their commitment to public service, the other galling critics who saw them as playing by their own rules. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere\u2019s this tremendous idealism with the Clintons \u2014 actually living social change, embodying social change,\u201d said Gil Troy, the author of \u201cThe Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s\u201d and a history professor at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cBut also, at the end of day, not just having this will to power, but also being so convinced of their own self-righteousness that they improvise a new set of morality and ethics.\u201d Like her husband\u2019s, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political odyssey began in earnest when she volunteered for George McGovern\u2019s youth-powered 1972 presidential bid, one that ended in a lopsided, welcome-to-adulthood takedown of \u201960s idealism at the hands of President Richard M. Nixon and his \u201csilent majority.\u201d It was there, in the trenches, that the Clintons \u2014 still in their mid-20s, and not yet married \u2014 began to assemble the network of trusted friends that continues to surround them. Twenty years later, at 46, Bill Clinton became the third-youngest president ever elected. At 69, Hillary Clinton would be the second-oldest. In many respects, her journey has become her generation\u2019s journey \u2014 from protester to parent and now grandparent, from earnest idealist to battle-hardened realist. Photo Festivities outside Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign office in August 1968 in Miami. Credit William Sauro/The New York Times They would be bookends on their cohort, one seizing the national stage on behalf of their generation in its prime, the other, who now qualifies for Medicare , vying to lead it into its dotage. Of course, the presidential election has featured not one but two members of the generation born between 1946 and 1964. And just as the Clintons grew out of the campus left, Donald J. Trump traces his political following, if not his own formation, to that generation\u2019s Nixon voters: those who did not protest, or even attend college; who preferred Elvis to the Beatles, Sinatra to Santana, the familiar to the foreign, order to upheaval. (Though at this point, what was once the counterculture has become the culture: Mr. Trump has been known to play the Rolling Stones at events.) If Mr. Trump does not fit the profile of the searching, liberal, conflicted boomer, well, blame the liberal boomers whose cultural contributions crystallized that image, most memorably in \u201cThe Big Chill.\u201d (They also created its counter-counterculture foil: Think of Mr. Trump \u2014 thin-skinned, red-faced, schooled in uniform \u2014 as the R.O.T.C. commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer in \u201cAnimal House.\u201d) The most enduring boomer icons, however, sprang not from a Hollywood script but from Yale Law School and the Arkansas Statehouse. Standing under the balloons at Madison Square Garden in 1992 \u2014 with Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d blaring \u2014 the Clintons sent a clear message to their peers: Yesterday\u2019s gone. Our time is now. And also, maybe, now. Not much remains of the we-can-change-the-world optimism that swept in with the new administration in 1993, and maybe with good reason. The great accomplishments of Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency \u2014 peace and its anticipated dividends, a surging economy, shrinking budget deficits \u2014 were washed away. As some boomers sent their kids to college, others sent their sons and daughters off to fight in a seemingly permanent conflict halfway around the globe. If elected, Mrs. Clinton would inherit the Islamic State, an ever-widening income gap, partisan gridlock and a populace so polarized and full of loathing that it seems to be segregating. Her husband had it easy by comparison. Photo Senator George McGovern at a campaign stop in June 1972 in Brooklyn. Credit Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times It\u2019s no fun getting old. Not that Mrs. Clinton is complaining. She has embraced her longevity, beginning a recent rally in Pueblo, Colo., with a callback to her last visit there. \u201cI know there are a lot of really young people here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut was anybody here back in 1992?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cheers shot up from some of the gathering\u2019s elders.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0Two State Department contractors, with decades of experience protecting the United States' most sensitive secrets, are speaking out for the first time about Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state and how the rules for government security clearance holders did not seem to apply to Clinton and her team. \u201cThe State Department was her oyster and it was great for the [Clinton] foundation and great for the Clintons to be able to have such a great position,\"\u00a0Dave Whitnah told Fox News.\u00a0 Whitnah said he worked within the State Department's Office of Security Technology which is responsible for cameras and alarms and sweeping for bugs.\u00a0Whitnah said everyone understood the secretary of state is the primary target of foreign intelligence services. \u201cThe number one person would be the secretary of state and their communications,\"\u00a0Whitnah explained. \"You can think of the Iran negotiations, nuclear negotiation, negotiations with Russia, talks with Russia.\u00a0You know, anything to do with foreign policy.\" Whitnah emphasized that tens of millions of dollars were spent on technical security for Clinton that apparently was disregarded as her team traveled around the world on official U.S. government business. \"It was unfathomable that [her BlackBerry] would be used for anything other than just unclassified communication,\"\u00a0Whitnah said. Clinton\u2019s devices were not certified as secure by the State Department.\u00a0As for her use of a non-secure BlackBerry, Whitnah stressed that email can be intercepted and, \u201cEven if turned off, it\u2019s still a listening device so that\u2019s why you take out the batteries.\u201d As Clinton was sworn in as secretary in January 2009, government contractor Amel Smith said he was also working at the department and: \"State Department rules are clear. I helped write those rules.\" Smith says his 30 years of experience includes serving in the U.S. Army's 82nd\u00a0Airborne, before becoming a counter-intelligence and counter-espionage investigator at State tracking down breaches of classified materials. He reviewed some of the FBI witness interviews from the Clinton email investigation with Fox News, and questioned those who claimed not to have the proper training in handling sensitive information. \"I hear things like, well, I forgot, um, I don't know that I was trained, I don't know this. You know -- every single person that had access to that information when it was sent is in violation,\" Smith emphasized. The FBI witness interviews also show secure facilities for classified information -- known as SCIFs -- were specially built for Clinton in her in Washington, D.C., and Chappaqua, N.Y., homes.\u00a0Doors that were supposed to be locked were left open. \"If you've got an uncleared person in there, it's automatically a compromise,\"\u00a0Smith said. Another FBI interview summary said there were personally owned desktop computers in the secure facilities at Clinton's homes, yet she told the FBI that she did not have a computer of any kind in these facilities. \"If somebody said they're there, then they probably were there, and you know, the reason you would deny it was because you probably didn't have approval,\"\u00a0Smith said. Having unapproved computers in a SCIF would automatically call for a security investigation. Asked for his reaction to Clinton's claim that nothing she sent or received was marked classified, Whitnah called that assertion a \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d\u00a0 Fox News was first to report in June that at least one of the emails contained a classified information portion marking for \"c\" which is confidential. FBI Director James Comey later said in July when he recommended against criminal charges that a handful of Clinton emails contained classified markings. But more than 2,100 emails with classified information,\u00a0and at least 22 at the \u201ctop secret\u201d level, passed through Clinton's unsecured private server.\u00a0Asked how it happened, Smith said, \"Personally, there had to have been somebody moving classified information from C-LAN, C-LAN again is Secret, Confidential only, and JWICS. JWICS is where all top secret information is.\" After new emails were found in the Anthony Weiner sexting case belonging to his estranged wife Clinton aide Huma Abedin, the FBI reopened the Clinton email investigation.\u00a0On Sunday, Comey said the emails did not change his recommendation against criminal charges because his investigators did not find intent to move classified materials outside secure government channels \"Whether it's the private email server, whether it's this private laptop. If there's classified -- one document on there -- that's classified, it's a violation. Somebody violated [the] law,\"\u00a0Smith said. \"Throw all the politics out the window, what we're talking about is the defense of this nation.\" Asked about Smith and Whitnah, who filed a complaint against the State Department, a department spokesman said they were not direct hires -- adding that the head of diplomatic security told the FBI that Clinton was \"very responsive to security issues.\"\u00a0 Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C. She covers intelligence, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security. Herridge joined FNC in 1996 as a London-based correspondent. Pamela K. Browne is Senior Executive Producer at the FOX News Channel (FNC) and is Director of Long-Form Series and Specials.  Her journalism has been recognized with several awards.  Browne first joined FOX in 1997 to launch the news magazine \u201cFox Files\u201d and later, \u201cWar Stories.\u201d Advertisement ",

Police say 34-year-old Sherri Papini has been missing since she went for a jog Wednesday afternoon in the tiny town of Mountain Gate in Shasta County. The Redding Record Searchlight reports the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office is dedicating nearly all its investigators to the case as well as some Redding police detectives. The sheriff\u2019s office has called her disappearance suspicious and said the mother of two may be at risk, the paper reports. Police say they have received about 100 tips since Papini\u2019s disappearance. Papini\u2019s family has said they believe she was abducted. Officials say her husband, Keith Papini, reported her missing when he came home from work and found that she hadn\u2019t picked up their two children from daycare. Her cellphone and headphones were found near where she was reported missing. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "4 US Cities to Vote on Soda Tax on Election Day By Paul Blake Nov 7, 2016, 5:35 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Philadelphia Is 1st Major American City With Soda Tax 0 Shares Email Sipping that sweet soft drink with lunch might be a little more expensive in four cities after this year\u2019s election. Initiatives asking voters to support or oppose new taxes on sweetened drinks like sodas are on ballots in Boulder, Colorado, and the California cities of Albany, San Francisco and Oakland. If passed, these cities will join Berkeley, California; Philadelphia and Chicago as the only cities in the nation to have the taxes that are designed to combat bulging bellies. Officials in Chicago are proposing to impose an additional tax on sweetened drinks in order to help pay for public health and emergency services, according to ABC's Chicago station, WLS . That proposal has been met with some protest. It is not on the ballot on Election Day. According to the World Health Organization , several countries across the Americas have introduced similar taxes including Barbados, Chile and Dominica. However, one country\u2019s implementation of a soda tax appears to have turned the most heads: Mexico. The United States\u2019 southern neighbor instituted the tax in 2014, and experts and reports suggest that it has been very successful in curbing consumption of beverages that can lead to negative health outcomes. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition and economics at the University of North Carolina who is studying the efficacy of these so-called sin taxes, told ABC News that a year after Mexico\u2019s soda tax went into effect, consumption rates had dropped by 17 percent among low-income individuals. For the average Mexican, consumption dropped 12 percent. He said that preliminary data suggested that rates dropped even further during the second year after the tax was imposed. This matters, Popkin pointed out, because Mexicans consume \u201cabout the same of level of sugary beverages as the low-income Americans consume.\u201d The Wall Street Journal, citing data from market research firm Canadean, reported in May that soft drink sales in Mexico fell by almost two percent in as many years after the new tax was imposed. Forecast data predicted sales were up about 0.5 percent in 2015. Americans consume the highest amounts of soft drinks (including sparkling juices, but not energy drinks) per person than any other country, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Mexico is in fourth place by the same measure. Popkin said that he saw a shift in consumer behavior after Berkeley's tax became law. The proposal in Oakland would see a tax of 1 cent per ounce imposed on sugary drinks, according to ABC station KGO-TV . The same amount would be levied under San Francisco and Albany's proposals, according to the local governments in San Francisco and in Albany . And in Boulder, the proposal would see a 2 cent per ounce tax imposed, according the local government . Votes on the ballot measures comes just weeks after the World Health Organization released a report saying that there are \u201creasonable and increasing evidence that appropriately designed taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages would result in proportional reductions in consumption.\u201d The report recommended that \u201ccountries consider the use of economic tools that are justified by evidence, and may include taxes and subsidies, to improve access to healthy dietary choices and create incentives for behaviors associated with improved health outcomes and discourage the consumption of less healthy options.\u201d That\u2019s bureaucratic speak for using taxes and subsidies to encourage people to eat and drink healthy foods and drinks. But these measures aren\u2019t without opposition. Lauren Kane, senior director for communications at the American Beverage Association, a trade group representing the non-alcoholic drink industry in the U.S., told ABC News that \u201ctaxes singling out one item in the grocery cart do not make people healthier and real word evidence backs this up.\" \"While we disagree with some in the public health community on discriminatory taxes, America\u2019s beverage companies recognize we have a role to play in addressing complex public health challenges because we too want a stronger, healthy America,\" she added. \"That\u2019s why we are working with prominent public health organizations to reduce calories and sugar from beverages in the American diet with a focus on communities where the obesity challenge is the greatest.\" Editors Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Chicago also has a tax on soda.

Markus Schreiber/AP More than four years after he took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will face questioning there on Nov. 14 over Sweden's allegations against him of sex crimes, including rape. This could mark a breakthrough in the standoff. Assange has repeatedly denied the accusations, which date to 2010. He maintains that he would face extradition to the U.S. if he appeared in Sweden for questioning, as we reported . Sweden has said an interview is necessary before it can determine whether to file charges against Assange. Ecuador Acknowledges It Restricted WikiLeaks Founder's Internet Connection Sweden's prosecution authority said in a statement that \"Ecuador has granted the Swedish request for legal assistance in criminal matters.\" It said an Ecuadorean prosecutor will conduct the interview with a Swedish prosecutor and police investigator. They will also take a DNA sample from Assange, should he give his consent. \"I welcome the fact that the investigation can now move forward via an interview with the suspect,\" Director of Prosecution Marianne Ny said. The prosecutors said they will not release details after they conduct the interview because this is an ongoing investigation. \"Since he took refuge in the embassy, three of four sex-crimes allegations against Assange have expired, due to statutes of limitation,\" as we have reported. \"The fourth allegation, of rape, remains.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

The federal prosecutor in Columbus says Aaron Daniels was taken into custody Monday at John Glenn Columbus International Airport after a monthslong investigation.\u00a0 The complaint against Daniels alleges he purchased an airline ticket on November 5th 2016 to travel from Columbus to Trinidad and Tobago via Houston on United Airlines.\u00a0 Daniels allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to travel to Trinidad as the beginning of his trip to Libya. His flights were scheduled to leave on Monday Nov. 7th.\u00a0 He had previously told an undercover FBI informant that he had an  interest in traveling to Libya for the purpose of engaging in violent  jihad on  behalf of ISIS.\u00a0 He was arrested when he arrived at the airport on  November 7th. After his arrest he admitted he was attempting to fly  overseas to join jihad.\u00a0 U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman says Daniels wired $250 to now-deceased ISIS operative Abu Isa Al-Amriki in January.\u00a0 CBS Columbus affiliate WBNS reports the complaint also states that Daniels set up email addresses and a social media account using the aliases Harun Muhammad and Abu Yusef. He used those accounts to expresses his interested in jihad and to seek funding to travel to Syria and Afghanistan. Daniels made an initial court appearance in federal court wearing ankle and wrist chains. He was read his rights but wasn\u2019t required to enter a plea. Magistrate Judge Terence Kemp scheduled a Thursday morning bond hearing. Daniels\u2019 court-appointed attorney declined to comment. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP U.S.-backed fighters rest during fighting with the Islamic State group near Ein Issa, north of Raqqa, Syria, as shown in a video by Qasioun, a Syrian opposition media outlet. AP U.S.-backed troops are making slow progress in their offensive aimed at retaking the Syrian city of Raqqa, the so-called capital of the Islamic State. This comes as Iraqi forces, assisted by the U.S., report gains in their mission to capture Mosul, the most important ISIS stronghold in that country. The Syrian Defense Forces \u2014 a coalition led by Kurds that also includes Arab and Turkmen fighters \u2014 are trying to isolate Raqqa before attempting to take control of it. The SDF announced the start of the offensive on Sunday. It's backed by U.S.-led air support and military advisers. > \"As in Mosul, the fight will not be easy and there is hard work ahead, but it is necessary to end the fiction of ISIL's caliphate and disrupt the group's ability to carry out terror attacks against the United States, our allies and our partners,\" U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement . Iraqi security forces launched their offensive on Mosul in mid-October and have steadily gained ground. Last week, forces entered the eastern neighborhoods of the city. As the fighting continues, concern is growing about widespread reports that ISIS is using civilians as human shields and carrying out executions. Article continues after sponsorship After Iraqi troops cleared ISIS fighters from the strategically located village of Hamam al-Alil south of Mosul, they discovered a mass grave with about 100 decapitated bodies, according to a Ministry of Defense statement. It wasn't immediately clear who the people were and when they died. Raqqa fell under ISIS control in 2014 and is seen as the group's most important stronghold in Syria. ISIS is likely to launch a fierce defense of the city, as Abdelaziz Alhamza of the citizen-journalism collective \"Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently\" tells Morning Edition . \"And [ISIS] losing Raqqa, it means like defeating the Islamic State,\" he added. While the coalition troops are reportedly making gains, the composition of the ground force has raised questions. The SDF's most powerful component is the Kurdish YPG, a key U.S. ally against the Islamic State in Syria that neighboring Turkey views as a terrorist group. Turkish concerns have complicated planning for the offensive, according to Reuters, because the country \"does not want to see any further expansion of Kurdish influence in northern Syria.\" \"The Kurdish participation is problematic,\" as the BBC's Mark Lowen reports , because \"Kurdish fighters are accused of expelling Arabs from areas they've taken in the north and Raqqa has an overwhelming Arab majority.\" The U.S.-led coalition said in a statement that Arab troops involved in the operation are \"indigenous to the area and will help establish regional support for SDF operations.\" Monday saw heavy fighting in the countryside north of Raqqa, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that the SDF fighters faced suicide attacks as the two sides exchanged fire. North of Mosul, Iraqi commanders tell NPR's Alice Fordham that they are making gains in the village of Bashiqa. As Alice reports, intense fighting continues in the city's eastern neighborhoods, and \"an eyewitness inside says ISIS is preventing people from leaving, and mosques are broadcasting calls for people to join the fighting.\" ",

It's a huge slate of choices for voters who, during this campaign cycle, have been inundated with nearly $100 million in advertising about the initiatives. California's ballot initiatives \u2014 the most since 2000 \u2014 also reflect the choices before voters in a state that tends to be a bellwether for broader cultural issues that ultimately become law, political experts say. People wait in line to vote in the California primary at City Hall in San Francisco on June 7. Andrew Burton / Getty Images, file \"Ballot initiatives often are leading indicators of trends, especially on social issues,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center of Politics. \"The ultimate trend-setter is California, partly because it is a mega-state that has so many ballot issues every year. Of course, the Golden State is much more liberal than the conservative states of the South or farm belt, so there are limits to what you can read into California's preferences.\" On the eve of Election Day, ballot initiatives ranging from marijuana regulation, gun rights voter identification laws, adult film industry regulation and the death penalty offer a glimpse of the nation's mood on policy issues. Nationally, only 24 states allow citizen-initiated statues or amendments to be up for election. And in these state, the proposed measures are often ones the federal government has left open to state discretion \u2014 with few national restrictions in place to inhibit the decision-making. \"We like to talk about ballot initiatives like the second story,\" said Kellie Dupree, programs and communications director for The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a progressive organization in support of ballot measures. \"People have taken it to the ballot to get the things they want.\" For example, as the national debate over what is a \"living wage\" rages on, residents in Arizona, Maine and Colorado will all be asked to vote on whether the state should raise its minimum wage progressively until it hits $12 by the year 2020. Washington state will vote on incrementally raising its minimum wage of $9.47 to $13.50 by 2020. Related: The New Battles Between Blue and Red America \"The federal minimum wage hasn't been changed in a couple of years and states are looking if they want to make a change on their own,\" said Wendy Underhill, a program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures. People in South Dakota will also be voting on minimum wage, but for minors. The act is looking to lower the state minimum wage of $8.55 per hour to $7.50 for non-tipped employees under 18. Another issue up for debate is marijuana legalization. Nine states have marijuana measures on the ballot this November with a high chance of passing. Pot advocates hope this will be added incentive for the federal government to lift its nationwide ban. Related: 9 States to Vote on Legalizing Recreational, Medical Marijuana States, such as Maine, are looking to make the drug legal for regulation, taxation and licensing. Should this become law, the legal age of consumption would be 21 years of age or older. \"Marijuana is the big one this year with nine measures,\" Underhill said. \"It's part of a year or more trend toward states allowing marijuana for recreation. Other states are adopting medical marijuana.\" Play ",

Trevor Hughes , USA TODAY 6:59 p.m. EST November 7, 2016 x Share Voters in nine states will consider marijuana ballot questions, including whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook A marijuana plant grows inside a state-licensed cultivation facility in Denver. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) DENVER \u2013 Tuesday is marijuana\u2019s big day, with voters in nine states deciding whether to relax cannabis restrictions for either medical or recreational use. Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada are considering legalizing recreational marijuana. Voters in Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota are asking voters\u00a0whether to permit medical use for certain conditions, like cancer or chronic pain. None of those votes will change the federal ban on marijuana use, although legalization advocates say it may further pressure Congress, the DEA and the FDA to act. Here\u2019s a quick guide to the measures, listed first by recreational and then by medical. Recreational marijuana proposals What would California\u2019s marijuana law do? The California plan, known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act or Prop. 64, allows residents to grow up to six plants at home\u00a0and gives municipalities the power to allow or ban outdoor grows and marijuana stores. It requires commercial growers to comply with environmental regulations \u2014\u00a0many illegal growers today ignore laws governing water , pesticide and fertilizer use \u2014\u00a0and gives existing medical-marijuana providers a head start in getting business licenses. The measure also maintains existing prohibitions on youth use and driving while high. Critics worry it will open up television advertising to marijuana companies\u00a0and goes too far in permitting people previously convicted of violent drug offenses to join the industry. Medical marijuana is widely available in California. What would legalized marijuana mean for California? What would Arizona\u2019s marijuana law do? Prop. 205 would legalize adult recreational marijuana use, cultivation and sales, with a 15% sales tax to fund new state regulation, enforcement and education efforts. Medical marijuana is legal already in Arizona, and the recreational plan backed by the group \u201cCampaign to\u00a0 Regulate Marijuana like Alcohol\u201d expands use to adults 21 and older. The proposal would allow people to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants, and creates a state-regulated system of commercial growers and retailers. Arizona marijuana campaign says Prop. 205 race could be decided by 'couple thousand' votes What would Maine\u2019s marijuana law do? The ballot measure expands the state\u2019s well-regarded medical marijuana program to recreational use, but it also permits the creation of \u201cmarijuana social clubs,\u201d where people would be able to consume marijuana. Critics worry that Question 1 might increase the amount of impaired driving, in the way that bars can lead to more drunken drivers on the road. There\u2019s also concern\u00a0that the measure requires marijuana-focused publications to be sold from behind store counters, a proposal that was struck down as unconstitutional in Colorado. Gov.\u00a0Paul LePage\u00a0signed Maine\u2019s medical marijuana law in 2011, but he opposes this recreational legalization effort. The plan lets adults possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana, along with growing up to six adult plants at a time, with exemptions for seedlings and smaller plants. Commercial sales would be taxed and regulated by the state. What would the Massachusetts marijuana law do? Question 4 allows adults to grow up to six plants, possess 10 ounces of marijuana at home, and posses up to an ounce in public, although public consumption remains illegal. Gov.\u00a0Charlie Baker\u00a0argues legalizing marijuana in the Bay State could increase youth use\u00a0and distract regulators and public health officials wrestling with an epidemic of opioid abuse and overdoses.\u00a0If approved, the measure creates a new Cannabis Control Commission, which would oversee regulations and taxing of commercial sales. What would Nevada\u2019s marijuana law do? Question 2 permits the personal possession of one ounce or less of marijuana or one-eighth of an ounce or less of concentrated marijuana for individuals 21 years of age or older. Adults 21 and older could grow up to six plants for personal use if they live more than 25 miles away from a commercial marijuana store, but otherwise would be required to buy taxed and regulated cannabis. Nevada\u2019s program would be open to anyone visiting the state, and supporters say the tourist-heavy market could be worth $390 million, with up to $1.1 billion in economic impact. Medical dispensaries would be granted an 18-month monopoly on recreational sales, and alcohol distributors would also have an 18-month monopoly on distribution. ",

News and the Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail 8:28 p.m. EST November 7, 2016 x Share The South Carolina realtor is charged in multiple murders as well as kidnapping a woman and chaining her up in a storage shed. His criminal past goes way beyond that. USA TODAY NETWORK Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, 45, is led into the courtroom for a bond hearing at the Spartanburg County  Detention Center in Spartanburg, S.C., on Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016. A second body was found on his property Sunday. (Photo: Ken Ruinard, Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail) 782 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE WOODRUFF, S.C.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0A third body was found Monday at the property near Woodruff where a kidnapped woman was rescued last week and investigators believe they have found all the bodies on the 95-acre property. One body was found Sunday and another was found Monday. Both were removed from the property, authorities said. \"We can\u2019t say if they are male or female,\" said Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger. They were found\u00a0close to each other and were at the two sites that Todd Kohlhepp indicated on Saturday. S.C. man facing murder charges likely linked to chilling Amazon reviews Kohlhepp, 45, a real estate broker, pilot and convicted sex offender, was arrested and charged with kidnapping 30-year-old Kala Brown, who was found chained inside a storage building on the property Thursday. Kohlhepp also has been\u00a0charged with four counts of murder in the 2003 quadruple slayings at Superbike Motorsports in Chesnee. Clevenger said he will examine\u00a0the bodies to determine how they died and would not go into their state of decomposition. \"At this time we don\u2019t feel like there are any more bodies on this property,\" said Lt. Kevin Bobo, Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman. The majority of the property has been searched, but investigators will be back on the site Tuesday, he said. Kohlhepp initially refused to talk with investigators and asked for a lawyer, Bobo said. On Saturday, he \"reinitiated contact with us and confessed to the Superbike murders,\" Bobo said. \"We can\u2019t go into who the people are or if Kohlhepp identified the two people found Sunday and Monday,\"\u00a0Bobo said. He has not confessed to any more killings, Bobo said. Law enforcement look for evidence on the property of Todd Kohlhepp in Woodruff, S.C., on Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Ken Ruinard, Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail) On Monday, a\u00a0day after\u00a0investigators\u00a0unearthed a second body from a wooded section of Kohlhepp\u2019s property, an excavator could be seen digging at a site separate from Friday's and Sunday's discovery of bodies as the painstaking search for more remains entered its fifth day. A green body board was taken onto the property\u00a0Monday afternoon. About an hour earlier, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright gathered inside the fenced area but away from investigators with a group of people from Duncan First Baptist Church for prayer. The sheriff and coronor, along with other investigators, could be seen working in the woods close to a clearing on the property. Late in the afternoon, a piece of excavating equipment was removed from the scene as was some evidence put into a black bag and driven away in a truck. Two of Kohlhepp\u2019s goats also were loaded into a large crate in the back of a truck and driven away. As teen in rape case, multiple murder suspect called 'devil on a chain' On Saturday, Kohlhepp pointed\u00a0investigators to the location of the second body and another after he was allowed to see his mother, according to CBS. Wright did not know when further charges might\u00a0be brought against Kohlhepp, but\u00a0Solicitor Barry Barnette said other charges are likely. The search for bodies has extended beyond the Woodruff property to other locations linked to Kohlhepp, though Wright declined to say where investigators were looking.\u00a0The investigation is widespread and no longer limited to South Carolina, he said. Just how far and for how long the search will continue is unclear, but with a private pilot\u2019s license since 2006 and as a real estate broker in Greenville and Spartanburg who owned his own property management business, the search may prove vast. He has yet to be charged in relation to two bodies that have now been found buried on his property. The remains of Charles Carver, 32, who was Brown\u2019s boyfriend and had gone missing along with her in late August, were recovered Friday. Carver had been shot multiple times, Clevenger said. S.C. man, accused of chaining up woman, charged in 2003 quadruple murder Wright said it is believed to be one of the two bodies the suspect told investigators about when he was brought to the scene Saturday morning. Neither Wright nor\u00a0Clevenger would speculate on an identity, or whether Kohlhepp had identified who might be in those graves. The process\u00a0of recovering the body has been meticulous,\u00a0Clevenger said. \u201cYou go to the point where they reference, where they tell you, and you very meticulously take off small layers of soil until you can identify potential for human remains,\u201d Clevenger said. Experts meticulously dig around and underneath the body to preserve every bit of evidence possible, he said. Wright and Clevenger declined to say whether the remains were skeletal or how long they may have been buried on the property, and would only classify them as \"human remains.\" Earlier Sunday, Kohlhepp\u00a0appeared in court in Spartanburg and was officially charged with four counts of murder. The charges are for the four deaths\u00a0at the\u00a0Chesnee motorcycle shop 13 years ago. Kohlhepp was denied bond and his next court appearance was scheduled for Jan. 19. He is charged in the deaths at Superbike Motorsports of\u00a0Scott Ponder, 30, Ponder's 52-year-old mother and part-time employee Beverly Guy, and employees Brian Lucas, 29, and Chris Sherbert, 26, according to Wright. The four\u00a0were found \u201cbrutally murdered\u201d on Nov. 6, 2003, at the business\u00a0on Parris Bridge Road. The case was Spartanburg County\u2019s first quadruple homicide. Families of some of Kohlhepp\u2019s alleged victims comforted each other as he stood before the Spartanburg County magistrate to be charged with four murders. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and acknowledging only the magistrate and law-enforcement officers, the short-haired, 5-foot-11, 300-pound man was told he could face the death penalty. Kohlhepp quietly answered \u201cyes, sir\u201d or \u201cno, sir\u201d to questions from magistrate Jimmy Henson Sunday. Asked if he wanted to make a statement to victims\u2019 families, he said, \u201cNot at this time, sir.\" Contributing: Michael Burns,Nathaniel Cary and Eric Connor, The Greenville (S.C.)

Bernie Sanders urges a crowd in Los Angeles to support Proposition 61, a ballot measure on prescription drug pricing. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders held rallies in Los Angeles and Sacramento on Monday to urge voters to support Proposition 61, the California pharmaceutical\u00a0drug-pricing initiative. Hundreds turned out to see the former Democratic presidential candidate criticize drug companies and encourage supporters to combat the influence of money in politics. Proposition 61 would\u00a0limit state government spending on prescription drugs to\u00a0the prices paid by\u00a0the\u00a0 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs .\u00a0Because the VA typically negotiates the lowest prices for prescription drugs of any public or private entity, the measure\u2019s supporters say they hope to curb rising drug costs paid by the state. Sanders started the day at Pershing Square in\u00a0Los Angeles, where he addressed a crowd of about\u00a0200. About 200 people attend the Bernie Sanders rally in Los Angeles. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Later, he\u00a0held a second rally\u00a0outside the Capitol in Sacramento. Proposition 61 is the most expensive of the 17 measures on Tuesday's ballot. Pharmaceutical companies have contributed\u00a0more than $109\u00a0million to oppose it. Supporters of the measure have contributed $18.5 million. Latest updates ",

Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final, frenzied hours of the presidential campaign, offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of must-win states. Accompanied by rock stars, ex-presidents, old friends and their grown children, the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of their visions for the country. Mrs. Clinton, whom polls show leading Mr. Trump, gave a sunny and optimistic summation of her candidacy for the White House as she embarked on a four-state tour on Monday. \u201cTomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,\u201d she told a crowd in Pittsburgh. \u201cOur core values are being tested in this election.\u201d Photo Hillary Clinton campaigned at the University of Pittsburgh as part of a four-state trip on Monday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Mr. Trump, who was campaigning in five states on Monday, took a darker approach, assailing the \u201ccrooked media,\u201d attacking a \u201ccorrupt Washington establishment\u201d and mocking Mrs. Clinton over and over. \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged, rigged system,\u201d he declared in Raleigh, N.C. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the campaign wound down, both candidates dispensed with ritual. Mrs. Clinton, who relishes upbraiding her opponent, abandoned her usual assault on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and temperament. And Mr. Trump, who normally seeks to convey confidence at all times, sounded uncharacteristically vulnerable . \u201cThey say we\u2019ll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose,\u201d he said during a rally in Sarasota, Fla. \u201cI said: \u2018No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want any credit if we lose.\u2019\u201d Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there were signs that Americans were seizing the opportunity to express themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high , and in interviews, many voters said they were eager to bring an end to this unusual, exhausting and still suspenseful election. Photo Donald J. Trump arrived for a rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Monday. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m totally ready for this election to be over,\u201d said Mary Hoch, 54, who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Sarasota with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on her head and a \u201cDeplorable Lives Matter\u201d pin on her shirt. Ms. Hoch predicted a Trump victory. \u201cI think there are a lot of silent Trump voters,\u201d she said. Daniel Saunders, 58, who attended a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Charlotte, N.C., was just as exasperated by the race. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by it,\u201d he said. But Mr. Saunders said he was convinced that Mrs. Clinton would eke out a win. \u201cI think it will be close, but I think she will pull it out,\u201d he said. Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton sent their running mates, families and allies across the country to maximize their reach in crucial swing states. Mr. Trump relied on his three oldest children \u2014 Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u2014 along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Mrs. Clinton deployed President Obama and former President Bill Clinton, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the first lady, Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular political figure in the country. ",

    "text": "But moments later, his resolve had collapsed. He allowed the same reporter onto his plane for a flight from Miami to Jacksonville, Fla. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy is a jarring split screen: the choreographed show of calm and confidence orchestrated by his staff, and the neediness and vulnerability of a once-boastful candidate now uncertain of victory. On the surface, there is the semblance of stability that is robbing Hillary Clinton of her most potent weapon: Mr. Trump\u2019s self-sabotaging eruptions, which have repeatedly undermined his candidacy. Underneath that veneer, turbulence still reigns, making it difficult for him to overcome all of the obstacles blocking his path to the White House. The contrasts pervade his campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away the Twitter account that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals. But offline, Mr. Trump still privately muses about all the ways he will punish his enemies after Election Day, including a threat to fund a \u201c super PAC \u201d with vengeance as its core mission. His polished older daughter, Ivanka, sat for a commercial intended to appeal to suburban women who have recoiled from her father\u2019s incendiary language. But she discouraged the campaign from promoting the ad in news releases, fearing that her high-profile association with the campaign would damage the businesses that bear her name. Video Ivanka Trump Ad For Donald Trump Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump's elder daughter, made a campaign commercial intended to appeal to suburban women. The ad is via Kantar Media / CMAG. Publish Date November 6, 2016. . Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is no longer making headlines with embarrassing staff shake-ups. But that has left him with a band of squabbling and unfireable advisers, with confusing roles and an inability to sign off on basic tasks. A plan to encourage early voting in Florida went unapproved for weeks. The result is chaotic. Advisers cut loose from the campaign months ago, like Corey Lewandowski, still talk to the candidate frequently, offering advice that sometimes clashes with that of the current leadership team. Mr. Trump, who does not use a computer, rails against the campaign\u2019s expenditure of tens of millions on digital ads, skeptical that spots he never sees could have any effect. Not even staff members who volunteer to be dismissed are let go. The senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, offered to resign after he was spotted at a Las Vegas strip club the night before the final presidential debate. The offer was rejected. This inside account of the Trump campaign\u2019s final stretch is based on interviews with dozens of aides, operatives, supporters and advisers, many of whom were granted anonymity to describe moments and conversations that were intended to be confidential. Photo Mr. Trump at a rally on Saturday at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, said the campaign was on course and gaining ground. She firmly rejected suggestions that advisers were clashing, and said voters were responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s message. Advertisement Ms. Hicks denied that Ms. Trump had misgivings about promoting the ad in which she appeared. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Ms. Hicks said. \u201cIvanka is totally supportive.\u201d Falling Into Despair The closing phase of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has been punctuated by swaying poll numbers and dizzying mood swings. It started on Oct. 7 with the release of a recording in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals. Many Republicans decided that Mr. Trump\u2019s already shaky campaign was over. Some despondent young staff members at the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill, who usually work late into the night in the final stretches of a campaign, took to leaving their desks early, in time for happy hour at bars. They complained that Mr. Trump had not just lost the election but was dragging down House and Senate candidates, dooming the entire party. Photo Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chief executive, with Rudolph W. Giuliani on Saturday in Reno, Nev. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were just as thrown by the tape. But they saw a chance to salvage his candidacy \u2014 on a Civil War battlefield. His aides outlined 15 bullet points for him to deliver during an Oct. 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pa., to focus voters on a new theme of cleaning up government, even as several women came forward to accuse him of groping them just as he had described in the recording. But Mr. Trump grew frustrated with the instructions. By the time he was done revising the proposed speech, only about a half-dozen of the original suggestions remained. And over the firm objections of his top advisers, he insisted on using the occasion to issue a remarkable threat: that he would sue all of the women who had gone public with the accusations. As the advisers begged him to reconsider \u2014 it would make him seem small, they warned, and undermine a pivotal speech \u2014 Mr. Trump was adamant. There had to be a severe penalty for those who dared to attack him, he said. He could not just sit back and let these women \u201ccome at me,\u201d he told one of them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The speech was roundly criticized and seemed strikingly out of place on such sacred and historic ground. \u201cThe Grievanceburg Address,\u201d one journalist deemed it. Mr. Trump fell into despair, and the gloom already enveloping the Republican political class started to infect his campaign. On Oct. 23, he learned that an ABC News poll showed him trailing Mrs. Clinton by 12 points. He lashed out, becoming so agitated that his aides planned to confront the network about its calculations and accuse ABC of bias, according to internal emails. \u201cDo they think Republicans and Trump supporters are not going to vote?\u201d one of Mr. Trump\u2019s pollsters, John McLaughlin, wrote to the group. \u201cOr is this an intentional effort to suppress Trump turnout?\u201d They pressed the network on its methods, but other polls delivered similarly grim news. An Injection of Hope Then came an astonishing development. On Oct. 28, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, announced that his agency would review newly discovered emails potentially pertinent to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server. On an afternoon flight to New Hampshire, Mr. Trump and his aides saw the news splash across the giant flat-screen television on his plane. Mr. Trump was unsure how to respond. \u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d he asked the small circle traveling with him \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, his campaign\u2019s chief executive; Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser; and Mr. Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who lives in New Hampshire. To the assembled men sitting in white leather seats, the answer was simple: It could turn the election around. ",

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images A court has blocked a new rule created by the Department of Health and Human Services that would preserve the right of patients and families to sue nursing homes in court. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images A federal district court in Mississippi has issued an injunction blocking a new rule that would preserve the right of patients and their families to sue nursing homes over quality-of-care disputes. The rule, announced in September by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, would ban so-called pre-dispute binding arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts, which require patients and families to settle any dispute over care through arbitration, rather than the court system. The rule was supposed to take effect Nov. 28, but the American Health Care Association, an industry group that represents most nursing homes in the U.S., filed a lawsuit in October to block the rule, which it called \"arbitrary and capricious.\" New Rule Preserves Patients' Rights To Sue Nursing Homes In Court The acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services argued in a September blog post that the rule improved the \"care and safety of the nearly 1.5 million residents in the more than 15,000 long-term care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\" As we have reported , the rule applies to facilities that receive money from Medicare or Medicaid \u2014 which is nearly all of them. The lawsuit by the AHCA also contests the authority of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to regulate how nursing homes handle disputes, saying that authority lies solely with Congress. On Monday, a federal district court granted the injunction, even as it acknowledged that \"nursing home arbitration litigation suffers from fundamental defects.\" The reason for granting the injunction, the court explained in its order , is that it believes the new rule represents \"incremental 'creep' of federal agency authority\" \u2014 in this case the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \u2014 \"beyond that envisioned by the U.S. Constitution.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

USA TODAY A screenshot of Facebook's voting plan feature. (Photo: Facebook) Your social media accounts can do more than serve as a vessel for sharing baby pics or crazy videos. They can also help you prepare for Tuesday's presidential election. On Tuesday, voters in the U.S. elect a new president. And Internet giants like Google, Facebook and others want to make sure users are ready. If you're completely unprepared for Tuesday, here's a breakdown of what some tech giants offer to guide you through the 2016 Election. GOOGLE What better way for Google to point users to election resources than devoting its search logo to politics? The doodle \u2014 which features cartoonish versions of the logo's letters holding \"Vote\" signs \u2014 will help users find out the location of their polling place, as well as a chance to check out their local ballot. There's also information on how to vote . One important note: in order to view this information, you'll need to type in your home address. Media jostles for viewers, relevancy with election night livestreams FACEBOOK The social network lets users create their own voting plan , checking out the official ballot and locating their polling place. Each candidate for all races includes an About section where users can learn about the candidate's positions on specific issues, recent endorsements and links to each candidate's official website. For local details, you need to include your address. Once your plan is ready, you can email it to yourself to have an extra copy, as well as encourage your friends to build out their own election itineraries. What's on your ballot? Facebook will show you TWITTER No surprise here, but you can discover details on how to prep for the election with a tweet. Twitter has its own Government account, @gov , that will respond to users through direct message. Once you input your address, the account will spit out polling place information and details on the local ballot. Since it's done through DM, the conversation (as well as your address) won't be made public. TINDER Not even the election could escape the \"Swipe Right\" era. The dating app will \"match\" users with the ideal candidate through a campaign called Swipe the Vote . Users are presented with a series of issues and will swipe left or right depending on their answer. Tinder will then determine whether your views match best with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton or Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. A great option if you're among the undecided voters. Trump vs. Clinton: how the rivals rank on Twitter, Facebook, more FOURSQUARE Not only will the search-and-discovery app help you find where to vote , you can also look up recommended places to eat or catch a cup of coffee.

By Jenna Johnson November 7 at 6:00 AM Follow @wpjenna Donald Trump greets supporters before speaking at the state fair in Oklahoma City on Sept. 25, 2015. (J. Pat Carter/Associated Press) On Sept. 25 last year, several thousand people gathered on a Friday night around a bandshell at the Great State Fair of Oklahoma for what felt like a rock concert. The opening acts included a live bald eagle named Uncle Sam, a young singer who belted out pop covers and a fiddler. The audience included an Elvis impersonator, a bearded member of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d family and a group of young Democrats from a nearby college who couldn\u2019t stop themselves from dancing along with the crowd. And then there was the featured act: Donald Trump. For 50 minutes, the unlikely Republican presidential candidate ordered journalists to pan the sprawling crowd with their cameras, mocked 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, imitated political pundits, bragged about his poll numbers, plugged an upcoming \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview and promised that he would make the country wealthy again. He vowed to self-fund his campaign, bully U.S. companies that try to move to Mexico, let Russia handle the Islamic State terrorist group and get rid of birthright citizenship for \u201canchor babies.\u201d The audience pulsed with laughter, cheers and chants of his name. Why were they there? Political pundits had said for months that it was just for the show, while Trump insisted that he had sparked a political movement. He was right. Standing toward the back that night was Charlie Bevers, a retired social studies teacher in his 60s from Moore, Okla., who said he was increasingly frustrated by what he viewed as the federal government having little respect for the U.S. Constitution. \u201cAt first, when he said he was going to run, I thought it was a joke. When he got out there and did his \u2018Trumpisms,\u2019 I listened because I thought it was funny,\u201d Bevers said that night. \u201cThen I realized he was saying what I want to hear.\u201d Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump spoke about his personal wealth, China, Secretary of State John F. Kerry's bike accident and more in his announcement that he would be running for president. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) It was a sentiment that I would hear again and again over the next year, as I followed Trump to more than 170 rallies in 35 states and talked with thousands of his supporters. The first question I usually asked: Why do you like him? The answers were nearly always the same: He\u2019s saying what I\u2019m saying, thinking, feeling or wanting to hear. He\u2019s not a politician and not part of a corrupt system. He\u2019s honest and speaks his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. And he\u2019s tough. [ \u2018Finally. Someone who thinks like me.\u2019 ] Plus, Trump told his supporters that it was okay to blame their financial problems on undocumented immigrants and the Chinese, that it was okay to be fearful of Muslims and those who don\u2019t speak English, that it was okay to punch back at Black Lives Matter activists, that it was okay to hate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In those early days, Trump had no Secret Service protection and nothing to lose. He took kids on rides in his helicopter in Iowa and stopped by a high school homecoming. There were no fundraisers, no sprawling staff, no teleprompters, no one telling him no. He held rallies in struggling former industrial towns with low median incomes and high rates of anger \u2014 and thousands showed up. The rally in Oklahoma foreshadowed what would come. There was the crowd \u2014 loud and adoring, no matter what Trump said or did or what might be revealed about his past. There was the palpable outrage, the sharing of conspiracy theories, the mob mentality. \u201cPick up your pitchfork!\u201d a local politician shouted, firing up the crowd before Trump arrived. \u201cFollow our next commander in chief! Join the Trump brigade and take back America once and for all!\u201d And there was the candidate, basking in the glow. \u201cNo matter where I go, we have these incredible crowds,\u201d Trump said that night. \u201cSomething is happening that is amazing. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d Trump gestures to the cameras while greeting supporters at a campaign rally in Worcester, Mass., on Nov. 18, 2015. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Nov. 18, 2015: Worcester, Mass. On a Wednesday night in mid-November, more than 12,000 Trump supporters and a small group of protesters gathered at an arena in downtown Worcester, a city with many more registered Democrats than Republicans. [ Nine things that happened during Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Worcester ] Generations ago, waves of immigrants moved here to work in textile factories, many of which closed decades ago. The town has tried to reinvent itself as a biotech and health-care hub. Although less than 70\u00a0percent of Worcester is white, it seemed like nearly 100\u00a0percent of Trump\u2019s crowd that night was. Earlier that month, Trump received Secret Service protection, a sign of just how far he and his movement had come. Photos of the packed arena in a blue town in a blue state would stun those who were convinced that at any moment, Trump would implode and drop out, allowing them to resume the traditional process of selecting a nominee. Sitting close to the stage were Tom and Sandy Morrissey, who drove in from Rhode Island and spoke longingly of the days when the nation was, in their eyes, a better place. \u201cWhen I grew up in Miami, it was English-speaking and now 75\u00a0percent of the households are non-English-speaking,\u201d said Tom Morrissey, a Vietnam War veteran in his late 60s wearing a red Trump \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. \u201cAnd people say they like to go to Miami because they like to go down there for the Cuban music. Well, I love Cuban music \u2014 I like to go to Cuba for Cuban music.\u201d \u201cI want my home town back,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd you can call me a racist or whatever.\u201d The Morrisseys said they once tried to buy a get-well card in a Miami convenience store but there were no options in English. Another time they went into a bakery and, they said, the woman working there refused to sell them pastries unless they ordered in Spanish. \u201cThey would not serve us,\u201d Sandy Morrissey said. \u201cThat\u2019s how bold people have gotten because they can be bold. That\u2019s the only reason why.\u201d \u201cSo if you want that to happen to this whole nation,\u201d Tom Morrissey said, \u201cyou go ahead and vote for Hillary.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know the truth,\u201d Sandy Morrissey added later. \u201cI don\u2019t think people care \u2014 and I think God has withheld his judgment on America. We are in deep trouble. This is not the America I knew as a child. It just isn\u2019t. And I feel bad about that.\u201d On the stage that night, Trump marveled at the crowd. \u201cLook at the people pouring in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been a movement. No matter where I go \u2014 and I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s for me. It\u2019s for me, I guess, a little bit. It\u2019s for the message.\u201d Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has found a groove for his campaign rallies \u2014 poll numbers, protesters, Vladi\u00admir Putin, and of course, making America great again. Here we break down a rally on Dec 21 into the required parts. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) Dec. 21, 2015: Grand Rapids, Mich. A few days before Christmas, Trump traveled to an aging arena in Grand Rapids on a cold, dark, rainy night. As traffic backed up, some parked near the railroad tracks. Generations ago, the city was known for its furniture factories that have mostly closed, although the economy here has been rapidly growing the past few years. The rally felt like a Christmas party. The stage was decorated with huge wreaths and a red \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d sign written in elegant script. \u201cSanta Claus is Coming to Town\u201d blared. Many in the crowd said they couldn\u2019t wait for the country to again say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d under President Trump. Sitting near the top of the bleachers was Kevin Steinke, a self-employed consultant in his 50s from a nearby suburb. He and his wife, a part-time music teacher, have two teenage sons, and they feel as though they are financially stuck in place, maybe falling behind. It had become difficult for Steinke to find clients, and he thought about once again working for a company instead of for himself \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to get hired over 50, he said. Sitting with his sons, he said the country needs a chief executive more than a \u201cpolitician in chief\u201d \u2014 someone who can cut government bloat without destroying the government, who can ease taxes without destroying schools, who can get rid of regulations without wiping them all out. \u201cPeople are getting frustrated by the fact that we don\u2019t seem like we\u2019re getting anywhere as a nation,\u201d Steinke said. \u201cA lot of us feel like we\u2019re going backward.\u201d Steinke has always been a Republican and has always voted for Republicans, and he doesn\u2019t understand why the GOP continues to allow the Affordable Care Act to stand. He\u2019s glad the party received a much-needed jolt from an outsider. \u201cIt\u2019s causing some of the establishment people to panic,\u201d he said, \u201cand I kind of like that.\u201d On stage that night, the Republican front-runner triumphantly declared: \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a silent majority anymore, folks. This is a very, very aggressive, very, very noisy, loud majority. Very, very noisy. Very, very loud.\u201d Trump acknowledges photographers after speaking at a campaign rally in Baton Rouge on Feb. 11. (Gerald Herbert/Associated Press) Feb. 11, 2016: Baton Rouge Ten days after losing the Iowa caucuses and two days after winning the New Hampshire primary \u2014 his first ballot victory \u2014 Trump traveled to an arena in Louisiana\u2019s capital that pulsated with gleeful energy matching his new burst of momentum. [ The target on Trump grows larger ] The South was home to Trump\u2019s biggest and rowdiest crowds, and a pre-rally speaker noted that the candidate didn\u2019t have a \u201cSouthern nickname,\u201d dubbing him \u201cDonny John.\u201d Sitting near the stage were Matthew Stirling and Darrin Hahn, brothers-in-law who live just outside town and hustle for every dollar they make. Stirling kept apologizing for Hahn\u2019s bad language. Stirling, then 40, said he installs security fences and had seen a huge spike in business because so many people \u201cfeel pretty damn unsafe.\u201d Hahn, then 45, is a commercial electrician. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go drum it up,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go drum up work, then I\u2019ve got 11 guys who don\u2019t work the next day, so I constantly have to go, literally, business to business.\u201d And that\u2019s why they like Trump. He hustles, just like them. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular guy,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cHe eats Wendy\u2019s on his plane.\u201d \u201cBut he owns a plane!\u201d I responded. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump documented the changes he made to his 757 jet in a 2011 video on his YouTube channel. (Donald Trump/YouTube) I was endlessly surprised that people said they related to Trump \u2014 who grew up wealthy, attended boarding school, received a $1\u00a0million loan from his father as a young man and who lives in a gold and marble tower in Manhattan with his third wife, a former model. He is a germaphobe who doesn\u2019t like shaking hands and will drink soda only from a sealed can or bottle. Backstage at a rally in New Hampshire in January, I asked Trump to tell me about one interaction he had with a supporter that stuck with him \u2014 and he called his campaign manager over to answer the question. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Hahn said, shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019s actually out there and hustled it and built it.\u201d Said Stirling: \u201cHe can come over to my house, and I will boil him crawfish. He can land his plane in the cul-de-sac. I mean, if he wants to go hang out with all of those VIP donors, that\u2019s fine. But come hang out with a real hard-working American man. I\u2019ll buy his beer, I\u2019ll buy him Wendy\u2019s, I\u2019ll boil his crawfish. Don\u2019t matter.\u201d Trump waves to the crowd as he arrives at a rally at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington on Aug. 9. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) Aug. 9, 2016: Wilmington, N.C. It was early August on the North Carolina coast, and it was miserably hot. Hundreds of people were lined up outside a small coli\u00adseum at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. [ From Trump\u2019s controversial words, a pattern: Outrage, headlines and then denial ] In June, after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump attacked a federal judge assigned to one of his civil cases, saying he was unable to be impartial because his parents were born in Mexico. In July, after becoming the nominee, Trump attacked the Muslim American parents of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq, saying they had no right to question him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention. In the spring, Trump had appeared poised to topple Clinton. Now, it seemed as though the race was over. Instead of focusing on the messages that resonated with Americans, he was obsessed with defending himself. Yet his most avid supporters were still standing with him, still waiting hours to see him. I was there with them, fanning myself with a reporter\u2019s notebook and sweating off my sunscreen. In June, Trump banned The Washington Post from covering his events, although reporters could attend most of his rallies by entering with the general public. For three months, I attended his gatherings like his fans did \u2014 signing up for a free ticket online, arriving to venues hours early and waiting in line. That gave me a direct look at the chronic disorganization of Trump\u2019s campaign. He had sparked a movement, but his campaign seemed to be doing little to harness it. The lines were often long, sometimes stretching more than half a mile. Food and water were rarely available, and neither were separate entrances for the elderly or the disabled. Occasionally, local Republican organizers would sign people up to vote and recruit volunteers, but the campaign never did. At many political rallies \u2014 including those of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Clinton\u2019s Democratic primary challenger \u2014 campaign staff members count off the line and let supporters at a certain point know that there is no chance they will get inside. This never happened as I waited. Those around me assumed that if they had a ticket, they would get in. Either the campaign was too disorganized to grant this kindness to its most devoted supporters \u2014 or, as I came to suspect, they cared more about creating a spectacle for reporters to document and for Trump to point to as proof of his broad support. In a rare move ahead of the Wilmington rally, the campaign limited the number of tickets to 5,800 \u2014 although no one was checking tickets at the door. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d a retiree said when she heard the news from those around her, tears welling up in her eyes. (She was one of the last people admitted.) Frustration grew as the start time neared. As the Trump supporters waited, protesters on the other side of the street behind a barricade screamed at them. A young woman yelled out Bible verses while holding a pink sign that read, \u201cJesus was a socialist.\u201d A guy in a banana costume quietly held a sign reading, \u201cThis s--- is bananas.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters were hot and tired, and now they were being attacked. Many yelled back. \u201cYour food stamps are in the mail!\u201d \u201cDeport Obama!\u201d Soon the venue was filled and workers closed the doors. There were disappointed groans, but I couldn\u2019t find anyone who blamed Trump. After all, they said, it\u2019s not his fault that he\u2019s so popular. People hung around for a few minutes, not sure what to do. Some went back to their cars. Others made an angry beeline for the protesters. Inside, Trump bragged about the \u201cthousands of people outside that can\u2019t get in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the messenger,\u201d Trump said, trying to make this movement about more than just him, \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you what, the message is the right message.\u201d Supporters packed the Pier Park Amphitheater in Panama City Beach, Fla., for Trump\u2019s Oct. 11 rally. (Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images) Oct. 11, 2016: Panama City Beach, Fla. In early October, Trump traveled to the Florida Panhandle, one of his hotbeds of support. More than 8,000 showed up at an outdoor rally on the water, a much-needed confidence boost for Trump. He had just apologized for recorded comments revealed by The Washington Post of him bragging in 2005 about sexually assaulting women, and faced accusations from a growing number of women that he had forced himself on them. Leaders of the party were distancing themselves, resigned to a loss of the White House but hoping to keep as many seats as possible in Congress. [ For Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, this election is about him, not the GOP ] \u201cPaul Ryan\u2019s an idiot,\u201d said Marla Clark, 52, a legal assistant at a private law firm who lives in Panama City, referring to the House speaker. \u201cThey need to get rid of the parties. Everybody needs to be independent because when the Republican Party doesn\u2019t stand by their own people, then they don\u2019t need to have a party. The parties are nothing but a problem. That was great in my parents\u2019 generation, but in this generation?\u201d She was also mad at Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for not standing more firmly with Trump when controversy hit. (\u201cDoes an officer leave his canine behind? No.\u201d) She was mad at those offended by Trump\u2019s crude comments. (\u201cThey\u2019ve never spewed anything nasty out of their mouth?\u201d) She was mad at Clinton, the \u201crigged system\u201d and the media. (\u201cThey\u2019re desperate.\u201d) And she was even a little mad at Trump. \u201cI was worried that he gets angry too fast,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried that he doesn\u2019t think about what he says. And there have been many times where I\u2019m like: I want him for president but his mouth does tend to just get out of line once in a while.\u201d She wants Trump to win, and she was still hopeful he could \u2014 as long as people realized how bad things have gotten and how much worse they could still get. \u201cI\u2019m truly scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just scared for the world. I\u2019m scared for the United States. I really am.\u201d Trump at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Oct. 31. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) Oct. 31, 2016: Grand Rapids, Mich. Eight days before the election, Trump returned to the aging arena in Grand Rapids. It was Halloween morning, and his campaign decorated the stage with pumpkins, buckets of crimson mums and bales of hay. \u201cMonster Mash\u201d and other Halloween songs blared. The audience included Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, Lady Liberty and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in an orange jumpsuit. Sitting near the top of the bleachers for that afternoon rally was Robert Donley, 74, who retired from IBM in 1999, drove a commercial truck for five years, and now splits his time between Michigan and Arizona. For most of his life he was a Democrat, but he said he began voting for Republicans after President Bill Clinton was caught lying about having an affair with a young intern. He likes that Trump wants to go after companies that exploit workers or move jobs overseas. He agrees with Trump on cracking down on illegal immigration but is conflicted on the nominee proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country, although he doesn\u2019t have a better idea. He likes that Trump doesn\u2019t dwell too much on social issues such as same-sex marriage. But he doubts that Trump will win. Instead of hammering on the messages that resonate with voters like him \u2014 job creation, trade, taxes and the economy \u2014 Trump obsessed over his own personal feuds. Donley was stunned when Trump attacked the Hispanic judge, calling it \u201clow-class, lowbrow.\u201d But Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server was once again in the news, and Trump seemed to have one last opening. \u201cIt opens a window, but the problem with Donald \u2014 I mean, he can turn a good thing into a defeat really fast with his mouth,\u201d Donley said. On the stage that day, Trump insisted that he would win. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a movement. This is like a great movement that the whole world is talking about,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd honestly you\u2019ll never have this chance; in four years, I don\u2019t care who it is that runs, you\u2019re never gonna have this chance. So you have to get out and vote. Vote with all of your heart, vote with all of your soul, because this is it.\u201d 1 of 55 ",

    "text": "Donald Trump's Possible Paths to Victory More broadly, large early turnout by Hispanics helps explain why a traditionally-Republican state like Arizona is being contested as a battleground, McDonald said. \u201cIf we\u2019re seeing these numbers in Florida,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s likely we\u2019re seeing them elsewhere in the country.\u201d Florida is one of the closest toss ups, according to the most recent data. The latest Quinnipiac University poll, which was released this morning, has Clinton with 46 percent of the vote among likely voters and Trump with 45 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson had 2 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 1 percent, the survey said. The top of that poll has remained unchanged since the same time last week. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook is counting on the uptick in early voting as an indication of a strong base for the Democratic nominee heading into tomorrow. \u201cWhat I am paying very close attention to are those early voting numbers,\u201d Mook said on \u201c Good Morning America .\u201d \u201cWe saw just eye popping turnout in Florida over the last two days, particularly in our strongholds of southern Florida, North Carolina and elsewhere so we're very encouraged, very positive.\u201d Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images People line up to vote at an early voting polling centre in Miami, Florida on Nov. 3, 2016. \u201cI think if Secretary Clinton does win this election, and we expect her to do so, it will in part be because of enormous turnout in the Latino community but also the Asian American community. There's really a Clinton coalition that has formed of women, Latinos, Asian Americans and we're really seeing turnout at very record levels,\u201d he said. Early voting by African-Americans in Florida has also seen an uptick compared to 2012, even though it got off to a slower start . While North Carolina has seen a relatively lower turnout by African-Americans compared to the 2012 early vote, McDonald noted that has not been the case in Florida and other states that publish early vote totals by race. \u201cWhatever happened in North Carolina with African Americans we\u2019re not seeing it in Florida, we\u2019re not seeing it happen in Georgia, we\u2019re not seeing it happen in Louisiana,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whatever happened there it seems to be North Carolina-specific.\u201d Trump said in Sarasota Monday morning that African-Americans voting early in Florida are voting for him. He also touted his primary finish in the state during a rally in Tampa Saturday. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on their final campaign swings before Election Day. (Photo: AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 In the race for president of the United States, everyone's vote counts. But some count more than others. That fact of American democracy is never more obvious on Election Day, when the president and vice president are elected\u00a0state-by-state under systems that change from county-by-county or even precinct-by-precinct. By the end of the night, more than 100 million individual voting decisions will be distilled into the only votes that count: the 538 votes in the Electoral College . The first candidate to 270 wins. Beyond the red states and blue states, voters will be segmented into bellwether counties, in-person voters and absentee ballots, and dozens of demographic groups: men and women, the more\u00a0and less educated, Baby Boomers and Millennials, Catholics and Jews, African-Americans and Hispanics, union and non-union households. For savvy election watchers, understanding those differences can send signals about who's winning and whose losing even before the last vote is cast. The Associated Press and the television networks have traditionally used exit polling to help quickly \"call\" states for one side or another. But as more states allow greater access to early voting, it's also possible for significant numbers of votes \u2014 more than half in some states\u00a0\u2014 to be counted and reported immediately after the polls close. What time do polls open and close in each state on Election Day? With the results in most states seemingly predetermined, the race comes down to a handful of \"swing states\" \u2014 places like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Nevada. Most analysts agree that Donald Trump needs more of those states than Hillary Clinton does. But the president isn't the only federal office on the ballot. The 2010 Tea Party surge swept in a class of Republican senators now defending their seats. Twenty-four of the 34\u00a0Senate seats are being defended by Republicans, and Democrats only need to win five of them to regain control of the Senate\u00a0\u2014 or just four if Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine is presiding. Here's a guide to watching the returns: 5 a.m. ET Every state has different poll opening and closing times, but in Vermont the polls can open as early as 5 a.m. And almost as soon as poll workers show up, there will almost certainly be problems reported. Locked polling places. Long lines. Power outages. Ballot shortages. Those are all problems that can bedevil election officials even in a less contentious\u00a0election year. Social media and growing distrust of the election system will shine a brighter light on them this year. And given the acrimony of 2016 \u2014 and Trump's charges that the election will be \"rigged\"\u00a0\u2014 both sides will be carefully watching to make sure elections are conducted peacefully and fairly. 6 p.m. ET Polls close in most of Indiana and Kentucky. Senate race\u00a0to watch: Democratic hopes to win the Senate could depend on a comeback by Democratic former senator Evan Bayh, scion of an\u00a0Indiana political family.\u00a0Bayh has been in a tight race with GOP Rep. Todd Young for the seat now occupied by retiring Sen. Dan Coats. 7 p.m. ET Polls close in Georgia, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, most of Florida,\u00a0and the western parts of Indiana and\u00a0Kentucky. Battlegrounds: Florida is one of the first states with polls to close,\u00a0and \u2014 if recent elections are any guide \u2014\u00a0will be one of the last states to be called. That means election watchers could have one eye on the Sunshine State for much of the night. But early voting could give some early indications: As of Sunday, 6.2 million voters had already cast ballots. That's nearly half the number of registered voters, and three-quarters of the number voting in 2012. Registered Democrats had cast 32,528 more votes than registered Republicans, but that gap is narrower than it was in 2012. Here's why Donald Trump (almost certainly) can't win without Florida Hillsborough County, home of Tampa, has the ethnic and economic diversity to make it a near-perfect microcosm, with a mix of longtime residents and snowbirds from other swing states like Michigan and Ohio.\u00a0\u201cThat diversity in geography and diversity in demographics makes Hillsborough County such a purple county,\" said\u00a0Ana Cruz, the former head of the\u00a0Florida Democratic Party. Hillsborough is \"a microcosm of what this battleground state of Florida represents.\" By all rights, Georgia shouldn't be in play; it hasn't gone Democratic since Bill Clinton in 1992. Trump has a healthy lead in recent polls, so a Clinton win \u2014 or even a close race \u2014 could signal trouble for Trump later on.\u00a0One reason: It would likely signal a motivated African-American turnout, which is going overwhelmingly for Clinton. An election official hands out stickers to encourage early voting in Atlanta on Oct. 17, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Erik S. Lesser, European Pressphoto Agency) 7:30 p.m. ET Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. Battlegrounds:\u00a0Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. It's not as important as it was a decade ago, but it's still more important to Trump as it is to Clinton. No Republican has won the White House without it. And on paper, it should be fertile ground for Trump's message: It has a high proportion of white voters without a college degree, and it's been buffeted by job losses caused by globalization. Reviving Rust Belt city in Ohio not convinced by Donald Trump's message Look to swing counties like Stark, Ross and Clark as bellwethers. Ottawa County, on Lake Erie, has predicted the national winner every year since 1964. But don't call the state until Cleveland vote comes in. Cuyahoga County often reports its votes late, and its\u00a0high concentration of true-blue Democratic voters can cancel out Trump wins downstate. \"I always feel like the Republican generally leads in the middle portion of the night, and then we wait and see if what happens in Cuyahoga,\" said Kyle Kondik, author of\u00a0 The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President . North Carolina is enjoying\u00a0\u2014 if that's the right word\u00a0\u2014 its newfound status as a swing state. In 2008, President Obama was the first Democrat to win it since 1976, but he lost it to Republican Mitt Romney four years later. It's gotten plenty of attention from both campaigns\u00a0\u2014 and from Obama, who made three stops there in the last week of the campaign. At the same time, the state has been roiled by\u00a0debates on transgender bathrooms and voting rights. The African-American turnout was key to Obama's 2008 victory and is crucial for Clinton as well. \"If she doesn\u2019t have a decent showing by black voters, then it makes it that much harder to make the state flip to blue,\"\u00a0 said Mike Bitzer , a political scientist at\u00a0Catawba College. Early voting is a good sign of whether the Clinton campaign has been successful in getting those voters to the polls; the first returns reported after the polls close could be revealing. Senate race\u00a0to watch: Democrat Deborah Ross, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, is challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr in the Tar Heel State. Burr made national headlines in the final days with comments about putting a bull's-eye on Clinton and promising to block Supreme Court nominees for another four years. A win by Democratic Senate challenger Deborah Ross in North Carolina could signal a change in Senate control. \u00a0(Photo: Gerry Broome, AP) 8 p.m. ET Polls close in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, most of Kansas,\u00a0Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, most of Michigan,\u00a0Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and\u00a0Rhode Island, most of Texas, eastern Tennessee\u00a0and the Florida panhandle. Battlegrounds:\u00a0Pennsylvania is so important to Democrats that Clinton decided to end her campaign there with a Philadelphia rally that brought her heaviest hitters\u00a0\u2014 the president and first lady\u00a0\u2014 back to the city where she was nominated. A big turnout in Pennsylvania is essential for her, but much of the attention will be in the suburban \"collar counties\":\u00a0Bucks, Chester, Delaware and\u00a0Montgomery. The moderate Republican voters there are usually a counterbalance to the urban Democrats, but this year could be different. A suburban tide against Trump could sink his election bid \"In Donald Trump, you have a perfect storm of a candidate in terms of pressing buttons to sending white, college-educated voters, particularly women, in the other direction,\" said\u00a0Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. Part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula is on Central time, so polls there close an hour later. But networks could call the state earlier based on exit polls in the Eastern time zone. Turnout in Detroit's Wayne County will be a key indicator of Clinton's support among African-Americans, but a better bellwether might be Macomb County, just north of 8 Mile Road. It's historically been ground zero for Reagan Democrats\u00a0and could indicate whether Trump's anti-trade, anti-immigration message swings enough union members to close the gap. Trump, Clinton each face challenges courting African-American vote in Detroit Maine is a curiosity, because it's one of two states (Nebraska is the other) that splits its electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 giving Trump a chance to pick up a spare vote in Maine's 2nd\u00a0district. New Hampshire voters have seen these candidates up close more than anyone else, and Trump has surged in the polls there in recent weeks. A Trump win may not\u00a0be decisive\u00a0\u2014 it has just four electoral votes\u00a0\u2014 but it could be a signal of whether Trump's rebound is for real . Senate races to watch: In Missouri,\u00a0GOP Sen. Roy Blunt faces a surprisingly strong challenger in Democratic Army veteran Jason Kander. In New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan is taking on GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte in a race dominated by the candidates' relationship to the presidential candidates. And in Pennsylvania, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is fending off a challenge from Katie McGinty, a former environmental protection official with close ties to Clinton and Obama. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and Democratic challenger Katie McGinty take part in a debate in Philadelphia on Oct. 24, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) Polls close in Arkansas. 9 p.m. ET Polls close in Arizona, Colorado, western Kansas,\u00a0Louisiana, the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Minnesota, eastern Nebraska, New Mexico,\u00a0New York,\u00a0western South Dakota the western panhandle of Texas,\u00a0Wisconsin and Wyoming. Battlegrounds:\u00a0In a normal election year, Arizona would be safely in the Republican column. The state has gone Democratic just once since 1948, and that was in the three-way race in 1996 when Reform Party candidate Ross Perot siphoned off Republican votes. While an Arizona Republic poll three weeks ago showed Clinton up by 5 percentage points, more recent polls have favored Trump. But those poll results are based largely on models that show that Hispanic voters are historically underrepresented in voter turnout. And Democrats are hoping that Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric will drive Latinos to the polls.\u00a0Exit polls will show whether that's happening. Trump supporters arrive at a rally in Phoenix on Oct. 29, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Caitlin O'Hara, AFP/Getty Images) Obama carried Colorado twice, moving it from purple to blue on most electoral maps, and Clinton leads in most recent polls. And its demographics work against Trump: It's younger, more educated and more Hispanic than the country at large. But Trump visited the state Saturday night ,\u00a0and GOP officials say they've pulled ahead on mail-in votes submitted by Republican voters. \"I don't think people are talking about it today, but we're 1,700\u00a0votes ahead in an all mail-in state in\u00a0Colorado\u00a0today. It is a jump ball in\u00a0Colorado,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on ABC's This Week. That's a change from a week ago, when Trump visited the state and claimed there were\u00a0\"real problems with ballots being sent\" and encouraged supporters to vote in person. In New Mexico, Clinton has had a consistent lead in the polls, with the latest\u00a0Albuquerque Journal poll showing her leading, 45% to 40%. So the most interesting thing to watch may be how well former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson does. The Libertarian candidate once hoped to play spoiler here, but his support has been cut to 11% from his high-water mark of 24% in September. 10 p.m. ET Polls close in southern Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Nevada,\u00a0eastern North Dakota, far eastern Oregon and Utah. Battlegrounds:\u00a0Once considered competitive, Iowa seems to be trending in Trump's direction. A Des Moines Register poll published Sunday showed him up by 7 percentage points. \u201cThe bigger surprise on election night would be if he lost Iowa, not that he won it,\u201d\u00a0said Amy Walter, national editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t afford to lose Iowa, and Hillary Clinton can.\u201d Like Colorado, Nevada is another state where the two main sources of predictive data\u00a0\u2014 polls and early votes\u00a0\u2014 are trending in opposite directions. Trump seems to have a slight lead in recent polls, but a surge of early ballots cast by registered Democrats would seem to favor Clinton. Trump needs crossover and independent votes\u00a0\u2014 and big turnout by Republicans on Election Day\u00a0\u2014 to overcome a 40,000-ballot early-vote advantage by registered Democrats. But Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., told a Trump rally in Reno on Saturday that the early voting numbers fail to take into account independent voters, who he said will break toward Trump on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cGuess what, the history in Nevada is Election Day is elephant day. Election Day is independent day,\" he said. Also closely watched will be the fate of Utah's six electoral votes, with recent polls showing insurgent conservative Evan McMullin within striking distance of Donald Trump. McMullin would be the first third-party candidate to win electoral votes since George Wallace in 1968 \u2014 and those are electoral votes Trump needs. Senate race to watch: The retirement of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid leaves an open seat in Nevada. Hoping to fill it are\u00a0Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic former state attorney general, and GOP Rep. Joe Heck. Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto shakes hands with GOP Rep. Joe Heck after the Nevada Senate debate on Oct. 14, 2016, in North Las Vegas. \u00a0(Photo: Erik Verduzco, AP) Polls close in California, Hawaii, northern Idaho, western North Dakota, most of Oregon and Washington. 12 midnight ET Polls close in most of Alaska. 1 a.m. ET Polls close in half the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.

Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images A pipeline replica sign in Cushing, Okla., in 2015. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images A magnitude 5.0 earthquake shook central Oklahoma on Sunday evening, damaging several buildings. Multiple aftershocks also hit the area, the U.S. Geological Survey says. The quake epicenter was about a mile west of the town of Cushing, the largest commercial crude oil storage center in North America and the southern terminus of the Keystone pipeline . On Monday, public schools in Cushing were closed to assess damage, and the school district said in a statement on Facebook that two schools had ceiling tiles down and other \"cosmetic damage.\" Damages in #Cushing from 5.0 #earthquake last night. Many buildings damaged, several blocks closed. @koconews pic.twitter.com/vIE7rvAwLI \u2014 Russell  Jones (@KOCORussell) November 7, 2016 No one was taken to the hospital with injuries from the quake, according to local television station News9 , and Cushing city officials said gas leaks caused by the shaking were contained. A spokesperson for Magellan Midstream Partners, which operates pipelines and oil storage facilities in and around Cushing, said the company had shut down its operations there to \"check the integrity of our assets.\" \"We did not encounter any damage associated with [the earthquake],\" he wrote in an email, saying the company expects to resume normal operations on Tuesday. Article continues after sponsorship This is not the first significant earthquake to damage central Oklahoma. The governor declared a state of emergency in September after a magnitude 5.3 temblor. As we have reported, the USGS announced earlier this year that pumping wastewater underground during oil and gas production has caused parts of Oklahoma and Texas to be as seismically active as parts of California. As NPR reported last year , the earthquakes could damage oil storage tanks and pipelines: \"This little patch of prairie in northwestern Oklahoma is one of the most important places in the U.S. energy market. ... \"The massive hub in Cushing, where domestic crude oil enters the energy market, is dotted with hundreds of airplane hangar-size tanks that hold an estimated 54 million barrels of oil. \"No earthquake damage has been reported \u2014 yet. But the possibility is a matter of national security. \" 'I have had conversations with Homeland Security. They're concerned about the tanks mostly,' says Daniel McNamara, a U.S. Geological Survey research geophysicist.\" Last year, Reuters reported that one company with storage facilities in Cushing, Phillips 66, had changed its protocols to reflect the increased earthquake activity. The changes include new plans for \"inspecting the health of crude tanks, potentially halting operations after temblors and monitoring quake alerts.\" State regulators in Oklahoma have also tried to reduce the risk of future earthquakes by shutting down or reducing activity at wastewater wells in the area.

Brent Baughman/NPR hide caption toggle caption Giant oil tanks like these stretch for miles in Cushing, seen in 2012. Brent Baughman/NPR Energy companies produce toxic wastewater during oil and gas production. To keep it from contaminating drinking water near the surface, they inject the wastewater into deep disposal wells, which can put pressure on faults in the earth's crust, causing them to slip. The slipping can cause an earthquake. After a series of earthquakes near Cushing, Oklahoma regulators ordered oil companies in 2015 to shut down all disposal wells within 3 miles of the center of the quake activity and reduced the volume of wastewater being injected into the earth by 25 percent for a radius between 3 and 6 miles from the center. In all, the earthquakes led to changes in the operation of 13 wastewater wells. Last week , the agency in charge of regulating the state's oil and gas industries, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, shut down more wastewater wells north of Cushing, after a magnitude 4.3 earthquake shook the town of Pawnee.

Caption The GOP presidential nominee is pressing his case ahead of Election Day. Nov. 7, 2016\u00a0 Donald Trump checks his watch as he speaks during a campaign event that he arrived at after midnight at Loudoun Fairgrounds in Leesburg, Va. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cDear Americans.\u201d The poster that started to widely circulate on social media during the weekend had no particular sender, except for \u201cthe people of Germany.\u201d Its message was a clear one: Don't elect Donald Trump, or else you will have your own Adolf Hitler. \u201cGo ahead, vote for the guy with the loud voice who hates minorities, threatens to imprison his opponents, doesn't give a f--- about democracy, and claims he alone can fix everything. What could possibly go wrong? Good luck,\u201d read the sign with the hashtag #BeenThereDoneThat. Sunday's message, supposedly signed by \u201cthe people of Germany,\u201d went viral within hours. But did it really\u00a0capture what\u00a0Germans really think of\u00a0such comparisons? The answer may be: yes, and no. Or \u201cJein,\u201d as Germans would say. [ Why the West\u2019s far-right \u2014 and Trump supporters \u2014 are still obsessed with an ancient battle ] In contemporary Germany,\u00a0Hitler comparisons are rarely taken lightly. \u201cHitler comparisons are far less frequent in German public life than they are elsewhere in Europe, the U.S., or Israel,\u201d explained German historian Thomas Weber in an emailed response. Weber , a professor at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, has published numerous books on Hitler and Germany's Nazi-past. \u201cIf you thus run a Google news search in German for \u2018Hitler comparisons Trump\u2019 almost all hits refer to articles that report for those comparisons having been made in the U.S. or elsewhere rather than in Germany,\u201d he said. According to him, there are two reasons for Germans' reluctance to use Hitler comparisons.\u00a0\u201cFor Germans Adolf Hitler is the symbol for all the crimes their country has committed,\u201d Weber wrote. \u201cNobody can ever be as evil as Hitler was,\u201d common thinking in the country goes. \u201cGermans are worried that overemphasizing Hitler (while discussing Trump) would appear as apologetic and distract from the responsibility of German elites and ordinary Germans for the crimes of the Third Reich.\u201d Secondly, and consequently, Hitler comparisons are often viewed as the end of a serious factual conversation, and the beginning of an ideological mud-bath. Making such claims can easily turn into an embarrassment, especially for people in higher public office. In 2002, then-Justice Secretary\u00a0Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin was forced out of the German governmental cabinet for comparing George W. Bush to Hitler over his plans to go to war in Iraq.\u00a0 [ After Clinton, Trump\u2019s real enemy is \u2018globalism\u2019 ] But in some cases, even Germans agree that Hitler comparisons are warranted. In\u00a0an interview conducted via Twitter, the author of the letter\u00a0that went viral over the weekend\u00a0defended his comparison Sunday, saying exaggeration was necessary to raise attention in the United States. \u201cOf course it appears arrogant to claim to speak for the whole Germany. Of course it provokes ridicule if a German, of all people, says these things. That's fine. But I just had to say SOMETHING,\u201d explained\u00a0the German author, who published his letter under a\u00a0pseudonym and did not want to give his real name because he feared a negative effects on his business relations. Born in 1972, the man\u00a0said he\u00a0was\u00a0frequently asked during trips abroad why his grandparents had\u00a0not prevented\u00a0Hitler's rise to power. \u201cWhen I traveled outside Germany in the past, I've often been asked how the German people could have fallen for Hitler back in the '30s and '40s. 'How could your people NOT have known?' they often asked. I don't get that question much lately,'\" he\u00a0wrote in a follow-up letter published on Twitter on Sunday. There is no doubt Germans are uneasy about Donald Trump, to say the least. In a poll conducted in July, only 6.3 percent of all Germans said they liked the idea of a Trump presidency. Many say they are shocked\u00a0by Trump's remarks about immigrants, women and his determination to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. In an email to The Washington Post, historian Weber emphasized that Germans widely perceived Trump as unelectable. \u201cThe near consensus indeed is that Trump is a minority-hating lout, who threatens to imprison his opponents, has disdain for democracy, and claims that he alone can fix everything.\u201d [ The ugly history of \u2018L\u00fcgenpresse,\u2019 a Nazi slur shouted at a Trump rally ] Referring to the viral post over the weekend implying that the effects of a Trump presidency would come anywhere close to the repercussion of Hitler's rise to power, Weber expressed skepticism, though. \u201cThis is simply not a sentiment expressed as prominently\u00a0in Germany as it is in the United States.\u201d Other German\u00a0historians have also been more cautious than their U.S. counterparts to make Hitler comparisons. Speaking to Handelsblatt , a business newspaper, political scientist Klaus Schubert said, \u201cTrump is an egomaniac in\u00a0totally different circumstances.\u201d According to Schubert, comparing the economic and political realities in the United States with those in Germany's Weimar Republic that enabled Hitler to take over power leads nowhere. Although his colleague Weber would not necessarily agree with Schubert's assertion that there are no similarities at all, Weber thinks\u00a0that such broader comparisons can have a dangerous effect. \u201cThere is a \u2018crying wolf\u2019 danger of an inflationary use of Hitler comparisons, for instance, that nobody will take Hitler comparisons seriously anymore when they really should and have to be made,\u201d Weber argued. \u201cThe danger also is that people will rally to defend the people who unfairly have been compared to Hitler and feel sorry for them, rather than to figure out what\u2019s wrong with them.\u201d Read more:\u00a0 ",

USA TODAY Minimum wage hikes have boosted the pay of restaurant and retail workers in many states. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) 1134 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 142 COMMENTEMAILMORE Voters in four states on Tuesday will consider ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage, threatening to widen the disparity between the growing number of jurisdictions that have lifted their pay floors and the rest of the country. In Arizona, Colorado and Maine, state hourly minimums would rise to $12 by 2020 from a range of $7.50 to $8.31. In Washington, the pay floor would climb from $9.47 to $13.50 over the next four years. Polls in the four states generally show solid majorities supporting the measures. A sweep would widen the gap between the 29 states \u2014\u00a0with 60% of the U.S. workforce \u2014\u00a0 that now have base wages higher than the federal government\u2019s $7.25 an hour, and the 21 states that remain at the U.S. minimum, according to the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. In the past couple of years, about 20 states and dozens of cities and counties have approved gradual increases in their pay floors through legislation or ballot initiatives as Republicans in Congress have blocked efforts to raise the federal minimum. \u201cThis is about states taking matters into their own hands,\u201d says Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the NELP Action Fund, the group\u2019s policy advocacy arm. Low-paid workers are leading in wage gains About 2 million workers in the four states voting Tuesday would be affected by an increase in their pay floors, according to NELP. Proponents of the measures say higher wages are needed to provide lower- and middle-income households a reasonable standard of living and narrow the yawning divide between those groups and the wealthy. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says the increasing divergence among state minimum wages heightens the need to lift the national pay base. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to win the geographic lottery to get access to a (higher) minimum wage,\u201d he said in an interview. Employers in states at the federal pay floor are at a growing disadvantage as they scramble to attract workers in a tightening labor market with a low 4.9% unemployment rate, Conti says. $15 minimum wage could spread in 2016 But Michael Saltsman, research director for the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry, says, \u201cThe exact opposite is the case,\u201d with businesses drawn to states with lower labor costs. Higher minimum wages, he argues, have prodded some restaurants and retailers to cut staff or close, and to hire older, more experienced employees, closing off opportunities for teenagers and lower-skilled adults. \u201cYou going to make it that much more difficult for people to find jobs at the bottom end of the career ladder,\u201d he says. Still, Americans generally favor a higher minimum wage, according to surveys, and their views could impact key Senate races. A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling for NELP\u2019s action fund showed voters in states such as Missouri and North Carolina switching preferences after learning of Republican Senate candidates\u2019 opposition to raising the minimum wage. Proponents of the hikes at least partly attribute the shift by states to the Fight for $15 campaign that has led fast- food worker strikes across the USA since 2012 and is financed by the Service Employees Union international. Earlier this year, California and New York approved minimum wage increases to $15 an hour by 2022, joining cities such as Seattle and San Francisco. 1134 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 142 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f2MScx ",

    "text": "Robert Durst Pleads Not Guilty to Killing Susan Berman By Lesley Messer Nov 7, 2016, 5:10 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Robert Durst Says He's Not Guilty of Killing Susan Berman 0 Shares Robert Durst appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom today on a murder charge. In a wheelchair and wearing a neck-brace, Durst told the judge that he's not guilty. \"I do want to say here and now, I am not guilty,\" he said. \"I did not kill Susan Berman.\" His next court date was set for Feb. 15. Prosecutors said they will not be seeking the death penalty in the case. The real estate heir, 73, is charged with first-degree murder for allegedly killing Berman in Los Angeles almost 16 years ago. He also faces charges of gun use and lying in wait. Durst's attorney Dick DeGuerin said last year that his client is not guilty of the crimes. \"Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman -- he\u2019s ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial,\" DeGuerin said. Durst was the subject of the 2015 HBO documentary \"The Jinx,\" which focused on the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, the death of his neighbor Morris Black, and Berman's murder. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder in 2003 and was never charged in connection with his wife's disappearance, for which he says he had no involvement. According to investigators, Berman had been scheduled to meet with authorities about Kathleen's disappearance when she was found dead at her Los Angeles home from a gunshot to the head. Durst was arrested just before the finale of \"The Jinx\" aired in March 2015. In that episode, Durst, seemingly unaware that his microphone was on, was heard whispering to himself, \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" Durst has been serving time in a federal prison in Indiana since September, stemming from a plea deal he took regarding a weapons charge in New Orleans, according to The Associated Press. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years and one month behind bars. 0 Shares ",

James Comey, director of the FBI, speaks during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 27, 2016. (Zach Gibson / Bloomberg) Tribune news services Contact Reporter FBI Director James Comey was being honored Monday night by a group whose board includes several people with longtime ties to Donald Trump , including the CEO of the National Enquirer and a convicted felon who goes by the nickname \"Joey No Socks.\" Comey, already criticized over his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation in the final days of the presidential campaign, was accepting the lifetime achievement award from the nonprofit Federal Drug Agents Foundation. The group lists more than three dozen board directors on its website; another was the developer of a troubled Trump-branded tower in Toronto. An FBI spokesman said the foundation provides disability, bereavement and personal crisis support to federal agents and educational and charitable grants. Foundation representatives did not immediately respond to phone and email messages from The Associated Press. The foundation regularly hosts dinners and events honoring law enforcement officials. Past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include Attorney General Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. It was not clear whether Comey \u2014 a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan \u2014 was aware of the board members' ties to Trump, or whether he decided those connections were not consequential given the group's stature with New York law enforcement. But the award and ceremony came as the FBI has been accused by partisans on both the left and right of injecting itself unnecessarily into the presidential race through Comey's statements and updates about the FBI's now-concluded review of Hillary Clinton's email practices. Among the Trump-connected board members is David Pecker, a friend of Trump's and the chief executive of American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer. ",

Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final, frenzied hours of the presidential campaign, offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of must-win states. Accompanied by rock stars, ex-presidents, old friends and their grown children, the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of their visions for the country. Mrs. Clinton, whom polls show leading Mr. Trump, gave a sunny and optimistic summation of her candidacy for the White House as she embarked on a four-state tour on Monday. \u201cTomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,\u201d she told a crowd in Pittsburgh. \u201cOur core values are being tested in this election.\u201d Photo Hillary Clinton campaigned at the University of Pittsburgh as part of a four-state trip on Monday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Mr. Trump, who was campaigning in five states on Monday, took a darker approach, assailing the \u201ccrooked media,\u201d attacking a \u201ccorrupt Washington establishment\u201d and mocking Mrs. Clinton over and over. \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged, rigged system,\u201d he declared in Raleigh, N.C. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the campaign wound down, both candidates dispensed with ritual. Mrs. Clinton, who relishes upbraiding her opponent, abandoned her usual assault on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and temperament. And Mr. Trump, who normally seeks to convey confidence at all times, sounded uncharacteristically vulnerable . \u201cThey say we\u2019ll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose,\u201d he said during a rally in Sarasota, Fla. \u201cI said: \u2018No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want any credit if we lose.\u2019\u201d Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there were signs that Americans were seizing the opportunity to express themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high , and in interviews, many voters said they were eager to bring an end to this unusual, exhausting and still suspenseful election. Photo Donald J. Trump arrived for a rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Monday. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m totally ready for this election to be over,\u201d said Mary Hoch, 54, who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Sarasota with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on her head and a \u201cDeplorable Lives Matter\u201d pin on her shirt. Ms. Hoch predicted a Trump victory. \u201cI think there are a lot of silent Trump voters,\u201d she said. Daniel Saunders, 58, who attended a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Charlotte, N.C., was just as exasperated by the race. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by it,\u201d he said. But Mr. Saunders said he was convinced that Mrs. Clinton would eke out a win. \u201cI think it will be close, but I think she will pull it out,\u201d he said. Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton sent their running mates, families and allies across the country to maximize their reach in crucial swing states. Mr. Trump relied on his three oldest children \u2014 Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u2014 along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Mrs. Clinton deployed President Obama and former President Bill Clinton, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the first lady, Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular political figure in the country. ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Glenn Beck is suffering an existential\u00a0crisis\u00a0\u2014 politically speaking at least. The most recent crisis \u2014 Beck has a long history of heavy on-air soul searching\u00a0\u2014\u00a0began to simmer with the rise of Donald Trump, but it reached full boil when he heard first lady Michelle Obama's speech in the wake of Trump's lewd remarks on a decade old Access Hollywood recording. \"It doesn\u2019t matter what party you belong to \u2014 Democrat, Republican, Independent\u2014 no woman deserves to be treated this way,\" Obama said. And the words hit Beck like a ton of bricks. He called it \"the most effective political speech I have heard since\u00a0Ronald Reagan.\" Glenn Beck praises Michelle Obama's speech slamming Trump \"Those words hit me where I live,\" Beck told The New Yorker in an interview. \"If you\u2019re a decent human being, those words were dead on.\" Beck went even further in\u00a0 the interview, saying President Obama \"made me a better man.\" This is the man who called Obama a Marxist. a racist with a \"deep-seated hatred for white people\" and who once asked a guest if Obama might be the Antichrist. \"I did a lot of freaking out about Barack Obama,\" Beck conceded to The New Yorker. He said he regrets calling the president a racist and he said he considers himself a Black Lives Matter supporter. \u201cThere are things unique to the African-American experience that I cannot relate to,\u201d Beck told The New Yorker. \u201cI had to listen to them.\" Beck has taken a lot of heat from his listeners for his opposition to Trump \u2014 whom he called \"dangerously unhinged\" \u2014\u00a0 and said he had received death threats. \"These people scare the hell out of me,\" he said of Trump's \"alt-right\" supporters. It's been a long, strange road for Beck, who is searching for a new path. \"So much of what I used to believe was either always a sham or has been made into a sham,\" Beck told The New Yorker. \"There\u2019s nothing deep.\" ",

    "text": "By Juliet Eilperin and Greg Jaffe November 7 at 6:00 AM Follow @eilperin Follow @GregJaffe In the waning days of a bitter, exhausting, enervating election season, President Obama has often seemed to be the only person in America who is still having fun. On each of his stops for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he has been greeted by screaming crowds and a palpable nostalgia embodied by the same largely improvised exchange. \u201cI love you,\u201d a voice from the crowd inevitably calls. \u201cLove you, too,\u201d Obama always replies. The exchange captures one of the striking paradoxes of this election season: At a moment defined by anger at Washington, voter cynicism and two historically unpopular presidential candidates, Obama\u2019s approval rating is the highest it has been since his first days in office. It now stands at 56\u00a0percent, according to a Gallup tracking poll released Sunday. How Obama tackled America\u2019s most divisive issues and what that means for the country\u2019s future. View Graphic How Obama tackled America\u2019s most divisive issues and what that means for the country\u2019s future. For the first time in decades \u2014 dating back to Ronald Reagan \u2014 a lame-duck incumbent is in high demand on the campaign trail. The good feelings, meanwhile, extend beyond the president himself. First lady Michelle Obama has been perhaps Clinton\u2019s most effective surrogate, campaigning alongside her in North Carolina last month. In crucial swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, Vice President Biden\u2019s popularity surpasses even that of the president at his eight-year peak. Nearly two-thirds of voters in Pennsylvania, for example, have a favorable view of the vice president and the first lady, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics poll. Some key factors have worked to the president\u2019s advantage. Respectable job growth and declining unemployment have helped the public mood, and for the most part, this White House has not been hobbled by any significant scandals in the second term. But the biggest reason for the late-term surge in presidential popularity may be the election itself. \u201cI know a lot of you are cynical about politics,\u201d Obama told a crowd in Miami last week. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about this election that gives you reason to be.\u201d [ Obama veers off script, turns up the passion at Clinton rally in Florida ] Presidential elections often are, at least in part, a referendum on the incumbent. But for months, Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump have been blasting away at each other in what amounts to a contest about character between two highly polarizing figures. Even a recent surge in insurance premiums associated with the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy accomplishment, has left the president largely unscathed, and broader Republican attacks on him have not been particularly effective. \u201cWe should have been able to say, \u2018We\u2019re ready for a change,\u2019 \u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said. \u201cThat has not been done successfully by the Trump campaign.\u201d At a rally for Hillary Clinton in Miami on Nov. 2, President Obama said Sen. Marco Rubio's vote for Donald Trump shows that the Florida Republican \"will say anything or be anything\" to \"get elected or cling to power.\" Obama told voters to elect Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) instead. (The Washington Post) Typically, Obama is Trump\u2019s third or fourth target, behind Clinton, the GOP establishment and the news media. Last week, as Trump\u2019s plane was taxiing for takeoff in Miami, he spotted Air Force One on the tarmac. \u201cHe\u2019s down here campaigning for Crooked Hillary,\u201d Trump said at a rally later that afternoon. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he back in the White House bringing our jobs back? And helping our veterans? Why? Why isn\u2019t he back working?\u201d Trump, however, has been either unwilling or unable to go after Obama for his handling of foreign affairs, the area where support for the president\u2019s policies is weakest. Since 2012, nearly 400,000 Syrians have died in that country\u2019s civil war, while nearly 5\u00a0million have fled as refugees. Amid that worsening humanitarian catastrophe, the toughest critiques of Obama\u2019s approach have come from Clinton, who has questioned the president\u2019s unwillingness to arm Syrian rebels early in the conflict or establish no-fly zones to protect American allies from Russian and Syrian bombs. Trump, channeling the electorate\u2019s fatalism regarding the Middle East, has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy and suggested outsourcing the crisis to the Russian and Syrian regime forces. \u201cThings are not going well in Syria or Iraq,\u201d said Michael Singh, a former top foreign policy official in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. \u201cBut there is no heated partisan debate on how to handle it.\u201d As the rhetoric has grown louder and meaner, Obama also has benefited from a White House message machine built, over the past eight years, for the digital age. Both the president and the first lady have been in heavy rotation on the TV talk-show circuit. Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d appearance with \u201cLate Late Show\u201d host James Corden has garnered more than 46 million views since it first aired in July \u2014 an audience that dwarfs any for campaign advertising in the current election cycle. [ Here\u2019s why Joe Biden chose Obama to deliver his son\u2019s eulogy ] The president, meanwhile, has gone from being a relative newcomer to national politics when he won in 2008 to a more practiced and confident politician. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m fearless,\u201d Obama said in a podcast interview last year. Jennifer Psaki, the White House communications director and a longtime Obama aide, recently made a similar point in an interview: \u201cWhat people are seeing is that he feels liberated, and he\u2019s able to be the wonky, optimistic, slightly nerdy president that people elected.\u201d In the final months of his presidency, Obama has played on that public nostalgia, returning repeatedly to the broader themes of the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that made him a political star and his 2008 inaugural address. \u201cI\u2019m asking you the same thing I asked of you eight years ago,\u201d he said in Miami. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to believe \u2014 not in my ability to change things or one person\u2019s ability change things . . . I\u2019m asking you to believe in your ability to change things.\u201d Obama\u2019s campaign audiences are often full of young, college-age voters, many of whom were in elementary school when he was elected. The message, however, is the same Obama message. \u201cYou can draw a straight line between that speech in 2004 and the speeches\u201d he is giving on the campaign trail, said David Simas, White House political director. The question is whether that loyalty and good feeling will transfer to Clinton. Obama spent the hours leading up to Election Day trying to rally the vote in swing states where support for Clinton, particularly among young people and African Americans, looks shaky. Several of the president\u2019s former campaign aides have started sharing their own video, titled \u201c Do It for Obama ,\u201d in which they recount war stories and explain why Clinton deserves support. Liz Jaff, who worked on both of Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and helped create the video, has spent more than a week turning out voters in Ohio. As she walked around a parking lot in Columbus near Clinton\u2019s campaign office, she worried that a Trump victory would essentially be a repudiation of Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cIf we elected the first African American president and it just opened up more racism in our society, it\u2019s just really hard,\u201d she said, her voice cracking as she started to cry. \u201cWe did everything for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be the same for her.\u201d Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Here's one clue Donald Trump Gerry Broome / Associated Press Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Monday. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Monday. (Gerry Broome / Associated Press) Matt Pearce Contact Reporter Over the weekend, the New York Times broke some news about Donald Trump 's\u00a0tweets. \"Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away\u00a0the Twitter account\u00a0that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals,\" the newspaper reported in its story about the final days of the Republican candidate's campaign for president. The paper also described Trump dictating a tweet to his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, who then did light editing on his remarks,\u00a0and noted that Trump \"seemed struck by an unfamiliar trend: News stories emphasized the intended message of his campaign rallies, not his improvised rants or stray tweets.\" OK. Except then Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, totally denied it. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true,\u201d Conway said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show when grilled about the Times' report. Whom to believe? Let's review the evidence. In August, we reported on a theory that Trump's account had multiple authors. The theory goes that tweets sent from an iPhone , which tend to be more measured and feature pictures of crowds, come from Trump's staff. Tweets sent from an Android device, which tend to be more confrontational, are thought to come from Trump. So where have Trump's tweets been coming from\u00a0lately? An iPhone. (You can look\u00a0here for yourself: Trump's\u00a0 Android\u00a0tweets versus\u00a0 iPhone tweets .) Since Thursday, @realDonaldTrump has sent only one tweet from an Android account, on Saturday morning: Over the same time period, @realDonaldTrump has sent about three dozen tweets from an iPhone, often with photos of his rallies. Obviously, this is not definitive evidence that Trump's staff has stripped away his Twitter access. But it's safe to say that his account has been much less newsworthy lately.
